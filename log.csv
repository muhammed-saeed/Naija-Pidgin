1,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.",,,,,,,
2,"And God, looking on the light, saw that it was good: and God made a division between the light and the dark,",,,,,,,
3,"Naming the light, Day, and the dark, Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.",,,,,,,
4,"And God said, Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters, parting the waters from the waters.",,,,,,,
5,And God made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it: and it was so.,,,,,,,
6,"And God gave the arch the name of Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.",,,,,,,
7,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven come together in one place, and let the dry land be seen: and it was so.",,,,,,,
8,And God gave the dry land the name of Earth; and the waters together in their place were named Seas: and God saw that it was good.,,,,,,,
9,"And God said, Let grass come up on the earth, and plants producing seed, and fruit-trees giving fruit, in which is their seed, after their sort: and it was so.",,,,,,,

13,And let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.,,,,,,,
14,"And God made the two great lights: the greater light to be the ruler of the day, and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night: and he made the stars.",,,,,,,

27,"And God said, See, I have given you every plant producing seed, on the face of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit producing seed: they will be for your food:",,,,,,,
28,And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth I have given every green plant for food: and it was so.,,,,,,,
29,"And God saw everything which he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.And the heaven and the earth and all things in them were complete.",,,,,,,
30,And on the seventh day God came to the end of all his work; and on the seventh day he took his rest from all the work which he had done.,,,,,,,
31,And God gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy: because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done.,,,,,,,
32,These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made.,,,,,,,
33,"In the day when the Lord God made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth, and no grass had come up: for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land.",,,,,,,
34,"But a mist went up from the earth, watering all the face of the land.",,,,,,,
35,"And the Lord God made man from the dust of the earth, breathing into him the breath of life: and man became a living soul.",,,,,,,
36,"And the Lord God made a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had made.",,,,,,,
37,"And out of the earth the Lord made every tree to come, delighting the eye and good for food; and in the middle of the garden, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.",,,,,,,
38,And a river went out of Eden giving water to the garden; and from there it was parted and became four streams.,,,,,,,
39,"The name of the first is Pishon, which goes round about all the land of Havilah where there is gold.",,,,,,,
40,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.,,,,,,,
41,And the name of the second river is Gihon: this river goes round all the land of Cush.,,,,,,,
42,"And the name of the third river is Tigris, which goes to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.",,,,,,,
43,And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to do work in it and take care of it.,,,,,,,
44,"And the Lord God gave the man orders, saying, You may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden:",,,,,,,
45,"But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take; for on the day when you take of it, death will certainly come to you.",,,,,,,
46,"And the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be by himself: I will make one like himself as a help to him",,,,,,,
47,"And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and took them to the man to see what names he would give them: and whatever name he gave to any living thing, that was its name.",,,,,,,
48,And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help.,,,,,,,
49,"And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man, and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping, joining up the flesh again in its place:",,,,,,,
50,"And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman, and took her to the man.",,,,,,,
51,"And the man said, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man.",,,,,,,
52,For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.,,,,,,,
53,"And the man and his wife were without clothing, and they had no sense of shame.Now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in",the garden?,,,,,,
54,"And the woman said, We may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden:",,,,,,,
55,"But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, If you take of it or put your hands on it, death will come to you.",,,,,,,
56,"And the snake said, Death will not certainly come to you:",,,,,,,
57,"For God sees that on the day when you take of its fruit, your eyes will be open, and you will be as gods, having knowledge of good and evil.",,,,,,,
58,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and a delight to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and gave it to her husband.",,,,,,,
59,And their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together.,,,,,,,
60,"And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind: and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden, away from the eyes of the Lord God.",,,,,,,
61,"And the voice of the Lord God came to the man, saying, Where are you?",,,,,,,
62,"And he said, Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear, because I was without clothing: and I kept myself from your eyes.",,,,,,,
63,"And he said, Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing? Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take?",,,,,,,
64,"And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it.",,,,,,,
65,"And the Lord God said to the woman, What have you done? And the woman said, I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it.",,,,,,,
66,"And the Lord God said to the snake, Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field; you will go flat on the earth, and dust will be your food all the days of your life:",,,,,,,
67,And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded.,,,,,,,
68,"To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master.",,,,,,,
69,"And to Adam he said, Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take, the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life.",,,,,,,
70,"Thorns and waste plants will come up, and the plants of the field will be your food;",,,,,,,
71,With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken: for dust you are and to the dust you will go back.,,,,,,,
72,And the man gave his wife the name of Eve because she was the mother of all who have life.,,,,,,,
73,And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing.,,,,,,,
74,"And the Lord God said, Now the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life, he will go on living for ever.",,,,,,,
75,So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken.,,,,,,,
76,"So he sent the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life.And the man had connection with Eve his wife, and she became with child and gave birth to Cain, and","said, I have",got,a,man,from,the,Lord.
77,"Then again she became with child and gave birth to Abel, his brother. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a farmer.",,,,,,,
78,"And after a time, Cain gave to the Lord an offering of the fruits of the earth.",,,,,,,
79,And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord was pleased with Abel's offering;,,,,,,,
80,But in Cain and his offering he had no pleasure. And Cain was angry and his face became sad.,,,,,,,
81,"And the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry? and why is your face sad?",,,,,,,
82,"If you do well, will you not have honour? and if you do wrong, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to have you, but do not let it be your master.",,,,,,,
83,"And Cain said to his brother, Let us go into the field: and when they were in the field, Cain made an attack on his brother Abel and put him to death.",,,,,,,
84,"And the Lord said to Cain, Where is your brother Abel? And he said, I have no idea: am I my brother's keeper?",,,,,,,
85,"And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the earth.",,,,,,,
86,"And now you are cursed from the earth, whose mouth is open to take your brother's blood from your hand;",,,,,,,
87,No longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work; you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth.,,,,,,,
88,"And Cain said, My punishment is greater than my strength.",,,,,,,
89,"You have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face; I will be a wanderer in flight over the earth, and whoever sees me will put me to death.",,,,,,,
90,"And the Lord said, Truly, if Cain is put to death, seven lives will be taken for his. And the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one might put him to death.",,,,,,,
91,"And Cain went away from before the face of the Lord, and made his living-place in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.",,,,,,,
92,"And Cain had connection with his wife and she became with child and gave birth to Enoch: and he made a town, and gave the town the name of Enoch after his son.",,,,,,,
93,And Enoch had a son Irad: and Irad became the father of Mehujael: and Mehujael became the father of Methushael: and Methushael became the father of Lamech.,,,,,,,
94,"And Lamech had two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.",,,,,,,
95,And Adah gave birth to Jabal: he was the father of such as are living in tents and keep cattle.,,,,,,,
96,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all players on instruments of music.,,,,,,,
97,"And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, who is the father of every maker of cutting instruments of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.",,,,,,,
98,"And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, give ear to my voice; you wives of Lamech, give attention to my words, for I would put a man to death for a wound, and a young man for a blow;",,,,,,,
99,"If seven lives are to be taken as punishment for Cain's death, seventy-seven will be taken for Lamech's.",,,,,,,
100,"And Adam had connection with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name of Seth: for she said, God has given me another seed in place of Abel, whom Cain put to death.",,,,,,,
101,"And Seth had a son, and he gave him the name of Enosh: at this time men first made use of the name of the Lord in worship.This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God made man, he made him in the image of God;",,,,,,,
102,"Male and female he made them, naming them Man, and giving them his blessing on the day when they were made.",,,,,,,
103,"Adam had been living for a hundred and thirty years when he had a son like himself, after his image, and gave him the name of Seth:",,,,,,,

133,The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them.,,,,,,,
134,"And the Lord said, My spirit will not be in man for ever, for he is only flesh; so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years.",,,,,,,
135,"There were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days; and after that, when the sons of God had connection with the daughters of men, they gave birth to children: these were the great men of old days, the men of great name.",,,,,,,

145,"Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out.",,,,,,,

147,"You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors.",,,,,,,
148,"For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end.",,,,,,,
149,"But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.",,,,,,,

158,And Noah was six hundred years old when the waters came flowing over all the earth.,,,,,,,
159,"And Noah, with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark because of the flowing of the waters.",,,,,,,

163,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through, and the windows of heaven were open;",,,,,,,
164,And rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights.,,,,,,,
165,"On the same day Noah, with Shem, Ham, and Japheth, his sons, and his wife and his sons' wives, went into the ark;",,,,,,,
166,"And with them, every sort of beast and cattle, and every sort of thing which goes on the earth, and every sort of bird.",,,,,,,
167,"They went with Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.",,,,,,,
168,"Male and female of all flesh went in, as God had said, and the ark was shut by the Lord.",,,,,,,
169,And for forty days the waters were over all the earth; and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth.,,,,,,,
170,"And the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth, and the ark was resting on the face of the waters.",,,,,,,
171,And the waters overcame everything on the earth; and all the mountains under heaven were covered.,,,,,,,
172,"The waters went fifteen cubits higher, till all the mountains were covered.",,,,,,,
173,"And destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth, birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth, and every man.",,,,,,,
174,"Everything on the dry land, in which was the breath of life, came to its end.",,,,,,,
175,"Every living thing on the face of all the earth, man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth, and birds of the air, came to destruction: only Noah and those who were with him in the ark, were kept from death.",,,,,,,
176,"And the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days.And God kept Noah in mind, and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters went down.",,,,,,,
177,"And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut, and the rain from heaven was stopped.",,,,,,,
178,"And the waters went slowly back from the earth, and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower.",,,,,,,
179,And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.,,,,,,,
180,"And still the waters went on falling, till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen.",,,,,,,
181,"Then, after forty days, through the open window of the ark which he had made,",,,,,,,
182,"Noah sent out a raven, which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth.",,,,,,,
183,"And he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth;",,,,,,,
184,"But the dove saw no resting-place for her foot, and came back to the ark, for the waters were still over all the earth; and he put out his hand, and took her into the ark.",,,,,,,
185,"And after waiting another seven days, he sent the dove out again;",,,,,,,
186,"And the dove came back at evening, and in her mouth was an olive-leaf broken off: so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth.",,,,,,,
187,"And after seven days more, he sent the dove out again, but she did not come back to him.",,,,,,,
188,"And in the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry.",,,,,,,
189,And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry.,,,,,,,
190,"And God said to Noah,",,,,,,,
191,"Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives.",,,,,,,
192,"Take out with you every living thing which is with you, birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth, so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth.",,,,,,,
193,And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives;,,,,,,,
194,"And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth, went out of the ark.",,,,,,,
195,"And Noah made an altar to the Lord, and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar.",,,,,,,
196,"And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord, he said in his heart, I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man, for the thoughts of man's heart are evil from his earliest days; never again will I send destruction on all living things as I h",ve done.,,,,,,
197,"While the earth goes on, seed time and the getting in of the grain, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will not come to an end.And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full.",,,,,,,
198,"And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands.",,,,,,,
199,Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things.,,,,,,,
200,But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.,,,,,,,
201,"And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man.",,,,,,,
202,"Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image.",,,,,,,
203,"And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number.",,,,,,,
204,"And God said to Noah and to his sons,",,,,,,,
205,"Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you,",,,,,,,
206,"And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you.",,,,,,,
207,And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction.,,,,,,,
208,"And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations:",,,,,,,
209,I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.,,,,,,,
210,"And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud,",,,,,,,
211,And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh.,,,,,,,
212,"And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth.",,,,,,,
213,"And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth.",,,,,,,
214,"And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.",,,,,,,
215,These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled.,,,,,,,
216,"In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden.",,,,,,,
217,And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.,,,,,,,
218,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside.",,,,,,,
219,"And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed.",,,,,,,
220,"And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said,",,,,,,,
221,Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.,,,,,,,
222,"And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant.",,,,,,,
223,"May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.",,,,,,,
224,And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;,,,,,,,
225,"all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters",,,,,,,
226,The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.,,,,,,,
227,And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.,,,,,,,
228,"And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, the Kittim and the Dodanim.",,,,,,,
229,"From these came the nations of the sea-lands, with their different families and languages.",,,,,,,
230,And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.,,,,,,,
231,And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.,,,,,,,
232,"And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who was the first of the great men of the earth.",,,,,,,
233,"He was a very great bowman, so that there is a saying, Like Nimrod, a very great bowman.",,,,,,,
234,"And at the first, his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.",,,,,,,
235,"From that land he went out into Assyria, building Nineveh with its wide streets and Calah,",,,,,,,
236,"And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which is a very great town.",,,,,,,
237,And Mizraim was the father of the Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim;,,,,,,,
238,"And Pathrusim and Casluhim and Caphtorim, from whom came the Philistines.",,,,,,,
239,"And Canaan was the father of Zidon, who was his oldest son, and Heth,",,,,,,,
240,"And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite,",,,,,,,
241,"And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite,",,,,,,,
242,And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; after that the families of the Canaanites went far and wide in all directions;,,,,,,,
243,"Their country stretching from Zidon to Gaza, in the direction of Gerar; and to Lasha, in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim.",,,,,,,
244,"All these, with their different families, languages, lands, and nations, are the offspring of Ham.",,,,,,,
245,"And Shem, the older brother of Japheth, the father of the children of Eber, had other sons in addition.",,,,,,,
246,These are the sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.,,,,,,,
247,And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.,,,,,,,
248,And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.,,,,,,,
249,"And Eber had two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate; and his brother's name was Joktan.",,,,,,,
250,And Joktan was the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah,,,,,,,
251,And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah,,,,,,,
252,And Obal and Abimael and Sheba,,,,,,,
253,And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.,,,,,,,
254,"And their country was from Mesha, in the direction of Sephar, the mountain of the east.",,,,,,,
255,"These, with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations, are the offspring of Shem.",,,,,,,
256,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, in the order of their generations and their nations: from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters.And all the earth had one language and one tongue.",,,,,,,
257,"And it came about that in their wandering from the east, they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of Shinar, and there they made their living-place.",,,,,,,
258,"And they said one to another, Come, let us make bricks, burning them well. And they had bricks for stone, putting them together with sticky earth.",,,,,,,
259,"And they said, Come, let us make a town, and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven; and let us make a great name for ourselves, so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth.",,,,,,,
260,And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building.,,,,,,,
261,"And the Lord said, See, they are all one people and have all one language; and this is only the start of what they may do: and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs.",,,,,,,
262,"Come, let us go down and take away the sense of their language, so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another.",,,,,,,
263,So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town.,,,,,,,
264,"So it was named Babel, because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth.",,,,,,,
265,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad, two years after the great flow of waters;",,,,,,,
266,"And after the birth of Arpachshad, Shem went on living for five hundred years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
267,And Arpachshad was thirty-five years old when he became the father of Shelah:,,,,,,,
268,"And after the birth of Shelah, Arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
269,And Shelah was thirty years old when he became the father of Eber:,,,,,,,
270,"And after the birth of Eber, Shelah went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
271,And Eber was thirty- four years old when he became the father of Peleg:,,,,,,,
272,"And after the birth of Peleg, Eber went on living for four hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
273,And Peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of Reu:,,,,,,,
274,"And after the birth of Reu, Peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
275,And Reu was thirty-two years old when he became the father of Serug:,,,,,,,
276,"And after the birth of Serug, Reu went on living for two hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
277,And Serug was thirty years old when he became the father of Nahor:,,,,,,,
278,"And after the birth of Nahor, Serug went on living for two hundred years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
279,And Nahor was twenty-nine years old when he became the father of Terah:,,,,,,,
280,"And after the birth of Terah, Nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years, and had sons and daughters:",,,,,,,
281,"And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.",,,,,,,
282,"These are the generations of Terah: Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.",,,,,,,
283,"And death came to Haran when he was with his father Terah in the land of his birth, Ur of the Chaldees.",,,,,,,
284,"And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.",,,,,,,
285,And Sarai had no child.,,,,,,,
286,"And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram and they went out from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and were there for some time.",,,,,,,
287,"And all the years of Terah's life were two hundred and five: and Terah came to his end in Haran.Now the Lord said to Abram, Go out from your country and from your family and from your father's house, into the land to which I will be your guide:",,,,,,,
288,"And I will make of you a great nation, blessing you and making your name great; and you will be a blessing:",,,,,,,
289,"To them who are good to you will I give blessing, and on him who does you wrong will I put my curse: and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth.",,,,,,,
290,"So Abram went as the Lord had said to him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy- five years old when he went away from Haran.",,,,,,,
291,"And Abram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their goods and the servants which they had got in Haran, and they went out to go to the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
292,"And Abram went through the land till he came to Shechem, to the holy tree of Moreh. At that time, the Canaanites were still living in the land.",,,,,,,
293,"And the Lord came to Abram, and said, I will give all this land to your seed; then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him.",,,,,,,
294,"And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, he put up his tent, having Beth-el on the west and Ai on the east: and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord.",,,,,,,
295,"And he went on, journeying still to the South.",,,,,,,
296,"And because there was little food to be had in that land, he went down into Egypt.",,,,,,,
297,"Now when he came near to Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, Truly, you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye;",,,,,,,
298,"And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you, they will say, This is his wife: and they will put me to death and keep you.",,,,,,,
299,"Say, then, that you are my sister, and so it will be well with me because of you, and my life will be kept safe on your account.",,,,,,,
300,"And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt, the men of Egypt, looking on the woman, saw that she was fair.",,,,,,,
301,"And Pharaoh's great men, having seen her, said words in praise of her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's house.",,,,,,,
302,"And because of her, he was good to Abram, and he had sheep and oxen and asses, and men-servants and women-servants, and camels.",,,,,,,
303,"And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaoh's house because of Sarai, Abram's wife.",,,,,,,
304,"Then Pharaoh sent for Abram, and said, What have you done to me? why did you not say that she was your wife?",,,,,,,
305,"Why did you say that she was your sister? so that I took her for my wife: now, take your wife and go on your way.",,,,,,,
306,"And Pharaoh gave orders to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and all he had.And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had, and Lot with him, and they came in to the South.",,,,,,,
307,Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold.,,,,,,,
308,"And travelling on from the South, he came to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been before, between Beth-el and Ai;",,,,,,,
309,"To the place where he had made his first altar, and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord.",,,,,,,
310,"And Lot, who went with him, had flocks and herds and tents;",,,,,,,
311,So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together.,,,,,,,
312,And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram's cattle and the keepers of Lot's cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land.,,,,,,,
313,"Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no argument between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen, for we are brothers.",,,,,,,
314,"Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left.",,,,,,,
315,"And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar.",,,,,,,
316,"So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another.",,,,,,,
317,"Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom.",,,,,,,
318,"Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord.",,,,,,,
319,"And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west:",,,,,,,
320,For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever.,,,,,,,
321,"And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered.",,,,,,,
322,"Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you.",,,,,,,
323,"And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord.Now in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, kin","of Goiim,",,,,,,
324,"They made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar).",,,,,,,
325,All these came together in the valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea).,,,,,,,
326,"For twelve years they were under the rule of Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they put off his control.",,,,,,,
327,"And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side, overcame the Rephaim in Ashteroth- karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,",,,,,,,
328,"And the Horites in their mountain Seir, driving them as far as El-paran, which is near the waste land.",,,,,,,
329,"Then they came back to En-mishpat (which is Kadesh), making waste all the country of the Amalekites and of the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar.",,,,,,,
330,"And the king of Sodom with the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is Zoar), went out, and put their forces in position in the valley of Siddim,",,,,,,,
331,"Against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar: four kings against the five.",,,,,,,
332,"Now the valley of Siddim was full of holes of sticky earth; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there, but the rest got away to the mountain.",,,,,,,
333,And the four kings took all the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way.,,,,,,,
334,"And in addition they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, and all his goods.",,,,,,,
335,"And one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the holy tree of Mamre, the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were friends of Abram.",,,,,,,
336,"And Abram, hearing that his brother's son had been made a prisoner, took a band of his trained men, three hundred and eighteen of them, sons of his house, and went after them as far as Dan.",,,,,,,
337,"And separating his forces by night, he overcame them, putting them to flight and going after them as far as Hobah, which is on the north side of Damascus.",,,,,,,
338,"And he got back all the goods, and Lot, his brother's son, with his goods and the women and the people.",,,,,,,
339,"And when he was coming back after putting to flight Chedorlaomer and the other kings, he had a meeting with the king of Sodom in the valley of Shaveh, that is, the King's Valley.",,,,,,,
340,"And Melchizedek, king of Salem, the priest of the Most High God, took bread and wine,",,,,,,,
341,"And blessing him, said, May the blessing of the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth, be on Abram:",,,,,,,
342,"And let the Most High God be praised, who has given into your hands those who were against you. Then Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken.",,,,,,,
343,"And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself.",,,,,,,
344,"But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have taken an oath to the Lord, the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth,",,,,,,,
345,"That I will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours; so that you may not say, I have given wealth to Abram:",,,,,,,
346,"Give me nothing but the food which the fighting-men who went with me have had; but let Aner and Eshcol and Mamre have their part of the goods.After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Have no fear, Abram: I will keep you","safe, and gr",at,i,l b,you,re,ard.
347,"And Abram said, What will you give me? for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me.",,,,,,,
348,"And Abram said, You have given me no child, and a servant in my house will get the heritage.",,,,,,,
349,"Then said the Lord, This man will not get the heritage, but a son of your body will have your property after you.",,,,,,,
350,"And he took him out into the open air, and said to him, Let your eyes be lifted to heaven, and see if the stars may be numbered; even so will your seed be.",,,,,,,
351,"And he had faith in the Lord, and it was put to his account as righteousness.",,,,,,,
352,"And he said to him, I am the Lord, who took you from Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land for your heritage.",,,,,,,
353,"And he said, O Lord God, how may I be certain that it will be mine?",,,,,,,
354,"And he said, Take a young cow of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a sheep of three years old, and a dove and a young pigeon.",,,,,,,
355,"All these he took, cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other, but not cutting the birds in two.",,,,,,,
356,"And evil birds came down on the bodies, but Abram sent them away.",,,,,,,
357,"Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep came on Abram, and a dark cloud of fear.",,,,,,,
358,"And he said to Abram, Truly, your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs, as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years;",,,,,,,
359,"But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are, and they will come out from among them with great wealth.",,,,,,,
360,"As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place.",,,,,,,
361,And in the fourth generation they will come back here; for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full.,,,,,,,
362,"Then when the sun went down and it was dark, he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies.",,,,,,,
363,"In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram, and said, To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:",,,,,,,
364,"The Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,",,,,,,,
365,"And the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,",,,,,,,
366,"And the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had given him no children; and she had a servant, a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar.",,,,,,,
367,"And Sarai said to Abram, See, the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant, for I may get a family through her. And Abram did as Sarai said.",,,,,,,
368,"So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to Abram for his wife.",,,,,,,
369,"And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master's wife.",,,,,,,
370,"And Sarai said to Abram, May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me.",,,,,,,
371,"And Abram said, The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you. And Sarai was cruel to her, so that she went running away from her.",,,,,,,
372,"And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land, by the fountain on the way to Shur.",,,,,,,
373,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master's wife.",,,,,,,
374,"And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority.",,,,,,,
375,"And the angel of the Lord said, Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered.",,,,,,,
376,"And the angel of the Lord said, See, you are with child and will give birth to a son, to whom you will give the name Ishmael, because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow.",,,,,,,
377,"And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him, and he will keep his place against all his brothers.",,,,,,,
378,"And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name, You are a God who is seen; for she said, Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living?",,,,,,,
379,"So that fountain was named, Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered.",,,,,,,
380,"And Hagar gave birth to a child, the son of Abram, to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael.",,,,,,,
381,"Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord came to him, and said, I am God, Ruler of all; go in my ways and be upright in all things,",,,,,,,
382,"And I will make an agreement between you and me, and your offspring will be greatly increased.",,,,,,,
383,"And Abram went down on his face on the earth, and the Lord God went on talking with him, and said,",,,,,,,
384,"As for me, my agreement is made with you, and you will be the father of nations without end.",,,,,,,
385,"No longer will your name be Abram, but Abraham, for I have made you the father of a number of nations.",,,,,,,
386,"I will make you very fertile, so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring.",,,,,,,
387,"And I will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations, an eternal agreement to be a God to you and to your seed after you.",,,,,,,
388,"And to you and to your seed after you, I will give the land in which you are living, all the land of Canaan for an eternal heritage; and I will be their God.",,,,,,,
389,"And God said to Abraham, On your side, you are to keep the agreement, you and your seed after you through all generations.",,,,,,,
390,"And this is the agreement which you are to keep with me, you and your seed after you: every male among you is to undergo circumcision.",,,,,,,
391,"In the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it, as a mark of the agreement between me and you.",,,,,,,
392,"Every male among you, from one generation to another, is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old, with every servant whose birth takes place in your house, or for whom you gave money to someone of another country, and not of your seed.",,,,,,,
393,"He who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price, all are to undergo circumcision; so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh, an agreement for all time.",,,,,,,
394,And any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people: my agreement has been broken by him.,,,,,,,
395,"And God said, As for Sarai, your wife, from now her name will be not Sarai, but Sarah.",,,,,,,
396,"And I will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her: truly my blessing will be on her, and she will be the mother of nations: kings of peoples will be her offspring.",,,,,,,
397,"Then Abraham went down on his face, and laughing, said in his heart, May a man a hundred years old have a child? will Sarah, at ninety years old, give birth?",,,,,,,
398,"And Abraham said to God, If only Ishmael's life might be your care!",,,,,,,
399,"And God said, Not so; but Sarah, your wife, will have a son, and you will give him the name Isaac, and I will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him.",,,,,,,
400,"As for Ishmael, I have given ear to your prayer: truly I have given him my blessing and I will make him fertile and give him great increase; he will be the father of twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.",,,,,,,
401,"But my agreement will be with Isaac, to whom Sarah will give birth a year from this time.",,,,,,,
402,"And having said these words, God went up from Abraham.",,,,,,,
403,"And Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all whose birth had taken place in his house, and all his servants whom he had made his for a price, every male of his house, and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as God",had said to,im.,,,,,
404,Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he underwent circumcision.,,,,,,,
405,"And Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision.",,,,,,,
406,"Abraham and Ishmael, his son, underwent circumcision on that very day.",,,,,,,
407,"And all the men of his house, those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands, underwent circumcision with him.Now the Lord came to him by the holy tree of Mamre, when he was seated in the doorwa",of his tent,in,h,mi,dle,f t,e day
408,"And lifting up his eyes, he saw three men before him; and seeing them, he went quickly to them from the door of the tent, and went down on his face to the earth;",,,,,,,
409,"And said, My Lord, if now I have grace in your eyes, do not go away from your servant:",,,,,,,
410,"Let me get water for washing your feet, and take your rest under the tree:",,,,,,,
411,"And let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength, and after that you may go on your way: for this is why you have come to your servant. And they said, Let it be so.",,,,,,,
412,"Then Abraham went quickly into the tent, and said to Sarah, Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes.",,,,,,,
413,"And running to the herd, he took a young ox, soft and fat, and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready;",,,,,,,
414,"And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them, waiting by them under the tree while they took food.",,,,,,,
415,"And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent.",,,,,,,
416,"And he said, I will certainly come back to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife will have a son. And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door.",,,,,,,
417,"Now Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was past the time for giving birth.",,,,,,,
418,"And Sarah, laughing to herself, said, Now that I am used up am I still to have pleasure, my husband himself being old?",,,,,,,
419,"And the Lord said, Why was Sarah laughing and saying, Is it possible for me, being old, to give birth to a child?",,,,,,,
420,"Is there any wonder which the Lord is not able to do? At the time I said, in the spring, I will come back to you, and Sarah will have a child.",,,,,,,
421,"Then Sarah said, I was not laughing; for she was full of fear. And he said, No, but you were laughing.",,,,,,,
422,And the men went on from there in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went with them on their way.,,,,,,,
423,"And the Lord said, Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do;",,,,,,,
424,"Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation, and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing?",,,,,,,
425,"For I have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do what is good and right: so that the Lord may do to Abraham as he has said.",,,,,,,
426,"And the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and their sin is very evil,",,,,,,,
427,"I will go down now, and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me; and if they are not, I will see.",,,,,,,
428,"And the men, turning from that place, went on to Sodom: but Abraham was still waiting before the Lord.",,,,,,,
429,"And Abraham came near, and said, Will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners?",,,,,,,
430,"If by chance there are fifty upright men in the town, will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men?",,,,,,,
431,"Let such a thing be far from you, to put the upright to death with the sinner: will not the judge of all the earth do right?",,,,,,,
432,"And the Lord said, If there are fifty upright men in the town, I will have mercy on it because of them.",,,,,,,
433,"And Abraham answering said, Truly, I who am only dust, have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord:",,,,,,,
434,"If by chance there are five less than fifty upright men, will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five? And he said, I will not give it to destruction if there are forty-five.",,,,,,,
435,"And again he said to him, By chance there may be forty there. And he said, I will not do it if there are forty.",,,,,,,
436,"And he said, Let not the Lord be angry with me if I say, What if there are thirty there? And he said, I will not do it if there are thirty.",,,,,,,
437,"And he said, See now, I have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord: what if there are twenty there? And he said, I will have mercy because of the twenty.",,,,,,,
438,"And he said, O let not the Lord be angry and I will say only one word more: by chance there may be ten there. And he said, I will have mercy because of the ten.",,,,,,,
439,"And the Lord went on his way when his talk with Abraham was ended, and Abraham went back to his place.And at nightfall the two angels came to Sodom; and Lot was seated at the way into the town: and when he saw them he got up and came before them, falling",down on his,ace,t,th,ear,h.,
440,"And he said, My masters, come now into your servant's house and take your rest there for the night, and let your feet be washed; and early in the morning you may go on your way. And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street.",,,,,,,
441,"But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took.",,,,,,,
442,"But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town;",,,,,,,
443,"And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night? Send them out to us, so that we may take our pleasure with them.",,,,,,,
444,"And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him.",,,,,,,
445,"And he said, My brothers, do not this evil.",,,,,,,
446,"See now, I have two unmarried daughters; I will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you: only do nothing to these men, for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof.",,,,,,,
447,"And they said, Give way there. This one man, they said, came here from a strange country, and will he now be our judge? now we will do worse to you than to them; and pushing violently against Lot, they came near to get the door broken in.",,,,,,,
448,"But the men put out their hands and took Lot into the house to them, shutting the door again.",,,,,,,
449,"But the men who were outside the door they made blind, all of them, small and great, so that they were tired out with looking for the door.",,,,,,,
450,"Then the men said to Lot, Are there any others of your family here? sons-in-law or sons or daughters, take them all out of this place;",,,,,,,
451,"For we are about to send destruction on this place, because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the Lord; and the Lord has sent us to put an end to the town.",,,,,,,
452,"And Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, Come, let us go out of this place, for the Lord is about to send destruction on the town. But his sons-in-law did not take him seriously.",,,,,,,
453,"And when morning came, the angels did all in their power to make Lot go, saying, Get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here, and go, for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town.",,,,,,,
454,"But while he was waiting, the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, for the Lord had mercy on them, and put them outside the town.",,,,,,,
455,"And when they had put them out, he said, Go for your life, without looking back or waiting in the lowland; go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction.",,,,,,,
456,"And Lot said to them, Not so, O my Lord;",,,,,,,
457,"See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death;",,,,,,,
458,"This town, now, is near, and it is a little one: O, let me go there (is it not a little one?) so that my life may be safe.",,,,,,,
459,"And he said, See, I have given you your request in this one thing more: I will not send destruction on this town.",,,,,,,
460,"Go there quickly, for I am not able to do anything till you have come there. For this reason, the town was named Zoar.",,,,,,,
461,The sun was up when Lot came to Zoar.,,,,,,,
462,Then the Lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah.,,,,,,,
463,"And he sent destruction on those towns, with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land.",,,,,,,
464,"But Lot's wife, looking back, became a pillar of salt.",,,,,,,
465,And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the Lord:,,,,,,,
466,"And looking in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the lowland, he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven.",,,,,,,
467,"So it came about that when God sent destruction on the towns of the lowland, he kept his word to Abraham, and sent Lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living.",,,,,,,
468,"Then Lot went up out of Zoar to the mountain, and was living there with his two daughters, for fear kept him from living in Zoar: and he and his daughters made their living-place in a hole in the rock.",,,,,,,
469,"And the older daughter said to her sister, Our father is old, and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way:",,,,,,,
470,"Come, let us give our father much wine, and we will go into his bed, so that we may have offspring by our father,",,,,,,,
471,And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.,,,,,,,
472,"And on the day after, the older daughter said to the younger, Last night I was with my father; let us make him take much wine this night again, and do you go to him, so that we may have offspring by our father.",,,,,,,
473,And that night again they made their father take much wine; and the younger daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.,,,,,,,
474,And so the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.,,,,,,,
475,"And the older daughter had a son, and she gave him the name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites to this day.",,,,,,,
476,"And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.And Abraham went on his way from there to the land of the South, and was living between Kadesh and Shur, in Gerar.",,,,,,,
477,"And Abraham said of Sarah, his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.",,,,,,,
478,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night, and said to him, Truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife.",,,,,,,
479,"Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will you put to death an upright nation?",,,,,,,
480,"Did he not say to me himself, She is my sister? and she herself said, He is my brother: with an upright heart and clean hands have I done this.",,,,,,,
481,"And God said to him in the dream, I see that you have done this with an upright heart, and I have kept you from sinning against me: for this reason I did not let you come near her.",,,,,,,
482,"So now, give the man back his wife, for he is a prophet, and let him say a prayer for you, so your life may be safe: but if you do not give her back, be certain that death will come to you and all your house.",,,,,,,
483,"So Abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things, and they were full of fear.",,,,,,,
484,"Then Abimelech sent for Abraham, and said, What have you done to us? what wrong have I done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin? You have done to me things which are not to be done.",,,,,,,
485,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, Why did you do this thing?",,,,,,,
486,"And Abraham said, Because it seemed to me that there was no fear of God in this place, and that they might put me to death because of my wife.",,,,,,,
487,"And, in fact, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:",,,,,,,
488,"And when God sent me wandering from my father's house, I said to her, Let this be the sign of your love for me; wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother.",,,,,,,
489,"Then Abimelech gave to Abraham sheep and oxen and men- servants and women-servants, and gave him back his wife Sarah.",,,,,,,
490,"And Abimelech said, See, all my land is before you; take whatever place seems good to you.",,,,,,,
491,"And he said to Sarah, See, I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right; now your honour is clear in the eyes of all.",,,,,,,
492,"Then Abraham made prayer to God, and God made Abimelech well again, and his wife and his women-servants, so that they had children.",,,,,,,
493,"For the Lord had kept all the women of the house of Abimelech from having children, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.And the Lord came to Sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken.",,,,,,,
494,"And Sarah became with child, and gave Abraham a son when he was old, at the time named by God.",,,,,,,
495,"And Abraham gave to his son, to whom Sarah had given birth, the name Isaac.",,,,,,,
496,"And when his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham made him undergo circumcision, as God had said to him.",,,,,,,
497,Now Abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of Isaac took place.,,,,,,,
498,"And Sarah said, God has given me cause for laughing, and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me.",,,,,,,
499,"And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would have a child at her breast? for see, I have given him a son now when he is old.",,,,,,,
500,"And when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast, Abraham made a great feast.",,,,,,,
501,And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac.,,,,,,,
502,"So she said to Abraham, Send away that woman and her son: for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son Isaac.",,,,,,,
503,And this was a great grief to Abraham because of his son.,,,,,,,
504,"But God said, Let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and Hagar his mother; give ear to whatever Sarah says to you, because it is from Isaac that your seed will take its name.",,,,,,,
505,"And I will make a nation of the son of your servant-woman, because he is your seed.",,,,,,,
506,"And early in the morning Abraham got up, and gave Hagar some bread and a water-skin, and put the boy on her back, and sent her away: and she went, wandering in the waste land of Beer-sheba.",,,,,,,
507,"And when all the water in the skin was used up, she put the child down under a tree.",,,,,,,
508,"And she went some distance away, about an arrow flight, and seating herself on the earth, she gave way to bitter weeping, saying, Let me not see the death of my child.",,,,,,,
509,"And the boy's cry came to the ears of God; and the angel of God said to Hagar from heaven, Hagar, why are you weeping? have no fear, for the child's cry has come to the ears of God.",,,,,,,
510,"Come, take your child in your arms, for I will make of him a great nation.",,,,,,,
511,"Then God made her eyes open, and she saw a water-spring, and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink.",,,,,,,
512,"And God was with the boy, and he became tall and strong, and he became a bowman, living in the waste land.",,,,,,,
513,"And while he was in the waste land of Paran, his mother got him a wife from the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
514,"Now at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, said to Abraham, I see that God is with you in all you do.",,,,,,,
515,"Now, then, give me your oath, in the name of God, that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me, but that as I have been good to you, so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living.",,,,,,,
516,"And Abraham said, I will give you my oath.",,,,,,,
517,But Abraham made a protest to Abimelech because of a water-hole which Abimelech's servants had taken by force.,,,,,,,
518,"But Abimelech said, I have no idea who has done this thing; you never gave me word of it, and I had no knowledge of it till this day.",,,,,,,
519,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement together.",,,,,,,
520,And Abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves.,,,,,,,
521,"Then Abimelech said, What are these seven lambs which you have put on one side?",,,,,,,
522,"And he said, Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this water-hole.",,,,,,,
523,"So he gave that place the name Beer-sheba, because there the two of them had given their oaths.",,,,,,,
524,"So they made an agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
525,"And Abraham, after planting a holy tree in Beer-sheba, gave worship to the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.",,,,,,,
526,"And Abraham went on living in the land of the Philistines as in a strange country.Now after these things, God put Abraham to the test, and said to him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
527,"And he said to him, Take your son, your dearly loved only son Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and givehim as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which I will give you knowledge.",,,,,,,
528,"And Abraham got up early in the morning, and made ready his ass, and took with him two of his young men and Isaac, his son, and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut, he went on his way to the place of which God had given him word.",,,,,,,
529,"And on the third day, Abraham, lifting up his eyes, saw the place a long way off.",,,,,,,
530,"Then he said to his young men, Keep here with the ass; and I and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you.",,,,,,,
531,"And Abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his son's back, and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them went on together.",,,,,,,
532,"Then Isaac said to Abraham, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, We have wood and fire here, but where is the lamb for the burned offering?",,,,,,,
533,"And Abraham said, God himself will give the lamb for the burned offering: so they went on together.",,,,,,,
534,"And they came to the place of which God had given him knowledge; and there Abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it, and having made tight the bands round Isaac his son, he put him on the wood on the altar.",,,,,,,
535,"And stretching out his hand, Abraham took the knife to put his son to death.",,,,,,,
536,"But the voice of the angel of the Lord came from heaven, saying, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
537,"And he said, Let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him; for now I am certain that the fear of God is in your heart, because you have not kept back your son, your only son, from me.",,,,,,,
538,"And lifting up his eyes, Abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood: and Abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son.",,,,,,,
539,"And Abraham gave that place the name Yahweh-yireh: as it is said to this day, In the mountain the Lord is seen.",,,,,,,
540,"And the voice of the angel of the Lord came to Abraham a second time from heaven,",,,,,,,
541,"Saying, I have taken an oath by my name, says the Lord, because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son,",,,,,,,
542,"That I will certainly give you my blessing, and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside; your seed will take the land of those who are against them;",,,,,,,
543,"And your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth, because you have done what I gave you orders to do.",,,,,,,
544,"Then Abraham went back to his young men and they went together to Beer-sheba, the place where Abraham was living.",,,,,,,
545,"After these things, Abraham had news that Milcah, the wife of his brother Nahor, had given birth to children;",,,,,,,
546,"Uz the oldest, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram,",,,,,,,
547,And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.,,,,,,,
548,"Bethuel was the father of Rebekah: these eight were the children of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham's brother.",,,,,,,
549,And his servant Reumah gave birth to Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.Now the years of Sarah's life were a hundred and twenty-seven.,,,,,,,
550,"And Sarah's death took place in Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan: and Abraham went into his house, weeping and sorrowing for Sarah.",,,,,,,
551,"And Abraham came from his dead and said to the children of Heth,",,,,,,,
552,"I am living among you as one from a strange country: give me some land here as my property, so that I may put my dead to rest.",,,,,,,
553,"And in answer the children of Heth said to Abraham,",,,,,,,
554,"My lord, truly you are a great chief among us; take the best of our resting-places for your dead; not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest.",,,,,,,
555,"And Abraham got up and gave honour to the children of Heth, the people of that land.",,,,,,,
556,"And he said to them, If you will let me put my dead to rest here, make a request for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar,",,,,,,,
557,"That he will give me the hollow in the rock named Machpelah, which is his property at the end of his field; let him give it to me for its full price as a resting-place for my dead among you.",,,,,,,
558,"Now Ephron was seated among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite gave Abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of Heth, and of all those who came into his town, saying,",,,,,,,
559,"No, my lord, I will give you the field with the hollow in the rock; before all the children of my people will I give it to you for a resting-place for your dead.",,,,,,,
560,And Abraham went down on his face before the people of the land.,,,,,,,
561,"And Abraham said to Ephron, in the hearing of the people of the land, If only you will give ear to me, I will give you the price of the field; take it, and let me put my dead to rest there.",,,,,,,
562,"So Ephron said to Abraham,",,,,,,,
563,"My lord, give ear to me: the value of the land is four hundred shekels; what is that between me and you? so put your dead to rest there.",,,,,,,
564,"And Abraham took note of the price fixed by Ephron in the hearing of the children of Heth, and gave him four hundred shekels in current money.",,,,,,,
565,"So Ephron's field at Machpelah near Mamre, with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it,",,,,,,,
566,Became the property of Abraham before the eyes of the children of Heth and of all who came into the town.,,,,,,,
567,"Then Abraham put Sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, that is, Hebron in the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
568,And the field and the hollow rock were handed over to Abraham as his property by the children of Heth.Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure.,,,,,,,
569,"And Abraham said to his chief servant, the manager of all his property, Come now, putyour handundermy leg:",,,,,,,
570,"And take an oath by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;",,,,,,,
571,But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac.,,,,,,,
572,"And the servant said, If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land, am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came?",,,,,,,
573,"And Abraham said, Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land.",,,,,,,
574,"The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land.",,,,,,,
575,"And if the woman will not come with you, then you are free from this oath; only do not take my son back there.",,,,,,,
576,"And the servant put his hand under Abraham's leg, and gave him his oath about this thing.",,,,,,,
577,"And the servant took ten of his master's camels, and all sorts of good things of his master's, and went to Mesopotamia, to the town of Nahor.",,,,,,,
578,"And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water-spring in the evening, at the time when the women came to get water.",,,,,,,
579,"And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, let me do well in what I have undertaken this day, and give your mercy to my master Abraham.",,,,,,,
580,"See, I am waiting here by the water-spring; and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water:",,,,,,,
581,"Now, may the girl to whom I say, Let down your vessel and give me a drink, and who says in answer, Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels: may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac: so may I be certain that you hav",been good t,my,m,ste,Abr,ham,
582,"And even before his words were ended, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water-vessel on her arm.",,,,,,,
583,"She was a very beautiful girl, a virgin, who had never been touched by a man: and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel.",,,,,,,
584,"And the servant came running to her and said, Give me a little water from your vessel.",,,,,,,
585,"And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink.",,,,,,,
586,"And having done so, she said, I will get water for your camels till they have had enough.",,,,,,,
587,"And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals' drinking- place, she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels.",,,,,,,
588,"And the man, looking at her, said nothing, waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome.",,,,,,,
589,"And when the camels had had enough, the man took a gold nose-ring, half a shekel in weight, and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold;",,,,,,,
590,"And said to her, Whose daughter are you? is there room in your father's house for us?",,,,,,,
591,"And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife.",,,,,,,
592,"And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you.",,,,,,,
593,And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord;,,,,,,,
594,"And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master's family.",,,,,,,
595,So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother's house,,,,,,,
596,"Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring.",,,,,,,
597,"And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister's hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring.",,,,,,,
598,"And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels.",,,,,,,
599,"Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet.",,,,,,,
600,"And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so.",,,,,,,
601,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant.",,,,,,,
602,"The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses.",,,,,,,
603,"And when Sarah, my master's wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has.",,,,,,,
604,"And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living;",,,,,,,
605,But go to my father's house and to my relations for a wife for my son.,,,,,,,
606,"And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me?",,,,,,,
607,"And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father's house;",,,,,,,
608,"And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath.",,,,,,,
609,"And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey,",,,,,,,
610,"Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says,",,,,,,,
611,"Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son.",,,,,,,
612,"And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink.",,,,,,,
613,"And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels.",,,,,,,
614,"And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands.",,,,,,,
615,"And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son.",,,,,,,
616,"And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do.",,,,,,,
617,"Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you.",,,,,,,
618,"See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the Lord has said.",,,,,,,
619,"And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord.",,,,,,,
620,Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother.,,,,,,,
621,"Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master.",,,,,,,
622,"But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go.",,,,,,,
623,"And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master.",,,,,,,
624,"And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision.",,,,,,,
625,"And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready.",,,,,,,
626,So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men.,,,,,,,
627,"And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them.",,,,,,,
628,"So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.",,,,,,,
629,Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South.,,,,,,,
630,"And when the evening was near, he went wandering out into the fields, and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming.",,,,,,,
631,"And when Rebekah, looking up, saw Isaac, she got down from her camel,",,,,,,,
632,"And said to the servant, Who is that man coming to us through the field? And the servant said, It is my master: then she took her veil, covering her face with it.",,,,,,,
633,Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done.,,,,,,,
634,"And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife; and in his love for her, Isaac was comforted after his father's death.And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.",,,,,,,
635,She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.,,,,,,,
636,And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And from Dedan came the Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.,,,,,,,
637,And from Midian came Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the offspring of Keturah.,,,,,,,
638,Now Abraham gave all his property to Isaac;,,,,,,,
639,"But to the sons of his other women he gave offerings, and sent them away, while he was still living, into the east country.",,,,,,,
640,Now the years of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five.,,,,,,,
641,"And Abraham came to his death, an old man, full of years; and he was put to rest with his people.",,,,,,,
642,"And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, put him to rest in the hollow rock of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre;",,,,,,,
643,"The same field which Abraham got from the children of Heth: there Abraham was put to rest with Sarah, his wife.",,,,,,,
644,"Now after the death of Abraham, the blessing of God was with Isaac, his son.",,,,,,,
645,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whose mother was Hagar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah:",,,,,,,
646,These are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their generations: Ishmael's first son was Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam,,,,,,,
647,"And Mishma and Dumah and Massa,",,,,,,,
648,"Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:",,,,,,,
649,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names in their towns and their tent-circles; twelve chiefs with their peoples.",,,,,,,
650,"And the years of Ishmael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven: and he came to his end, and was put to rest with his people.",,,,,,,
651,And their country was from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt: they took their place to the east of all their brothers.,,,,,,,
652,Now these are the generations of Abraham's son Isaac:,,,,,,,
653,"Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife.",,,,,,,
654,"Isaac made prayer to the Lord for his wife because she had no children; and the Lord gave ear to his prayer, and Rebekah became with child.",,,,,,,
655,"And the children were fighting together inside her, and she said, If it is to be so, why am I like this? So she went to put her question to the Lord.",,,,,,,
656,"And the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your body, and two peoples will come to birth from you: the one will be stronger than the other, and the older will be the servant of the younger.",,,,,,,
657,"And when the time came for her to give birth, there were two children in her body.",,,,,,,
658,"And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair, and they gave him the name of Esau.",,,,,,,
659,"And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.",,,,,,,
660,"And the boys came to full growth; and Esau became a man of the open country, an expert bowman; but Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.",,,,,,,
661,"Now Isaac's love was for Esau, because Esau's meat was greatly to his taste: but Rebekah had more love for Jacob.",,,,,,,
662,And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food;,,,,,,,
663,"And Esau said to Jacob, Give me a full meal of that red soup, for I am overcome with need for food: for this reason he was named Edom.",,,,,,,
664,"And Jacob said, First of all give me your birthright.",,,,,,,
665,"And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me?",,,,,,,
666,"And Jacob said, First of all give me your oath; and he gave him his oath, handing over his birthright to Jacob.",,,,,,,
667,"Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright.Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Ph","listines, at",Ger,r,,,,
668,"And the Lord came to him in a vision and said, Do not go down to Egypt; keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge:",,,,,,,
669,"Keep in this land, and I will be with you and give you my blessing; for to you and to your seed will I give all these lands, giving effect to the oath which I made to your father Abraham;",,,,,,,
670,"I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth;",,,,,,,
671,"Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws.",,,,,,,
672,So Isaac went on living in Gerar;,,,,,,,
673,"And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife, he said, She is my sister; fearing to say, She is my wife; for, he said, the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah; because she is very beautiful.",,,,,,,
674,"And when he had been there for some time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looking through a window, saw Isaac playing with Rebekah his wife.",,,,,,,
675,"And he said to Isaac, It is clear that she is your wife: why then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said, For fear that I might be put to death because of her.",,,,,,,
676,"Then Abimelech said, What have you done to us? one of the people might well have had connection with your wife, and the sin would have been ours.",,,,,,,
677,And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death.,,,,,,,
678,"Now Isaac, planting seed in that land, got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much, for the blessing of the Lord was on him.",,,,,,,
679,"And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more;",,,,,,,
680,For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants; so that the Philistines were full of envy.,,,,,,,
681,"Now all the water- holes, which his father's servants had made in the days of Abraham, had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines.",,,,,,,
682,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are stronger than we are.",,,,,,,
683,"So Isaac went away from there, and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar, making his living-place there.",,,,,,,
684,"And he made again the water-holes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father, and which had been stopped up by the Philistines; and he gave them the names which his father had given them.",,,,,,,
685,"Now Isaac's servants made holes in the valley, and came to a spring of flowing water.",,,,,,,
686,"But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac's herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it.",,,,,,,
687,"Then they made another water-hole, and there was a fight about that, so he gave it the name of Sitnah.",,,,,,,
688,"Then he went away from there, and made another water-hole, about which there was no fighting: so he gave it the name of Rehoboth, for he said, Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will have fruit in this land.",,,,,,,
689,And from there he went on to Beer-sheba.,,,,,,,
690,"That night the Lord came to him in a vision, and said, I am the God of your father Abraham: have no fear for I am with you, blessing you, and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham.",,,,,,,
691,"Then he made an altar there, and gave worship to the name of the Lord, and he put up his tents there, and there his servants made a water-hole.",,,,,,,
692,"And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol, the captain of his army.",,,,,,,
693,"And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you?",,,,,,,
694,"And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with you: so we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and let us make an agreement with you;",,,,,,,
695,"That you will do us no damage, even as we put no hand on you, and did you nothing but good, and sent you away in peace: and now the blessing of the Lord is on you.",,,,,,,
696,"Then he made a feast for them, and they all had food and drink.",,,,,,,
697,And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other: then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace.,,,,,,,
698,"And that day Isaac's servants came to him and gave him word of the water-hole which they had made, and said to him, We have come to water.",,,,,,,
699,And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day.,,,,,,,
700,"And when Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite:",,,,,,,
701,"And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them.Now when Isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see, he sent for Esau, his first son, and said to him, My son: and he said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
702,"And he said, See now, I am old, and my death may take place at any time:",,,,,,,
703,So take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me;,,,,,,,
704,"And make me food, good to the taste, such as is pleasing to me, and put it before me, so that I may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me.",,,,,,,
705,Now Isaac's words to his son were said in Rebekah's hearing. Then Esau went out to get the meat.,,,,,,,
706,"And Rebekah said to Jacob, her son, Your father said to your brother Esau in my hearing,",,,,,,,
707,"Go and get some roe's meat and make me a good meal, so that I may be full, and give you my blessing before the Lord before my death.",,,,,,,
708,"Now, my son, do what I say.",,,,,,,
709,Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats; and I will make of them a meal to your father's taste:,,,,,,,
710,"And you will take it to him, so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death.",,,,,,,
711,"And Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, But Esau my brother is covered with hair, while I am smooth:",,,,,,,
712,"If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing.",,,,,,,
713,"And his mother said, Let the curse be on me, my son: only do as I say, and go and get them for me.",,,,,,,
714,So he went and got them and took them to his mother: and she made a meal to his father's taste.,,,,,,,
715,"And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son:",,,,,,,
716,And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck:,,,,,,,
717,"And she gave into the hand of Jacob, her son, the meat and the bread which she had made ready.",,,,,,,
718,"And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I: who are you, my son?",,,,,,,
719,"And Jacob said, I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you said: come now, be seated and take of my meat, so that you may give me a blessing.",,,,,,,
720,"And Isaac said, How is it that you have got it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord your God made it come my way.",,,,,,,
721,"And Isaac said, Come near so that I may put my hand on you, my son, and see if you are truly my son Esau or not.",,,,,,,
722,"And Jacob went near his father Isaac: and he put his hands on him; and he said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.",,,,,,,
723,"And he did not make out who he was, because his hands were covered with hair like his brother Esau's hands: so he gave him a blessing.",,,,,,,
724,"And he said, Are you truly my son Esau? And he said, I am.",,,,,,,
725,"And he said, Put it before me and I will take of my son's meat, so that I may give you a blessing. And he put it before him and he took it; and he gave him wine, and he had a drink.",,,,,,,
726,"And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, my son, and give me a kiss.",,,,,,,
727,"And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come:",,,,,,,
728,"May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure:",,,,,,,
729,"Let peoples be your servants, and nations go down before you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons go down before you: a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed, and a blessing on those who give you a blessing.",,,,,,,
730,"And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father, Esau came in from the field.",,,,,,,
731,"And he made ready a meal, good to the taste, and took it to his father, and said to him, Let my father get up and take of his son's meat, so that you may give me a blessing.",,,,,,,
732,"And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau.",,,,,,,
733,"And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be?",,,,,,,
734,"And hearing the words of his father, Esau gave a great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Give a blessing to me, even to me, O my father!",,,,,,,
735,"And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and took away your blessing.",,,,,,,
736,"And he said, Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place? for he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not kept a blessing for me?",,,,,,,
737,"And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son?",,,,,,,
738,"And Esau said to his father, Is that the only blessing you have, my father? give a blessing to me, even me! And Esau was overcome with weeping.",,,,,,,
739,"Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him, Far from the fertile places of the earth, and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living-place be:",,,,,,,
740,By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brother's servant; but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck.,,,,,,,
741,"So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his father's blessing; and he said in his heart, The days of weeping for my father are near; then I will put my brother Jacob to death.",,,,,,,
742,"Then Rebekah, hearing what Esau had said, sent for Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death.",,,,,,,
743,"So now, my son, do what I say: go quickly to Haran, to my brother Laban;",,,,,,,
744,"And be there with him for a little time, till your brother's wrath is turned away;",,,,,,,
745,Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day?,,,,,,,
746,"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, My life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth, such as these, the women of this land, of what use will my life be to me?Then Isaac sent for Jacob, and ble","sing him, sa","d,",o,not,take,a w,fe fr
747,"But go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.",,,,,,,
748,"AndmayGod, theRulerofall, giveyouhisblessing, givingyoufruitandincrease, sothat you may become an army of peoples.",,,,,,,
749,"And may God give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed, so that the land of your wanderings, which God gave to Abraham, may be your heritage.",,,,,,,
750,"So Isaac sent Jacob away: and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.",,,,,,,
751,"So when Esau saw that Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and sent him away to Paddan- aram to get a wife for himself there, blessing him and saying to him, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan;",,,,,,,
752,And that Jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to Paddan-aram;,,,,,,,
753,"It was clear to Esau that his father had no love for the women of Canaan,",,,,,,,
754,"So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.",,,,,,,
755,So Jacob went out from Beer-sheba to go to Haran.,,,,,,,
756,"And coming to a certain place, he made it his resting-place for the night, for the sun had gone down; and he took one of the stones which were there, and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place.",,,,,,,
757,"And he had a dream, and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven, and the angels of God were going up and down on them.",,,,,,,
758,"And he saw the Lord by his side, saying, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: I will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping.",,,,,,,
759,"Your seed will be like the dust of the earth, covering all the land to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south: you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth.",,,,,,,
760,"And truly, I will be with you, and will keep you wherever you go, guiding you back again to this land; and I will not give you up till I have done what I have said to you.",,,,,,,
761,"And Jacob, awaking from his sleep, said, Truly, the Lord is in this place and I was not conscious of it.",,,,,,,
762,"And fear came on him, and he said, This is a holy place; this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven.",,,,,,,
763,"And early in the morning Jacob took the stone which had been under his head, and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it.",,,,,,,
764,"And he gave that place the name of Beth-el, but before that time the town was named Luz.",,,,,,,
765,"Then Jacob took an oath, and said, If God will be with me, and keep me safe on my journey, and give me food and clothing to put on,",,,,,,,
766,"So that I come again to my father's house in peace, then I will take the Lord to be my God,",,,,,,,
767,"And this stone which I have put up for a pillar will be God's house: and of all you give me, I will give a tenth part to you.Then Jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the East.",,,,,,,
768,"And there he saw a water-hole in a field, and by the side of it three flocks of sheep, for there they got water for the sheep: and on the mouth of the water-hole there was a great stone.",,,,,,,
769,"And all the flocks would come together there, and when the stone had been rolled away, they would give the sheep water, and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the water-hole.",,,,,,,
770,"Then Jacob said to the herdmen, My brothers, where do you come from? And they said, From Haran.",,,,,,,
771,"And he said to them, Have you any knowledge of Laban, the son of Nahor? And they said, We have.",,,,,,,
772,"And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.",,,,,,,
773,"Then Jacob said, The sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together: get water for the sheep and go and give them their food.",,,,,,,
774,"And they said, We are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the water-hole; then we will get water for the sheep.",,,,,,,
775,"While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she took care of them.",,,,,,,
776,"Then when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, coming with Laban's sheep, he came near, and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole, he got water for Laban's flock.",,,,,,,
777,"And weeping for joy, Jacob gave Rachel a kiss.",,,,,,,
778,"And Rachel, hearing from Jacob that he was her father's relation and that he was the son of Rebekah, went running to give her father news of it.",,,,,,,
779,"And Laban, hearing news of Jacob, his sister's son, came running, and took Jacob in his arms, and kissing him, made him come into his house. And Jacob gave him news of everything.",,,,,,,
780,"And Laban said to him, Truly, you are my bone and my flesh. And he kept Jacob with him for the space of a month.",,,,,,,
781,"Then Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing? say now, what is your payment to be?",,,,,,,
782,"Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.",,,,,,,
783,"And Leah's eyes were clouded, but Rachel was fair in face and form.",,,,,,,
784,"And Jacob was in love with Rachel; and he said, I will be your servant seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.",,,,,,,
785,"And Laban said, It is better for you to have her than another man: go on living here with me.",,,,,,,
786,And Jacob did seven years' work for Rachel; and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time.,,,,,,,
787,"Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife so that I may have her, for the days are ended.",,,,,,,
788,And Laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast.,,,,,,,
789,"And in the evening he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him, and he went in to her.",,,,,,,
790,"And Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her waiting-woman.",,,,,,,
791,"And in the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What have you done to me? was I not working for you so that I might have Rachel? why have you been false to me?",,,,,,,
792,"And Laban said, In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older.",,,,,,,
793,"Let the week of the bride-feast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition, if you will be my servant for another seven years.",,,,,,,
794,"And Jacob did so; and when the week was ended, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel for his wife.",,,,,,,
795,And Laban gave Rachel his servant-girl Bilhah to be her waiting-woman.,,,,,,,
796,"Then Jacob took Rachel as his wife, and his love for her was greater than his love for Leah; and he went on working for Laban for another seven years.",,,,,,,
797,"Now the Lord, seeing that Leah was not loved, gave her a child; while Rachel had no children.",,,,,,,
798,"And Leah was with child, and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name Reuben: for she said, The Lord has seen my sorrow; now my husband will have love for me.",,,,,,,
799,"Then she became with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Because it has come to the Lord's ears that I am not loved, he has given me this son in addition: and she gave him the name Simeon.",,,,,,,
800,"And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Now at last my husband will be united to me, because I have given him three sons: so he was named Levi.",,,,,,,
801,"And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son: and she said, This time I will give praise to the Lord: so he was named Judah; after this she had no more children for a time.Now Rachel, because she had no children, was full of envy of her sister;",nd she said,o J,c,"b,",f yo,do,not g
802,"But Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said, Am I in the place of God, who has kept your body from having fruit?",,,,,,,
803,"Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah, go in to her, so that she may have a child on my knees, and I may have a family by her.",,,,,,,
804,"So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.",,,,,,,
805,"And Bilhah became with child, and gave birth to a son.",,,,,,,
806,"Then Rachel said, God has been my judge, and has given ear to my voice, and has given me a son; so he was named Dan.",,,,,,,
807,"And again Bilhah, Rachel's servant, was with child, and gave birth to a second son.",,,,,,,
808,"And Rachel said, I have had a great fight with my sister, and I have overcome her: and she gave the child the name Naphtali.",,,,,,,
809,"When it was clear to Leah that she would have no more children for a time, she gave Zilpah, her servant, to Jacob as a wife.",,,,,,,
810,"And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a son.",,,,,,,
811,"And Leah said, It has gone well for me: and she gave him the name Gad.",,,,,,,
812,"And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a second son.",,,,,,,
813,"And Leah said, Happy am I! and all women will give witness to my joy: and she gave him the name Asher.",,,,,,,
814,"Now at the time of the grain-cutting, Reuben saw some love-fruits in the field, and took them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits.",,,,,,,
815,"But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits.",,,,,,,
816,"In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night.",,,,,,,
817,"And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son.",,,,,,,
818,"Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar.",,,,,,,
819,"And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son.",,,,,,,
820,"And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun.",,,,,,,
821,"After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah.",,,,,,,
822,"Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile.",,,,,,,
823,"And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame.",,,,,,,
824,"And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son.",,,,,,,
825,"Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country.",,,,,,,
826,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you.",,,,,,,
827,"And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you.",,,,,,,
828,Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it.,,,,,,,
829,"Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care.",,,,,,,
830,"For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family?",,,,,,,
831,"And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me:",,,,,,,
832,"Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment.",,,,,,,
833,"And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief.",,,,,,,
834,"And Laban said, Let it be as you say.",,,,,,,
835,"So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;",,,,,,,
836,And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock.,,,,,,,
837,"Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands.",,,,,,,
838,And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.,,,,,,,
839,"And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour.",,,,,,,
840,These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock.,,,,,,,
841,"And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks.",,,,,,,
842,"But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's.",,,,,,,
843,"So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.Now it came to the ears of Jacob that Laban's sons were saying, Jacob has taken away all our father's property, and in this way he has g",t all this w,alt,.,,,,
844,And Jacob saw that Laban's feeling for him was no longer what it had been before.,,,,,,,
845,"Then the Lord said to Jacob, Go back to the land of your fathers, and to your relations, and I will be with you.",,,,,,,
846,And Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to him in the field among his flock.,,,,,,,
847,"And he said to them, It is clear to me that your father's feeling is no longer what it was to me; but the God of my father has been with me",,,,,,,
848,"And you have seen how I have done all in my power for your father,",,,,,,,
849,"But your father has not kept faith with me, and ten times he has made changes in my payment; but God has kept him from doing me damage.",,,,,,,
850,"If he said, All those in the flock which have marks are to be yours, then all the flock gave birth to marked young; and if he said, All the banded ones are to be yours, then all the flock had banded young.",,,,,,,
851,So God has taken away your father's cattle and has given them to me.,,,,,,,
852,"And at the time when the flock were with young, I saw in a dream that all the he-goats which were joined with the she-goats were banded and marked and coloured.",,,,,,,
853,"And in my dream the angel of the Lord said to me, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
854,"And he said, See how all the he-goats are banded and marked and coloured: for I have seen what Laban has done to you.",,,,,,,
855,"I am the God of Beth-el, where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me: now then, come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth.",,,,,,,
856,"Then Rachel and Leah said to him in answer, What part or heritage is there for us in our father's house?",,,,,,,
857,Are we not as people from a strange country to him? for he took a price for us and now it is all used up.,,,,,,,
858,"For the wealth which God has taken from him is ours and our children's; so now, whatever God has said to you, do.",,,,,,,
859,Then Jacob put his wives and his sons on camels;,,,,,,,
860,"And sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in Paddan-aram, he made ready to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
861,Now Laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep; so Rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her father's house.,,,,,,,
862,"And Jacob went away secretly, without giving news of his flight to Laban the Aramaean.",,,,,,,
863,"So he went away with all he had, and went across the River in the direction of the hill-country of Gilead.",,,,,,,
864,And on the third day Laban had news of Jacob's flight.,,,,,,,
865,"And taking the men of his family with him, he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hill-country of Gilead.",,,,,,,
866,"Then God came to Laban in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.",,,,,,,
867,"Now when Laban overtook him, Jacob had put up his tent in the hill-country; and Laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hill-country of Gilead.",,,,,,,
868,"And Laban said to Jacob, Why did you go away secretly, taking my daughters away like prisoners of war?",,,,,,,
869,"Why did you make a secret of your flight, not giving me word of it, so that I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with melody and music?",,,,,,,
870,You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters. This was a foolish thing to do.,,,,,,,
871,"It is in my power to do you damage: but the God of your father came to me this night, saying, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.",,,,,,,
872,"And now, it seems, you are going because your heart's desire is for your father's house; but why have you taken my gods?",,,,,,,
873,"And Jacob, in answer, said to Laban, My fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force.",,,,,,,
874,"As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death: make search before us all for what is yours, and take it. For Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them.",,,,,,,
875,"So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there; and he came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's.",,,,,,,
876,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and had put them in the camels' basket, and was seated on them. And Laban, searching through all the tent, did not come across them.",,,,,,,
877,"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry because I do not get up before you, for I am in the common condition of women. And with all his searching, he did not come across the images.",,,,,,,
878,"Then Jacob was angry with Laban, and said, What crime or sin have I done that you have come after me with such passion?",,,,,,,
879,"Now that you have made search through all my goods, what have you seen which is yours? Make it clear now before my people and your people, so that they may be judges between us.",,,,,,,
880,"These twenty years I have been with you; your sheep and your goats have had young without loss, not one of your he-goats have I taken for food.",,,,,,,
881,"Anything which was wounded by beasts I did not take to you, but myself made up for the loss of it; you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves, by day or by night.",,,,,,,
882,"This was my condition, wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night; and sleep went from my eyes.",,,,,,,
883,"These twenty years I have been in your house; I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters, and for six years I kept your flock, and ten times was my payment changed.",,,,,,,
884,"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands. But God has seen my troubles and the work of my hands, and this night he kept you back.",,,,,,,
885,"Then Laban, answering, said, These women are my daughters and these children my children, the flocks and all you see are mine: what now may I do for my daughters and for their children?",,,,,,,
886,"Come, let us make an agreement, you and I; and let it be for a witness between us.",,,,,,,
887,Then Jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar.,,,,,,,
888,"And Jacob said to his people, Get stones together; and they did so; and they had a meal there by the stones.",,,,,,,
889,And the name Laban gave it was Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob gave it the name of Galeed.,,,,,,,
890,"And Laban said, These stones are a witness between you and me today. For this reason its name was Galeed,",,,,,,,
891,"And Mizpah, for he said, May the Lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one another's doings.",,,,,,,
892,"If you are cruel to my daughters, or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters, then though no man is there to see, God will be the witness between us.",,,,,,,
893,"And Laban said, See these stones and this pillar which I have put between you and me;",,,,,,,
894,"They will be witness that I will not go over these stones to you, and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me, for any evil purpose.",,,,,,,
895,"May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, be our judge. Then Jacob took an oath by the Fear of his father Isaac.",,,,,,,
896,"And Jacob made an offering on the mountain, and gave orders to his people to take food: so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain.",,,,,,,
897,"And early in the morning Laban, after kissing and blessing his daughters, went on his way back to his country.And on his way Jacob came face to face with the angels of God.",,,,,,,
898,"And when he saw them he said, This is the army of God: so he gave that place the name of Mahanaim.",,,,,,,
899,"Now Jacob sent servants before him to Esau, his brother, in the land of Seir, the country of Edom;",,,,,,,
900,"And he gave them orders to say these words to Esau: Your servant Jacob says, Till now I have been living with Laban:",,,,,,,
901,And I have oxen and asses and flocks and men- servants and women-servants: and I have sent to give my lord news of these things so that I may have grace in his eyes.,,,,,,,
902,"When the servants came back they said, We have seen your brother Esau and he is coming out to you, and four hundred men with him.",,,,,,,
903,Then Jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind: and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups;,,,,,,,
904,"And said, If Esau, meeting one group, makes an attack on them, the others will get away safely.",,,,,,,
905,"Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, the Lord who said to me, Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you:",,,,,,,
906,"I am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant; for with only my stick in my hand I went across Jordan, and now I have become two armies.",,,,,,,
907,"Be my saviour from the hand of Esau, my brother: for my fear is that he will make an attack on me, putting to death mother and child.",,,,,,,
908,"And you said, Truly, I will be good to you, and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered.",,,,,,,
909,"Then he put up his tent there for the night; and from among his goods he took, as an offering for his brother Esau,",,,,,,,
910,"Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep,",,,,,,,
911,"Thirty camels with their young ones, forty cows, ten oxen, twenty asses, and ten young asses.",,,,,,,
912,"These he gave to his servants, every herd by itself, and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and let there be a space between one herd and another.",,,,,,,
913,"And he gave orders to the first, saying, When my brother Esau comes to you and says, Whose servant are you, and where are you going, and whose are these herds?",,,,,,,
914,"Then say to him, These are your servant Jacob's; they are an offering for my lord, for Esau; and he himself is coming after us.",,,,,,,
915,"And he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds, saying, This is what you are to say to Esau when you see him;",,,,,,,
916,"And you are to say further, Jacob, your servant, is coming after us. For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes.",,,,,,,
917,"So the servants with the offerings went on in front, and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people.",,,,,,,
918,"And in the night he got up, and taking with him his two wives and the two servant-women and his eleven children, he went over the river Jabbok.",,,,,,,
919,He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had.,,,,,,,
920,Then Jacob was by himself; and a man was fighting with him till dawn.,,,,,,,
921,"But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob, he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg, so that his leg was damaged.",,,,,,,
922,"And he said to him, Let me go now, for the dawn is near. But Jacob said, I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing.",,,,,,,
923,"Then he said, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.",,,,,,,
924,"And he said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel: for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome.",,,,,,,
925,"Then Jacob said, What is your name? And he said, What is my name to you? Then he gave him a blessing.",,,,,,,
926,"And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel, saying, I have seen God face to face, and still I am living.",,,,,,,
927,"And while he was going past Peniel, the sun came up. And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg.",,,,,,,
928,"For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched.Then Jacob, lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. So he made a division o",the childre,be,w,en,eah,nd,achel
929,"He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph at the back.",,,,,,,
930,"And he himself, going before them, went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother.",,,,,,,
931,"Then Esau came running up to him, and folding him in his arms, gave him a kiss: and the two of them were overcome with weeping.",,,,,,,
932,"Then Esau, lifting up his eyes, saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God in his mercy has given to your servant.",,,,,,,
933,"Then the servants and their children came near, and went down on their faces.",,,,,,,
934,"And Leah came near with her children, and then Joseph and Rachel, and they did the same.",,,,,,,
935,"And he said, What were all those herds which I saw on the way? And Jacob said, They were an offering so that I might have grace in my lord's eyes.",,,,,,,
936,"But Esau said, I have enough; keep what is yours, my brother, for yourself.",,,,,,,
937,"And Jacob said, Not so; but if I have grace in your eyes, take them as a sign of my love, for I have seen your face as one may see the face of God, and you have been pleased with me.",,,,,,,
938,"Take my offering then, with my blessing; for God has been very good to me and I have enough: so at his strong request, he took it.",,,,,,,
939,"And he said, Let us go on our journey together, and I will go in front.",,,,,,,
940,"But Jacob said, My lord may see that the children are only small, and there are young ones in my flocks and herds: one day's over-driving will be the destruction of all the flock.",,,,,,,
941,"Do you, my lord, go on before your servant; I will come on slowly, at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go, till I come to my lord at Seir.",,,,,,,
942,"And Esau said, Then keep some of my men with you. And he said, What need is there for that, if my lord is pleased with me?",,,,,,,
943,"So Esau, turning back that day, went on his way to Seir.",,,,,,,
944,"And Jacob went on to Succoth, where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle: for this reason the place was named Succoth.",,,,,,,
945,"So Jacob came safely from Paddan-aram to the town of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and put up his tents near the town.",,,,,,,
946,"And for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of Hamor, the builder of Shechem, the field in which he had put up his tents.",,,,,,,
947,"And there he put up an altar, naming it El, the God of Israel.Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had by Jacob, went out to see the women of that country.",,,,,,,
948,"And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite who was the chief of that land, saw her, he took her by force and had connection with her.",,,,,,,
949,"Then his heart went out in love to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he said comforting words to her.",,,,,,,
950,"And Shechem said to Hamor, his father, Get me this girl for my wife.",,,,,,,
951,"Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter; but his sons were in the fields with the cattle, and Jacob said nothing till they came.",,,,,,,
952,"Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, came out to have a talk with Jacob.",,,,,,,
953,"Now the sons of Jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it, and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in Israel by having connection with Jacob's daughter; and they said, Such a thing is not to be done.",,,,,,,
954,"But Hamor said to them, Shechem, my son, is full of desire for your daughter: will you then give her to him for a wife?",,,,,,,
955,"And let our two peoples be joined together; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.",,,,,,,
956,"Go on living with us, and the country will be open to you; do trade and get property there.",,,,,,,
957,"And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, If you will give ear to my request, whatever you say I will give to you.",,,,,,,
958,"However great you make the bride-price and payment, I will give it; only let me have the girl for my wife.",,,,,,,
959,"But the sons of Jacob gave a false answer to Shechem and Hamor his father, because of what had been done to Dinah their sister.",,,,,,,
960,"And they said, It is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision, for that would be a cause of shame to us:",,,,,,,
961,But on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you: if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision;,,,,,,,
962,Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people.,,,,,,,
963,"But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go.",,,,,,,
964,And their words were pleasing to Hamor and his son Shechem.,,,,,,,
965,"And without loss of time the young man did as they said, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was the noblest of his father's house.",,,,,,,
966,"Then Hamor and Shechem, his son, went to the meeting-place of their town, and said to the men of the town,",,,,,,,
967,"It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us; let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here, for the country is wide open before them; let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters.",,,,,,,
968,"But these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people, only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done.",,,,,,,
969,Then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us.,,,,,,,
970,Then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of Hamor and Shechem his son; and every male in the town underwent circumcision.,,,,,,,
971,"But on the third day after, before the wounds were well, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death.",,,,,,,
972,"And Hamor and his son they put to death with the sword, and they took Dinah from Shechem's house and went away.",,,,,,,
973,And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister;,,,,,,,
974,"They took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields,",,,,,,,
975,And all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives; everything in their houses they took and made them waste.,,,,,,,
976,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me; a",d it will be,the,e,d o,me,nd,ll my
977,"But they said, Were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman?And God said to Jacob, Go up now to Beth-el and make your living-place there: and put up an altar there to the God who came to you when you were in flight from your brother Esau.",,,,,,,
978,"Then Jacob said to all his people, Put away the strange gods which are among you, and make yourselves clean, and put on a change of clothing:",,,,,,,
979,"And let us go up to Beth-el: and there I will make an altar to God, who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble, and was with me wherever I went.",,,,,,,
980,"Then they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which they had, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem.",,,,,,,
981,"So they went on their journey: and the fear of God was on the towns round about, so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob.",,,,,,,
982,"And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (which is the same as Beth-el), he and all his people.",,,,,,,
983,"And there he made an altar, naming the place El-beth-el: because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother.",,,,,,,
984,"And Deborah, the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth, came to her end, and was put to rest near Beth-el, under the holy tree: and they gave it the name of Allon-bacuth.",,,,,,,
985,"Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddan-aram, God came to him again and, blessing him, said,",,,,,,,
986,"Jacob is your name, but it will be so no longer; from now your name will be Israel; so he was named Israel.",,,,,,,
987,"And God said to him, I am God, the Ruler of all: be fertile, and have increase; a nation, truly a group of nations, will come from you, and kings will be your offspring;",,,,,,,
988,"And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you; and to your seed after you I will give the land.",,,,,,,
989,Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him.,,,,,,,
990,"And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God, and put a drink offering on it, and oil.",,,,,,,
991,"And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him, the name of Beth-el.",,,,,,,
992,"So they went on from Beth-el; and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time.",,,,,,,
993,"And when her pain was very great, the woman who was helping her said, Have no fear; for now you will have another son.",,,,,,,
994,"And in the hour when her life went from her (for death came to her), she gave the child the name Ben-oni: but his father gave him the name of Benjamin.",,,,,,,
995,So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath (which is Beth-lehem).,,,,,,,
996,"And Jacob put up a pillar on her resting-place; which is named, The Pillar of the resting-place of Rachel, to this day.",,,,,,,
997,And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock.,,,,,,,
998,"Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it.",,,,,,,
999,"Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;",,,,,,,
1000,The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;,,,,,,,
1001,"The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali;",,,,,,,
1002,"The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher; these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddan-aram.",,,,,,,
1003,"And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had been living.",,,,,,,
1004,And Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old.,,,,,,,
1005,"Then Isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his father's people, an old man after a long life: and Jacob and Esau, his sons, put him in his last resting-place.Now these are the generations of Esau, that is to say, Edom.",,,,,,,
1006,"Esau's wives were women of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,",,,,,,,
1007,"And Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.",,,,,,,
1008,Adah had a son Eliphaz; and Basemath was the mother of Reuel;,,,,,,,
1009,"Oholibamah was the mother of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; these are the sons of Esau, whose birth took place in the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
1010,"Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters, and all the people of his house, and his beasts and his cattle and all his goods which he had got together in the land of Canaan, and went into the land of Seir, away from his brother Jacob.",,,,,,,
1011,For their wealth was so great that the land was not wide enough for the two of them and all their cattle.,,,,,,,
1012,So Esau made his living-place in the hill-country of Seir (Esau is Edom).,,,,,,,
1013,"And these are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites in the hill-country of Seir:",,,,,,,
1014,"These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath.",,,,,,,
1015,"The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.",,,,,,,
1016,"And Eliphaz, the son of Esau, had connection with a woman named Timna, who gave birth to Amalek: all these were the children of Esau's wife Adah.",,,,,,,
1017,"And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: they were the children of Esau's wife Basemath.",,,,,,,
1018,"And these are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon: she was the mother of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.",,,,,,,
1019,"These were the chiefs among the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's first son: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,",,,,,,,
1020,"Korah, Gatam, Amalek: all these were chiefs in the land of Edom, the offspring of Eliphaz, the seed of Adah.",,,,,,,
1021,"And these are the sons of Esau's son Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, Mizzah: these were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom, the children of Esau's wife Basemath.",,,,,,,
1022,"And these are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah: these were the chiefs who came from Esau's wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah.",,,,,,,
1023,"These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs.",,,,,,,
1024,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite who were living in that country; Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,",,,,,,,
1025,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan: these are the chiefs of the Horites, offspring of Seir in the land of Edom.",,,,,,,
1026,The children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; Lotan's sister was Timna.,,,,,,,
1027,"And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.",,,,,,,
1028,"And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; that same Anah who made the discovery of the water-springs in the waste land, when he was looking after the asses of his father Zibeon.",,,,,,,
1029,And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah his daughter.,,,,,,,
1030,"These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.",,,,,,,
1031,"These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.",,,,,,,
1032,These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.,,,,,,,
1033,"These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,",,,,,,,
1034,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. Such were the Horite chiefs in their order in the land of Seir.",,,,,,,
1035,And these are the kings who were ruling in the land of Edom before there was any king over the children of Israel.,,,,,,,
1036,"Bela, son of Beor, was king in Edom, and the name of his chief town was Dinhabah.",,,,,,,
1037,"At his death, Jobab, son of Zerah of Bozrah, became king in his place.",,,,,,,
1038,"And at the death of Jobab, Husham, from the country of the Temanites, became king in his place.",,,,,,,
1039,"And at the death of Husham, Hadad, son of Bedad, who overcame the Midianites in the field of Moab, became king; his chief town was named Avith.",,,,,,,
1040,"And at the death of Hadad, Samlah of Masrekah became king.",,,,,,,
1041,"And at the death of Samlah, Shaul of Rehoboth by the River became king in his place.",,,,,,,
1042,"And at the death of Shaul, Baal-hanan, son of Achbor, became king.",,,,,,,
1043,"And at the death of Baal-hanan, Hadar became king in his place; his chief town was named Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel; she was the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.",,,,,,,
1044,"These are the names of the chiefs of Esau in the order of their families and their places: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,",,,,,,,

1046,"Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,",,,,,,,
1047,"Magdiel, Iram; these are the Edomite chiefs, in their places in their heritage; this is Esau, the father of the Edomites.Now Jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself, in the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
1048,"These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a boy seventeen years old, was looking after the flock, together with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph gave their father a bad account of them.",,,,,,,
1049,"Now the love which Israel had for Joseph was greater than his love for all his other children, because he got him when he was an old man: and he had a long coat made for him.",,,,,,,
1050,"And because his brothers saw that Joseph was dearer to his father than all the others, they were full of hate for him, and would not say a kind word to him.",,,,,,,
1051,"Now Joseph had a dream, and he gave his brothers an account of it, which made their hate greater than ever.",,,,,,,
1052,"And he said to them, Let me give you the story of my dream.",,,,,,,
1053,"We were in the field, getting the grain stems together, and my grain kept upright, and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine.",,,,,,,
1054,"And his brothers said to him, Are you to be our king? will you have authority over us? And because of his dream and his words, their hate for him became greater than ever.",,,,,,,
1055,"Then he had another dream, and gave his brothers an account of it, saying, I have had another dream: the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me.",,,,,,,
1056,"And he gave word of it to his father and his brothers; but his father protesting said, What sort of a dream is this? am I and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you?",,,,,,,
1057,And his brothers were full of envy; but his father kept his words in mind.,,,,,,,
1058,Now his brothers went to keep watch over their father's flock in Shechem.,,,,,,,
1059,"And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers with the flock in Shechem? come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I.",,,,,,,
1060,"And he said to him, Go now, and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is; then come back and give me word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.",,,,,,,
1061,"And a man saw him wandering in the country, and said to him, What are you looking for?",,,,,,,
1062,"And he said, I am looking for my brothers; please give me word of where they are keeping their flock.",,,,,,,
1063,"And the man said, They have gone away from here, for they said in my hearing, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan.",,,,,,,
1064,"But they saw him when he was a long way off, and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death;",,,,,,,
1065,"Saying to one another, See, here comes this dreamer.",,,,,,,
1066,"Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams.",,,,,,,
1067,"But Reuben, hearing these words, got him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life.",,,,,,,
1068,"Do not put him to a violent death, but let him be placed in one of the holes; this he said to keep him safe from their hands, with the purpose of taking him back to his father again.",,,,,,,
1069,"So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat which he had on;",,,,,,,
1070,And they took him and put him in the hole: now the hole had no water in it.,,,,,,,
1071,"Then seating themselves, they took their meal: and looking up, they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt, with spices and perfumes on their camels.",,,,,,,
1072,"And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood?",,,,,,,
1073,"Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price, and let us not put violent hands on him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers gave ear to him.",,,,,,,
1074,"And some traders from Midian went by; so pulling Joseph up out of the hole, they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver, and they took him to Egypt.",,,,,,,
1075,"Now when Reuben came back to the hole, Joseph was not there; and giving signs of grief,",,,,,,,
1076,"He went back to his brothers, and said, The child is gone; what am I to do?",,,,,,,
1077,"Then they took Joseph's coat, and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death,",,,,,,,
1078,"And they took the coat to their father, and said, We came across this; is it your son's coat or not?",,,,,,,
1079,"And he saw that it was, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has put him to death; without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end.",,,,,,,
1080,"Then Jacob, giving signs of grief, put on haircloth, and went on weeping for his son day after day.",,,,,,,
1081,"And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort, but he would not be comforted, saying with weeping, I will go down to the underworld to my son. So great was his father's sorrow for him.",,,,,,,
1082,"And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house.Now at that time, Judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of Adullam named Hirah.",,,,,,,
1083,"And there he saw the daughter of a certain man of Canaan named Shua, and took her as his wife.",,,,,,,
1084,"And she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Er.",,,,,,,
1085,"And again she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Onan.",,,,,,,
1086,"Then she had another son, to whom she gave the name Shelah; she was at Chezib when the birth took place.",,,,,,,
1087,"And Judah took a wife for his first son Er, and her name was Tamar.",,,,,,,
1088,"Now Er, Judah's first son, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death.",,,,,,,
1089,"Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife and do what it is right for a husband's brother to do; make her your wife and get offspring for your brother.",,,,,,,
1090,"But Onan, seeing that the offspring would not be his, went in to his brother's wife, but let his seed go on to the earth, so that he might not get offspring for his brother.",,,,,,,
1091,"And what he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death, like his brother.",,,,,,,
1092,"Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Go back to your father's house and keep yourself as a widow till my son Shelah becomes a man: for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers. So Tamar went bac",to her fath,r's,h,use,,,
1093,"And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah's wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him.",,,,,,,
1094,"And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting,",,,,,,,
1095,"She took off her widow's clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife.",,,,,,,
1096,"When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered.",,,,,,,
1097,"And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me as my price?",,,,,,,
1098,"And he said, I will give you a young goat from the flock. And she said, What will you give me as a sign till you send it?",,,,,,,
1099,"And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him.",,,,,,,
1100,Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widow's clothing.,,,,,,,
1101,"Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat, to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman: but she was not there.",,,,,,,
1102,"And he put questions to the men of the place, saying, Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There was no such woman there.",,,,,,,
1103,"So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there.",,,,,,,
1104,"And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman.",,,,,,,
1105,"Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned.",,,,,,,
1106,"And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick?",,,,,,,
1107,"Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her.",,,,,,,
1108,"And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body.",,,,,,,
1109,"And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first.",,,,,,,
1110,"But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself! So he was named Perez.",,,,,,,
1111,"And then his brother came out, with the red thread round his hand, and he was named Zerah.Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar the Egyptian, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house, got him for a price from the Ishmaelites who had taken",him there.,,,,,,
1112,"And the Lord was with Joseph, and he did well; and he was living in the house of his master the Egyptian.",,,,,,,
1113,"And his master saw that the Lord was with him, making everything he did go well.",,,,,,,
1114,"And having a high opinion of Joseph as his servant, he made him the overseer of his house and gave him control over all he had.",,,,,,,
1115,"And from the time when he made him overseer and gave him control of all his property, the blessing of the Lord was with the Egyptian, because of Joseph; the blessing of the Lord was on all he had, in the house and in the field.",,,,,,,
1116,"And he gave Joseph control of all his property, keeping no account of anything, but only the food which was put before him. Now Joseph was very beautiful in form and face.",,,,,,,
1117,"And after a time, his master's wife, looking on Joseph with desire, said to him, Be my lover.",,,,,,,
1118,"But he would not, and said to her, You see that my master keeps no account of what I do in his house, and has put all his property in my control;",,,,,,,
1119,"So that no one has more authority in this house than I have; he has kept nothing back from me but you, because you are his wife; how then may I do this great wrong, sinning against God?",,,,,,,
1120,"And day after day she went on requesting Joseph to come to her and be her lover, but he would not give ear to her.",,,,,,,
1121,Now one day he went into the house to do his work; and not one of the men of the house was inside.,,,,,,,
1122,"And pulling at his coat, she said, Come to my bed; but slipping out of his coat, he went running away.",,,,,,,
1123,"And when she saw that he had got away, letting her keep his coat,",,,,,,,
1124,"She sent for the men of her house and said to them, See, he has let a Hebrew come here and make sport of us; he came to my bed, and I gave a loud cry;",,,,,,,
1125,And hearing it he went running out without his coat.,,,,,,,
1126,"And she kept his coat by her, till his master came back.",,,,,,,
1127,"Then she gave him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me;",,,,,,,
1128,And when I gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat.,,,,,,,
1129,"And hearing his wife's account of what his servant had done, he became very angry.",,,,,,,
1130,"And Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, in the place where the king's prisoners were kept in chains, and he was there in the prison-house.",,,,,,,
1131,"But the Lord was with Joseph, and was good to him, and made the keeper of the prison his friend.",,,,,,,
1132,"And the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under Joseph's control, and he was responsible for whatever was done there.",,,,,,,
1133,"And the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care, because the Lord was with him; and the Lord made everything he did go well.Now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine, and the chief bread-mak",r in Pharaoh,s h,u,"e,",id s,met,ing a
1134,"And Pharaoh was angry with his two servants, with the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker;",,,,,,,
1135,"And he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army, in the same prison where Joseph himself was shut up.",,,,,,,
1136,"And the captain put them in Joseph's care, and he did what was needed for them; and they were kept in prison for some time.",,,,,,,
1137,"And these two had a dream on the same night; the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker of the king of Egypt, who were in prison, the two of them had dreams with a special sense.",,,,,,,
1138,And in the morning when Joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad.,,,,,,,
1139,"And he said to the servants of Pharaoh who were in prison with him, Why are you looking so sad?",,,,,,,
1140,"Then they said to him, We have had a dream, and no one is able to give us the sense. And Joseph said, Does not the sense of dreams come from God? what was your dream?",,,,,,,
1141,"Then the chief wine-servant gave Joseph an account of his dream, and said, In my dream I saw a vine before me;",,,,,,,
1142,"And on the vine were three branches; and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers, and from them came grapes ready for cutting.",,,,,,,
1143,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and crushing them into Pharaoh's cup, gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.",,,,,,,
1144,"Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three branches are three days;",,,,,,,
1145,"After three days Pharaoh will give you honour, and put you back into your place, and you will give him his cup as you did before, when you were his wine-servant.",,,,,,,
1146,"But keep me in mind when things go well for you, and be good to me and say a good word for me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison:",,,,,,,
1147,For truly I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews; and I have done nothing for which I might be put in prison.,,,,,,,
1148,"Now when the chief bread-maker saw that the first dream had a good sense, he said to Joseph, I had a dream; and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head;",,,,,,,
1149,And in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for Pharaoh; and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head.,,,,,,,
1150,"Then Joseph said, This is the sense of your dream: the three baskets are three days;",,,,,,,
1151,"After three days Pharaoh will take you out of prison, hanging you on a tree, so that your flesh will be food for birds.",,,,,,,
1152,"Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his servants; and he gave honour to the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker among the others.",,,,,,,
1153,And he put the chief wine-servant back in his old place; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.,,,,,,,
1154,"But the chief bread-maker was put to death by hanging, as Joseph had said.",,,,,,,
1155,"But the wine-servant did not keep Joseph in mind or give a thought to him.Now after two years had gone by, Pharaoh had a dream; and in his dream he was by the side of the Nile;",,,,,,,
1156,"And out of the Nile came seven cows, good-looking and fat, and their food was the river-grass.",,,,,,,
1157,"And after them seven other cows came out of the Nile, poor-looking and thin; and they were by the side of the other cows.",,,,,,,
1158,And the seven thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows. Then Pharaoh came out of his sleep.,,,,,,,
1159,"But he went to sleep again and had a second dream, in which he saw seven heads of grain, full and good, all on one stem.",,,,,,,
1160,"And after them came up seven other heads, thin and wasted by the east wind.",,,,,,,
1161,And the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads. And when Pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream.,,,,,,,
1162,"And in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent for all the wise men of Egypt and all the holy men, and put his dream before them, but no one was able to give him the sense of it.",,,,,,,
1163,"Then the chief wine-servant said to Pharaoh, The memory of my sin comes back to me now;",,,,,,,
1164,"Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army, together with the chief bread-maker;",,,,,,,
1165,"And we had a dream on the same night, the two of us, and the dreams had a special sense.",,,,,,,
1166,"And there was with us a young Hebrew, the captain's servant, and when we put our dreams before him, he gave us the sense of them.",,,,,,,
1167,"And it came about as he said: I was put back in my place, and the bread-maker was put to death by hanging.",,,,,,,
1168,"Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they took him quickly out of prison; and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed, he came before Pharaoh.",,,,,,,
1169,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have had a dream, and no one is able to give me the sense of it; now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you.",,,,,,,
1170,"Then Joseph said, Without God there will be no answer of peace for Pharaoh.",,,,,,,
1171,"Then Pharaoh said, In my dream I was by the side of the Nile:",,,,,,,
1172,"And out of the Nile came seven cows, fat and good-looking, and their food was the river-grass;",,,,,,,
1173,"Then after them came seven other cows, very thin and poor-looking, worse than any I ever saw in the land of Egypt;",,,,,,,
1174,And the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first;,,,,,,,
1175,And even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before. And so I came out of my sleep.,,,,,,,
1176,"And again in a dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stem:",,,,,,,
1177,"And then I saw seven other heads, dry, thin, and wasted by the east wind, coming up after them:",,,,,,,
1178,"And the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads; and I put this dream before the wise men, but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it.",,,,,,,
1179,"Then Joseph said, These two dreams have the same sense: God has made clear to Pharaoh what he is about to do.",,,,,,,
1180,"The seven fat cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years: the two have the same sense.",,,,,,,
1181,"The seven thin and poor-looking cows who came up after them are seven years; and the seven heads of grain, dry and wasted by the east wind, are seven years when there will be no food.",,,,,,,
1182,"As I said to Pharaoh before, God has made clear to him what he is about to do.",,,,,,,
1183,Seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in Egypt;,,,,,,,
1184,And after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food; and the memory of the good years will go from men's minds; and the land will be made waste by the bad years;,,,,,,,
1185,"And men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after, for it will be very bitter.",,,,,,,
1186,"And this dream came to Pharaoh twice, because this thing is certain, and God will quickly make it come about.",,,,,,,
1187,"And now let Pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense, and put him in authority over the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1188,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him put overseers over the land of Egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years.",,,,,,,
1189,"And let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under Pharaoh's control for the use of the towns, and let them keep it.",,,,,,,
1190,And let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in Egypt; so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food.,,,,,,,
1191,And this seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.,,,,,,,
1192,"Then Pharaoh said to his servants, Where may we get such a man as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?",,,,,,,
1193,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Seeing that God has made all this clear to you, there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you:",,,,,,,
1194,"You, then, are to be over my house, and all my people will be ruled by your word: only as king will I be greater than you.",,,,,,,
1195,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1196,"Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and he had him clothed with the best linen, and put a chain of gold round his neck;",,,,,,,
1197,"And he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages; and they went before him crying, Make way! So he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1198,"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1199,"And Pharaoh gave Joseph the name of Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, the priest of On, to be his wife. So Joseph went through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1200,"Now Joseph was thirty years old when he came before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before the face of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1201,Now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses.,,,,,,,
1202,"And Joseph got together all the food of those seven years, and made a store of food in the towns: the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town.",,,,,,,
1203,"So he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea; so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it, for it might not be measured.",,,,,,,
1204,"And before the time of need, Joseph had two sons, to whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, gave birth.",,,,,,,
1205,"And to the first he gave the name Manasseh, for he said, God has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my father's house.",,,,,,,
1206,"And to the second he gave the name Ephraim, for he said, God has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow.",,,,,,,
1207,And so the seven good years in Egypt came to an end.,,,,,,,
1208,Then came the first of the seven years of need as Joseph had said: and in every other land they were short of food; but in the land of Egypt there was bread.,,,,,,,
1209,"And when all the land of Egypt was in need of food, the people came crying to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to the people, Go to Joseph, and whatever he says to you, do it.",,,,,,,
1210,"And everywhere on the earth they were short of food; then Joseph, opening all his store-houses, gave the people of Egypt grain for money; so great was the need of food in the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1211,"And all lands sent to Egypt, to Joseph, to get grain, for the need was great over all the earth.Now Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are you looking at one another?",,,,,,,
1212,"And he said, I have had news that there is grain in Egypt: go down there and get grain for us, so that life and not death may be ours.",,,,,,,
1213,So Joseph's ten brothers went down to get grain from Egypt.,,,,,,,
1214,"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with them, for fear, as he said, that some evil might come to him.",,,,,,,
1215,And the sons of Israel came with all the others to get grain: for they were very short of food in the land of Canaan.,,,,,,,
1216,"Now Joseph was ruler over all the land, and it was he who gave out the grain to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brothers came before him and went down on their faces to the earth.",,,,,,,
1217,"And when Joseph saw his brothers, it was clear to him who they were, but he made himself strange to them, and talking roughly to them, said, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to get food.",,,,,,,
1218,"Now though Joseph saw that these were his brothers, they had no idea who he was.",,,,,,,
1219,"Then the memory of his dreams about them came back to Joseph, and he said to them, You have come secretly to see how poor the land is.",,,,,,,
1220,"And they said to him, Not so, my lord: your servants have come with money to get food.",,,,,,,
1221,"We are all one man's sons, we are true men; we have not come with any secret purpose.",,,,,,,
1222,"And he said to them, No, but you have come to see how poor the land is.",,,,,,,
1223,"Then they said, We your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; the youngest of us is now with our father, and one is dead.",,,,,,,
1224,"And Joseph said, It is as I said; you have come with some secret purpose;",,,,,,,
1225,"But in this way will you be put to the test: by the life of Pharaoh, you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here.",,,,,,,
1226,"Send one of your number to get your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are true; if not, by the life of Pharaoh, your purpose is certainly secret.",,,,,,,
1227,So he put them in prison for three days.,,,,,,,
1228,"And on the third day Joseph said to them, Do this, if you would keep your lives: for I am a god-fearing man:",,,,,,,
1229,"If you are true men, let one of you be kept in prison, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;",,,,,,,
1230,"And come back to me with your youngest brother, so that your words may be seen to be true, and you will not be put to death. This is what you are to do.",,,,,,,
1231,"And they said to one another, Truly, we did wrong to our brother, for we saw his grief of mind, and we did not give ear to his prayers; that is why this trouble has come on us.",,,,,,,
1232,"And Reuben said to them, Did I not say to you, Do the child no wrong? but you gave no attention; so now, punishment has come on us for his blood.",,,,,,,
1233,"They were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to Joseph, for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language.",,,,,,,
1234,"And turning away from them, he was overcome with weeping; then he went on talking to them again and took Simeon and put chains on him before their eyes.",,,,,,,
1235,"Then Joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain, and for every man's money to be put back into his bag, and for food to be given them for the journey: which was done.",,,,,,,
1236,Then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away.,,,,,,,
1237,"Now at their night's resting-place one of them, opening his bag to give his ass some food, saw his money in the mouth of the bag.",,,,,,,
1238,"And he said to his brothers, My money has been given back: it is in my bag; then their hearts became full of fear, and turning to one another they said, What is this which God has done to us?",,,,,,,
1239,"So when they came to Jacob their father, in the land of Canaan, they gave him an account of all their experiences, saying,",,,,,,,
1240,"The man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison, saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose.",,,,,,,
1241,"And we said to him, We are true men, we have no evil designs;",,,,,,,
1242,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is dead, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
1243,"And the ruler of the land said, In this way I may be certain that you are true men; let one of you be kept here with me, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;",,,,,,,
1244,"And come back to me with your youngest brother: then I will be certain that you are true men, and I will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land.",,,,,,,
1245,"And when they took the grain out of their bags, it was seen that every man's parcel of money was in his bag; and when they and their father saw the money, they were full of fear.",,,,,,,
1246,"And Jacob their father said to them, You have taken my children from me: Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin away; all these things have come on me.",,,,,,,
1247,"And Reuben said, Put my two sons to death if I do not come back to you with him; let him be in my care and I will give him safely back to you.",,,,,,,
1248,"And he said, I will not let my son go down with you; for his brother is dead and he is all I have: if evil overtakes him on the journey, then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow.Now the land was in bitter need of food.",,,,,,,
1249,"And when the grain which they had got in Egypt was all used up, their father said to them, Go again and get us a little food.",,,,,,,
1250,"And Judah said to him, The man said to us with an oath, You are not to come before me again without your brother.",,,,,,,
1251,"If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and get food:",,,,,,,
1252,"But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You are not to come before me if your brother is not with you.",,,,,,,
1253,"And Israel said, Why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother?",,,,,,,
1254,"And they said, The man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family, saying, Is your father still living? have you another brother? And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brot",er?,,,,,,
1255,"Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction.",,,,,,,
1256,"Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.",,,,,,,
1257,"Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now.",,,,,,,
1258,"Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts:",,,,,,,
1259,"And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error;",,,,,,,
1260,And take your brother and go back to the man:,,,,,,,
1261,"And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it.",,,,,,,
1262,"So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph.",,,,,,,
1263,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day.",,,,,,,
1264,"And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph's house.",,,,,,,
1265,"Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph's house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and",ur asses for,his,u,e.,,,
1266,"So they went up to Joseph's chief servant at the door of the house,",,,,,,,
1267,"And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food;",,,,,,,
1268,"And when we came to our night's resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man's money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back;",,,,,,,
1269,"As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags.",,,,,,,
1270,"Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them.",,,,,,,
1271,"And the servant took them into Joseph's house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food.",,,,,,,
1272,And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there.,,,,,,,
1273,"And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him.",,,,,,,
1274,"And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living?",,,,,,,
1275,"And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him.",,,,,,,
1276,"Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son.",,,,,,,
1277,"Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping.",,,,,,,
1278,"Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us.",,,,,,,
1279,"And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean.",,,,,,,
1280,"And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder.",,,,,,,
1281,"And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him.Then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house, saying, Put as much food into the men's bags as",will go into,the,",",and,put,ver,man'
1282,"And put my cup, my silver cup, in the youngest one's bag, with his money. So he did as Joseph said.",,,,,,,
1283,"And at dawn the men, with their asses, were sent away.",,,,,,,
1284,"And when they had gone only a little way out of the town, Joseph said to the servant who was over his house, Go after them; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you done evil in reward for good?",,,,,,,
1285,"Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future? Truly, you have done evil.",,,,,,,
1286,So he overtook them and said these words to them.,,,,,,,
1287,"And they said to him, Why does my lord say such words as these? far be it from your servants to do such a thing:",,,,,,,
1288,"See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house?",,,,,,,
1289,"If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants.",,,,,,,
1290,"And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible.",,,,,,,
1291,Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it.,,,,,,,
1292,"And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag.",,,,,,,
1293,Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town.,,,,,,,
1294,So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.,,,,,,,
1295,"And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret?",,,,,,,
1296,"And Judah said, What are we to say to my lord? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes? God has made clear the sin of your servants: now we are in your hands, we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen.",,,,,,,
1297,"Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace.",,,,,,,
1298,"Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us.",,,,,,,
1299,"My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother?",,,,,,,
1300,"And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father.",,,,,,,
1301,"And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him.",,,,,,,
1302,"And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death.",,,,,,,
1303,"But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again.",,,,,,,
1304,"And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words.",,,,,,,
1305,"And our father said, Go again and get us a little food.",,,,,,,
1306,"And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us.",,,,,,,
1307,"And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons;",,,,,,,
1308,"The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,",,,,,,,
1309,"If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld.",,,,,,,
1310,"If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one,",,,,,,,
1311,"When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld.",,,,,,,
1312,"For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.",,,,,,,
1313,"So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers.",,,,,,,
1314,"For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father?Then Joseph, unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him, gave orders for everyone to be sent away, and no one was present when he made",lear to his,rot,e,s w,o he,was,
1315,"And so loud was his weeping, that it came to the ears of the Egyptians and all Pharaoh's house.",,,,,,,
1316,"And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph: is my father still living? But his brothers were not able to give him an answer for they were troubled before him.",,,,,,,
1317,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me. And they came near, And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sent into Egypt.",,,,,,,
1318,"Now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away, because God sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives.",,,,,,,
1319,"For these two years have been years of need, and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain.",,,,,,,
1320,God sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation.,,,,,,,
1321,"So now it was not you who sent me here, but God: and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1322,"Now go quickly to my father, and say to him, Your son Joseph says, God has made me ruler over all the land of Egypt: come down to me straight away:",,,,,,,
1323,"The land of Goshen will be your living-place, and you will be near me; you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks and herds and all you have:",,,,,,,
1324,"And there I will take care of you, so that you and your family may not be in need, for there are still five bad years to come.",,,,,,,
1325,"Now truly, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth which says these things to you.",,,,,,,
1326,Give my father word of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have seen; and come back quickly with my father.,,,,,,,
1327,"Then, weeping, he took Benjamin in his arms, and Benjamin himself was weeping on Joseph's neck.",,,,,,,
1328,"Then he gave a kiss to all his brothers, weeping over them; and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him.",,,,,,,
1329,"And news of these things went through Pharaoh's house, and it was said that Joseph's brothers were come; and it seemed good to Pharaoh and his servants.",,,,,,,
1330,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;",,,,,,,
1331,"And get your father and your families and come back to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and the fat of the land will be your food.",,,,,,,
1332,"And say to them, This you are to do: take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and get your father and come back.",,,,,,,
1333,"And take no thought for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.",,,,,,,
1334,"And the children of Israel did as he said; and Joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by Pharaoh, and food for their journey.",,,,,,,
1335,To every one of them he gave three changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing.,,,,,,,
1336,"And to his father he sent ten asses with good things from Egypt on their backs, and ten she-asses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey.",,,,,,,
1337,"And he sent his brothers on their way, and said to them, See that you have no argument on the road.",,,,,,,
1338,"So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.",,,,,,,
1339,"And they said to him, Joseph is living, and is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And at this word Jacob was quite overcome, for he had no faith in it.",,,,,,,
1340,"And they gave him an account of everything Joseph had said to them; and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent for them, his spirit came back to him:",,,,,,,
1341,"And Israel said, It is enough: Joseph my son is still living; I will go and see him before my death.And Israel went on his journey with all he had, and came to Beer-sheba, where he made offerings to the God of his father Isaac.",,,,,,,
1342,"And God said to Israel in a night-vision, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
1343,"And he said, I am God, the God of your father: go down to Egypt without fear, for I will make a great nation of you there:",,,,,,,
1344,"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will see that you come back again, and at your death Joseph will put his hands on your eyes.",,,,,,,
1345,Then Jacob went on from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent for them.,,,,,,,
1346,"And they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, even Jacob and all his seed:",,,,,,,
1347,"His sons and his sons' sons, his daughters and his daughters' sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt.",,,,,,,
1348,"And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, even Jacob and all his sons: Reuben, Jacob's oldest son;",,,,,,,
1349,And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi;,,,,,,,
1350,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan;",,,,,,,
1351,"And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari;",,,,,,,
1352,And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah: but Er and Onan had come to their death in the land of Canaan; and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.,,,,,,,
1353,And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puah and Job and Shimron;,,,,,,,
1354,And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel;,,,,,,,
1355,"All these, together with his daughter Dinah, were the children of Leah, whom Jacob had by her in Paddan-aram; they were thirty-three in number.",,,,,,,
1356,"And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli;",,,,,,,
1357,"And the sons of Asher: Jimnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Sarah, their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.",,,,,,,
1358,"These are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and Jacob had these sixteen children by her.",,,,,,,
1359,The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.,,,,,,,
1360,"And Joseph had Manasseh and Ephraim in the land of Egypt, by Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On.",,,,,,,
1361,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.",,,,,,,
1362,"All these were the children of Rachel whom Jacob had by her, fourteen persons.",,,,,,,
1363,And the son of Dan was Hushim.,,,,,,,
1364,And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.,,,,,,,
1365,"These were the children of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, seven persons.",,,,,,,
1366,"All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, the offspring of his body, were sixty-six, without taking into account the wives of Jacob's sons.",,,,,,,
1367,And the sons of Joseph whom he had in Egypt were two. Seventy persons of the family of Jacob came into Egypt.,,,,,,,
1368,"Now he had sent Judah before him to Goshen, to get word from Joseph; and so they came to the land of Goshen.",,,,,,,
1369,"And Joseph got his carriage ready and went to Goshen for the meeting with his father; and when he came before him, he put his arms round his neck, weeping.",,,,,,,
1370,"And Israel said to Joseph, Now that I have seen you living again, I am ready for death.",,,,,,,
1371,"And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's people, I will go and give the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's people, from the land of Canaan, have come to me;",,,,,,,
1372,"And these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle, and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have.",,,,,,,
1373,"Now when Pharaoh sends for you and says, What is your business?",,,,,,,
1374,"You are to say, Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now, like our fathers; in this way you will be able to have the land of Goshen for yourselves; because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the Egyptians.Then Jose",h went to Ph,rao,",",and,said,My,fathe
1375,And he took five of his brothers to Pharaoh.,,,,,,,
1376,"And Pharaoh said to them, What is your business? And they said, Your servants are keepers of sheep, as our fathers were before us.",,,,,,,
1377,"And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to make a living in this land, because we have no grass for our flocks in the land of Canaan; so now let your servants make a place for themselves in the land of Goshen.",,,,,,,
1378,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Let them have the land of Goshen; and if there are any able men among them, put them over my cattle.",,,,,,,
1379,"And Jacob and his sons came to Joseph in Egypt, and when word of it came to the ears of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, he said to Joseph, Your father and brothers have come to you; all the land of Egypt is before you; let your father and your brothers have the",est of the l,nd,o,th,ir r,sti,g-pla
1380,"Then Joseph made his father Jacob come before Pharaoh, and Jacob gave him his blessing.",,,,,,,
1381,"And Pharaoh said to him, How old are you?",,,,,,,
1382,"And Jacob said, The years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty; small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life, and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers.",,,,,,,
1383,"And Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing, and went out from before him.",,,,,,,
1384,"And Joseph made a place for his father and his brothers, and gave them a heritage in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had given orders.",,,,,,,
1385,"And Joseph took care of his father and his brothers and all his father's people, giving them food for the needs of their families.",,,,,,,
1386,"Now there was no food to be had in all the land, so that all Egypt and Canaan were wasted from need of food.",,,,,,,
1387,"And all the money in Egypt and in the land of Canaan which had been given for grain, came into the hands of Joseph: and he put it in Pharaoh's house.",,,,,,,
1388,"And when all the money in Egypt and Canaan was gone, the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread; would you have us come to destruction before your eyes? for we have no more money.",,,,,,,
1389,"And Joseph said, Give me your cattle; I will give you grain in exchange for your cattle if your money is all gone.",,,,,,,
1390,"So they took their cattle to Joseph and he gave them bread in exchange for their horses and flocks and herds and asses, so all that year he gave them food in exchange for their cattle.",,,,,,,
1391,"And when that year was ended, they came to him in the second year, and said, We may not keep it from our lord's knowledge that all our money is gone, and all the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing more to give my lord but our bodies and our",and;,,,,,,
1392,"Are we to come to destruction before your eyes, we and our land? take us and our land and give us bread; and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh; and give us seed so that we may have life and the land may not become waste.",,,,,,,
1393,"So Joseph got all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian gave up his land in exchange for food, because of their great need; so all the land became Pharaoh's.",,,,,,,
1394,"And as for the people, he made servants of them, town by town, from one end of Egypt to the other.",,,,,,,
1395,"Only he did not take the land of the priests, for the priests had their food given them by Pharaoh, and having what Pharaoh gave them, they had no need to give up their land.",,,,,,,
1396,"Then Joseph said to the people, I have made you and your land this day the property of Pharaoh; here is seed for you to put in your fields.",,,,,,,
1397,"And when the grain is cut, you are to give a fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts will be yours for seed and food, and for your families and your little ones.",,,,,,,
1398,"And they said to him, Truly you have kept us from death; may we have grace in your eyes, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.",,,,,,,
1399,"Then Joseph made a law which is in force to this day, that Pharaoh was to have the fifth part; only the land of the priests did not become his.",,,,,,,
1400,"And so Israel was living among the Egyptians in the land of Goshen; and they got property there, and became very great in numbers and in wealth.",,,,,,,
1401,And Jacob was living in the land of Goshen for seventeen years; so the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.,,,,,,,
1402,"And the time of his death came near, and he sent for his son Joseph and said to him, If now I am dear to you, put your hand under my leg and take an oath that you will not put me to rest in Egypt;",,,,,,,
1403,"But when I go to my fathers, you are to take me out of Egypt and put me to rest in their last resting-place. And he said, I will do so.",,,,,,,
1404,"And he said, Take an oath to me; and he took an oath to him: and Israel gave worship on the bed's head.Now after these things, word came to Joseph that his father was ill: and he took with him his sons Manasseh and Ephraim.",,,,,,,
1405,"And when they said to Jacob, Your son Joseph is coming to see you: then Israel, getting all his strength together, had himself lifted up in his bed.",,,,,,,
1406,"And Jacob said to Joseph, God, the Ruler of all, came to me in a vision at Luz in the land of Canaan, and gave me his blessing,",,,,,,,
1407,"And said to me, Truly, I will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations: and I will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever.",,,,,,,
1408,"And now your two sons who came to birth in Egypt before I came to you here, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, in the same way as Reuben and Simeon are.",,,,,,,
1409,"And any other offspring which you have after them, will be yours, and will be named after their brothers in their heritage.",,,,,,,
1410,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, death overtook Rachel on the way, when we were still some distance from Ephrath; and I put her to rest there on the road to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.",,,,,,,
1411,"Then Israel, looking at Joseph's sons, said, Who are these?",,,,,,,
1412,"And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this land. And he said, Let them come near me, and I will give them a blessing.",,,,,,,
1413,"Now because Israel was old, his eyes were no longer clear, and he was not able to see. So he made them come near to him, and he gave them a kiss, folding them in his arms.",,,,,,,
1414,"And Israel said to Joseph, I had no hope of seeing your face again, but God in his mercy has let me see you and your children.",,,,,,,
1415,"Then Joseph took them from between his knees, and went down on his face to the earth.",,,,,,,
1416,"Then taking Ephraim with his right hand, Joseph put him at Israel's left side, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Israel's right side, placing them near him.",,,,,,,
1417,"And Israel, stretching out his right hand, put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands on purpose, for Manasseh was the older.",,,,,,,
1418,"And he gave Joseph a blessing, saying, May the God to whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, gave worship, the God who has taken care of me all my life till this day,",,,,,,,
1419,"The angel who has been my saviour from all evil, send his blessing on these children: and let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be given to them; and let them become a great nation in the earth.",,,,,,,
1420,"Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it did not seem right to him; and lifting his father's hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh.",,,,,,,
1421,"And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the older; put your right hand on his head.",,,,,,,
1422,"But his father would not, saying, I am doing it on purpose, my son; he will certainly become a nation and a great one; but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a great family of nations.",,,,,,,
1423,"So he gave them his blessing that day, saying, You will be the sign of blessing in Israel, for they will say, May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh; and he put Ephraim before Manasseh.",,,,,,,
1424,"Then Israel said to Joseph, Now my death is near; but God will be with you, guiding you back to the land of your fathers.",,,,,,,
1425,"And I have given you more than your brothers, even Shechem as your heritage, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.And Jacob sent for his sons, and said, Come together, all of you, so that I may give you news of your fate in future time",.,,,,,,
1426,"Come near, O sons of Jacob, and give ear to the words of Israel your father.",,,,,,,
1427,"Reuben, you are my oldest son, the first-fruit of my strength, first in pride and first in power:",,,,,,,
1428,"But because you were uncontrolled, the first place will not be yours; for you went up to your father's bed, even his bride-bed, and made it unclean.",,,,,,,
1429,Simeon and Levi are brothers; deceit and force are their secret designs.,,,,,,,
1430,"Take no part in their secrets, O my soul; keep far away, O my heart, from their meetings; for in their wrath they put men to death, and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded.",,,,,,,
1431,"A curse on their passion for it was bitter; and on their wrath for it was cruel. I will let their heritage in Jacob be broken up, driving them from their places in Israel.",,,,,,,

1448,"But their bows were broken by a strong one, and the cords of their arms were cut by the Strength of Jacob, by the name of the Stone of Israel:",,,,,,,
1449,"Even by the God of your father, who will be your help, and by the Ruler of all, who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high, blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth, blessings of the breasts and of the fertile body:",,,,,,,

1451,"Benjamin is a wolf, searching for meat: in the morning he takes his food, and in the evening he makes division of what he has taken.",,,,,,,
1452,"These are the twelve tribes of Israel: and these are the words their father said to them, blessing them; to every one he gave his blessing.",,,,,,,
1453,"And he gave orders to them, saying, Put me to rest with my people and with my fathers, in the hollow of the rock in the field of Ephron the Hittite,",,,,,,,
1454,"In the rock in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham got from Ephron the Hittite, to be his resting-place.",,,,,,,
1455,"There Abraham and Sarah his wife were put to rest, and there they put Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I put Leah to rest.",,,,,,,
1456,In the rock in the field which was got for a price from the people of Heth.,,,,,,,
1457,"And when Jacob had come to the end of these words to his sons, stretching himself on his bed, he gave up his spirit, and went the way of his people.And Joseph put his head down on his father's face, weeping and kissing him.",,,,,,,
1458,"And Joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge, to make his father's body ready, folding it in linen with spices, and they did so.",,,,,,,
1459,And the forty days needed for making the body ready went by: and there was weeping for him among the Egyptians for seventy days.,,,,,,,
1460,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph said to the servants of Pharaoh, If now you have love for me, say these words to Pharaoh:",,,,,,,
1461,"My father made me take an oath, saying, When I am dead, put me to rest in the place I have made ready for myself in the land of Canaan. So now let me go and put my father in his last resting-place, and I will come back again.",,,,,,,
1462,"And Pharaoh said, Go up and put your father to rest, as you gave your oath to him.",,,,,,,
1463,"So Joseph went up to put his father in his last resting-place; and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of Egypt,",,,,,,,
1464,"And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen.",,,,,,,
1465,"And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army.",,,,,,,
1466,"And they came to the grain-floor of Atad on the other side of Jordan, and there they gave the last honours to Jacob, with great and bitter sorrow, weeping for their father for seven days.",,,,,,,
1467,"And when the people of the land, the people of Canaan, at the grain-floor of Atad, saw their grief, they said, Great is the grief of the Egyptians: so the place was named Abel-mizraim, on the other side of Jordan.",,,,,,,
1468,So his sons did as he had given them orders to do:,,,,,,,
1469,"For they took him into the land of Canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah, which Abraham got with the field, for a resting-place, from Ephron the Hittite at Mamre.",,,,,,,
1470,"And when his father had been put to rest, Joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him, went back to Egypt.",,,,,,,
1471,"Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him.",,,,,,,
1472,"So they sent word to Joseph, saying, Your father, before his death, gave us orders, saying,",,,,,,,
1473,"You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father's God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weepin",.,,,,,,
1474,"Then his brothers went, and falling at his feet, said, Truly, we are your servants.",,,,,,,
1475,"And Joseph said, Have no fear: am I in the place of God?",,,,,,,
1476,"As for you, it was in your mind to do me evil, but God has given a happy outcome, the salvation of numbers of people, as you see today.",,,,,,,
1477,"So now, have no fear: for I will take care of you and your little ones. So he gave them comfort with kind words.",,,,,,,
1478,Now Joseph and all his father's family went on living in Egypt: and the years of Joseph's life were a hundred and ten.,,,,,,,
1479,"And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: and the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, came to birth on Joseph's knees.",,,,,,,
1480,"Then Joseph said to his brothers, The time of my death has come; but God will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.",,,,,,,
1481,"Then Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly give effect to his word, and you are to take my bones away from here.",,,,,,,
1482,"So Joseph came to his death, being a hundred and ten years old: and they made his body ready, and he was put in a chest in Egypt.Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt; every man and his family came with Jacob.",,,,,,,
1483,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;",,,,,,,
1484,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;",,,,,,,
1485,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.",,,,,,,
1486,All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons: and Joseph had come to Egypt before them.,,,,,,,
1487,"Then Joseph came to his end, and all his brothers, and all that generation.",,,,,,,
1488,"And the children of Israel were fertile, increasing very greatly in numbers and in power; and the land was full of them.",,,,,,,
1489,"Now a new king came to power in Egypt, who had no knowledge of Joseph.",,,,,,,
1490,"And he said to his people, See, the people of Israel are greater in number and in power than we are:",,,,,,,
1491,"Let us take care for fear that their numbers may become even greater, and if there is a war, they may be joined with those who are against us, and make an attack on us, and go up out of the land.",,,,,,,
1492,"So they put overseers of forced work over them, in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work. And they made store-towns for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.",,,,,,,
1493,"But the more cruel they were to them, the more their number increased, till all the land was full of them. And the children of Israel were hated by the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1494,And they gave the children of Israel even harder work to do:,,,,,,,
1495,"And made their lives bitter with hard work, making building-material and bricks, and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions.",,,,,,,
1496,"And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth (the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah),",,,,,,,
1497,"When you are looking after the Hebrew women in childbirth, if it is a son you are to put him to death; but if it is a daughter, she may go on living.",,,,,,,
1498,"But the women had the fear of God, and did not do as the king of Egypt said, but let the male children go on living.",,,,,,,
1499,"And the king of Egypt sent for the women, and said to them, Why have you done this, and let the male children go on living?",,,,,,,
1500,"And they said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are strong, and the birth takes place before we come to them.",,,,,,,
1501,And the blessing of God was on these women: and the people were increased in number and became very strong.,,,,,,,
1502,"And because the women who took care of the Hebrew mothers had the fear of God, he gave them families.",,,,,,,
1503,"And Pharaoh gave orders to all his people, saying, Every son who comes to birth is to be put into the river, but every daughter may go on living.Now a man of the house of Levi took as his wife a daughter of Levi.",,,,,,,
1504,"And she became with child and gave birth to a Son; and when she saw that he was a beautiful child, she kept him secretly for three months.",,,,,,,
1505,"And when she was no longer able to keep him secret, she made him a basket out of the stems of water-plants, pasting sticky earth over it to keep the water out; and placing the baby in it she put it among the plants by the edge of the Nile.",,,,,,,
1506,And his sister took her place at a distance to see what would become of him.,,,,,,,
1507,"Now Pharaoh's daughter came down to the Nile to take a bath, while her women were walking by the riverside; and she saw the basket among the river-plants, and sent her servant-girl to get it.",,,,,,,
1508,"And opening it, she saw the child, and he was crying. And she had pity on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.",,,,,,,
1509,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, May I go and get you one of the Hebrew women to give him the breast?",,,,,,,
1510,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and got the child's mother.",,,,,,,
1511,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take the child away and give it milk for me, and I will give you payment. And the woman took the child and gave it milk at her breast.",,,,,,,
1512,"And when the child was older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son, and she gave him the name Moses, Because, she said, I took him out of the water.",,,,,,,
1513,"Now when Moses had become a man, one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was; and he saw an Egyptian giving blows to a Hebrew, one of his people.",,,,,,,
1514,"And turning this way and that, and seeing no one, he put the Egyptian to death, covering his body with sand.",,,,,,,
1515,"And he went out the day after and saw two of the Hebrews fighting: and he said to him who was in the wrong, Why are you fighting your brother?",,,,,,,
1516,"And he said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? are you going to put me to death as you did the Egyptian? And Moses was in fear, and said, It is clear that the thing has come to light.",,,,,,,
1517,"Now when Pharaoh had news of this, he would have put Moses to death. But Moses went in flight from Pharaoh into the land of Midian: and he took his seat by a water-spring.",,,,,,,
1518,Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came to get water for their father's flock.,,,,,,,
1519,"And the keepers of the sheep came up and were driving them away; but Moses got up and came to their help, watering their flock for them.",,,,,,,
1520,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you have come back so quickly today?",,,,,,,
1521,"And they said, An Egyptian came to our help against the keepers of sheep and got water for us and gave it to the flock.",,,,,,,
1522,"And he said to his daughters, Where is he? why have you let the man go? make him come in and give him a meal.",,,,,,,
1523,And Moses was happy to go on living with the man; and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.,,,,,,,
1524,"And she gave birth to a son, to whom he gave the name Gershom: for he said, I have been living in a strange land.",,,,,,,
1525,"Now after a long time the king of Egypt came to his end: and the children of Israel were crying in their grief under the weight of their work, and their cry for help came to the ears of God.",,,,,,,
1526,And at the sound of their weeping the agreement which God had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob came to his mind.,,,,,,,
1527,"And God's eyes were turned to the children of Israel and he gave them the knowledge of himself.Now Moses was looking after the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he took the flock to the back of the waste land and came to Horeb",the mountai,of,G,d.,,,
1528,"And the angel of the Lord was seen by him in a flame of fire coming out of a thorn-tree: and he saw that the tree was on fire, but it was not burned up.",,,,,,,
1529,"And Moses said, I will go and see this strange thing, why the tree is not burned up,",,,,,,,
1530,"And when the Lord saw him turning to one side to see, God said his name out of the tree, crying, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
1531,"And he said, Do not come near: take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy.",,,,,,,
1532,"And he said, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses kept his face covered for fear of looking on God.",,,,,,,
1533,"And God said, Truly, I have seen the grief of my people in Egypt, and their cry because of their cruel masters has come to my ears; for I have knowledge of their sorrows;",,,,,,,
1534,"And I have come down to take them out of the hands of the Egyptians, guiding them out of that land into a good land and wide, into a land flowing with milk and honey; into the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and t",e Hivite and,the,J,bus,te.,,
1535,"For now, truly, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the cruel behaviour of the Egyptians to them.",,,,,,,
1536,"Come, then, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may take my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1537,"And Moses said to God, Who am I to go to Pharaoh and take the children of Israel out of Egypt?",,,,,,,
1538,"And he said, Truly I will be with you; and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you have taken the children of Israel out of Egypt, you will give worship to God on this mountain.",,,,,,,
1539,"And Moses said to God, When I come to the children of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you: and they say to me, What is his name? what am I to say to them?",,,,,,,
1540,"And God said to him, I AM WHAT I AM: and he said, Say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.",,,,,,,
1541,"And God went on to say to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my sign to all generations.",,,,,,,
1542,"Go and get together the chiefs of the children of Israel, and say to them, The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has been seen by me, and has said, Truly I have taken up your cause, because of what is done to you",n Egypt;,,,,,,
1543,"And I have said, I will take you up out of the sorrows of Egypt into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, into a land flowing with milk and honey.",,,,,,,
1544,"And they will give ear to your voice: and you, with the chiefs of Israel, will go to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has come to us: let us then go three days' journey into the waste land to make an offering",o the Lord o,r G,d,,,,
1545,And I am certain that the king of Egypt will not let you go without being forced.,,,,,,,
1546,But I will put out my hand and overcome Egypt with all the wonders which I will do among them: and after that he will let you go.,,,,,,,
1547,"And I will give this people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that when you go out you will go out with your hands full.",,,,,,,
1548,"For every woman will get from her neighbour and from the woman living in her house, ornaments of silver and gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and your daughters; you will take the best of their goods from the Egyptians.And Moses, ans","ering, said,",It,s,cer,ain,hat,they
1549,"And the Lord said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod.",,,,,,,
1550,"And he said, Put it down on the earth. And he put it down on the earth and it became a snake; and Moses went running from it.",,,,,,,
1551,"And the Lord said to Moses, Put out your hand and take it by the tail: (and he put out his hand and took a grip of it and it became a rod in his hand:)",,,,,,,
1552,"So that they may be certain that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has been seen by you.",,,,,,,
1553,"Then the Lord said to him again, Put your hand inside your clothing. And he put his hand inside his robe: and when he took it out it was like the hand of a leper, as white as snow.",,,,,,,
1554,"And he said, Put your hand inside your robe again. (And he put his hand into his robe again, and when he took it out he saw that it had become like his other flesh.)",,,,,,,
1555,"And if they do not have faith in you or give ear to the voice of the first sign, they will have faith in the second sign.",,,,,,,
1556,"And if they have no faith even in these two signs and will not give ear to your voice, then you are to take the water of the Nile and put it on the dry land: and the water you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.",,,,,,,
1557,"And Moses said to the Lord, O Lord, I am not a man of words; I have never been so, and am not now, even after what you have said to your servant: for talking is hard for me, and I am slow of tongue.",,,,,,,
1558,"And the Lord said to him, Who has made man's mouth? who takes away a man's voice or hearing, or makes him seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?",,,,,,,
1559,"So go now, and I will be with your mouth, teaching you what to say.",,,,,,,
1560,"And he said, O Lord, send, if you will, by the hand of anyone whom it seems good to you to send.",,,,,,,
1561,"And the Lord was angry with Moses, and said, Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? To my knowledge he is good at talking. And now he is coming out to you: and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart.",,,,,,,
1562,"Let him give ear to your voice, and you will put my words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his, teaching you what you have to do.",,,,,,,
1563,And he will do the talking for you to the people: he will be to you as a mouth and you will be to him as God.,,,,,,,
1564,And take in your hand this rod with which you will do the signs.,,,,,,,
1565,"And Moses went back to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go back now to my relations in Egypt and see if they are still living. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.",,,,,,,
1566,"And the Lord said to Moses in Midian, Go back to Egypt, for all the men are dead who were attempting to take your life.",,,,,,,
1567,And Moses took his wife and his sons and put them on an ass and went back to the land of Egypt: and he took the rod of God in his hand.,,,,,,,
1568,"And the Lord said to Moses, When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have given you power to do: but I will make his heart hard and he will not let the people go.",,,,,,,
1569,"And you are to say to Pharaoh, The Lord says, Israel is the first of my sons:",,,,,,,
1570,"And I said to you, Let my son go, so that he may give me worship; and you did not let him go: so now I will put the first of your sons to death.",,,,,,,
1571,"Now on the journey, at the night's resting-place, the Lord came in his way and would have put him to death.",,,,,,,
1572,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cutting off the skin of her son's private parts, and touching his feet with it, she said, Truly you are a husband of blood to me.",,,,,,,
1573,"So he let him go. Then she said, You are a husband of blood because of the circumcision.",,,,,,,
1574,"And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the waste land and you will see Moses. So he went and came across Moses at the mountain of God, and gave him a kiss.",,,,,,,
1575,"And Moses gave Aaron an account of all the words of the Lord which he had sent him to say, and of all the signs which he had given him orders to do.",,,,,,,
1576,Then Moses and Aaron went and got together all the chiefs of the children of Israel:,,,,,,,
1577,"And Aaron said to them all the words the Lord had said to Moses, and did the signs before all the people.",,,,,,,
1578,"And the people had faith in them; and hearing that the Lord had taken up the cause of the children of Israel and had seen their troubles, with bent heads they gave him worship.And after that, Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and said, The Lord, the God o","Israel, say",", L",t,my,eopl,go,so th
1579,"And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, to whose voice I am to give ear and let Israel go? I have no knowledge of the Lord and I will not let Israel go.",,,,,,,
1580,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews has come to us: let us then go three days' journey into the waste land to make an offering to the Lord our God, so that he may not send death on us by disease or the sword.",,,,,,,
1581,"And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people away from their work? get back to your work.",,,,,,,
1582,"And Pharaoh said, Truly, the people of the land are increasing in number, and you are keeping them back from their work.",,,,,,,
1583,"The same day Pharaoh gave orders to the overseers and those who were responsible for the work, saying,",,,,,,,
1584,Give these men no more dry stems for their brick- making as you have been doing; let them go and get the material for themselves.,,,,,,,
1585,"But see that they make the same number of bricks as before, and no less: for they have no love for work; and so they are crying out and saying, Let us go and make an offering to our God.",,,,,,,
1586,"Give the men harder work, and see that they do it; let them not give attention to false words.",,,,,,,
1587,"And the overseers of the people and their responsible men went out and said to the people, Pharaoh says, I will give you no more dry stems.",,,,,,,
1588,Go yourselves and get dry stems wherever you are able; for your work is not to be any less.,,,,,,,
1589,So the people were sent in all directions through the land of Egypt to get dry grass for stems.,,,,,,,
1590,"And the overseers went on driving them and saying, Do your full day's work as before when there were dry stems for you.",,,,,,,
1591,"And the responsible men of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's overseers had put over them, were given blows, and they said to them, Why have you not done your regular work, in making bricks as before?",,,,,,,
1592,"Then the responsible men of the children of Israel came to Pharaoh, protesting and saying, Why are you acting in this way to your servants?",,,,,,,
1593,"They give us no dry stems and they say to us, Make bricks: and they give your servants blows; but it is your people who are in the wrong.",,,,,,,
1594,"But he said, You have no love for work: that is why you say, Let us go and make an offering to the Lord.",,,,,,,
1595,"Go now, get back to your work; no dry stems will be given to you, but you are to make the full number of bricks.",,,,,,,
1596,"Then the responsible men of the children of Israel saw that they were purposing evil when they said, The number of bricks which you have to make every day will be no less than before.",,,,,,,
1597,"And they came face to face with Moses and Aaron, who were in their way when they came out from Pharaoh:",,,,,,,
1598,"And they said to them, May the Lord take note of you and be your judge; for you have given Pharaoh and his servants a bad opinion of us, putting a sword in their hands for our destruction.",,,,,,,
1599,"And Moses went back to the Lord and said, Lord, why have you done evil to this people? why have you sent me?",,,,,,,
1600,"For from the time when I came to Pharaoh to put your words before him, he has done evil to this people, and you have given them no help.And the Lord said to Moses, Now you will see what I am about to do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand he will be forced",o let them g,", d",i,ing,them,out,of hi
1601,"And God said to Moses, I am Yahweh:",,,,,,,
1602,"I let myself be seen by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God, the Ruler of all; but they had no knowledge of my name Yahweh.",,,,,,,
1603,"And I made an agreement with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their wanderings.",,,,,,,
1604,And truly my ears are open to the cry of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep under their yoke; and I have kept in mind my agreement.,,,,,,,
1605,"Say then to the children of Israel, I am Yahweh, and I will take you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians, and make you safe from their power, and will make you free by the strength of my arm after great punishments.",,,,,,,
1606,"And I will take you to be my people and I will be your God; and you will be certain that I am the Lord your God, who takes you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1607,"And I will be your guide into the land which I made an oath to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for your heritage: I am Yahweh.",,,,,,,
1608,"And Moses said these words to the children of Israel, but they gave no attention to him, because of the grief of their spirit and the cruel weight of their work.",,,,,,,
1609,"And the Lord said to Moses,",,,,,,,
1610,"Go in and say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he is to let the children of Israel go out of his land.",,,,,,,
1611,"And Moses, answering the Lord, said, See, the children of Israel will not give ear to me; how then will Pharaoh give ear to me, whose lips are unclean?",,,,,,,
1612,"And the word of the Lord came to Moses and Aaron, with orders for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1613,"These are the heads of their fathers' families: the sons of Reuben the oldest son of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben.",,,,,,,
1614,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan: these are the families of Simeon.",,,,,,,
1615,And these are the names of the sons of Levi in the order of their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari: and the years of Levi's life were a hundred and thirty-seven.,,,,,,,
1616,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, in the order of their families.",,,,,,,
1617,And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel: and the years of Kohath's life were a hundred and thirty-three.,,,,,,,
1618,"And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi: these are the families of the Levites, in the order of their generations.",,,,,,,
1619,"And Amram took Jochebed, his father's sister, as wife; and she gave birth to Aaron and Moses: and the years of Amram's life were a hundred and thirty-seven.",,,,,,,
1620,And the sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.,,,,,,,
1621,And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.,,,,,,,

1624,"And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel; and she gave birth to Phinehas. These are the heads of the families of the Levites, in the order of their families.",,,,,,,
1625,"These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt in their armies.",,,,,,,
1626,These are the men who gave orders to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of Egypt: these are the same Moses and Aaron.,,,,,,,
1627,"And on the day when the word of the Lord came to Moses in the land of Egypt,",,,,,,,
1628,"The Lord said to Moses, I am the Lord: say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, everything I am saying to you.",,,,,,,
1629,"And Moses said to the Lord, My lips are unclean; how is it possible that Pharaoh will give me a hearing?And the Lord said to Moses, See I have made you a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.",,,,,,,
1630,Say whatever I give you orders to say: and Aaron your brother will give word to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of his land.,,,,,,,
1631,"And I will make Pharaoh's heart hard, and my signs and wonders will be increased in the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1632,"But Pharaoh will not give ear to you, and I will put my hand on Egypt, and take my armies, my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt, after great punishments.",,,,,,,
1633,"And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord, when my hand is stretched out over Egypt, and I take the children of Israel out from among them.",,,,,,,
1634,"And Moses and Aaron did so: as the Lord gave them orders, so they did.",,,,,,,
1635,"And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they gave the Lord's word to Pharaoh.",,,,,,,
1636,"And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,",,,,,,,
1637,"If Pharaoh says to you, Let me see a wonder: then say to Aaron, Take your rod and put it down on the earth before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake.",,,,,,,
1638,"Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and they did as the Lord had said: and Aaron put his rod down on the earth before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a snake.",,,,,,,
1639,"Then Pharaoh sent for the wise men and the wonder-workers, and they, the wonder-workers of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.",,,,,,,
1640,"For every one of them put down his rod on the earth, and they became snakes: but Aaron's rod made a meal of their rods.",,,,,,,
1641,"But Pharaoh's heart was made hard, and he did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
1642,"And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh's heart is unchanged; he will not let the people go.",,,,,,,
1643,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning; when he goes out to the water, you will be waiting for him by the edge of the Nile, with the rod which was turned into a snake in your hand;",,,,,,,
1644,"And say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go so that they may give me worship in the waste land; but up to now you have not given ear to his words.",,,,,,,
1645,"So the Lord says, By this you may be certain that I am the Lord; see, by the touch of this rod in my hand the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood;",,,,,,,
1646,"And the fish in the Nile will come to destruction, and the river will send up a bad smell, and the Egyptians will not be able, for disgust, to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking.",,,,,,,
1647,"And the Lord said, Say to Aaron, Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the waters of Egypt, and over the rivers and the streams and the pools, and over every stretch of water, so that they may be turned to blood; and there will be blood through",ll the land,f E,y,"t,",n ve,sel,of w
1648,"And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had said; and when his rod had been lifted up and stretched out over the waters of the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, all the water in the Nile was turned to blood;",,,,,,,
1649,"And the fish in the Nile came to destruction, and a bad smell went up from the river, and the Egyptians were not able to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking; and there was blood through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1650,"And the wonder-workers of Egypt did the same with their secret arts: but Pharaoh's heart was made hard, and he would not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
1651,"Then Pharaoh went into his house, and did not take even this to heart.",,,,,,,
1652,"And all the Egyptians made holes round about the Nile to get drinking- water, for they were not able to make use of the Nile water.",,,,,,,
1653,"And seven days went past, after the Lord had put his hand on the Nile.And this is what the Lord said to Moses: Go to Pharaoh and say to him, The Lord says, Let my people go so that they may give me worship.",,,,,,,
1654,"And if you will not let them go, see, I will send frogs into every part of your land:",,,,,,,
1655,"The Nile will be full of frogs, and they will come up into your house and into your bedrooms and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and into your bread- basins.",,,,,,,
1656,The frogs will come up over you and your people and all your servants.,,,,,,,
1657,"And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the streams and the waterways and the pools, causing frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1658,"And when Aaron put out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs came up and all the land of Egypt was covered with them.",,,,,,,
1659,"And the wonder-workers did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up over the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1660,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Make prayer to the Lord that he will take away these frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go and make their offering to the Lord.",,,,,,,
1661,"And Moses said, I will let you have the honour of saying when I am to make prayer for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs may be sent away from you and your houses, and be only in the Nile.",,,,,,,
1662,"And he said, By tomorrow. And he said, Let it be as you say: so that you may see that there is no other like the Lord our God.",,,,,,,
1663,And the frogs will be gone from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people and will be only in the Nile.,,,,,,,
1664,Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses made prayer to the Lord about the frogs which he had sent on Pharaoh.,,,,,,,
1665,And the Lord did as Moses said; and there was an end of all the frogs in the houses and in the open spaces and in the fields.,,,,,,,
1666,"And they put them together in masses, and a bad smell went up from the land.",,,,,,,
1667,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was peace for a time, he made his heart hard and did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
1668,"And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1669,"And they did so; and Aaron, stretching out the rod in his hand, gave a touch to the dust of the earth, and insects came on man and on beast; all the dust of the earth was changed into insects through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1670,"And the wonder-workers with their secret arts, attempting to make insects, were unable to do so: and there were insects on man and on beast.",,,,,,,
1671,"Then the wonder-workers said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: but Pharaoh's heart was hard, and he did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
1672,"And the Lord said to Moses, Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh when he comes out to the water; and say to him, This is what the Lord says: Let my people go to give me worship.",,,,,,,
1673,"For if you do not let my people go, see, I will send clouds of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into their houses; and the houses of the Egyptians and the land where they are will be full of flies.",,,,,,,
1674,"And at that time I will make a division between your land and the land of Goshen where my people are, and no flies will be there; so that you may see that I am the Lord over all the earth.",,,,,,,
1675,And I will put a division between my people and your people; tomorrow this sign will be seen.,,,,,,,
1676,"And the Lord did so; and great clouds of flies came into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses, and all the land of Egypt was made waste because of the flies.",,,,,,,
1677,"And Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Go and make your offering to your God here in the land.",,,,,,,
1678,"And Moses said, It is not right to do so; for we make our offerings of that to which the Egyptians give worship; and if we do so before their eyes, certainly we will be stoned.",,,,,,,
1679,But we will go three days' journey into the waste land and make an offering to the Lord our God as he may give us orders.,,,,,,,
1680,"Then Pharaoh said, I will let you go to make an offering to the Lord your God in the waste land; but do not go very far away, and make prayer for me.",,,,,,,
1681,"And Moses said, When I go out from you I will make prayer to the Lord that the cloud of flies may go away from Pharaoh and from his people and from his servants tomorrow: only let Pharaoh no longer by deceit keep back the people from making their offerin",to the Lord,,,,,,
1682,Then Moses went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord.,,,,,,,
1683,"And the Lord did as Moses said, and took away the cloud of flies from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people; not one was to be seen.",,,,,,,
1684,"But again Pharaoh made his heart hard and did not let the people go.Then the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so that they may give me worship.",,,,,,,
1685,"For if you will not let them go, but still keep them in your power,",,,,,,,
1686,"Then the hand of the Lord will put on your cattle in the field, on the horses and the asses and the camels, on the herds and the flocks, a very evil disease.",,,,,,,
1687,And the Lord will make a division between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; there will be no loss of any of the cattle of Israel.,,,,,,,
1688,"And the time was fixed by the Lord, and he said, Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.",,,,,,,
1689,"And on the day after, the Lord did as he had said, causing the death of all the cattle of Egypt, but there was no loss of any of the cattle of Israel.",,,,,,,
1690,And Pharaoh sent and got word that there was no loss of any of the cattle of Israel. But the heart of Pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go.,,,,,,,
1691,"And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take in your hand a little dust from the fire and let Moses send it in a shower up to heaven before the eyes of Pharaoh.",,,,,,,
1692,"And it will become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and will be a skin-disease bursting out in wounds on man and beast through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1693,"So they took some dust from the fire, and placing themselves before Pharaoh, Moses sent it out in a shower up to heaven; and it became a skin-disease bursting out on man and on beast.",,,,,,,
1694,"And the wonder-workers were not able to take their places before Moses, because of the disease; for the disease was on the wonder-workers and on all the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1695,"And the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he would not give ear to them, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
1696,"And the Lord said to Moses, Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh, and say to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so that they may give me worship.",,,,,,,
1697,For this time I will send all my punishments on yourself and on your servants and on your people; so that you may see that there is no other like me in all the earth.,,,,,,,
1698,"For if I had put the full weight of my hand on you and your people, you would have been cut off from the earth:",,,,,,,
1699,"But, for this very reason, I have kept you from destruction, to make clear to you my power, and so that my name may be honoured through all the earth.",,,,,,,
1700,Are you still uplifted in pride against my people so that you will not let them go?,,,,,,,
1701,"Truly, tomorrow about this time I will send down an ice-storm, such as never was in Egypt from its earliest days till now.",,,,,,,
1702,"Then send quickly and get in your cattle and all you have from the fields; for if any man or beast in the field has not been put under cover, the ice-storm will come down on them with destruction.",,,,,,,
1703,"Then everyone among the servants of Pharaoh who had the fear of the Lord, made his servants and his cattle come quickly into the house:",,,,,,,
1704,"And he who gave no attention to the word of the Lord, kept his servants and his cattle in the field.",,,,,,,
1705,"And the Lord said to Moses, Now let your hand be stretched out to heaven so that there may be an ice-storm on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field through all the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1706,"And Moses put out his rod to heaven: and the Lord sent thunder, and an ice-storm, and fire running down on the earth; the Lord sent an ice-storm on the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1707,"So there was an ice-storm with fire running through it, coming down with great force, such as never was in all the land of Egypt from the time when it became a nation.",,,,,,,
1708,"And through all the land of Egypt the ice-storm came down on everything which was in the fields, on man and on beast; and every green plant was crushed and every tree of the field broken.",,,,,,,
1709,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no ice-storm.",,,,,,,
1710,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have done evil this time: the Lord is upright, and I and my people are sinners.",,,,,,,
1711,Make prayer to the Lord; for there has been enough of these thunderings of God and this ice-storm; and I will let you go and will keep you no longer.,,,,,,,
1712,"And Moses said, When I am gone outside the town, my hands will be stretched out to the Lord; the thunders and the ice-storm will come to an end, so that you may see that the earth is the Lord's.",,,,,,,
1713,"But as for you and your servants, I am certain that even now the fear of the Lord God will not be in your hearts.",,,,,,,
1714,"And the flax and the barley were damaged, for the barley was almost ready to be cut and the flax was in flower.",,,,,,,
1715,"But the rest of the grain-plants were undamaged, for they had not come up.",,,,,,,
1716,"So Moses went out of the town, and stretching out his hands made prayer to God: and the thunders and the ice-storm came to an end; and the fall of rain was stopped.",,,,,,,
1717,"But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the ice-storm and the thunders were ended, he went on sinning, and made his heart hard, he and his servants.",,,,,,,
1718,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he did not let the people go, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Moses.And the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have made his heart and the hearts of his servants hard, so that I may let my signs be see",among them:,,,,,,
1719,"And so that you may be able to give to your son and to your son's son the story of my wonders in Egypt, and the signs which I have done among them; so that you may see that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
1720,"Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: How long will you be lifted up in your pride before me? let my people go so that they may give me worship.",,,,,,,
1721,"For if you will not let my people go, tomorrow I will send locusts into your land:",,,,,,,
1722,"And the face of the earth will be covered with them, so that you will not be able to see the earth: and they will be the destruction of everything which up to now has not been damaged, everything which was not crushed by the ice-storm, and every tree sti",l living in,our,f,eld,.,,
1723,"And your houses will be full of them, and the houses of your servants and of all the Egyptians; it will be worse than anything your fathers have seen or their fathers, from the day when they were living on the earth till this day. And so he went out from",Pharaoh.,,,,,,
1724,"And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long is this man to be the cause of evil to us? let the men go so that they may give worship to the Lord their God: are you not awake to Egypt's danger?",,,,,,,
1725,"Then Moses and Aaron came in again before Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go and give worship to the Lord your God: but which of you are going?",,,,,,,
1726,"And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds; for we are to keep a feast to the Lord.",,,,,,,
1727,"And he said to them, May the Lord be with you, if I will let you and your little ones go! take care, for your purpose clearly is evil.",,,,,,,
1728,"Not so; but let your males go and give worship to the Lord, as your desire is. This he said, driving them out from before him.",,,,,,,
1729,"And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the land of Egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land, even everything untouched by the ice-storm.",,,,,,,
1730,"And Moses' rod was stretched out over the land of Egypt, and the Lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night; and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind.",,,,,,,
1731,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, resting on every part of the land, in very great numbers; such an army of locusts had never been seen before, and never will be again.",,,,,,,
1732,"For all the face of the earth was covered with them, so that the land was black; and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the ice-storm they took for food: not one green thing, no plant or tree, was to be seen in all th",land of Egy,t.,,,,,
1733,"Then Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and said, I have done evil against the Lord your God and against you.",,,,,,,
1734,"Let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only, and make prayer to the Lord your God that he will take away from me this death only.",,,,,,,
1735,So he went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord.,,,,,,,
1736,"And the Lord sent a very strong west wind, which took up the locusts, driving them into the Red Sea; not one locust was to be seen in any part of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1737,"But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he did not let the children of Israel go.",,,,,,,
1738,"And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out to heaven, and all the land of Egypt will be dark, so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark.",,,,,,,
1739,"And when Moses' hand was stretched out, dark night came over all the land of Egypt for three days;",,,,,,,
1740,"They were not able to see one another, and no one got up from his place for three days: but where the children of Israel were living it was light.",,,,,,,
1741,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses, and said, Go and give worship to the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be kept here: your little ones may go with you.",,,,,,,
1742,"But Moses said, You will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the Lord our God.",,,,,,,
1743,"So our cattle will have to go with us, not one may be kept back; for they are needed for the worship of the Lord our God; we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place.",,,,,,,
1744,"But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he would not let them go.",,,,,,,
1745,"And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me, take care that you come not again before me; for the day when you see my face again will be your last.",,,,,,,
1746,"And Moses said, You say truly; I will not see your face again.And the Lord said to Moses, I will send one more punishment on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go; and when he does let you go, he will not keep one of you back, but will send",you out by f,rce,,,,,
1747,So go now and give orders to the people that every man and every woman is to get from his or her neighbour ornaments of silver and of gold.,,,,,,,
1748,"And the Lord gave the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians. For the man Moses was highly honoured in the land of Egypt, by Pharaoh's servants and the people.",,,,,,,
1749,"And Moses said, This is what the Lord says: About the middle of the night I will go out through Egypt:",,,,,,,
1750,"And death will come to every mother's first male child in all the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power, to the child of the servant-girl crushing the grain; and the first births of all the cattle.",,,,,,,
1751,"And there will be a great cry through all the land of Egypt, such as never has been or will be again.",,,,,,,
1752,"But against the children of Israel, man or beast, not so much as the tongue of a dog will be moved: so that you may see how the Lord makes a division between Israel and the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1753,"And all these your servants will come to me, going down on their faces before me and saying, Go out, and all your people with you: and after that I will go out. And he went away from Pharaoh burning with wrath.",,,,,,,
1754,"And the Lord said to Moses, Pharaoh will not give ear to you, so that my wonders may be increased in the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1755,"All these wonders Moses and Aaron did before Pharaoh: but the Lord made Pharaoh's heart hard, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,",,,,,,,
1756,"Let this month be to you the first of months, the first month of the year.",,,,,,,
1757,"Say to all the children of Israel when they are come together, In the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb, by the number of their fathers' families, a lamb for every family:",,,,,,,
1758,"And if the lamb is more than enough for the family, let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them, taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man.",,,,,,,
1759,"Let your lamb be without a mark, a male in its first year: you may take it from among the sheep or the goats:",,,,,,,
1760,"Keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month, when everyone who is of the children of Israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark.",,,,,,,
1761,Then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken.,,,,,,,
1762,"And let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb, cooked with fire in the oven, together with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants.",,,,,,,
1763,"Do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water, but let it be cooked in the oven; its head with its legs and its inside parts.",,,,,,,
1764,Do not keep any of it till the morning; anything which is not used is to be burned with fire.,,,,,,,
1765,"And take your meal dressed as if for a journey, with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands: take it quickly: it is the Lord's Passover.",,,,,,,
1766,"For on that night I will go through the land of Egypt, sending death on every first male child, of man and of beast, and judging all the gods of Egypt: I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
1767,"And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are: when I see the blood I will go over you, and no evil will come on you for your destruction, when my hand is on the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1768,"And this day is to be kept in your memories: you are to keep it as a feast to the Lord through all your generations, as an order for ever.",,,,,,,
1769,"For seven days let your food be unleavened bread; from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses: whoever takes bread with leaven in it, from the first till the seventh day, will be cut off from Israel.",,,,,,,
1770,And on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting; no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyone's food.,,,,,,,
1771,"So keep the feast of unleavened bread; for on this very day I have taken your armies out of the land of Egypt: this day, then, is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever.",,,,,,,
1772,"In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day, let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.",,,,,,,
1773,"For seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses: for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of Israel, if he is from another country or if he is an Israelite by birth.",,,,,,,
1774,Take nothing which has leaven in it; wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes.,,,,,,,
1775,"Then Moses sent for the chiefs of Israel, and said to them, See that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families, and let the Passover lamb be put to death.",,,,,,,
1776,"And take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin, touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin; and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning.",,,,,,,
1777,"For the Lord will go through the land, sending death on the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door, the Lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction.",,,,,,,
1778,And you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever.,,,,,,,
1779,"And when you come into the land which the Lord will make yours, as he gave his word, you are to keep this act of worship.",,,,,,,
1780,"And when your children say to you, What is the reason of this act of worship?",,,,,,,
1781,"Then you will say, This is the offering of the Lord's Passover; for he went over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he sent death on the Egyptians, and kept our families safe. And the people gave worship with bent heads.",,,,,,,
1782,"And the children of Israel went and did so; as the Lord had given orders to Moses and Aaron, so they did.",,,,,,,
1783,"And in the middle of the night the Lord sent death on every first male child in the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison; and the first births of all the cattle.",,,,,,,
1784,"Then Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and a great cry went up from Egypt; for there was not a house where someone was not dead.",,,,,,,
1785,"And he sent for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Get up and go out from among my people, you and the children of Israel; go and give worship to the Lord as you have said.",,,,,,,
1786,"And take your flocks and your herds as you have said, and be gone; and give me your blessing.",,,,,,,
1787,"And the Egyptians were forcing the people on, to get them out of the land quickly; for they said, We are all dead men.",,,,,,,
1788,"And the people took their bread-paste before it was leavened, putting their basins in their clothing on their backs.",,,,,,,
1789,"And the children of Israel had done as Moses had said; and they got from the Egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold, and clothing:",,,,,,,
1790,And the Lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested. So they took away all their goods from the Egyptians.,,,,,,,
1791,"And the children of Israel made the journey from Rameses to Succoth; there were about six hundred thousand men on foot, as well as children.",,,,,,,
1792,And a mixed band of people went with them; and flocks and herds in great numbers.,,,,,,,
1793,"And they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of Egypt; it was not leavened, for they had been sent out of Egypt so quickly, that they had no time to make any food ready.",,,,,,,
1794,Now the children of Israel had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years.,,,,,,,
1795,"And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the armies of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1796,"It is a watch-night before the Lord who took them out of the land of Egypt: this same night is a watch-night to the Lord for all the children of Israel, through all their generations.",,,,,,,
1797,"And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the Passover: no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it:",,,,,,,
1798,"But every man's servant, whom he has got for money, may take of it, when he has had circumcision.",,,,,,,
1799,"A man from a strange country living among you, and a servant working for payment, may not take part in it.",,,,,,,
1800,"It is to be taken in one house; not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house, and no bone of it may be broken.",,,,,,,
1801,All Israel is to keep the feast.,,,,,,,
1802,"And if a man from another country is living with you, and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all the males of his family undergo circumcision, and then let him come near and keep it; for he will then be as one of your people; but no one w",thout circum,isi,n,may,keep,it.,
1803,The law is the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you.,,,,,,,
1804,So the children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses and Aaron.,,,,,,,
1805,"And on that very day the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.And the Lord said to Moses,",,,,,,,
1806,"Let the first male child of every mother among the children of Israel be kept holy for me, even the first male birth among man or beast; for it is mine.",,,,,,,
1807,"And Moses said to the people, Let this day, on which you came out of Egypt, out of your prison-house, be kept for ever in memory; for by the strength of his hand the Lord has taken you out from this place; let no leavened bread be used.",,,,,,,
1808,"On this day, in the month Abib, you are going out.",,,,,,,
1809,"And it will be that, when the Lord takes you into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, the land which he made an oath to your fathers that he would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you wi",l do this ac,of,w,rsh,p in,thi,mont
1810,For seven days let your food be unleavened cakes; and on the seventh day there is to be a feast to the Lord.,,,,,,,
1811,"Unleavened cakes are to be your food through all the seven days; let no leavened bread be seen among you, or any leaven, in any part of your land.",,,,,,,
1812,"And you will say to your son in that day, It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1813,"And this will be for a sign to you on your hand and for a mark on your brow, so that the law of the Lord may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand the Lord took you out of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1814,"So let this order be kept, at the right time, from year to year.",,,,,,,
1815,"And when the Lord takes you into the land of Canaan, as he made his oath to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,",,,,,,,
1816,"You are to put on one side for the Lord every mother's first male child, the first-fruit of her body, and the first young one of every beast; every male is holy to the Lord.",,,,,,,
1817,"And for the young of an ass you may give a lamb in payment, or if you will not make payment for it, its neck is to be broken; but for all the first sons among your children, let payment be made.",,,,,,,
1818,"And when your son says to you in time to come, What is the reason for this? say to him, By the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt, out of the prison-house:",,,,,,,
1819,"And when Pharaoh made his heart hard and would not let us go, the Lord sent death on all the first sons in Egypt, of man and of beast: and so every first male who comes to birth is offered to the Lord; but for all the first of my sons I give a price.",,,,,,,
1820,And this will be for a sign on your hand and for a mark on your brow: for by the strength of his hand the Lord took us out of Egypt.,,,,,,,
1821,"Now after Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not take them through the land of the Philistines, though that was near: for God said, If the people see war, they may have a change of heart and go back to Egypt.",,,,,,,
1822,But God took the people round by the waste land near the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up in fighting order out of the land of Egypt.,,,,,,,
1823,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, God will certainly keep you in mind; and you are to take my bones away with you.",,,,,,,
1824,"Then they went on their journey from Succoth, and put up their tents in Etham at the edge of the waste land.",,,,,,,
1825,"And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, guiding them on their way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light: so that they were able to go on day and night:",,,,,,,
1826,"The pillar of cloud went ever before them by day, and the pillar of fire by night.And the Lord said to Moses,",,,,,,,
1827,"Give orders to the children of Israel to go back and put up their tents before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon, opposite to which you are to put up your tents by the sea.",,,,,,,
1828,"And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are wandering without direction, they are shut in by the waste land.",,,,,,,
1829,"And I will make Pharaoh's heart hard, and he will come after them and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and all his army, so that the Egyptians may see that I am the Lord. And they did so.",,,,,,,
1830,"And word came to Pharaoh of the flight of the people: and the feeling of Pharaoh and of his servants about the people was changed, and they said, Why have we let Israel go, so that they will do no more work for us?",,,,,,,
1831,So he had his war-carriage made ready and took his people with him:,,,,,,,
1832,"And he took six hundred carriages, all the carriages of Egypt, and captains over all of them.",,,,,,,
1833,"And the Lord made the heart of Pharaoh hard, and he went after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel had gone out without fear.",,,,,,,
1834,"But the Egyptians went after them, all the horses and carriages of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them in their tents by the sea, by Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.",,,,,,,
1835,"And when Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel, lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians coming after them, and were full of fear; and their cry went up to God.",,,,,,,
1836,"And they said to Moses, Was there no resting-place for the dead in Egypt, that you have taken us away to come to our death in the waste land? why have you taken us out of Egypt?",,,,,,,
1837,"Did we not say to you in Egypt, Let us be as we are, working for the Egyptians? for it is better to be the servants of the Egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land.",,,,,,,
1838,"But Moses said, Keep where you are and have no fear; now you will see the salvation of the Lord which he will give you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.",,,,,,,
1839,"The Lord will make war for you, you have only to keep quiet.",,,,,,,
1840,"And the Lord said to Moses, Why are you crying out to me? give the children of Israel the order to go forward.",,,,,,,
1841,"And let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea, and it will be parted in two; and the children of Israel will go through on dry land.",,,,,,,
1842,"And I will make the heart of the Egyptians hard, and they will go in after them: and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and over his army, his war-carriages, and his horsemen.",,,,,,,
1843,"And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord, when I get honour over Pharaoh and his war-carriages and his horsemen.",,,,,,,
1844,"Then the angel of God, who had been before the tents of Israel, took his place at their back; and the pillar of cloud, moving from before them, came to rest at their back:",,,,,,,
1845,"And it came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel; and there was a dark cloud between them, and they went on through the night; but the one army came no nearer to the other all the night.",,,,,,,
1846,"And when Moses' hand was stretched out over the sea, the Lord with a strong east wind made the sea go back all night, and the waters were parted in two and the sea became dry land.",,,,,,,
1847,And the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land: and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left.,,,,,,,
1848,"Then the Egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses and his war-carriages and his horsemen.",,,,,,,
1849,"And in the morning watch, the Lord, looking out on the armies of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, sent trouble on the army of the Egyptians;",,,,,,,
1850,"And made the wheels of their war-carriages stiff, so that they had hard work driving them: so the Egyptians said, Let us go in flight from before the face of Israel, for the Lord is fighting for them against the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1851,"And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the sea, and the waters will come back again on the Egyptians, and on their war-carriages and on their horsemen.",,,,,,,
1852,"And when Moses' hand was stretched out over the sea, at dawn the sea came flowing back, meeting the Egyptians in their flight, and the Lord sent destruction on the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.",,,,,,,
1853,"And the waters came back, covering the war-carriages and the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh which went after them into the middle of the sea; not one of them was to be seen.",,,,,,,
1854,"But the children of Israel went through the sea walking on dry land, and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left.",,,,,,,
1855,So that day the Lord gave Israel salvation from the hands of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea's edge.,,,,,,,
1856,"And Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done against the Egyptians, and the fear of the Lord came on the people and they had faith in the Lord and in his servant Moses.Then Moses and the children of Israel made this song to the Lord, and said, I",will make a,ong,t,th,Lor,", f",r he
1857,"The Lord is my strength and my strong helper, he has become my salvation: he is my God and I will give him praise; my father's God and I will give him glory.",,,,,,,
1858,The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.,,,,,,,
1859,Pharaoh's war-carriages and his army he has sent down into the sea: the best of his captains have gone down into the Red Sea.,,,,,,,
1860,They were covered by the deep waters: like a stone they went down under the waves.,,,,,,,
1861,"Full of glory, O Lord, is the power of your right hand; by your right hand those who came against you are broken.",,,,,,,
1862,"When you are lifted up in power, all those who come against you are crushed: when you send out your wrath, they are burned up like dry grass.",,,,,,,
1863,"By your breath the waves were massed together, the flowing waters were lifted up like a pillar; the deep waters became solid in the heart of the sea.",,,,,,,
1864,"Egypt said, I will go after them, I will overtake, I will make division of their goods: my desire will have its way with them; my sword will be uncovered, my hand will send destruction on them.",,,,,,,
1865,You sent your wind and the sea came over them: they went down like lead into the great waters.,,,,,,,
1866,"Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods? who is like you, in holy glory, to be praised with fear, doing wonders?",,,,,,,
1867,"When your right hand was stretched out, the mouth of the earth was open for them.",,,,,,,
1868,In your mercy you went before the people whom you have made yours; guiding them in your strength to your holy place.,,,,,,,
1869,Hearing of you the peoples were shaking in fear: the people of Philistia were gripped with pain.,,,,,,,
1870,The chiefs of Edom were troubled in heart; the strong men of Moab were in the grip of fear: all the people of Canaan became like water.,,,,,,,
1871,"Fear and grief came on them; by the strength of your arm they were turned to stone; till your people went over, O Lord, till the people went over whom you have made yours.",,,,,,,
1872,"You will take them in, planting them in the mountain of your heritage, the place, O Lord, where you have made your house, the holy place, O Lord, the building of your hands.",,,,,,,
1873,The Lord is King for ever and ever.,,,,,,,
1874,"For the horses of Pharaoh, with his war-carriages and his horsemen, went into the sea, and the Lord sent the waters of the sea back over them; but the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land.",,,,,,,
1875,"And Miriam, the woman prophet, the sister of Aaron, took an instrument of music in her hand; and all the women went after her with music and dances.",,,,,,,
1876,"And Miriam, answering, said, Make a song to the Lord, for he is lifted up in glory; the horse and the horseman he has sent into the sea.",,,,,,,
1877,"Then Moses took Israel forward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the waste land of Shur; and for three days they were in the waste land where there was no water.",,,,,,,
1878,"And when they came to Marah, the water was no good for drinking, for the waters of Marah were bitter, which is why it was named Marah.",,,,,,,
1879,"And the people, crying out against Moses, said, What are we to have for drink?",,,,,,,
1880,"And in answer to his prayer, the Lord made him see a tree, and when he put it into the water, the water was made sweet. There he gave them a law and an order, testing them;",,,,,,,
1881,"And he said, If with all your heart you will give attention to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is right in his eyes, giving ear to his orders and keeping his laws, I will not put on you any of the diseases which I put on the Egyptians: for I",m the Lord y,ur,i,e-g,ver.,,
1882,"And they came to Elim where there were twelve water-springs and seventy palm-trees: and they put up their tents there by the waters.And they went on their way from Elim, and all the children of Israel came into the waste land of Sin, which is between Eli","and Sinai,",n t,e,fif,eent,da,of t
1883,And all the children of Israel were crying out against Moses and Aaron in the waste land:,,,,,,,
1884,"And the children of Israel said to them, It would have been better for the Lord to have put us to death in the land of Egypt, where we were seated by the flesh-pots and had bread enough for our needs; for you have taken us out to this waste of sand, to p",t all this p,opl,,o d,ath,hro,gh ne
1885,"Then the Lord said to Moses, See, I will send down bread from heaven for you; and the people will go out every day and get enough for the day's needs; so that I may put them to the test to see if they will keep my laws or not.",,,,,,,
1886,"And on the sixth day they are to make ready what they get in, and it will be twice as much as they get on the other days.",,,,,,,
1887,"And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, This evening it will be clear to you that it is the Lord who has taken you out of the land of Egypt:",,,,,,,
1888,And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord; for your angry words against the Lord have come to his ears: and what are we that you are crying out against us?,,,,,,,
1889,"And Moses said, The Lord will give you meat for your food at evening, and in the morning bread in full measure; for your outcry against the Lord has come to his ears: for what are we? your outcry is not against us but against the Lord.",,,,,,,
1890,"And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the people of Israel, Come near before the Lord for he has given ear to your outcry.",,,,,,,
1891,"And while Aaron was talking to the children of Israel, their eyes were turned in the direction of the waste land, and they saw the glory of the Lord shining in the cloud.",,,,,,,
1892,"And the Lord said to Moses,",,,,,,,
1893,"The outcry of the children of Israel has come to my ears: say to them now, At nightfall you will have meat for your food, and in the morning bread in full measure; and you will see that I am the Lord your God.",,,,,,,
1894,And it came about that in the evening little birds came up and the place was covered with them: and in the morning there was dew all round about the tents.,,,,,,,
1895,"And when the dew was gone, on the face of the earth was a small round thing, like small drops of ice on the earth.",,,,,,,
1896,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, What is it? for they had no idea what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which the Lord has given you for your food.",,,,,,,
1897,"This is what the Lord has said, Let every man take up as much as he has need of; at the rate of one omer for every person, let every man take as much as is needed for his family.",,,,,,,
1898,"And the children of Israel did so, and some took more and some less.",,,,,,,
1899,"And when it was measured, he who had taken up much had nothing over, and he who had little had enough; every man had taken what he was able to make use of.",,,,,,,
1900,"And Moses said to them, Let nothing be kept till the morning.",,,,,,,
1901,"But they gave no attention to Moses, and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell: and Moses was angry with them.",,,,,,,
1902,"And they took it up morning by morning, every man as he had need: and when the sun was high it was gone.",,,,,,,
1903,"And on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread, two omers for every person: and all the rulers of the people gave Moses word of it.",,,,,,,
1904,"And he said, This is what the Lord has said, Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord: what has to be cooked may be cooked; and what is over, put on one side to be kept till the morning.",,,,,,,
1905,"And they kept it till the morning as Moses had said: and no smell came from it, and it had no worms.",,,,,,,
1906,"And Moses said, Make your meal today of what you have, for this day is a Sabbath to the Lord: today you will not get any in the fields.",,,,,,,
1907,"For six days you will get it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.",,,,,,,
1908,"But still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it, and there was not any.",,,,,,,
1909,"And the Lord said to Moses, How long will you go against my orders and my laws?",,,,,,,
1910,"See, because the Lord has given you the Sabbath, he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days; let every man keep where he is; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.",,,,,,,
1911,So the people took their rest on the seventh day.,,,,,,,
1912,"And this bread was named manna by Israel: it was white, like a grain seed, and its taste was like cakes made with honey.",,,,,,,
1913,"And Moses said, This is the order which the Lord has given: Let one omer of it be kept for future generations, so that they may see the bread which I gave you for your food in the waste land, when I took you out from the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
1914,"And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put one omer of manna in it, and put it away before the Lord, to be kept for future generations.",,,,,,,
1915,"So Aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept, as the Lord gave orders to Moses.",,,,,,,
1916,"And the children of Israel had manna for their food for forty years, till they came to a land with people in it, till they came to the edge of the land of Canaan.",,,,,,,
1917,"Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.And the children of Israel went on from the waste land of Sin, by stages as the Lord gave them orders, and put up their tents in Rephidim: and there was no drinking-water for the people.",,,,,,,
1918,"So the people were angry with Moses, and said, Give us water for drinking. And Moses said, Why are you angry with me? and why do you put God to the test?",,,,,,,
1919,"And the people were in great need of water; and they made an outcry against Moses, and said, Why have you taken us out of Egypt to send death on us and our children and our cattle through need of water?",,,,,,,
1920,"And Moses, crying out to the Lord, said, What am I to do to this people? they are almost ready to put me to death by stoning.",,,,,,,
1921,"And the Lord said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take some of the chiefs of Israel with you, and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the Nile, and go.",,,,,,,
1922,"See, I will take my place before you on the rock in Horeb; and when you give the rock a blow, water will come out of it, and the people will have drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the chiefs of Israel.",,,,,,,
1923,"And he gave that place the name Massah and Meribah, because the children of Israel were angry, and because they put the Lord to the test, saying, Is the Lord with us or not?",,,,,,,
1924,Then Amalek came and made war on Israel in Rephidim.,,,,,,,
1925,"And Moses said to Joshua, Get together a band of men for us and go out, make war on Amalek: tomorrow I will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.",,,,,,,
1926,"So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and went to war with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.",,,,,,,
1927,"Now while Moses' hand was lifted up, Israel was the stronger: but when he let his hand go down, Amalek became the stronger.",,,,,,,
1928,"But Moses' hands became tired; so they put a stone under him and he took his seat on it, Aaron and Hur supporting his hands, one on one side and one on the other; so his hands were kept up without falling till the sun went down.",,,,,,,
1929,And Joshua overcame Amalek and his people with the sword.,,,,,,,
1930,"And the Lord said to Moses, Make a record of this in a book, so that it may be kept in memory, and say it again in the ears of Joshua: that all memory of Amalek is to be completely uprooted from the earth.",,,,,,,
1931,Then Moses put up an altar and gave it the name of Yahweh-nissi:,,,,,,,
1932,"For he said, The Lord has taken his oath that there will be war with Amalek from generation to generation.Now news came to Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, of all God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, and how the Lord had t",ken Israel o,t o,,gyp,.,,
1933,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,",,,,,,,
1934,"And her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom, for he said, I have been living in a strange land:",,,,,,,
1935,"And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help, and kept me safe from the sword of Pharaoh:",,,,,,,
1936,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to where Moses had put up his tent in the waste land, by the mountain of God.",,,,,,,
1937,"And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law, have come to you, with your wife and your two sons.",,,,,,,
1938,"And Moses went out to his father- in-law, and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss; and they said to one another, Are you well? and they came into the tent.",,,,,,,
1939,"And Moses gave his father-in-law an account of all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians because of Israel, and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way, and how the Lord had given them salvation.",,,,,,,
1940,"And Jethro was glad because the Lord had been good to Israel, freeing them from the power of the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1941,"And Jethro said, Praise be to the Lord, who has taken you out of the hand of Pharaoh and out of the hand of the Egyptians; freeing the people from the yoke of the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
1942,"Now I am certain that the Lord is greater than all gods, for he has overcome them in their pride.",,,,,,,
1943,"Then Jethro, Moses' father- in-law, made a burned offering to God: and Aaron came, with the chiefs of Israel, and had a meal with Moses' father-in-law, before God.",,,,,,,
1944,"Now on the day after, Moses took his seat to give decisions for the people: and the people were waiting before Moses from morning till evening.",,,,,,,
1945,"And when Moses' father-in-law saw all he was doing, he said, What is this you are doing for the people? why are you seated here by yourself, with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening?",,,,,,,
1946,"And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to get directions from God:",,,,,,,
1947,"And if they have any question between themselves, they come to me, and I am judge between a man and his neighbour, and I give them the orders and laws of God.",,,,,,,
1948,"And Moses' father- in-law said to him, What you are doing is not good.",,,,,,,
1949,Your strength and that of the people will be completely used up: this work is more than you are able to do by yourself.,,,,,,,
1950,"Give ear now to my suggestion, and may God be with you: you are to be the people's representative before God, taking their causes to him:",,,,,,,
1951,"Teaching them his rules and his laws, guiding them in the way they have to go, and making clear to them the work they have to do.",,,,,,,
1952,"But for the rest, take from among the people able men, such as have the fear of God, true men hating profits wrongly made; and put such men over them, to be captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens;",,,,,,,
1953,"And let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times: and let them put before you all important questions, but in small things let them give decisions themselves: in this way, it will be less hard for you, and they will take the weight off you",,,,,,,

2361,"And when Aaron saw this, he made an altar before it, and made a public statement, saying, Tomorrow there will be a feast to the Lord.",,,,,,,
2362,"So early on the day after they got up and made burned offerings and peace-offerings; and took their seats at the feast, and then gave themselves to pleasure.",,,,,,,
2363,"And the Lord said to Moses, Go down quickly; for your people, whom you took out of the land of Egypt, are turned to evil ways;",,,,,,,
2364,"Even now they are turned away from the rule I gave them, and have made themselves a metal ox and given worship to it and offerings, saying, This is your god, O Israel, who took you up out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
2365,"And the Lord said to Moses, I have been watching this people, and I see that they are a stiff-necked people.",,,,,,,
2366,"Now do not get in my way, for my wrath is burning against them; I will send destruction on them, but of you I will make a great nation.",,,,,,,
2367,"But Moses made prayer to God, saying, Lord, why is your wrath burning against your people whom you took out of the land of Egypt, with great power and with the strength of your hand?",,,,,,,
2368,"Why let the Egyptians say, He took them out to an evil fate, to put them to death on the mountains, cutting them off from the earth? Let your wrath be turned away from them, and send not this evil on your people.",,,,,,,
2369,"Have in mind Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you gave your oath, saying, I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and all this land will I give to your seed, as I said, to be their heritage for ever.",,,,,,,
2370,So the Lord let himself be turned from his purpose of sending punishment on his people.,,,,,,,
2371,"Then Moses came down the mountain with the two stones of the law in his hand; the stones had writing on their two sides, on the front and on the back.",,,,,,,
2372,"The stones were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, cut on the stones.",,,,,,,
2373,"Now when the noise and the voices of the people came to the ears of Joshua, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the tents.",,,,,,,
2374,"And Moses said, It is not the voice of men who are overcoming in the fight, or the cry of those who have been overcome; it is the sound of songs which comes to my ear.",,,,,,,
2375,"And when he came near the tents he saw the image of the ox, and the people dancing; and in his wrath Moses let the stones go from his hands, and they were broken at the foot of the mountain.",,,,,,,
2376,"And he took the ox which they had made, burning it in the fire and crushing it to powder, and he put it in the water and made the children of Israel take a drink of it.",,,,,,,
2377,"And Moses said to Aaron, What did the people do to you that you let this great sin come on them?",,,,,,,
2378,"And Aaron said, Let not my lord be angry; you have seen how the purposes of this people are evil.",,,,,,,
2379,"For they said to me, Make us a god to go before us: as for this Moses, who took us up out of the land of Egypt, we have no idea what has come to him.",,,,,,,
2380,"Then I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let him take it off; so they gave it to me, and I put it in the fire, and this image of an ox came out.",,,,,,,
2381,"And Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them loose to their shame before their haters:",,,,,,,
2382,"Then Moses took his place at the way into the tents, and said, Whoever is on the Lord's side, let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi came together to him.",,,,,,,
2383,"And he said to them, This is the word of the Lord, the God of Israel: Let every man take his sword at his side, and go from one end of the tents to the other, putting to death his brother and his friend and his neighbour.",,,,,,,
2384,And the sons of Levi did as Moses said; and about three thousand of the people were put to death that day.,,,,,,,
2385,"And Moses said, You have made yourselves priests to the Lord this day; for every one of you has made the offering of his son and his brother; the blessing of the Lord is on you this day.",,,,,,,
2386,"And on the day after, Moses said to the people, Great has been your sin: but I will go up to the Lord, and see if I may get forgiveness for your sin.",,,,,,,
2387,"Then Moses went back to the Lord and said, This people has done a great sin, making themselves a god of gold;",,,,,,,
2388,"But now, if you will give them forgiveness — but if not, let my name be taken out of your book.",,,,,,,
2389,"And the Lord said to Moses, Whoever has done evil against me will be taken out of my book.",,,,,,,
2390,"But now, go, take the people into that place of which I have given you word; see, my angel will go before you: but when the time of my judging has come, I will send punishment on them for their sin.",,,,,,,
2391,"And the Lord sent punishment on the people because they gave worship to the ox which Aaron made.And the Lord said to Moses, Go forward from this place, you and the people whom you have taken up out of the land of Egypt, to that land about which I made an",oath to Abra,"am,",I,aac,and,Jac,"b, sa"
2392,"And I will send an angel before you, driving out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite:",,,,,,,
2393,"Go up to that land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, for fear that I send destruction on you while you are on the way.",,,,,,,
2394,"Hearing this bad news the people were full of grief, and no one put on his ornaments.",,,,,,,
2395,"And the Lord said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people: if I come among you, even for a minute, I will send destruction on you; so take off all your ornaments, so that I may see what to do with you.",,,,,,,
2396,"So the children of Israel took off their ornaments at Mount Horeb, and did not put them on again.",,,,,,,
2397,"Now it was Moses' way to put up the Tent of meeting outside the tent-circle, at some distance away; giving it the name of The Tent of meeting. And everyone desiring to make his prayer to the Lord went to the Tent of meeting outside the tent-circle.",,,,,,,
2398,"And whenever Moses went out to the Tent of meeting, all the people got up and everyone went to the door of his tent, looking after Moses till he went inside the Tent.",,,,,,,
2399,"And whenever Moses went into the Tent, the pillar of cloud came down, and took its place by the door of the Tent, as long as the Lord was talking with Moses.",,,,,,,
2400,"And all the people saw the cloud at the door of the Tent, and they went down on their faces, everyone at the door of his tent.",,,,,,,
2401,"And the Lord had talk with Moses face to face, as a man may have talk with his friend. And when Moses came back to the tents, his servant, the young man Joshua, the son of Nun, did not come away from the Tent.",,,,,,,
2402,"And Moses said to the Lord, See, you say to me, Be this people's guide on their journey, but you have not made clear to me whom you will send with me. But you have said, I have knowledge of you by name, and you have grace in my eyes.",,,,,,,
2403,"If then I have grace in your eyes, let me see your ways, so that I may have knowledge of you and be certain of your grace; and my prayer is that you will keep in mind that this nation is your people.",,,,,,,
2404,"And he said, I myself will go with you and give you rest.",,,,,,,
2405,"And Moses said, If you yourself are not going with us, do not send us on from here.",,,,,,,
2406,"For is not the fact of your going with us the sign that I and this people have grace in your eyes, so that we, that is, I and your people, are separate from all other people on the face of the earth?",,,,,,,
2407,"And the Lord said to Moses, I will do as you say: for you have grace in my eyes, and I have knowledge of you by your name.",,,,,,,
2408,"And Moses said, O Lord, let me see your glory.",,,,,,,
2409,"And he said, I will make all the light of my being come before you, and will make clear to you what I am; I will be kind to those to whom I will be kind, and have mercy on those on whom I will have mercy.",,,,,,,
2410,"But it is not possible for you to see my face, for no man may see me and still go on living.",,,,,,,
2411,"And the Lord said, See, there is a place near me, and you may take your place on the rock:",,,,,,,
2412,"And when my glory goes by, I will put you in a hole in the rock, covering you with my hand till I have gone past:",,,,,,,
2413,"Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back: but my face is not to be seen.And the Lord said to Moses, Make two other stones like the first two; and I will put on them the words which were on the first stones, which were broken by you.",,,,,,,
2414,"And be ready by the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai, and come before me there in the morning, on the top of the mountain.",,,,,,,
2415,"No one is to come up with you, and let no man be seen anywhere on the mountain; let no flocks or herds come near to get their food at its foot.",,,,,,,
2416,"So Moses got two stones cut like the first; and early in the morning he went up Mount Sinai, as the Lord had said, with the two stones in his hand.",,,,,,,
2417,"And the Lord came down in the cloud and took his place by the side of Moses, and Moses gave worship to the name of the Lord.",,,,,,,
2418,"And the Lord went past before his eyes, saying, The Lord, the Lord, a God full of pity and grace, slow to wrath and great in mercy and faith;",,,,,,,
2419,"Having mercy on thousands, overlooking evil and wrongdoing and sin; he will not let wrongdoers go free, but will send punishment on children for the sins of their fathers, and on their children's children to the third and fourth generation.",,,,,,,
2420,Then Moses quickly went down on his face in worship.,,,,,,,
2421,"And he said, If now I have grace in your eyes, let the Lord go among us, for this is a stiff-necked people, and give us forgiveness for our wrongdoing and our sin, and take us for your heritage.",,,,,,,
2422,"And the Lord said, See, this is what I will undertake: before the eyes of your people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth or in any nation: and all your people will see the work of the Lord, for what I am about to do for you is",greatly to b,fe,r,d.,,,
2423,Take care to do the orders which I give you today; I will send out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.,,,,,,,
2424,"But take care, and do not make any agreement with the people of the land where you are going, for it will be a cause of sin to you.",,,,,,,
2425,But their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down:,,,,,,,
2426,For you are to be worshippers of no other god: for the Lord is a God who will not give his honour to another.,,,,,,,
2427,"So see that you make no agreement with the people of the land, and do not go after their gods, or take part in their offerings, or be guests at their feasts,",,,,,,,
2428,"Or take their daughters for your sons; for when their daughters give worship before their gods, they will make your sons take part with them.",,,,,,,
2429,Make for yourselves no gods of metal.,,,,,,,
2430,"Keep the feast of unleavened bread; for seven days your food is to be bread without leaven, as I gave you orders, at the regular time in the month Abib; for in that month you came out of Egypt.",,,,,,,
2431,"Every first male child is mine; the first male birth of your cattle, the first male of every ox and sheep.",,,,,,,
2432,"A lamb may be given in payment for the young of an ass, but if you will not make payment for it, its neck will have to be broken. For all the first of your sons you are to make payment. No one is to come before me without an offering.",,,,,,,
2433,"Six days let work be done, but on the seventh day take your rest: at ploughing time and at the grain-cutting you are to have a day for rest.",,,,,,,
2434,"And you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first-fruits of the grain, and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields.",,,,,,,
2435,"Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
2436,"For I will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land; and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the Lord, three times in the year.",,,,,,,
2437,"No leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering, and the offering of the Passover feast may not be kept till the morning.",,,,,,,
2438,Take the first-fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the Lord your God. Let not the young goat be cooked in its mother's milk,,,,,,,
2439,"And the Lord said to Moses, Put all these words in writing; for on them is based the agreement which I will make with you.",,,,,,,
2440,"And for forty days and forty nights Moses was there with the Lord, and in that time he had no food or drink. And he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement, the ten rules of the law.",,,,,,,
2441,"Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two stones in his hand, he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with God.",,,,,,,
2442,"But when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and the shining of his face, they would not come near him for fear.",,,,,,,
2443,"Then Moses sent for them; and Aaron, with the chiefs of the people, came to him; and Moses had talk with them.",,,,,,,
2444,"And later, all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the orders which the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.",,,,,,,
2445,"And at the end of his talk with them, Moses put a veil over his face.",,,,,,,
2446,"But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to have talk with him, he took off the veil till he came out. And whenever he came out he said to the children of Israel what he had been ordered to say;",,,,,,,
2447,"And the children of Israel saw that the face of Moses was shining: so Moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the Lord.And Moses sent for all the children of Israel to come together, and said to them, This is what the Lord has said and the",e are his or,ers,,,,,
2448,"Six days let work be done, but the seventh day is to be a holy day to you, a Sabbath of rest to the Lord; whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death.",,,,,,,
2449,No fire is to be lighted in any of your houses on the Sabbath day.,,,,,,,
2450,"And Moses said to all the meeting of the children of Israel, This is the order which the Lord has given:",,,,,,,
2451,"Take from among you an offering to the Lord; everyone who has the impulse in his heart, let him give his offering to the Lord; gold and silver and brass;",,,,,,,
2452,"And blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats' hair,",,,,,,,
2453,"And sheepskins coloured red, and leather, and hard wood,",,,,,,,
2454,"And oil for the lights, and spices for the holy oil and for the sweet perfumes for burning.",,,,,,,
2455,And beryls and jewels to be cut for the ephod and for the priest's bag.,,,,,,,
2456,And let every wise-hearted man among you come and make whatever has been ordered by the Lord;,,,,,,,
2457,"The House and its tent and its cover, its hooks and its boards, its rods and its pillars and its bases;",,,,,,,
2458,The ark with its cover and its rods and the veil hanging before it;,,,,,,,
2459,"The table and its rods and all its vessels, and the holy bread;",,,,,,,
2460,"And the support for the lights, with its vessels and its lights and the oil for the light;",,,,,,,
2461,"And the altar for burning spices, with its rods, and the holy oil and the sweet perfume, and the curtain for the door, at the door of the House;",,,,,,,
2462,"The altar of burned offerings, with its network of brass, its rods, and all its vessels, the washing-vessel and its base;",,,,,,,
2463,"The hangings for the open space, its pillars and their bases, and the curtain for the doorway;",,,,,,,
2464,"The nails for the House, and the nails for the open space and their cords;",,,,,,,
2465,"The robes of needlework for the work of the holy place, the holy robes for Aaron the priest, and the robes for his sons when acting as priests.",,,,,,,
2466,And all the children of Israel went away from Moses.,,,,,,,
2467,"And everyone whose heart was moved, everyone who was guided by the impulse of his spirit, came with his offering for the Lord, for whatever was needed for the Tent of meeting and its work and for the holy robes.",,,,,,,
2468,"They came, men and women, all who were ready to give, and gave pins and nose-rings and finger-rings and neck-ornaments, all of gold; everyone gave an offering of gold to the Lord.",,,,,,,
2469,"And everyone who had blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats' hair and sheepskins coloured red and leather, gave them.",,,,,,,
2470,"Everyone who had silver and brass gave an offering of them to the Lord; and everyone who had hard wood, such as was needed for the work, gave it.",,,,,,,
2471,"And all the women who were expert with their hands, made cloth, and gave the work of their hands, blue and purple and red and the best linen.",,,,,,,
2472,"And those women who had the knowledge, made the goats' hair into cloth.",,,,,,,
2473,And the rulers gave the beryls and the cut jewels for the ephod and the priest's bag;,,,,,,,
2474,"And the spice and the oil for the light, and the holy oil and the sweet perfumes.",,,,,,,
2475,"The children of Israel, every man and woman, from the impulse of their hearts, gave their offerings freely to the Lord for the work which the Lord had given Moses orders to have done.",,,,,,,
2476,"And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the Lord has made selection of Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;",,,,,,,
2477,"And he has made him full of the spirit of God, in all wisdom and knowledge and art of every sort;",,,,,,,
2478,"As an expert designer of beautiful things, working in gold and silver and brass;",,,,,,,
2479,Trained in the cutting of stones and the ornamenting of wood and in every sort of handwork.,,,,,,,
2480,"And he has given to him, and to Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the power of training others.",,,,,,,
2481,"To them he has given knowledge of all the arts of the handworker, of the designer, and the expert workman; of the maker of needlework in blue and purple and red and the best linen, and of the maker of cloth; in all the arts of the designer and the traine",workman the,ar,,xpe,t.So,let,Bezal

2483,And they took from Moses all the offerings which the children of Israel had given for the building of the holy place. And still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning.,,,,,,,
2484,"Then the wise men, who were doing all the work of the holy place, came from their work;",,,,,,,
2485,"And said to Moses, The people are giving much more than is needed for the work which the Lord has given us orders to do.",,,,,,,
2486,"So Moses made an order and had it given out through all the tents, saying, Let no man or woman make any more offerings for the holy place. So the people were kept from giving more.",,,,,,,
2487,For the material they had was enough and more than enough for all the work which had to be done.,,,,,,,
2488,"Then all the expert workmen among them made the House with its ten curtains; of the best linen, blue and purple and red, they made them, with winged ones worked by expert designers.",,,,,,,

2493,"And they made fifty hooks of gold, joining the curtains one to another with the hooks; and so the House was made.",,,,,,,
2494,And they made curtains of goats' hair for the tent; eleven curtains were made.,,,,,,,
2495,"Every curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, all of the same measure.",,,,,,,

2864,But the fat and the kidneys and the fat on the liver of the sin-offering were burned by him on the altar as the Lord gave orders to Moses.,,,,,,,
2865,And the flesh and the skin were burned with fire outside the tent-circle;,,,,,,,
2866,And he put to death the burned offering; and Aaron's sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar;,,,,,,,
2867,"And they gave him the parts of the burned offering, in their order, and the head, to be burned on the altar.",,,,,,,
2868,"And the inside parts and the legs, when they had been washed with water, were burned on the burned offering on the altar.",,,,,,,
2869,"And he made an offering for the people and took the goat of the sin-offering for the people and put it to death, offering it for sin, in the same way as the first.",,,,,,,
2870,"And he took the burned offering, offering it in the ordered way;",,,,,,,
2871,"And he put the meal offering before the Lord, and taking some of it in his hand he had it burned on the altar, separately from the burned offering of the morning.",,,,,,,
2872,"And he put to death the ox and the sheep, which were the peace-offerings for the people; and Aaron's sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar;",,,,,,,
2873,And as for the fat of the ox and the fat tail of the sheep and the fat covering the inside parts and the kidneys and the fat on the liver;,,,,,,,
2874,"They put the fat on the breasts, and the fat was burned on the altar.",,,,,,,
2875,"And Aaron took the breasts and the right leg, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses gave orders.",,,,,,,
2876,"And Aaron, lifting up his hands to the people, gave them a blessing; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burned offering, and the peace-offerings.",,,,,,,
2877,"And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of meeting, and came out and gave the people a blessing, and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people.",,,,,,,
2878,"And fire came out from before the Lord, burning up the offering on the altar and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they gave a loud cry, falling down on their faces.And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their vessels and put fire in them an","perfume, bu",nin,,tra,ge f,re,efore

2881,"And Moses sent for Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, the brother of Aaron's father, and said to them, Come near and take your brothers away from before the holy place, outside the tent-circle.",,,,,,,
2882,"So they came and took them, in their coats, outside the tent-circle, as Moses had said.",,,,,,,
2883,"And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, Do not let your hair be loose, and give no signs of grief; so that death may not overtake you, and his wrath come on all the people; but let there be weeping among your brothers and all the ho",se of Israel,for,t,is,urni,g o,the

2886,"Take no wine, or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of meeting, that it may not be the cause of death to you; this is an order for ever through all your generations.",,,,,,,
2887,"And make a division between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;",,,,,,,
2888,Teaching the children of Israel all the laws which the Lord has given them by the hand of Moses.,,,,,,,

2890,"It is to be for your food in a holy place, because it is your right and your sons' right, from the offerings of the Lord made by fire: for so am I ordered.",,,,,,,

2894,"Why did you not make a meal of the sin-offering in the holy place? For it is most holy and he has given it to you, so that the sin of the people may be put on it, to take away their sin before the Lord.",,,,,,,
2895,"See, its blood was not taken into the holy place: certainly it was right for you to have taken it as food in the holy place, as I gave orders.",,,,,,,

3394,"But let him be with you as a servant working for payment, till the year of Jubilee;",,,,,,,
3395,"Then he will go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his family and to the property of his fathers.",,,,,,,

3426,"And if, even after these things, you will not give ear to me, then I will send you punishment seven times more for your sins.",,,,,,,
3427,"And the pride of your strength will be broken, and I will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass;",,,,,,,
3428,And your strength will be used up without profit; for your land will not give her increase and the trees of the field will not give their fruit.,,,,,,,
3429,"And if you still go against me and will not give ear to me, I will put seven times more punishments on you because of your sins.",,,,,,,
3430,"I will let loose the beasts of the field among you, and they will take away your children and send destruction on your cattle, so that your numbers will become small and your roads become waste.",,,,,,,
3431,"And if by these things you will not be turned to me, but still go against me;",,,,,,,
3432,"Then I will go against you, and I will give you punishment, I myself, seven times for all your sins.",,,,,,,
3433,And I will send a sword on you to give effect to the punishment of my agreement; and when you come together into your towns I will send disease among you and you will be given up into the hands of your haters.,,,,,,,
3434,"When I take away your bread of life, ten women will be cooking bread in one oven, and your bread will be measured out by weight; you will have food but never enough.",,,,,,,

3436,"Then my wrath will be burning against you, and I will give you punishment, I myself, seven times for your sins.",,,,,,,
3437,Then you will take the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters for food;,,,,,,,

3441,"And I will send you out in all directions among the nations, and my sword will be uncovered against you, and your land will be without any living thing, and your towns will be made waste.",,,,,,,
3442,Then will the land take pleasure in its Sabbaths while it is waste and you are living in the land of your haters; then will the land have rest.,,,,,,,
3443,"All the days while it is waste will the land have rest, such rest as it never had in your Sabbaths, when you were living in it.",,,,,,,

3445,"Falling on one another, as before the sword, when no one comes after them; you will give way before your haters.",,,,,,,
3446,"And death will overtake you among strange nations, and the land of your haters will be your destruction.",,,,,,,
3447,And those of you who are still living will be wasting away in their sins in the land of your haters; in the sins of their fathers they will be wasting away.,,,,,,,
3448,"And they will have grief for their sins and for the sins of their fathers, when their hearts were untrue to me, and they went against me;",,,,,,,
3449,"So that I went against them and sent them away into the land of their haters: if then the pride of their hearts is broken and they take the punishment of their sins,",,,,,,,
3450,"Then I will keep in mind the agreement which I made with Jacob and with Isaac and with Abraham, and I will keep in mind the land.",,,,,,,
3451,"And the land, while she is without them, will keep her Sabbaths; and they will undergo the punishment of their sins, because they were turned away from my decisions and in their souls was hate for my laws.",,,,,,,

3459,"And if the person is from one month to five years old, then the value for a male will be five shekels of silver, and for a female three shekels.",,,,,,,
3460,"And for sixty years old and over, for a male the value will be fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten.",,,,,,,
3461,"But if he is poorer than the value which you have put on him, then let him be taken to the priest, and the priest will put a value on him, such as it is possible for him to give.",,,,,,,

3463,"It may not be changed in any way, a good given for a bad, or a bad for a good; if one beast is changed for another, the two will be holy.",,,,,,,
3464,"And if it is any unclean beast, of which offerings are not made to the Lord, then let him take the beast before the priest;",,,,,,,
3465,"And let the priest put a value on it, if it is good or bad; whatever value the priest puts on it, so will it be.",,,,,,,
3466,"But if he has a desire to get it back for himself, let him give a fifth more than your value.",,,,,,,
3467,"And if a man has given his house as holy to the Lord, then the priest will put a value on it, if it is good or bad; as the priest gives decision so will the value be fixed.",,,,,,,
3468,"And if the owner has a desire to get back his house, let him give a fifth more than your value, and it will be his.",,,,,,,
3469,"And if a man gives to the Lord part of the field which is his property, then let your value be in relation to the seed which is planted in it; a measure of barley grain will be valued at fifty shekels of silver.",,,,,,,
3470,"If he gives his field from the year of Jubilee, the value will be fixed by your decision.",,,,,,,
3471,"But if he gives his field after the year of Jubilee, the amount of the money will be worked out by the priest in relation to the number of years till the coming year of Jubilee, and the necessary amount will be taken off your value.",,,,,,,
3472,"And if the man who has given the field has a desire to get it back, let him give a fifth more than the price at which it was valued and it will be his.",,,,,,,
3473,"But if he has no desire to get it back, or if he has given it for a price to another man, it may not be got back again.",,,,,,,
3474,"But the field, when it becomes free at the year of Jubilee, will be holy to the Lord, as a field given under oath: it will be the property of the priest.",,,,,,,
3475,"And if a man gives to the Lord a field which he has got for money from another, which is not part of his heritage;",,,,,,,
3476,"Then the value fixed by you up to the year of Jubilee will be worked out for him by the priest, and in that day he will give the amount of your value as holy to the Lord.",,,,,,,
3477,"In the year of Jubilee the field will go back to him from whom he got it, that is, to him whose heritage it was.",,,,,,,
3478,"And let all your values be based on the shekel of the holy place, that is, twenty gerahs to the shekel.",,,,,,,
3479,But a man may not give by oath to the Lord the first-fruits of cattle which are offered to the Lord: if it is an ox or a sheep it is the Lord's.,,,,,,,

3500,"And you made answer and said to me, It is good for us to do as you say.",,,,,,,
3501,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men and respected, and made them rulers over you, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens, and overseers of your tribes.",,,,,,,
3502,"And at that time I gave orders to your judges, saying, Let all questions between your brothers come before you for hearing, and give decisions uprightly between a man and his brother or one from another nation who is with him.",,,,,,,
3503,"In judging, do not let a man's position have any weight with you; give hearing equally to small and great; have no fear of any man, for it is God who is judge: and any cause in which you are not able to give a decision, you are to put before me and I wil",give it a h,ari,g,,,,
3504,And at that time I gave you all the orders which you were to do.,,,,,,,
3505,"Then we went on from Horeb, through all that great and cruel waste which you saw, on our way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as the Lord gave us orders; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.",,,,,,,
3506,"And I said to you, You have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.",,,,,,,
3507,"See now, the Lord your God has put the land into your hands: go up and take it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has said to you; have no fear and do not be troubled.",,,,,,,
3508,"And you came near to me, every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us to go through the land with care and give us an account of the way we are to go and the towns to which we will come.",,,,,,,
3509,"And what you said seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from among you, one from every tribe;",,,,,,,
3510,"And they went up into the hill-country and came to the valley of Eshcol, and saw what was there.",,,,,,,
3511,"And taking in their hands some of the fruit of the land, they came down again to us, and gave us their account, saying, It is a good land which the Lord our God is giving us.",,,,,,,
3512,"But going against the order of the Lord your God, you would not go up:",,,,,,,
3513,"And you made an angry outcry in your tents, and said, In his hate for us the Lord has taken us out of the land of Egypt, to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction.",,,,,,,
3514,"Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying, The people are greater and taller than we are, and the towns are great and walled up to heaven; and more than this, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.",,,,,,,
3515,"Then I said to you, Have no fear of them.",,,,,,,
3516,"The Lord your God who goes before you will be fighting for you, and will do such wonders as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;",,,,,,,
3517,"And in the waste land, where you have seen how the Lord was supporting you, as a man does his son, in all your journeying till you came to this place.",,,,,,,
3518,"But for all this, you had no faith in the Lord your God,",,,,,,,
3519,"Who goes before you on your way, looking for a place where you may put up your tents, in fire by night, lighting up the way you are to go, and in a cloud by day.",,,,,,,
3520,"And the Lord, hearing your words, was angry, and said with an oath,",,,,,,,
3521,"Truly, not one of this evil generation will see that good land which I said I would give to your fathers,",,,,,,,
3522,"But only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he will see it; and to him and to his children I will give the land over which his feet have gone, because he has been true to the Lord with all his heart.",,,,,,,
3523,"And, in addition, the Lord was angry with me because of you, saying, You yourself will not go into it:",,,,,,,
3524,"Joshua, the son of Nun, your servant, he will go into the land: say to him that he is to be strong, for he will be Israel's guide into their heritage.",,,,,,,
3525,"And your little ones, who, you said, would come into strange hands, your children, who now have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go into that land, and to them I will give it and it will be theirs.",,,,,,,
3526,"But as for you, go back, journeying into the waste land by the way of the Red Sea.",,,,,,,
3527,"Then you said to me, We have done evil against the Lord, we will go up to the attack, as the Lord our God has given us orders. And arming yourselves every one, you made ready to go up without care into the hill-country.",,,,,,,
3528,"And the Lord said to me, Say to them, Do not go up to the attack; for I am not among you, and you will be overcome by those who are against you.",,,,,,,
3529,"This I said to you, but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the Lord, and in your pride went up into the hill-country.",,,,,,,
3530,"And the Amorites who were in the hill-country came out against you and put you to flight, rushing after you like bees, and overcame you in Seir, driving you even as far as Hormah.",,,,,,,
3531,"And you came back, weeping before the Lord; but the Lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you.",,,,,,,
3532,"So you were kept waiting in Kadesh for a long time.Then we went back, journeying into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea, as the Lord had said to me: and we were a long time going round Mount Seir.",,,,,,,
3533,"And the Lord said to me,",,,,,,,
3534,You have been journeying round this mountain long enough: now go to the north;,,,,,,,
3535,"And give the people orders, saying, You are about to go through the land of your brothers, the children of Esau, who are living in Seir; and they will have fear of you; so take care what you do:",,,,,,,
3536,"Make no attack on them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even space enough for a man's foot: because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for his heritage.",,,,,,,
3537,"You may get food for your needs from them for a price, and water for drinking.",,,,,,,
3538,"For the blessing of the Lord your God has been on you in all the work of your hands: he has knowledge of your wanderings through this great waste: these forty years the Lord your God has been with you, and you have been short of nothing.",,,,,,,
3539,"So we went on past our brothers, the children of Esau, living in Seir, by the road through the Arabah, from Elath and Ezion-geber. And turning, we went by the road through the waste land of Moab.",,,,,,,
3540,"And the Lord said to me, Make no attack on Moab and do not go to war with them, for I will not give you any of his land: because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for their heritage.",,,,,,,
3541,"(In the past the Emim were living there; a great people, equal in numbers to the Anakim and as tall;",,,,,,,
3542,"They are numbered among the Rephaim, like the Anakim; but are named Emim by the Moabites.",,,,,,,
3543,"And the Horites in earlier times were living in Seir, but the children of Esau took their place; they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves, as Israel did to the land of his heritage which the Lord gave them.)",,,,,,,
3544,"Get up now, and go over the stream Zered. So we went over the stream Zered.",,,,,,,
3545,"Thirty-eight years had gone by from the time when we came away from Kadesh-barnea till we went over the stream Zered; by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
3546,"For the hand of the Lord was against them, working their destruction, till all were dead.",,,,,,,
3547,"So when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people,",,,,,,,
3548,"The word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
3549,"You are about to go by Ar, the limit of the country of Moab;",,,,,,,
3550,"And when you come near the land of the children of Ammon, give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them, for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for your heritage: because I have given it to the children of Lot.",,,,,,,
3551,"(That land is said to have been a land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim had been living there in earlier times, but they were named Zamzummim by the Ammonites;",,,,,,,
3552,"They were a great people, tall as the Anakim, and equal to them in number; but the Lord sent destruction on them and the children of Ammon took their place, living in their land;",,,,,,,
3553,"As he did for the children of Esau living in Seir, when he sent destruction on the Horites before them, and they took their land where they are living to this day:",,,,,,,
3554,"And the Avvim, living in the small towns as far as Gaza, came to destruction by the hands of the Caphtorim who came out from Caphtor and took their land.)",,,,,,,
3555,"Get up now, and go on your journey, crossing over the valley of the Arnon: see, I have given into your hands Sihon, the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and all his land: go forward to make it yours, and make war on him,",,,,,,,
3556,"From now on I will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven, who, hearing of you, will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you.",,,,,,,
3557,"Then from the waste land of Kedemoth I sent representatives to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,",,,,,,,
3558,"Let me go through your land: I will keep to the highway, not turning to the right or to the left;",,,,,,,
3559,"Let me have food, at a price, for my needs, and water for drinking: only let me go through on foot;",,,,,,,
3560,As the children of Esau did for me in Seir and the Moabites in Ar; till I have gone over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us.,,,,,,,
3561,"But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us go through; for the Lord your God made his spirit hard and his heart strong, so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day.",,,,,,,
3562,"And the Lord said to me, See, from now on I have given Sihon and his land into your hands: go forward now to take his land and make it yours.",,,,,,,
3563,"Then Sihon came out against us with all his people, to make an attack on us at Jahaz.",,,,,,,
3564,And the Lord our God gave him into our hands; and we overcame him and his sons and all his people.,,,,,,,
3565,"At that time we took all his towns, and gave them over to complete destruction, together with men, women, and children; we had no mercy on any:",,,,,,,
3566,"Only the cattle we took for ourselves, with the goods from the towns we had taken.",,,,,,,
3567,"From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and from the town in the valley as far as Gilead, no town was strong enough to keep us out; the Lord our God gave them all into our hands:",,,,,,,
3568,"But you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon, that is, all the side of the river Jabbok or the towns of the hill-country, wherever the Lord our God had said we were not to go.Then turning we took the road to Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, c",me out again,t u,,ith,all,is,eople
3569,"And the Lord said to me, Have no fear of him: for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hands; do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who was ruling in Heshbon.",,,,,,,
3570,"So the Lord our God gave up Og, king of Bashan, and all his people into our hands; and we overcame him so completely that all his people came to their end in the fight.",,,,,,,
3571,"At that time we took all his towns; there was not one town of the sixty towns, all the country of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which we did not take.",,,,,,,
3572,All these towns had high walls round them with doors and locks; and in addition we took a great number of unwalled towns.,,,,,,,
3573,"And we put them to the curse, every town together with men, women, and children.",,,,,,,
3574,But we took for ourselves all the cattle and the stored wealth of the towns.,,,,,,,
3575,"At that time we took their land from the two kings of the Amorites on the far side of Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;",,,,,,,
3576,"(By the Sidonians, Hermon is named Sirion, and by the Amorites Shenir;)",,,,,,,
3577,"All the towns of the table-land and all Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",,,,,,,
3578,"(For Og, king of Bashan, was the last of all the Rephaim; his bed was made of iron; is it not in Rabbah, in the land of the children of Ammon? It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide, measured by the common cubit.)",,,,,,,
3579,"And this land which we took at that time, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead with its towns, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.",,,,,,,
3580,"The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, all the land of Argob, together with Bashan, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This land is named the land of the Rephaim.",,,,,,,
3581,"Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the land of Argob, as far as the country of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, naming it, Bashan, Havvoth-Jair after himself, as it is to this day.)",,,,,,,
3582,And Gilead I gave to Machir.,,,,,,,
3583,"And the land from Gilead to the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a limit, as far as the river Jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of Ammon, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites;",,,,,,,
3584,"As well as the Arabah, with the river Jordan as their limit, from Chinnereth to the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah to the east.",,,,,,,
3585,"At that time I gave you orders, saying, The Lord has given you this land for your heritage: all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
3586,But your wives and your little ones and your cattle (for it is clear that you have much cattle) may go on living in the towns I have given you;,,,,,,,
3587,"Till the Lord has given rest to your brothers as to you, and till they have taken for themselves the land which the Lord your God is giving them on the other side of Jordan: then you may go back, every man of you, to the heritage which I have given you.",,,,,,,
3588,"And I gave orders to Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen what the Lord your God has done to these two kings: so will the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come.",,,,,,,
3589,"Have no fear of them, for the Lord your God will be fighting for you.",,,,,,,
3590,"And at that time I made request to the Lord, saying,",,,,,,,
3591,"O Lord God, you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power?",,,,,,,
3592,"Let me go over, O Lord, and see the good land on the other side of Jordan, and that fair mountain country, even Lebanon.",,,,,,,
3593,"But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer; and the Lord said to me, Let it be enough, say no more about this thing.",,,,,,,
3594,"Go up to the top of Pisgah, and turning your eyes to the west and the north, to the south and the east, see the land with your eyes: for you are not to go over Jordan.",,,,,,,
3595,"But give my orders to Joshua, comforting him and making him strong; for he is to go over Jordan at the head of this people, and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage.",,,,,,,
3596,"So we were waiting in the valley facing Beth-peor.And now give ear, O Israel, to the laws and the decisions which I am teaching you, and do them; so that life may be yours, and you may go in and take for yourselves the land which the Lord, the God of you","fathers, is",giv,n,yo,.,,
3597,"Make no addition to the orders which I give you, and take nothing from them, but keep the orders of the Lord your God which I give you.",,,,,,,
3598,Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor: for destruction came from the Lord on all those among you who went after Baal-peor.,,,,,,,
3599,"But you who kept faith with the Lord are living, every one of you, today.",,,,,,,
3600,"I have been teaching you laws and decisions, as I was ordered to do by the Lord my God, so that you might keep them in the land to which you are going to take it for your heritage.",,,,,,,
3601,"So keep these laws and do them; for so will your wisdom and good sense be clear in the eyes of the peoples, who hearing all these laws will say, Truly, this great nation is a wise and far-seeing people.",,,,,,,
3602,"For what great nation has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is, whenever we are turned to him in prayer?",,,,,,,
3603,And what great nation has laws and decisions so right as all this law which I put before you today?,,,,,,,
3604,"Only take care, and keep watch on your soul, for fear that the things which your eyes have seen go from your memory and from your heart all the days of your life; but let the knowledge of them be given to your children and to your children's children;",,,,,,,
3605,"That day when you were waiting before the Lord your God in Horeb, and the Lord said to me, Make all the people come together, so that hearing my words they may go in fear of me all the days of their life on earth and give this teaching to their children.",,,,,,,
3606,"And you came near, waiting at the foot of the mountain; and flames of fire went up from the mountain to the heart of heaven, with dark clouds, and all was black as night.",,,,,,,
3607,And the voice of the Lord came to you out of the fire: the sound of his words came to your ears but you saw no form; there was nothing but a voice.,,,,,,,
3608,"And he gave you his agreement with you, the ten rules which you were to keep, which he put in writing on the two stones of the law.",,,,,,,
3609,"And the Lord gave me orders at that time to make clear to you these laws and decisions, so that you might do them in the land to which you are going, and which is to be your heritage.",,,,,,,
3610,So keep watch on yourselves with care; for you saw no form of any sort on the day when the voice of the Lord came to you in Horeb out of the heart of the fire:,,,,,,,
3611,"So that you may not be turned to evil ways and make for yourselves an image in the form of any living thing, male or female,",,,,,,,
3612,"Or any beast of the earth, or winged bird of the air,",,,,,,,
3613,"Or of anything which goes flat on the earth, or any fish in the water under the earth.",,,,,,,
3614,"And when your eyes are lifted up to heaven, and you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of heaven, do not let yourselves be moved to give them worship, or become the servants of what the Lord has given equally to all peoples under heaven",,,,,,,
3615,"But the Lord has taken you out of the flaming fire, out of Egypt, to be to him the people of his heritage, as you are today.",,,,,,,
3616,"And the Lord was angry with me because of you, and made an oath that I was not to go over Jordan into the good land which the Lord is giving you for your heritage:",,,,,,,
3617,"But death is to come to me in this land, I may not go over Jordan: but you will go over and take that good land for your heritage.",,,,,,,
3618,"Take care that you do not let the agreement of the Lord your God, which he has made with you, go out of your mind, or make for yourselves images of any sort, against the orders which the Lord your God has given you.",,,,,,,
3619,"For the Lord your God is an all-burning fire, and he will not let the honour which is his be given to any other.",,,,,,,
3620,"If, when you have had children and children's children, and have been living a long time in the land, you are turned to evil ways, and make an image of any sort, and do evil in the eyes of the Lord your God, moving him to wrath:",,,,,,,
3621,"May heaven and earth be my witnesses against you today, that destruction will quickly overtake you, cutting you off from that land which you are going over Jordan to take; your days will not be long in that land, but you will come to a complete end.",,,,,,,
3622,And the Lord will send you wandering among the peoples; only a small band of you will be kept from death among the nations where the Lord will send you.,,,,,,,
3623,"There you will be the servants of gods, made by men's hands, of wood and stone, having no power of seeing or hearing or taking food or smelling.",,,,,,,
3624,"But if in those lands you are turned again to the Lord your God, searching for him with all your heart and soul, he will not keep himself from you.",,,,,,,
3625,"When you are in trouble and all these things have come on you, if, in the future, you are turned again to the Lord your God, and give ear to his voice:",,,,,,,
3626,"Because the Lord your God is a God of mercy, he will not take away his help from you or let destruction overtake you, or be false to the agreement which he made by an oath with your fathers.",,,,,,,
3627,"Give thought now to the days which are past, before your time, from the day when God first gave life to man on the earth, and searching from one end of heaven to the other, see if such a great thing as this has ever been, or if anything like it has been",alked of in,tor,.,,,,
3628,Has any people ever gone on living after hearing the voice of God out of the heart of the fire as you did?,,,,,,,
3629,"Has God ever before taken a nation for himself from out of another nation, by punishments and signs and wonders, by war and by a strong hand and a stretched-out arm and great acts of wonder and fear, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before your",very eyes?,,,,,,
3630,"All this he let you see, so that you might be certain that the Lord is God and there is no other.",,,,,,,
3631,"Out of heaven itself his voice came to you, teaching you; and on earth he let you see his great fire; and his words came to your ears out of the heart of the fire.",,,,,,,
3632,"And because of his love for your fathers, he took their seed and made it his, and he himself, present among you, took you out of Egypt by his great power;",,,,,,,
3633,"Driving out before you nations greater and stronger than you, to take you into their land and give it to you for your heritage, as at this day.",,,,,,,
3634,"So today be certain, and keep the knowledge deep in your hearts, that the Lord is God, in heaven on high and here on earth; there is no other God.",,,,,,,
3635,"Then keep his laws and his orders which I give you today, so that it may be well for you and for your children after you, and that your lives may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for ever.",,,,,,,
3636,Then Moses had three towns marked out on the far side of Jordan looking to the east;,,,,,,,
3637,"To which anyone causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate, might go in flight; so that in one of these towns he might be kept from death:",,,,,,,
3638,"The names of the towns were Bezer in the waste land, in the table-land, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for Manasseh.",,,,,,,
3639,This is the law which Moses put before the children of Israel:,,,,,,,
3640,These are the rules and the laws and the decisions which Moses gave to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt;,,,,,,,
3641,"On the far side of Jordan, in the valley facing Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who was ruling in Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel overcame after they had come out of Egypt:",,,,,,,
3642,"And they took his land for a heritage, and the land of Og, king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, whose lands were on the other side of Jordan to the east;",,,,,,,
3643,"From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Sion, which is Hermon,",,,,,,,
3644,"And all the Arabah on the far side of Jordan to the east, as far as the sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah.And Moses sent for all Israel, and said to them, Give ear, O Israel, to the laws and the decisions which I give you today, and give atten",ion to them,o t,a,yo,may,kee,and
3645,The Lord our God made an agreement with us in Horeb.,,,,,,,
3646,"The Lord did not make this agreement with our fathers but with us, who are all living and present here today.",,,,,,,
3647,"The word of the Lord came to you face to face on the mountain, out of the heart of the fire,",,,,,,,
3648,"(I was between the Lord and you at that time, to make clear to you the word of the Lord: because, through fear of the fire, you did not go up the mountain;) saying,",,,,,,,
3649,"I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house.",,,,,,,
3650,You are to have no other gods but me.,,,,,,,
3651,You may not make for yourselves an image in the form of anything in heaven or on earth or in the waters under the earth:,,,,,,,
3652,"You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth genera",ion of my ha,ers,,,,,
3653,And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.,,,,,,,
3654,You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged as a sinner by the Lord.,,,,,,,
3655,"Keep the Sabbath day as a holy day, as you have been ordered by the Lord your God.",,,,,,,
3656,On six days do all your work:,,,,,,,
3657,"But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day do no work, you or your son or your daughter, or your man-servant or your woman-servant, or your ox or your ass or any of your cattle, or the man from a strange country who is living amon",you; so tha,yo,r,man,serv,nt,nd yo

3665,"These words the Lord said to all of you together on the mountain, out of the heart of the fire, out of the cloud and the dark, with a great voice: and he said no more; he put them in writing on the two stones of the law and gave them to me.",,,,,,,
3666,"And after hearing the voice which came out of the dark while the mountain was burning with fire, all the heads of your tribes and your chiefs came to me,",,,,,,,
3667,"And said, The Lord has let us see his glory and his power, and his voice has come to us out of the fire: today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of God.",,,,,,,
3668,"Why then is death to be our fate? For if the voice of the Lord our God comes to us any more, death will overtake us, and we will be burned up in this great fire.",,,,,,,
3669,"For what man is there in all the earth, who, hearing the voice of the living God as we have, out of the heart of the fire, has been kept from death?",,,,,,,
3670,"Do you go near: and after hearing everything which the Lord our God has to say, give us an account of all he has said to you, and we will give ear, and do it.",,,,,,,
3671,"Then the Lord, hearing your words to me, said to me, The words which this people have said to you have come to my ears: what they have said is well said.",,,,,,,
3672,"If only they had such a heart in them at all times, so that they might go in fear of me and keep my orders and that it might be well for them and for their children for ever!",,,,,,,
3673,"Now say to them, Go back to your tents.",,,,,,,

3734,"And you will have food enough and be full, praising the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.",,,,,,,
3735,Then take care that you are not turned away from the Lord your God and from keeping his orders and decisions and laws which I give you this day:,,,,,,,

3747,"And after the Lord has sent them in flight from before you, say not in your heart, Because of my righteousness the Lord has given me this land; when it is because of their evil-doing that the Lord is driving these nations out before you.",,,,,,,
3748,"Not for your righteousness or because your hearts are upright are you going in to take their land; but because of the evil-doing of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you, and to give effect to his oath to your fathers, Abrah","m, Isaac, an",Ja,o,.,,,
3749,Be certain then that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land as a reward for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.,,,,,,,
3750,"Keep well in mind how you made the Lord your God angry in the waste land; from the day when you went out of Egypt till you came to this place, you have gone against the orders of the Lord.",,,,,,,
3751,"Again in Horeb you made the Lord angry, and in his wrath he would have put an end to you.",,,,,,,
3752,"When I had gone up into the mountain to be given the stones on which was recorded the agreement which the Lord made with you, I was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water.",,,,,,,
3753,"And the Lord gave me the two stones with writing on them done by the finger of God: on them were recorded all the words which the Lord said to you on the mountain out of the heart of the fire, on the day of the great meeting.",,,,,,,
3754,"Then at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me those stones, the stones of the agreement.",,,,,,,
3755,"And the Lord said to me, Get up now, and go down quickly from this place; for the people you have taken out of Egypt have given themselves over to evil; they have quickly been turned from the way in which I gave them orders to go; they have made themselv",s a metal im,ge.,,,,,
3756,"And then the Lord said to me, I have seen that this people is stiff-necked:",,,,,,,
3757,Let me send destruction on them till their very name is cut off; and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they.,,,,,,,
3758,"So turning round I came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two stones of the agreement were in my hands.",,,,,,,
3759,"And I saw that you had done evil against the Lord, and had made for yourselves a metal image of a young ox: you had quickly been turned from the way in which the Lord had given you orders to go.",,,,,,,
3760,"And I let the stones go from my hands, and they were broken before your eyes.",,,,,,,
3761,"And I went down on my face before the Lord, as at the first, for forty days and forty nights, without taking food or drinking water, because of all your sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and moving him to wrath.",,,,,,,
3762,"For I was full of fear because of the wrath of the Lord which was burning against you, with your destruction in view. But again the Lord's ear was open to my prayer.",,,,,,,
3763,"And the Lord, in his wrath, would have put Aaron to death: and I made prayer for Aaron at the same time.",,,,,,,
3764,"And I took your sin, the image which you had made, and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust: and the dust I put in the stream flowing down from the mountain.",,,,,,,
3765,Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you made the Lord angry.,,,,,,,
3766,"And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and take the land which I have given you; you went against the orders of the Lord your God, and had no faith in him, and would not give ear to his voice.",,,,,,,
3767,"From the day when I first had knowledge of you, you have gone against the word of the Lord.",,,,,,,
3768,So I went down on my face in prayer before the Lord for forty days and forty nights as I did at first; because the Lord had said that he would put an end to you.,,,,,,,
3769,"And I made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord God, do not send destruction on your people and your heritage, to whom, by your great power, you have given salvation, whom you have taken out of Egypt by the strength of your hand.",,,,,,,
3770,"Keep in mind your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not looking at the hard heart of this people, or their evil-doing and their sin:",,,,,,,
3771,"Or it may be said in the land from which you have taken them, Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land which he said he would give them, and because of his hate for them, he has taken them out to put them to death in the waste land.",,,,,,,
3772,"But still they are your people and your heritage, whom you took out by your great power and by your stretched-out arm.At that time the Lord said to me, Make two other stones, cut like the first two, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of w",od.,,,,,,
3773,"And I will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you, and you are to put them into the ark.",,,,,,,
3774,"So I made an ark of hard wood, and had two stones cut like the others, and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands.",,,,,,,
3775,"And he put on the stones, as in the first writing, the ten rules which the Lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting: and the Lord gave the stones to me.",,,,,,,
3776,And turning round I came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the Lord gave me orders.,,,,,,,
3777,"(And the children of Israel went on from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah: there death came to Aaron and he was put to rest in the earth; and Eleazar, his son, took his place as priest.",,,,,,,
3778,"From there they went on to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of streams of water.",,,,,,,
3779,"At that time the Lord had the tribe of Levi marked out to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, to be before the Lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name, to this day.",,,,,,,
3780,"For this reason Levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers: the Lord is his heritage, as the Lord your God said to him.)",,,,,,,
3781,"And I was in the mountain, as at the first time, for forty days and forty nights; and again the ears of the Lord were open to my prayer, and he did not send destruction on you.",,,,,,,
3782,"Then the Lord said to me, Get up and go on your journey before the people, so that they may go in and take the land which I said in my oath to their fathers that I would give them.",,,,,,,
3783,"And now, Israel, what would the Lord your God have you do, but to go in the fear of the Lord your God, walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul,",,,,,,,
3784,Doing the orders of the Lord and keeping his laws which I give you this day for your good?,,,,,,,
3785,"The Lord your God is ruler of heaven, of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth with everything in it.",,,,,,,
3786,"But the Lord had delight in your fathers and love for them, marking out for himself their seed after them, even you, from all peoples, as at this day.",,,,,,,
3787,"Let your circumcision be of the heart, and put away your pride.",,,,,,,
3788,"For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, strong in power and greatly to be feared, who has no respect for any man's position and takes no rewards:",,,,,,,
3789,"Judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father, and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country.",,,,,,,
3790,"So be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you, for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
3791,"Let the fear of the Lord your God be before you, give him worship and be true to him at all times, taking your oaths in his name.",,,,,,,
3792,"He is your God, the God of your praise, your God who has done for you all these works of power which your eyes have seen.",,,,,,,
3793,"Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the Lord your God has made you like the stars of heaven in number.So have love for the Lord your God, and give him worship, and keep his laws and his decisions and his orders at all times.",,,,,,,
3794,"And be certain in your minds this day; for these words are not said to your children, who have had no experience of the training of the Lord your God, and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretched-out arm,",,,,,,,
3795,"Or his signs and wonders which he did in Egypt, to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all his land;",,,,,,,
3796,"And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their war-carriages; how he made the waters of the Red Sea come up over them when they went after you, and how the Lord put an end to them even to this day;",,,,,,,
3797,"And what he did for you in the waste land, till you came to this place;",,,,,,,
3798,"And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; when they went down into the open mouth of the earth, with their families and their tents and every living thing which was theirs, before the eyes of all Israel:",,,,,,,
3799,But your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord which he has done.,,,,,,,
3800,"So keep all the orders which I give you today, so that you may be strong, and go in and take the land which is to be your heritage;",,,,,,,
3801,"And that your days may be long in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.",,,,,,,
3802,"For the land where you are going is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you put in your seeds, watering them with your foot, like a planted garden:",,,,,,,
3803,"But the land where you are going is a land of hills and valleys, drinking in the rain of heaven:",,,,,,,
3804,A land cared for by the Lord your God: the eyes of the Lord your God are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other.,,,,,,,
3805,"And it will be that if you truly give ear to the orders which I put before you this day, loving the Lord your God and worshipping him with all your heart and all your soul,",,,,,,,
3806,"Then I will send rain on your land at the right time, the early rains and the late rains, so that you may get in your grain and your wine and your oil.",,,,,,,
3807,"And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle, so that you may have food in full measure.",,,,,,,
3808,But take care that your hearts are not turned to false ways so that you become servants and worshippers of other gods;,,,,,,,
3809,"For if you do so, the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you, and the heaven will be shut up so that there is no rain and the land will give no fruit; and in a very little time you will be cut off from the good land which the Lord is giving you.",,,,,,,
3810,"So keep these words deep in your heart and in your soul, and have them fixed on your hand for a sign and marked on your brow;",,,,,,,
3811,"Teaching them to your children, and talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way, when you go to sleep and when you get up:",,,,,,,
3812,Writing them on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns:,,,,,,,
3813,"So that your days, and the days of your children, may be long in the land which the Lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give them, like the days of the eternal heavens.",,,,,,,
3814,"For if you take care to keep all the orders which I give you, and to do them; loving the Lord your God and walking in all his ways and being true to him:",,,,,,,
3815,"Then the Lord will send these nations in flight before you, and you will take the lands of nations greater and stronger than yourselves.",,,,,,,
3816,"Every place where you put your foot will be yours: from the waste land and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates as far as the Great Sea, will be the limits of your land.",,,,,,,
3817,"All people will give way before you: for the Lord your God will put the fear of you on all the land through which you go, as he has said.",,,,,,,
3818,Today I put before you a blessing and a curse:,,,,,,,
3819,"The blessing if you give ear to the orders of the Lord your God, which I give you this day:",,,,,,,
3820,"And the curse if you do not give ear to the orders of the Lord your God, but let yourselves be turned from the way which I have put before you this day, and go after other gods which are not yours.",,,,,,,

3822,"Are they not on the other side of Jordan, looking west, in the land of the Canaanites living in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, by the holy tree of Moreh?",,,,,,,

3824,"And you are to take care to keep all the laws and the decisions which I put before you today.These are the laws and the decisions which you are to keep with care in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you to be your heritage all t",e days of yo,r l,f,on,eart,.,

4300,"It is the Lord who goes before you; he will be with you, he will not take away his help from you or give you up: so have no fear.",,,,,,,
4301,"Then Moses put all this law in writing, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, and to all the responsible men of Israel.",,,,,,,

4307,And the Lord was seen in the Tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the Tent.,,,,,,,
4308,"And the Lord said to Moses, Now you are going to rest with your fathers; and this people will be false to me, uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going; they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement I have",made with th,m.,,,,,

4315,"Then he gave orders to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying to him, Be strong and take heart: for you are to go at the head of the children of Israel into the land which I made an oath to give them; and I will be with you.",,,,,,,
4316,"Now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete,",,,,,,,
4317,"Moses said to the Levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the Lord's agreement,",,,,,,,
4318,"Take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the Lord's agreement, so that it may be a witness against you.",,,,,,,
4319,"For I have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts: even now, while I am still living, you will not be ruled by the Lord; how much less after my death?",,,,,,,
4320,"Get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes, and your overseers, so that I may say these things in their hearing, and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them.",,,,,,,

4322,"Then in the hearing of all the meeting of Israel, Moses said the words of this song, to the end.Give ear, O heavens, to my voice; let the earth take note of the words of my mouth:",,,,,,,
4323,"My teaching is dropping like rain, coming down like dew on the fields; like rain on the young grass and showers on the garden plants:",,,,,,,
4324,For I will give honour to the name of the Lord: let our God be named great.,,,,,,,
4325,"He is the Rock, complete is his work; for all his ways are righteousness: a God without evil who keeps faith, true and upright is he.",,,,,,,
4326,"They have become false, they are not his children, the mark of sin is on them; they are an evil and hard-hearted generation.",,,,,,,
4327,"Is this your answer to the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is he not your father who has given you life? He has made you and given you your place.",,,,,,,
4328,"Keep in mind the days of the past, give thought to the years of generations gone by: go to your father and he will make it clear to you, to the old men and they will give you the story.",,,,,,,
4329,"When the Most High gave the nations their heritage, separating into groups the children of men, he had the limits of the peoples marked out, keeping in mind the number of the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
4330,For the Lord's wealth is his people; Jacob is the land of his heritage.,,,,,,,
4331,"He came to him in the waste land, in the unpeopled waste of sand: putting his arms round him and caring for him, he kept him as the light of his eye.",,,,,,,
4332,"As an eagle, teaching her young to make their flight, with her wings outstretched over them, takes them up on her strong feathers:",,,,,,,
4333,"So the Lord only was his guide, no other god was with him.",,,,,,,
4334,"He put him on the high places of the earth, his food was the increase of the field; honey he gave him out of the rock and oil out of the hard rock;",,,,,,,
4335,"Butter from his cows and milk from his sheep, with fat of lambs and sheep of Bashan, and goats, and the heart of the grain; and for your drink, wine from the blood of the grape.",,,,,,,
4336,"But Jeshurun became fat and would not be controlled: you have become fat, you are thick and full of food: then he was untrue to the God who made him, giving no honour to the Rock of his salvation.",,,,,,,
4337,The honour which was his they gave to strange gods; by their disgusting ways he was moved to wrath.,,,,,,,
4338,"They made offerings to evil spirits which were not God, to gods who were strange to them, which had newly come up, not feared by your fathers.",,,,,,,
4339,"You have no thought for the Rock, your father, you have no memory of the God who gave you birth.",,,,,,,
4340,And the Lord saw with disgust the evil-doing of his sons and daughters.,,,,,,,
4341,"And he said, My face will be veiled from them, I will see what their end will be: for they are an uncontrolled generation, children in whom is no faith.",,,,,,,
4342,"They have given my honour to that which is not God, moving me to wrath with their false worship: I will give their honour to those who are not a people, moving them to wrath by a foolish nation,",,,,,,,
4343,"For my wrath is a flaming fire, burning to the deep parts of the underworld, burning up the earth with her increase, and firing the deep roots of the mountains.",,,,,,,
4344,"I will send a rain of troubles on them, my arrows will be showered on them.",,,,,,,
4345,"They will be wasted from need of food, and overcome by burning heat and bitter destruction; and the teeth of beasts I will send on them, with the poison of the worms of the dust.",,,,,,,
4346,"Outside they will be cut off by the sword, and in the inner rooms by fear; death will take the young man and the virgin, the baby at the breast and the grey-haired man.",,,,,,,
4347,"I said I would send them wandering far away, I would make all memory of them go from the minds of men:",,,,,,,
4348,"But for the fear that their haters, uplifted in their pride, might say, Our hand is strong, the Lord has not done all this.",,,,,,,
4349,For they are a nation without wisdom; there is no sense in them.,,,,,,,
4350,"If only they were wise, if only this was clear to them, and they would give thought to their future!",,,,,,,
4351,"How would it be possible for one to overcome a thousand, and two to send ten thousand in flight, if their rock had not let them go, if the Lord had not given them up?",,,,,,,
4352,"For their rock is not like our Rock, even our haters themselves being judges.",,,,,,,
4353,"For their vine is the vine of Sodom, from the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are the grapes of evil, and the berries are bitter:",,,,,,,
4354,"Their wine is the poison of dragons, the cruel poison of snakes.",,,,,,,
4355,"Is not this among my secrets, kept safe in my store-house?",,,,,,,
4356,"Punishment is mine and reward, at the time of the slipping of their feet: for the day of their downfall is near, sudden will be their fate.",,,,,,,
4357,"For the Lord will be judge of his people, he will have pity for his servants; when he sees that their power is gone, there is no one, shut up or free.",,,,,,,
4358,"And he will say, Where are their gods, the rock in which they put their faith?",,,,,,,
4359,"Who took the fat of their offerings, and the wine of their drink offering? Let them now come to your help, let them be your salvation.",,,,,,,
4360,"See now, I myself am he; there is no other god but me: giver of death and life, wounding and making well: and no one has power to make you free from my hand.",,,,,,,
4361,"For lifting up my hand to heaven I say, By my unending life,",,,,,,,
4362,"If I make sharp my shining sword, and my hand is outstretched for judging, I will give punishment to those who are against me, and their right reward to my haters.",,,,,,,
4363,"I will make my arrows red with blood, my sword will be feasting on flesh, with the blood of the dead and the prisoners, of the long-haired heads of my haters.",,,,,,,
4364,"Be glad, O you his people, over the nations; for he will take payment for the blood of his servants, and will give punishment to his haters, and take away the sin of his land, for his people.",,,,,,,
4365,"So Moses said all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Hoshea, the son of Nun.",,,,,,,
4366,"And after saying all this to the people,",,,,,,,
4367,"Moses said to them, Let the words which I have said to you today go deep into your hearts, and give orders to your children to do every word of this law.",,,,,,,
4368,"And this is no small thing for you, but it is your life, and through this you may make your days long in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage.",,,,,,,
4369,"That same day the Lord said to Moses,",,,,,,,
4370,"Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo in the land of Moab opposite Jericho; there you may see the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel for their heritage:",,,,,,,
4371,"And let death come to you on the mountain where you are going, and be put to rest with your people; as death came to Aaron, your brother, on Mount Hor, where he was put to rest with his people:",,,,,,,
4372,Because of your sin against me before the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath Kadesh in the waste land of Zin; because you did not keep my name holy among the children of Israel.,,,,,,,
4373,"So you will see the land before you, but you will not go into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.Now this is the blessing which Moses, the man of God, gave to the children of Israel before his death.",,,,,,,
4374,"He said, The Lord came from Sinai, dawning on them from Seir; shining out from Mount Paran, coming from Meribath Kadesh: from his right hand went flames of fire: his wrath made waste the peoples.",,,,,,,
4375,All his holy ones are at his hand; they go at his feet; they are lifted up on his wings.,,,,,,,

4472,"And he said to them, Go over before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of Jordan, and let every one of you take up a stone on his back, one for every tribe of the children of Israel:",,,,,,,
4473,"So that this may be a sign among you; when your children say to you in time to come, What is the reason for these stones?",,,,,,,
4474,"Then you will say to them, Because the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the Lord's agreement; when it went over Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones will be a sign for the children of Israel, keeping it in their memor",for ever.,,,,,,

4478,"And when all the people had come to the other side, the ark of the Lord went over, and the priests, before the eyes of the people.",,,,,,,
4479,And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh went over armed before the children of Israel as Moses had said to them:,,,,,,,
4480,"About forty thousand armed for war went over before the Lord to the fight, to the lowlands of Jericho.",,,,,,,
4481,"That day the Lord made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel; and all the days of his life they went in fear of him, as they had gone in fear of Moses.",,,,,,,
4482,"Then the Lord said to Joshua,",,,,,,,
4483,"Give orders to the priests who take up the ark of witness, to come up out of Jordan.",,,,,,,
4484,"So Joshua gave orders to the priests, saying, Come up now out of Jordan.",,,,,,,
4485,"And when the priests who took up the ark of the Lord's agreement came up out of Jordan and their feet came out on to dry land, the waters of Jordan went back to their place, overflowing its edges as before.",,,,,,,
4486,"So on the tenth day of the first month the people came up out of Jordan, and put up their tents in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.",,,,,,,
4487,"And the twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, Joshua put up in Gilgal.",,,,,,,
4488,"And he said to the children of Israel, When your children say to their fathers in time to come, What is the reason for these stones?",,,,,,,
4489,"Then give your children the story, and say, Israel came over this river Jordan on dry land.",,,,,,,
4490,"For the Lord your God made the waters of Jordan dry before you till you had gone across, as he did to the Red Sea, drying it up before us till we had gone across:",,,,,,,
4491,"So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the hand of the Lord is strong; and that they may go in fear of the Lord your God for ever.Now when the news came to all the kings of the Amorites on the west side of Jordan, and all the kings of the Cana",nites living,by,h,se,", ho",th,Lord
4492,"At that time the Lord said to Joshua, Make yourself stone knives and give the children of Israel circumcision a second time.",,,,,,,
4493,So Joshua made stone knives and gave the children of Israel circumcision at Gibeath-ha-araloth.,,,,,,,
4494,"And this is the reason why Joshua did so: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the fighting-men, had been overtaken by death in the waste land on the way, after they came out of Egypt.",,,,,,,
4495,All the people who came out had undergone circumcision; but all the people whose birth had taken place in the waste land on their journey from Egypt had not.,,,,,,,
4496,"For the children of Israel were wandering in the waste land for forty years, till all the nation, that is, all the fighting-men, who had come out of Egypt, were dead, because they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord: to whom the Lord said, with an","ath, that he",wou,d,not,let,hem,see t
4497,"And their children, who came up in their place, now underwent circumcision by the hands of Joshua, not having had it before: for there had been no circumcision on the journey.",,,,,,,
4498,"So when all the nation had undergone circumcision, they kept in their tents till they were well again.",,,,,,,
4499,"And the Lord said to Joshua, Today the shame of Egypt has been rolled away from you. So that place was named Gilgal, to this day.",,,,,,,
4500,"So the children of Israel put up their tents in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the lowlands of Jericho.",,,,,,,
4501,"And on the day after the Passover, they had for their food the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and dry grain on the same day.",,,,,,,
4502,"And there was no more manna from the day after they had for their food the produce of the land; the children of Israel had manna no longer, but that year the produce of the land of Canaan was their food.",,,,,,,
4503,"Now when Joshua was near Jericho, lifting up his eyes he saw a man in front of him, with his sword uncovered in his hand: and Joshua went up to him and said, Are you for us or against us?",,,,,,,
4504,"And he said, No; but I have come as captain of the armies of the Lord. Then Joshua, falling down with his face to the earth in worship, said, What has my lord to say to his servant?",,,,,,,
4505,"And the captain of the Lord's army said to Joshua, Take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy. And Joshua did so.(Now Jericho was all shut up because of the children of Israel: there was no going out or coming in.)",,,,,,,
4506,"And the Lord said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hands Jericho with its king and all its men of war.",,,,,,,
4507,"Now let all your fighting-men make a circle round the town, going all round it once. Do this for six days.",,,,,,,
4508,"And let seven priests go before the ark with seven loud-sounding horns in their hands: on the seventh day you are to go round the town seven times, the priests blowing their horns.",,,,,,,
4509,"And at the sound of a long note on the horns, let all the people give a loud cry; and the wall of the town will come down flat, and all the people are to go straight forward.",,,,,,,
4510,"Then Joshua, the son of Nun, sent for the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the agreement, and let seven priests take seven horns in their hands and go before the ark of the Lord.",,,,,,,
4511,"And he said to the people, Go forward, circling the town, and let the armed men go before the ark of the Lord.",,,,,,,
4512,"So after Joshua had said this to the people, the seven priests with their seven horns went forward before the Lord, blowing on their horns: and the ark of the Lord's agreement went after them.",,,,,,,
4513,"And the armed men went before the priests who were blowing the horns, and the mass of the people went after the ark, blowing their horns.",,,,,,,
4514,"And to the people Joshua gave an order, saying, You will give no cry, and make no sound, and let no word go out of your mouth till the day when I say, Give a loud cry; then give a loud cry.",,,,,,,
4515,So he made the ark of the Lord go all round the town once: then they went back to the tents for the night.,,,,,,,
4516,"And early in the morning Joshua got up, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.",,,,,,,
4517,"And the seven priests with their seven horns went on before the ark of the Lord, blowing their horns: the armed men went before them, and the mass of the people went after the ark of the Lord, blowing their horns.",,,,,,,
4518,"The second day they went all round the town once, and then went back to their tents: and so they did for six days.",,,,,,,
4519,"Then on the seventh day they got up early, at the dawn of the day, and went round the town in the same way, but that day they went round it seven times.",,,,,,,
4520,"And the seventh time, at the sound of the priests' horns, Joshua said to the people, Now give a loud cry; for the Lord has given you the town.",,,,,,,
4521,"And the town will be put to the curse, and everything in it will be given to the Lord: only Rahab, the loose woman, and all who are in the house with her, will be kept safe, because she kept secret the men we sent.",,,,,,,
4522,"And as for you, keep yourselves from the cursed thing, for fear that you may get a desire for it and take some of it for yourselves, and so be the cause of a curse and great trouble on the tents of Israel.",,,,,,,
4523,But all the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron are holy to the Lord: they are to come into the store-house of the Lord.,,,,,,,
4524,"So the people gave a loud cry, and the horns were sounded; and on hearing the horns the people gave a loud cry, and the wall came down flat, so that the people went up into the town, every man going straight before him, and they took the town.",,,,,,,
4525,"And they put everything in the town to the curse; men and women, young and old, ox and sheep and ass, they put to death without mercy.",,,,,,,
4526,"Then Joshua said to the two men who had been sent to make a search through the land, Go into the house of the loose woman, and get her out, and all who are with her, as you gave her your oath.",,,,,,,
4527,"So the searchers went in and got out Rahab and her father and mother and her brothers and all she had, and they got out all her family; and they took them outside the tents of Israel.",,,,,,,
4528,"Then, after burning up the town and everything in it, they put the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron into the store-house of the Lord's house.",,,,,,,
4529,"But Joshua kept Rahab, the loose woman, and her father's family and all she had, from death, and so she got a living-place among the children of Israel to this day; because she kept safe the men whom Joshua had sent to make a search through the land.",,,,,,,
4530,"Then Joshua gave the people orders with an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed before the Lord who puts his hand to the building up of this town: with the loss of his first son will he put the first stone of it in place, and with the loss of his younges",son he will,put,u,it,doo,s.,
4531,"So the Lord was with Joshua; and news of him went through all the land.But the children of Israel did wrong about the cursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the family of Judah, took of the cursed thing, moving",he Lord to w,ath,a,ain,t th,ch,ldren
4532,"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is by the side of Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and said to them, Go up and make a search through the land. And the men went up and saw how Ai was placed.",,,,,,,
4533,"Then they came back to Joshua and said to him, Do not send all the people up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and make an attack on Ai; there is no need for all the people to be tired with the journey there, for it is only a small town.",,,,,,,
4534,"So about three thousand of the people went up, and were sent in flight by the men of Ai.",,,,,,,
4535,"The men of Ai put to death about thirty-six of them, driving them from before the town as far as the stoneworks, and overcoming them on the way down: and the hearts of the people became like water.",,,,,,,
4536,"Then Joshua, in great grief, went down on the earth before the ark of the Lord till the evening, and all the chiefs of Israel with him, and they put dust on their heads.",,,,,,,
4537,"And Joshua said, O Lord God, why have you taken us over Jordan only to give us up into the hands of the Amorites for our destruction? If only it had been enough for us to keep on the other side of Jordan!",,,,,,,
4538,"O Lord, what am I to say now that Israel have given way before their attackers?",,,,,,,
4539,"For when the news comes to the Canaanites and all the people of the land, they will come up, shutting us in and cutting off our name from the earth: and what will you do for the honour of your great name?",,,,,,,
4540,"Then the Lord said to Joshua, Get up; what are you doing with your face to the earth?",,,,,,,
4541,"Israel has done wrong, sinning against the agreement which I made with them: they have even taken of the cursed thing; acting falsely like thieves they have put it among their goods.",,,,,,,
4542,"For this reason the children of Israel have given way, turning their backs in flight before their attackers, because they are cursed: I will no longer be with you, if you do not put the cursed thing away from among you.",,,,,,,
4543,"Up! make the people holy; say to them, Make yourselves holy before tomorrow, for the Lord, the God of Israel, has said, There is a cursed thing among you, O Israel, and you will give way before your attackers in the fight till the cursed thing has been t",ken away fro,am,n,yo,.,,
4544,"So in the morning you are to come near, tribe by tribe; and the tribe marked out by the Lord is to come near, family by family; and the family marked out by the Lord is to come near, house by house; and the house marked out by the Lord is to come near, m",n by man.,,,,,,
4545,"Then the man who is taken with the cursed thing is to be burned, with everything which is his; because he has gone against the agreement of the Lord and has done an act of shame in Israel.",,,,,,,
4546,"So Joshua got up early in the morning, and made Israel come before him by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken;",,,,,,,
4547,"Then he made Judah come forward, and the family of the Zerahites was taken; and he made the family of the Zerahites come forward man by man; and Zabdi was taken;",,,,,,,
4548,"Then the house of Zabdi came forward man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.",,,,,,,
4549,"And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory and praise to the Lord, the God of Israel; give me word now of what you have done, and keep nothing back from me.",,,,,,,
4550,"And Achan, answering, said to Joshua, Truly I have done wrong against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done:",,,,,,,
4551,"When I saw among their goods a fair robe of Babylon and two hundred shekels of silver, and a mass of gold, fifty shekels in weight, I was overcome by desire and took them; and they are put away in the earth in my tent, and the silver is under it.",,,,,,,
4552,"So Joshua sent men quickly, and looking in his tent, they saw where the robe had been put away secretly with the silver under it.",,,,,,,
4553,"And they took them from the tent and came back with them to Joshua and the children of Israel, and put them before the Lord.",,,,,,,
4554,"Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the robe and the mass of gold, and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and everything he had; and they took them up into the valley o",Achor.,,,,,,
4555,"And Joshua said, Why have you been a cause of trouble to us? Today the Lord will send trouble on you. And all Israel took part in stoning him; they had him stoned to death and then burned with fire.",,,,,,,
4556,"And over him they put a great mass of stones, which is there to this day; then the heat of the Lord's wrath was turned away. So that place was named, The Valley of Achor, to this day.Then the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear and do not be troubled: take",with you all,the,f,ght,ng-m,n a,d go
4557,And you are to do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king: but their goods and their cattle you may take for yourselves: let a secret force be stationed to make a surprise attack on the town from the back.,,,,,,,
4558,"So Joshua and the fighting-men got ready to go up against Ai; and Joshua took thirty thousand men of war, and sent them out by night.",,,,,,,
4559,"And he gave them their orders, saying, Go and take up your position secretly at the back of the town: do not go very far away, and let all of you be ready:",,,,,,,
4560,"And I and all the people with me will come near the town, and when they come out against us as they did before, we will go in flight from them;",,,,,,,
4561,"And they will come out after us, till we have got them away from the town; for they will say, They have gone in flight from us as before; so we will go in flight before them;",,,,,,,
4562,"Then you will get up from your secret position and take the town, for the Lord your God will give it up into your hands.",,,,,,,
4563,"And when you have taken the town, put fire to it, as the Lord has said: see, I have given you your orders.",,,,,,,
4564,"So Joshua sent them out: and they took up a secret position between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua kept with the people that night.",,,,,,,
4565,"And early in the morning Joshua got up, and put the people in order, and he and the chiefs of Israel went up before the people to Ai.",,,,,,,
4566,"And all the fighting-men who were with him went up and came near the town, and took up a position on the north side of Ai facing the town, with a valley between him and the town.",,,,,,,
4567,"And taking about five thousand men, he put them in position for a surprise attack on the west side of Ai, between Beth-el and Ai.",,,,,,,
4568,"So all the people were in their places, the army on the north side of the town and the secret force on the west; and that night Joshua went down into the valley.",,,,,,,
4569,"Now when the king of Ai saw it, he got up quickly and went out to war against Israel, he and all his people, to the slope going down to the valley; but he had no idea that a secret force was waiting at the back of the town.",,,,,,,
4570,"Then Joshua and all Israel, acting as if they were overcome before them, went in flight by way of the waste land.",,,,,,,
4571,"And all the people in Ai came together to go after them; and they went after Joshua, moving away from the town.",,,,,,,
4572,There was not a man in Ai and Beth-el who did not go out after Israel; and the town was open and unwatched while they went after Israel.,,,,,,,
4573,"And the Lord said to Joshua, Let your spear be stretched out against Ai; for I will give it into your hands. So Joshua took up his spear, stretching it out in the direction of the town.",,,,,,,
4574,"Then the secret force came quickly from their place, and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out, went into the town and took it, and put fire to it straight away.",,,,,,,
4575,"Then the men of Ai, looking back, saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven, and were unable to go this way or that: and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them.",,,,,,,
4576,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack, and that the smoke of the town had gone up, turning round they overcame the men of Ai.",,,,,,,
4577,"Then the other force came out of the town against them, so that they were being attacked on this side and on that: and Israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life.",,,,,,,
4578,"But the king of Ai they made prisoner, and took him to Joshua.",,,,,,,
4579,"Then, after the destruction of all the people of Ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them, and when all the people had been put to death without mercy, all Israel went back to Ai, and put to death all who were in it without mercy.",,,,,,,
4580,"On that day twelve thousand were put to death, men and women, all the people of Ai.",,,,,,,
4581,For Joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of Ai was complete.,,,,,,,
4582,"But the cattle and the goods from that town, Israel took for themselves, as the Lord had given orders to Joshua.",,,,,,,
4583,"So Joshua gave Ai to the flames, and made it a waste mass of stones for ever, as it is to this day.",,,,,,,
4584,"And he put the king of Ai to death, hanging him on a tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree, and put it in the public place of the town, covering it with a great mass of stones, which is",there to thi,da,.,,,,
4585,"Then Joshua put up an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,",,,,,,,
4586,"In the way ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, as it is recorded in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, untouched by any iron instrument: and on it they made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.",,,,,,,
4587,"And he made there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, writing it before the eyes of the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
4588,"And all Israel, those who were Israelites by birth, as well as the men from other lands living with them, and their responsible men and their overseers and judges, took their places round the ark, in front of the priests, the Levites, whose work it was t",take up the,ark,o,th,Lor,'s,greem
4589,"And after, he gave them all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, as it is all recorded in the book of the law;",,,,,,,
4590,"Reading to all the meeting of Israel, with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them, every word of the orders which Moses had given.Now on hearing the news of these things, all the kings on the west side of Jorda",", in the hil",-co,n,ry,nd t,e l,wland
4591,"Came together with one purpose, to make war against Joshua and Israel.",,,,,,,
4592,"And the men of Gibeon, hearing what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,",,,,,,,
4593,"Acting with deceit, got food together as if for a long journey; and took old food-bags for their asses, and old and cracked wine-skins kept together with cord;",,,,,,,
4594,"And put old stitched-up shoes on their feet, and old clothing on their backs; and all the food they had with them was dry and broken up.",,,,,,,
4595,"And they came to Joshua to the tent-circle at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: so now make an agreement with us.",,,,,,,
4596,"And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be that you are living among us; how then may we make an agreement with you?",,,,,,,
4597,"And they said to Joshua, We are your servants. Then Joshua said to them, Who are you and where do you come from?",,,,,,,
4598,"And they said to him, Your servants have come from a very far country, because of the name of the Lord your God: for the story of his great name, and of all he did in Egypt has come to our ears,",,,,,,,
4599,"And what he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of Jordan, to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, at Ashtaroth.",,,,,,,
4600,"So the responsible men and all the people of our country said to us, Take food with you for the journey and go to them, and say to them, We are your servants: so now make an agreement with us.",,,,,,,
4601,"This bread which we have with us for our food, we took warm and new from our houses when starting on our journey to you; but now see, it has become dry and broken up.",,,,,,,
4602,"And these wine-skins were new when we put the wine in them, and now they are cracked as you see; and our clothing and our shoes have become old because of our very long journey here.",,,,,,,
4603,"And the men took some of their food, without requesting directions from the Lord.",,,,,,,
4604,"So Joshua made peace with them, and made an agreement with them that they were not to be put to death: and the chiefs of the people took an oath to them.",,,,,,,
4605,"Now three days after, when they had made this agreement with them, they had word that these men were their neighbours, living near them.",,,,,,,
4606,"And the children of Israel went forward on their journey, and on the third day came to their towns. Now their towns were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.",,,,,,,
4607,"And the children of Israel did not put them to death, because the chiefs of the people had taken an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. And all the people made an outcry against the chiefs.",,,,,,,
4608,"But all the chiefs said to the people, We have taken an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and so we may not put our hands on them.",,,,,,,
4609,"This is what we will do to them: we will not put them to death, for fear that wrath may come on us because of our oath to them.",,,,,,,
4610,"Keep them living, and let them be servants, cutting wood and getting water for all the people. And all the people did as the chiefs had said to them.",,,,,,,
4611,"Then Joshua sent for them, and said to them, Why have you been false to us, saying, We are very far from you, when you are living among us?",,,,,,,
4612,"Now because of this you are cursed, and you will for ever be our servants, cutting wood and getting water for the house of my God.",,,,,,,
4613,"And, answering Joshua, they said, Because it came to the ears of your servants that the Lord your God had given orders to his servant Moses to give you all this land, and to send destruction on all the people living in it, because of you; so, fearing gre",tly for our,ive,,eca,se o,yo,", we"
4614,And now we are in your hands: do to us whatever seems good and right to you.,,,,,,,
4615,"So he kept them safe from the children of Israel, and did not let them be put to death.",,,,,,,
4616,"And that day Joshua made them servants, cutting wood and getting water for the people and for the altar of the Lord, in the place marked out by him, to this day.Now when it came to the ears of Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, that Joshua had taken Ai, and",had given it,up,o,the,curs,(f,r as
4617,"He was in great fear, because Gibeon was a great town, like one of the king's towns, greater than Ai, and all the men in it were men of war.",,,,,,,
4618,"So Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,",,,,,,,
4619,"Come up to me and give me help, and let us make an attack on Gibeon: for they have made peace with Joshua and the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
4620,"So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, were banded together, and went up with all their armies and took up their position before Gibeon and made war a",ainst it.,,,,,,
4621,"And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the tent-circle at Gilgal, saying, Be not slow to send help to your servants; come up quickly to our support and keep us safe: for all the kings of the Amorites from the hill- country have come together against us.",,,,,,,
4622,So Joshua went up from Gilgal with all his army and all his men of war.,,,,,,,
4623,"And the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear of them, for I have given them into your hands; they will all give way before you.",,,,,,,
4624,"So Joshua, having come up from Gilgal all night, made a sudden attack on them.",,,,,,,
4625,"And the Lord made them full of fear before Israel, and they put great numbers of them to death at Gibeon, and went after them by the way going up to Beth-horon, driving them back to Azekah and Makkedah",,,,,,,
4626,"And in their flight before Israel, on the way down from Beth-horon, the Lord sent down great stones from heaven on them all the way to Azekah, causing their death: those whose death was caused by the stones were more than those whom the children of Israe",put to deat,wi,h,the,swor,.,
4627,"It was on the day when the Lord gave up the Amorites into the hands of the children of Israel that Joshua said to the Lord, before the eyes of Israel, Sun, be at rest over Gibeon; and you, O moon, in the valley of Aijalon.",,,,,,,
4628,"And the sun was at rest and the moon kept its place till the nation had given punishment to their attackers. (Is it not recorded in the book of Jashar?) So the sun kept its place in the middle of the heavens, and was waiting, and did not go down, for the",space of a d,y.,,,,,
4629,"And there was no day like that, before it or after it, when the Lord gave ear to the voice of a man; for the Lord was fighting for Israel.",,,,,,,
4630,"And Joshua, with all Israel, went back to the tent-circle at Gilgal.",,,,,,,
4631,But these five kings went in flight secretly to a hole in the rock at Makkedah.,,,,,,,
4632,And word was given to Joshua that the five kings had been taken in a hole in the rock at Makkedah.,,,,,,,
4633,"And Joshua said, Let great stones be rolled against the mouth of the hole, and let men keep watch by it:",,,,,,,
4634,"But do you, without waiting, go after their army, attacking them from the back; do not let them get into their towns, for the Lord your God has given them into your hands.",,,,,,,
4635,"Now when Joshua and the children of Israel had come to the end of their war of complete destruction, and had put to death all but a small band who had got safely into the walled towns,",,,,,,,
4636,All the people went back to Joshua to the tent-circle at Makkedah in peace: and no one said a word against the children of Israel.,,,,,,,
4637,"Then Joshua said, Take away the stones from the mouth of the hole in the rock, and make those five kings come out to me.",,,,,,,
4638,"And they did so, and made those five kings come out of the hole to him, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.",,,,,,,
4639,"And when they had made those kings come out to Joshua, Joshua sent for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near and put your feet on the necks of these kings. So they came near and put their feet on",their necks.,,,,,,
4640,"And Joshua said to them, Have no fear and do not be troubled; be strong and take heart: for so will the Lord do to all against whom you make war.",,,,,,,
4641,"Then Joshua had them put to death, hanging them on five trees, where they were till evening.",,,,,,,
4642,"And when the sun went down, they were taken down from the trees, by Joshua's orders, and put into the hole where they had gone to be safe; and great stones were placed at the mouth of the hole, where they are to this day.",,,,,,,
4643,"That day Joshua took Makkedah, and put it and its king to the sword; every soul in it he gave up to the curse without mercy: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.",,,,,,,
4644,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Makkedah and came to Libnah, and made an attack on it;",,,,,,,
4645,"And again the Lord gave it and its king into the hands of Israel; and he put it and every person in it to the sword, till their destruction was complete; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.",,,,,,,
4646,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Libnah to Lachish, and took up their position against it and made an attack on it,",,,,,,,
4647,"And the Lord gave Lachish into the hands of Israel, and on the second day he took it, putting it and every person in it to the sword without mercy, as he had done to Libnah.",,,,,,,
4648,"Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to the help of Lachish; and Joshua overcame him and his people, putting all of them to death.",,,,,,,
4649,And Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Lachish to Eglon: and they took up their position against it and made an attack on it;,,,,,,,
4650,"And that day they took it, putting it and every person in it to the sword, as he had done to Lachish.",,,,,,,
4651,"And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and made an attack on it;",,,,,,,
4652,"And took it, overcoming it and putting it and its king and its towns and every person in it to the sword: as he had done to Eglon, he put them all to death, and gave it up to the curse with every person in it.",,,,,,,
4653,And Joshua and all Israel with him went on to make an attack on Debir;,,,,,,,
4654,"And he took it, with its king and all its towns: and he put them to the sword, giving every person in it to the curse; all were put to death: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king.",,,,,,,
4655,"So Joshua overcame all the land, the hill-country and the South and the lowland and the mountain slopes, and all their kings; all were put to death: and every living thing he gave up to the curse, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had given him orders.",,,,,,,
4656,"Joshua overcame them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen as far as Gibeon.",,,,,,,
4657,"And all these kings and their land Joshua took at the same time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, was fighting for Israel.",,,,,,,
4658,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him went back to their tents at Gilgal.Now Jabin, king of Hazor, hearing of these things, sent to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,",,,,,,,
4659,"And to the kings on the north in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the highlands of Dor on the west,",,,,,,,
4660,"And to the Canaanites on the east and on the west, and to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill- country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.",,,,,,,
4661,"And they went out, they and all their armies with them, a great people, in number like the sand on the seaside, with horses and war-carriages in great number.",,,,,,,
4662,"And all these kings came together, and put their forces in position at the waters of Merom, to make war on Israel.",,,,,,,
4663,"And the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear of them: for tomorrow at this time I will give them all up dead before Israel; you are to have the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.",,,,,,,
4664,"So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and made an attack on them.",,,,,,,
4665,"And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Israel, and they overcame them driving them back to great Zidon and to Misrephoth-maim and into the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they put them all to death, no man got away safely.",,,,,,,
4666,And Joshua did to them as the Lord had said to him; he had the leg-muscles of their horses cut and their war-carriages burned with fire.,,,,,,,
4667,"At that time, Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword: for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms.",,,,,,,
4668,"And they put every person in it to death without mercy, giving every living thing up to the curse, and burning Hazor.",,,,,,,
4669,"And all the towns of these kings, and all the kings, Joshua took, and put them to the sword: he gave them up to the curse, as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had said.",,,,,,,
4670,"As for the towns made on hills of earth, not one was burned by Israel but Hazor, which was burned by Joshua.",,,,,,,
4671,"And all the goods taken from these towns, and their cattle, the children of Israel kept for themselves; but every man they put to death without mercy, till their destruction was complete, and there was no one living.",,,,,,,
4672,"As the Lord had given orders to Moses his servant, so Moses gave orders to Joshua, and so Joshua did; every order which the Lord had given to Moses was done.",,,,,,,
4673,"So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland and the Arabah, the hill-country of Israel and its lowland;",,,,,,,
4674,"From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon: and all their kings he overcame and put to death.",,,,,,,
4675,For a long time Joshua made war on all those kings.,,,,,,,
4676,"Not one town made peace with the children of Israel, but only the Hivites of Gibeon: they took them all in war.",,,,,,,
4677,"For the Lord made them strong in heart to go to war against Israel, so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy, and that destruction might come on them, as the Lord had given orders to Moses.",,,,,,,
4678,"And Joshua came at that time and put an end to the Anakim in the hill-country, in Hebron, in Debir, in Anab, and in all the hill-country of Judah and Israel: Joshua gave them and their towns to the curse.",,,,,,,
4679,"Not one of the Anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, some were still living.",,,,,,,
4680,"So Joshua took all the land, as the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it to the children of Israel as their heritage, making division of it among them by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.Now these are the kings of the land whom the chil",ren of Israe,ov,r,ame,tak,ng,s the

5078,"Naphtali did not take the land of the people of Beth-shemesh or of Beth- anath, driving them out; but he was living among the Canaanites in the land; however, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were put to forced work.",,,,,,,
5079,"And the children of Dan were forced into the hill-country by the Amorites, who would not let them come down into the valley;",,,,,,,
5080,"For the Amorites would go on living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but the children of Joseph became stronger than they, and put them to forced work.",,,,,,,
5081,"And the limit of the Edomites went from the slope of Akrabbim from Sela and up.Now the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, ***I took you out of Egypt, guiding you into the land which I gave by an oath to your fathers; and I said",My agreemen,wi,h,you,will,nev,r be

5084,"Now on hearing these words which the angel of the Lord said to all the children of Israel, the people gave themselves up to loud crying and weeping.",,,,,,,
5085,"And they gave that place the name of Bochim, and made offerings there to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5086,"And Joshua let the people go away, and the children of Israel went, every man to his heritage, to take the land for themselves.",,,,,,,
5087,"And the people were true to the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the responsible men who were still living after the death of Joshua, and had seen all the great work of the Lord which he had done for Israel.",,,,,,,
5088,"And death came to Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, he being a hundred and ten years old.",,,,,,,
5089,"And they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim to the north of Mount Gaash.",,,,,,,
5090,"And in time death overtook all that generation; and another generation came after them, having no knowledge of the Lord or of the things which he had done for Israel.",,,,,,,
5091,And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord and became servants to the Baals;,,,,,,,
5092,"And they gave up the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had taken them out of the land of Egypt, and went after other gods, the gods of the peoples round about them, worshipping them and moving the Lord to wrath.",,,,,,,
5093,"And they gave up the Lord, and became the servants of Baal and the Astartes.",,,,,,,
5094,"And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he gave them up into the hands of those who violently took their property, and into the hands of their haters all round them, so that they were forced to give way before them.",,,,,,,
5095,"Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had taken his oath it would be; and things became very hard for them.",,,,,,,
5096,"Then the Lord gave them judges, as their saviours from the hands of those who were cruel to them.",,,,,,,
5097,"But still they would not give ear to their judges, but went after other gods and gave them worship; quickly turning from the way in which their fathers had gone, keeping the orders of the Lord; but they did not do so.",,,,,,,

5099,"But whenever the judge was dead, they went back and did more evil than their fathers, going after other gods, to be their servants and their worshippers; giving up nothing of their sins and their hard-hearted ways.",,,,,,,

5101,From now on I will not go on driving out from before them any of the nations which at the death of Joshua were still living in this land;,,,,,,,

5103,"So the Lord let those nations go on living in the land, not driving them out quickly, and did not give them up into the hands of Joshua.Now these are the nations which the Lord kept in the land for the purpose of testing Israel by them, all those who had",had no exper,enc,,f a,l th,wa,s of

5109,"And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and put out of their minds the Lord their God, and became servants to the Baals and the Astartes.",,,,,,,
5110,"So the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he gave them up into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel were his servants for eight years.",,,,,,,
5111,"And when the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord, he gave them a saviour, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.",,,,,,,
5112,"And the spirit of the Lord came on him and he became judge of Israel, and went out to war, and the Lord gave up Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hands and he overcame him.",,,,,,,
5113,"Then for forty years the land had peace, till the death of Othniel, the son of Kenaz.",,,,,,,
5114,"Then the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord made Eglon, king of Moab, strong against Israel, because they had done evil in the Lord's eyes.",,,,,,,
5115,"And Eglon got together the people of Ammon and Amalek, and they went and overcame Israel and took the town of palm-trees.",,,,,,,
5116,"And the children of Israel were servants to Eglon, king of Moab, for eighteen years.",,,,,,,
5117,"Then when the children of Israel made prayer to the Lord, he gave them a saviour, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man; and the children of Israel sent an offering by him to Eglon, king of Moab.",,,,,,,
5118,"So Ehud made himself a two-edged sword, a cubit long, which he put on at his right side under his robe.",,,,,,,
5119,"And he took the offering to Eglon, king of Moab, who was a very fat man.",,,,,,,
5120,"And after giving the offering, he sent away the people who had come with the offering.",,,,,,,
5121,"But he himself, turning back from the stone images at Gilgal, said, I have something to say to you in secret, O king. And he said, Let there be quiet. Then all those who were waiting before him went out.",,,,,,,
5122,"Then Ehud came in to him while he was seated by himself in his summer-house. And Ehud said, I have a word from God for you. And he got up from his seat.",,,,,,,
5123,"And Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right side, and sent it into his stomach;",,,,,,,
5124,"And the hand-part went in after the blade, and the fat was joined up over the blade; for he did not take the sword out of his stomach. And he went out into the ...",,,,,,,
5125,"Then Ehud went out into the covered way, shutting the doors of the summer-house on him and locking them.",,,,,,,
5126,"Now when he had gone, the king's servants came, and saw that the doors of the summer-house were locked; and they said, It may be that he is in his summer-house for a private purpose.",,,,,,,
5127,"And they went on waiting till they were shamed, but the doors were still shut; so they took the key, and, opening them, saw their lord stretched out dead on the floor.",,,,,,,
5128,But Ehud had got away while they were waiting and had gone past the stone images and got away to Seirah.,,,,,,,
5129,"And when he came there, he had a horn sounded in the hill-country of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he at their head.",,,,,,,
5130,"And he said to them, Come after me; for the Lord has given the Moabites, your haters, into your hands. So they went down after him and took the crossing-places of Jordan against Moab, and let no one go across.",,,,,,,
5131,"At that time they put about ten thousand men of Moab to the sword, every strong man and every man of war; not a man got away.",,,,,,,
5132,So Moab was broken that day under the hand of Israel. And for eighty years the land had peace.,,,,,,,
5133,"And after him came Shamgar, the son of Anath, who put to death six hundred Philistines with an ox-stick; and he was another saviour of Israel.And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord when Ehud was dead.",,,,,,,
5134,"And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Jabin, king of Canaan, who was ruling in Hazor; the captain of his army was Sisera, who was living in Harosheth of the Gentiles.",,,,,,,

5136,"NowDeborah, a woman prophet, the wife of Lapidoth, was judge of Israel at that time.",,,,,,,
5137,(And she had her seat under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her to be judged.),,,,,,,
5138,"And she sent for Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Has not the Lord, the God of Israel, given orders saying, Go and get your force into line in Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali an",of the chil,ren,o,Ze,ulun,,
5139,"And I will make Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his war-carriages and his forces, come against you at the river Kishon, where I will give him into your hands.",,,,,,,
5140,"And Barak said to her, If you will go with me then I will go; but if you will not go with me I will not go.",,,,,,,
5141,"And she said, I will certainly go with you: though you will get no honour in your undertaking, for the Lord will give Sisera into the hands of a woman. So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.",,,,,,,
5142,"Then Barak sent for Zebulun and Naphtali to come to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up after him, and Deborah went up with him.",,,,,,,
5143,"Now Heber the Kenite, separating himself from the rest of the Kenites, from the children of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, had put up his tent as far away as the oak-tree in Zaanannim, by Kedesh.",,,,,,,
5144,"And word was given to Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.",,,,,,,
5145,"So Sisera got together all his war-carriages, nine hundred war-carriages of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles as far as the river Kishon.",,,,,,,
5146,"Then Deborah said to Barak, Up! for today the Lord has given Sisera into your hands: has not the Lord gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him.",,,,,,,
5147,And the Lord sent fear on Sisera and all his war-carriages and all his army before Barak; and Sisera got down from his war-carriage and went in flight on foot.,,,,,,,
5148,But Barak went after the war-carriages and the army as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all Sisera's army was put to the sword; not a man got away.,,,,,,,
5149,"But Sisera went in flight on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin, king of Hazor, and the family of Heber the Kenite.",,,,,,,
5150,"And Jael went out to Sisera, and said to him, Come in, my lord, come in to me without fear. So he went into her tent, and she put a cover over him.",,,,,,,
5151,"Then he said to her, Give me now a little water, for I have need of a drink. And opening a skin of milk, she gave him drink, and put the cover over him again.",,,,,,,
5152,"And he said to her, Take your place at the door of the tent, and if anyone comes and says to you, Is there any man here, say, No.",,,,,,,
5153,"Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent-pin and a hammer and went up to him quietly, driving the pin into his head, and it went through his head into the earth, for he was in a deep sleep from weariness; and so he came to his end.",,,,,,,
5154,"Then Jael went out, and meeting Barak going after Sisera, said to him, Come, and I will let you see the man you are searching for. So he came into her tent and saw, and there was Sisera stretched out dead with the tent-pin in his head.",,,,,,,
5155,"So that day God overcame Jabin, king of Canaan, before the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
5156,"And the power of the children of Israel went on increasing against Jabin, king of Canaan, till he was cut off.At that time Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, made this song, saying:",,,,,,,
5157,"Because of the flowing hair of the fighters in Israel, because the people gave themselves freely, give praise to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5158,"Give attention, O kings; give ear, O rulers; I, even I, will make a song to the Lord; I will make melody to the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
5159,"Lord, when you went out from Seir, moving like an army from the field of Edom, the earth was shaking and the heavens were troubled, and the clouds were dropping water.",,,,,,,
5160,"The mountains were shaking before the Lord, before the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
5161,"In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were not used, and travellers went by side roads.",,,,,,,
5162,"Country towns were no more in Israel, ***were no more, till you, Deborah, came up, till you came up as a mother in Israel.",,,,,,,
5163,"They had no one to make arms, there were no more armed men in the towns; was there a body-cover or a spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?",,,,,,,
5164,"Come, you rulers of Israel, you who gave yourselves freely among the people: give praise to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5165,"Let them give thought to it, who go on white asses, and those who are walking on the road.",,,,,,,
5166,"Give ear to the women laughing by the water-springs; there they will give again the story of the upright acts of the Lord, all the upright acts of his arm in Israel.",,,,,,,
5167,"Awake! awake! Deborah: awake! awake! give a song: Up! Barak, and take prisoner those who took you prisoner, O son of Abinoam.",,,,,,,
5168,Then the chiefs went down to the doors; the Lord's people went down among the strong ones.,,,,,,,
5169,"Out of Ephraim they came down into the valley; after you, Benjamin, among your tribesmen; from Machir came down the captains, and from Zebulun those in whose hand is the ruler's rod.",,,,,,,
5170,"Your chiefs, Issachar, were with Deborah; and Naphtali was true to Barak; into the valley they went rushing out at his feet. In Reuben there were divisions, and great searchings of heart.",,,,,,,
5171,"Why did you keep quiet among the sheep, hearing nothing but the watchers piping to the flocks?",,,,,,,
5172,"Gilead was living over Jordan; and Dan was waiting in his ships; Asher kept in his place by the sea's edge, living by his inlets.",,,,,,,
5173,"It was the people of Zebulun who put their lives in danger, even to death, with Naphtali on the high places of the field.",,,,,,,
5174,"The kings came on to the fight, the kings of Canaan were warring; in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they took no profit in money.",,,,,,,
5175,The stars from heaven were fighting; from their highways they were fighting against Sisera.,,,,,,,
5176,"The river Kishon took them violently away, stopping their flight, the river Kishon. Give praise, O my soul, to the strength of the Lord!",,,,,,,
5177,"Then loudly the feet of the horses were sounding with the stamping, the stamping of their war-horses.",,,,,,,
5178,"A curse, a curse on Meroz! said the angel of the Lord. A bitter curse on her townspeople! Because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord among the strong ones.",,,,,,,
5179,"Blessings be on Jael, more than on all women! Blessings greater than on any in the tents!",,,,,,,
5180,"His request was for water, she gave him milk; she put butter before him on a fair plate.",,,,,,,
5181,"She put out her hand to the tent-pin, and her right hand to the workman's hammer; and she gave Sisera a blow, crushing his head, wounding and driving through his brow.",,,,,,,
5182,"Bent at her feet he went down, he was stretched out; bent at her feet he went down; where he was bent down, there he went down in death.",,,,,,,
5183,"Looking out from the window she gave a cry, the mother of Sisera was crying out through the window, Why is his carriage so long in coming? When will the noise of his wheels be sounding?",,,,,,,
5184,"Her wise women gave answer to her, yes, she made answer again to herself,",,,,,,,
5185,"Are they not getting, are they not parting the goods among them: a young girl or two to every man; and to Sisera robes of coloured needlework, worked in fair colours on this side and on that, for the neck of the queen?",,,,,,,
5186,"So may destruction come on all your haters, O Lord; but let your lovers be like the sun going out in his strength. And for forty years the land had peace.And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord gave them up into the hand",of Midian fo,se,e,ye,rs.,,
5187,"And Midian was stronger than Israel; and because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made holes for themselves in the mountains, and hollows in the rocks, and strong places.",,,,,,,
5188,"And whenever Israel's grain was planted, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came up against them;",,,,,,,
5189,"And put their army in position against them; and they took all the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, till there was no food in Israel, or any sheep or oxen or asses.",,,,,,,
5190,For they came up regularly with their oxen and their tents; they came like the locusts in number; they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land for its destruction.,,,,,,,
5191,And Israel was in great need because of Midian; and the cry of the children of Israel went up to the Lord.,,,,,,,
5192,"And when the cry of the children of Israel, because of Midian, came before the Lord,",,,,,,,
5193,"The Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, The Lord the God of Israel, has said, I took you up from Egypt, out of the prison-house;",,,,,,,
5194,"And I took you out of the hands of the Egyptians and out of the hands of all who were cruel to you, and I sent them out by force from before you and gave you their land;",,,,,,,
5195,"And I said to you, I am the Lord your God; you are not to give worship to the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living, but you did not give ear to my voice.",,,,,,,
5196,"Now the angel of the Lord came and took his seat under the oak-tree in Ophrah, in the field of Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon was crushing grain in the place where the grapes were crushed, so that the Midianites might not see it.",,,,,,,
5197,"And the angel of the Lord came before his eyes, and said to him, The Lord is with you, O man of war.",,,,,,,
5198,"Then Gideon said to him, O my lord, if the Lord is with us why has all this come on us? And where are all his works of power, of which our fathers have given us word, saying, Did not the Lord take us out of Egypt? But now he has given us up, handing us o",er to the po,er,f,Mid,an.,,
5199,"And the Lord, turning to him, said, Go in the strength you have and be Israel's saviour from Midian: have I not sent you?",,,,,,,
5200,"And he said to him, O Lord, how may I be the saviour of Israel? See, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.",,,,,,,
5201,"Then the Lord said to him, Truly, I will be with you, and you will overcome the Midianites as if they were one man.",,,,,,,
5202,"So he said to him, If now I have grace in your eyes, then give me a sign that it is you who are talking to me.",,,,,,,
5203,"Do not go away till I come with my offering and put it before you. And he said, I will not go away before you come back.",,,,,,,
5204,"Then Gideon went in and made ready a young goat, and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes: he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot, and he took it out to him under the oak-tree and gave it to him the",e.,,,,,,
5205,"And the angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them down on the rock over there, draining out the soup over them. And he did so.",,,,,,,
5206,"Then the angel of the Lord put out the stick which was in his hand, touching the meat and the cakes with the end of it; and a flame came up out of the rock, burning up the meat and the cakes: and the angel of the Lord was seen no longer.",,,,,,,
5207,"Then Gideon was certain that he was the angel of the Lord; and Gideon said, I am in fear, O Lord God! for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.",,,,,,,
5208,"But the Lord said to him, Peace be with you; have no fear: you are in no danger of death.",,,,,,,
5209,"Then Gideon made an altar there to the Lord, and gave it the name Yahweh-shalom; to this day it is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.",,,,,,,
5210,"The same night the Lord said to him, Take ten men of your servants and an ox seven years old, and after pulling down the altar of Baal which is your father's, and cutting down the holy tree by its side,",,,,,,,
5211,"Make an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered way and take the ox and make a burned offering with the wood of the holy tree which has been cut down.",,,,,,,
5212,"Then Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had said to him; but fearing to do it by day, because of his father's people and the men of the town, he did it by night.",,,,,,,
5213,"And the men of the town got up early in the morning, and they saw the altar of Baal broken down, and the holy tree which was by it cut down, and the ox offered on the altar which had been put up there.",,,,,,,
5214,"And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And after searching with care, they said, Gideon, the son of Joash, has done this thing.",,,,,,,
5215,"Then the men of the town said to Joash, Make your son come out to be put to death, for pulling down the altar of Baal and cutting down the holy tree which was by it.",,,,,,,
5216,"But Joash said to all those who were attacking him, Will you take up the cause of Baal? will you be his saviour? Let anyone who will take up his cause be put to death while it is still morning: if he is a god, let him take up his cause himself because of",the pulling,own,o,hi,alt,r.,
5217,"So that day he gave him the name of Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal take up his cause against him because his altar has been broken down.",,,,,,,
5218,"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east, banding themselves together, went over and put up their tents in the valley of Jezreel.",,,,,,,
5219,But the spirit of the Lord came on Gideon; and at the sound of his horn all Abiezer came together after him.,,,,,,,
5220,"And he sent through all Manasseh, and they came after him; and he sent to Asher and Zebulun and Naphtali, and they came up and were joined to the others.",,,,,,,
5221,"Then Gideon said to God, If you are going to give Israel salvation by my hand, as you have said,",,,,,,,
5222,"See, I will put the wool of a sheep on the grain-floor; if there is dew on the wool only, while all the earth is dry, then I will be certain that it is your purpose to give Israel salvation by my hand as you have said.",,,,,,,
5223,"And it was so: for he got up early on the morning after, and twisting the wool in his hands, he got a basin full of water from the dew on the wool.",,,,,,,
5224,"Then Gideon said to God, Do not be moved to wrath against me if I say only this: let me make one more test with the wool; let the wool now be dry, while the earth is covered with dew.",,,,,,,
5225,"And that night God did so; for the wool was dry, and there was dew on all the earth round it.Then Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, and all the people with him, got up early and put up their tents by the side of the water-spring of Harod; the tents of Midian w",re on the no,th,i,e o,him,un,er th
5226,"And the Lord said to Gideon, So great is the number of your people, that if I give the Midianites into their hands they will be uplifted in pride over me and will say, I myself have been my saviour.",,,,,,,
5227,"So now, let it be given out to the people that anyone who is shaking with fear is to go back from Mount Galud. So twenty-two thousand of the people went back, but there were still ten thousand.",,,,,,,
5228,"Then the Lord said to Gideon, There are still more people than is necessary; take them down to the water so that I may put them to the test for you there; then whoever I say is to go with you will go, and whoever I say is not to go will not go.",,,,,,,
5229,"So he took the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gideon, Put on one side by themselves all those drinking up the water with their tongues like a dog; and in the same way, all those who go down on their knees to the water while drinking.",,,,,,,
5230,Now the number of those who took up the water with their tongues was three hundred; all the rest of the people went down on their knees to the water.,,,,,,,
5231,"And the Lord said to Gideon, By those three hundred who were drinking with their tongues I will give you salvation and give the Midianites into your hands; let the rest of the people go away, every man to his place.",,,,,,,
5232,"So they took the vessels of the people, and their horns from their hands, and he sent them away, every man to his tent, keeping only the three hundred; and the tents of Midian were lower down in the valley.",,,,,,,
5233,"The same night the Lord said to him, Up! go down now against their army, for I have given them into your hands.",,,,,,,
5234,"But if you have fear of going down, take your servant Purah with you and go down to the tents;",,,,,,,
5235,"And after hearing what they are saying, you will get strength to go down against the army. So he went down with his servant Purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men.",,,,,,,
5236,"Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the east were covering the valley like locusts; and their camels were like the sand by the seaside, without number.",,,,,,,
5237,"When Gideon came there, a man was giving his friend an account of his dream, saying, See, I had a dream about a cake of barley bread which, falling into the tents of Midian, came on to the tent, overturning it so that it was stretched out flat on the ear",h.,,,,,,
5238,"And his friend in answer said, This is certainly the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, the men of Israel: into their hands God has given up all the army of Midian.",,,,,,,
5239,"Then Gideon, hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it, gave worship; then he went back to the tents of Israel, and said, Up! for the Lord has given the army of Midian into your hands.",,,,,,,
5240,"Then separating the three hundred men into three bands, he gave every man a horn, and a vessel in which was a flaming branch.",,,,,,,
5241,"And he said to them, Keep your eyes on me, and do what I do; when I come to the outer line of tents, whatever I do, you are to do the same.",,,,,,,
5242,"At the sound of my horn, and the horns of those who are with me, let your horns be sounded all round the tents, and say, For the Lord and for Gideon.",,,,,,,
5243,"So Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the outer line of tents, at the start of the middle watch, when the watchmen had only then taken their stations; and the horns were sounded and the vessels broken.",,,,,,,
5244,"So the three bands all gave a loud note on their horns, and when the vessels had been broken, they took the flaming branches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands ready for blowing, crying out, For the Lord and for Gideon.",,,,,,,
5245,"Then they made a line round the tents, every man in his place; and all the army, awaking from sleep, came running out, and with loud cries went in flight.",,,,,,,
5246,"And the three hundred gave a loud note on their horns, and every man's sword was turned by the Lord against his brother all through the army; and the army went in flight as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zeredah, to the edge of Abel-meholah by T",bbath.,,,,,,
5247,"And the men of Israel came together from Naphtali and from Asher and all Manasseh, and went after Midian.",,,,,,,
5248,"Then Gideon sent through all the hill-country of Ephraim saying, Come down against Midian, and keep the ways across Jordan before they come. So all the men of Ephraim, massing themselves together, kept the ways across Jordan.",,,,,,,
5249,"And they took the two chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they put Oreb to death at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they put to death at the place of the grape-crushing in Zeeb, and they went after Midian; but the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they took across Jord",n to Gideon.,nd,h,me,of,phr,im ca
5250,"And he said to them, What have I done in comparison with you? Is not that which Ephraim took up after the grape-cutting better than all the grapes which Abiezer got in from the grape- cutting?",,,,,,,
5251,"God has given into your hands the chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you? And when he said this, their feeling about him became kinder.",,,,,,,
5252,"Then Gideon came to Jordan and went over it with his three hundred, overcome with weariness and in need of food.",,,,,,,
5253,"And he said to the men of Succoth, Give bread cakes to my people, for they are overcome with weariness, and I am going on after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.",,,,,,,
5254,"But the chiefs of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army?",,,,,,,
5255,"Then Gideon said, Because of this, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems, and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grain-floor.",,,,,,,
5256,So he went up from there to Penuel and made the same request to the men of Penuel; but they gave him the same answer as the men of Succoth had given.,,,,,,,
5257,"So he said to the men of Penuel, When I come back in peace, I will have this tower broken down.",,,,,,,
5258,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living; for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death.",,,,,,,
5259,"And Gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger.",,,,,,,
5260,"And Zebah and Zalmunna went in flight; and he went after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and put all the army to the curse.",,,,,,,
5261,"Then Gideon, the son of Joash, went back from the fight:",,,,,,,
5262,"And taking prisoner a young man of the people of Succoth, he got from him, in answer to his questions, a list of the chiefs of Succoth and the responsible men, seventy-seven men.",,,,,,,
5263,"So he came to the men of Succoth and said, Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, on account of whom you made sport of me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand, that we are to give bread to your army who are overcome with weariness?",,,,,,,
5264,Then he took the responsible men of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems.,,,,,,,
5265,And he had the tower of Penuel broken down and the men of the town put to death.,,,,,,,
5266,"Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, Where are the men whom you put to death at Tabor? And they gave answer, As you are, so were they; every one of them was like a king's son.",,,,,,,
5267,"And he said, They were my brothers, my mother's sons: by the life of the Lord, if you had kept them safe, I would not put you to death.",,,,,,,
5268,"Then he said to Jether, his oldest son, Up! Put them to death. But the boy did not take out his sword, fearing because he was still a boy.",,,,,,,
5269,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Up! Put an end to us yourself: for you have a man's strength. Then Gideon got up and put Zebah and Zalmunna to death and took the ornaments which were on their camels' necks.",,,,,,,
5270,"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Be our ruler, you and your son and your son's son after him; for you have been our saviour from the hands of Midian.",,,,,,,
5271,"But Gideon said to them, I will not be a ruler over you, and my son will not be a ruler over you: it is the Lord who will be ruler over you.",,,,,,,
5272,"Then Gideon said to them, I have a request to make to you; let every man give me the ear-rings he has taken. (For they had gold ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)",,,,,,,
5273,"And they gave answer, We will gladly give them. So they put down a robe, every man dropping into it the ear-rings he had taken.",,,,,,,
5274,"The weight of the gold ear-rings which he got from them was one thousand, seven hundred shekels of gold; in addition to the moon-ornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and the chains on their camels' necks.",,,,,,,
5275,And Gideon made an ephod from them and put it up in his town Ophrah; and all Israel went after it there and were false to the Lord; and it became a cause of sin to Gideon and his house.,,,,,,,
5276,"So Midian was broken before the children of Israel and the Midianites never got back their strength. And the land had peace for forty years, in the days of Gideon.",,,,,,,
5277,"And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went back to his house and was living there.",,,,,,,
5278,"Gideon had seventy sons, the offspring of his body; for he had a number of wives.",,,,,,,
5279,"And the servant-wife he had in Shechem had a son by him, to whom he gave the name Abimelech.",,,,,,,
5280,"AndGideon, thesonofJoash, cametohisendwhenhewasveryold, andhis body was put in the resting-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.",,,,,,,
5281,"And after the death of Gideon, the children of Israel again went after the gods of Canaan and were false to the Lord, and made Baal-berith their god.",,,,,,,
5282,"And the children of Israel did not keep in their minds the Lord their God, who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side;",,,,,,,
5283,"And they were not kind to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in reward for all the good he had done to Israel.Now Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem to his mother's family, and said to them and to all the family of his mother's father",,,,,,,
5284,"Say now in the ears of all the townsmen of Shechem, Is it better for you to be ruled by all the seventy sons of Jerubbaal or by one man only? And keep in mind that I am your bone and your flesh.",,,,,,,
5285,"So his mother's family said all this about him in the ears of all the townsmen of Shechem: and their hearts were turned to Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.",,,,,,,
5286,"And they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech got the support of a number of uncontrolled and good-for-nothing persons.",,,,,,,
5287,"Then he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and put his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, to death on the same stone; however, Jotham, the youngest, kepthimself safe by going away to a secret place.",,,,,,,
5288,"And all the townsmen of Shechem and all Beth-millo came together and went and made Abimelech their king, by the oak of the pillar in Shechem.",,,,,,,
5289,"Now Jotham, on hearing of it, went to the top of Mount Gerizim, and crying out with a loud voice said to them, Give ear to me, you townsmen of Shechem, so that God may give ear to you.",,,,,,,
5290,"One day the trees went out to make a king for themselves; and they said to the olive-tree, Be king over us.",,,,,,,
5291,"But the olive-tree said to them, Am I to give up my wealth of oil, by which men give honour to God, and go waving over the trees?",,,,,,,
5292,"Then the trees said to the fig-tree, You come and be king over us.",,,,,,,
5293,"But the fig-tree said to them, Am I to give up my sweet taste and my good fruit and go waving over the trees?",,,,,,,
5294,"Then the trees said to the vine, You come and be king over us.",,,,,,,
5295,"But the vine said to them, Am I to give up my wine, which makes glad God and men, to go waving over the trees?",,,,,,,
5296,"Then all the trees said to the thorn, You come and be king over us.",,,,,,,
5297,"And the thorn said to the trees, If it is truly your desire to make me your king, then come and put your faith in my shade; and if not, may fire come out of the thorn, burning up the cedars of Lebanon.",,,,,,,
5298,"So now, if you have done truly and uprightly in making Abimelech king, and if you have done well to Jerubbaal and his house in reward for the work of his hands;",,,,,,,
5299,"(For my father made war for you, and put his life in danger, and made you free from the hands of Midian;",,,,,,,
5300,"And you have gone against my father's family this day, and have put to death his sons, even seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his servant-wife, king over the townsmen of Shechem because he is your brother;)",,,,,,,
5301,"If then you have done what is true and upright to Jerubbaal and his family this day, may you have joy in Abimelech, and may he have joy in you;",,,,,,,
5302,"But if not, may fire come out from Abimelech, burning up the townsmen of Shechem and Beth-millo; and may fire come out from the townsmen of Shechem and Beth-millo, for the destruction of Abimelech.",,,,,,,
5303,"Then Jotham straight away went in flight to Beer, and was living there for fear of his brother Abimelech.",,,,,,,
5304,So Abimelech was chief over Israel for three years.,,,,,,,
5305,And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the townsmen of Shechem; and the townsmen of Shechem were false to Abimelech;,,,,,,,
5306,"So that punishment for the violent attack made on the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, and for their blood, might come on Abimelech, their brother, who put them to death, and on the townsmen of Shechem who gave him their help in putting his brothers to death.",,,,,,,
5307,"And the townsmen of Shechem put secret watchers on the tops of the mountains, and they made attacks on all who went by on the road and took their goods; and word of this came to Abimelech.",,,,,,,
5308,"Then Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their faith in him.",,,,,,,
5309,"And they went out into their fields and got in the fruit of their vines, and when the grapes had been crushed, they made a holy feast and went into the house of their god, and over their food and drink they were cursing Abimelech.",,,,,,,
5310,"And Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem, that we are to be his servants? Is it not right for the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his captain to be servants to the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem? But why are we to be his serva",ts?,,,,,,
5311,"If only I had authority over this people! I would put Abimelech out of the way, and I would say to Abimelech, Make your army strong, and come out.",,,,,,,
5312,"Now Zebul, the ruler of the town, hearing what Gaal, the son of Ebed, had said, was moved to wrath.",,,,,,,
5313,"And he sent to Abimelech at Arumah, saying, See, Gaal, the son of Ebed, and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are working up the town against you.",,,,,,,
5314,"So now, get up by night, you and your people, and keep watch in the field secretly;",,,,,,,
5315,"And in the morning, when the sun is up, get up early and make a rush on the town; and when he and his people come out against you, do to them whatever you have a chance to do.",,,,,,,
5316,"So Abimelech and the people with him got up by night, in four bands, to make a surprise attack on Shechem.",,,,,,,
5317,"And Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out, and took his place at the doorway into the town; then Abimelech and his people got up from the place where they had been waiting.",,,,,,,
5318,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, See! people are coming down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, You see the shade of the mountains like men.",,,,,,,
5319,"And Gaal said again, See! people are coming down from the middle of the land, and one band is coming by way of the oak-tree of the Seers.",,,,,,,
5320,"Then Zebul said to him, Now where is your loud talk when you said, Who is Abimelech that we are to be his servants? Is this not the people whom you were rating so low? Go out now, and make war on them.",,,,,,,
5321,So Gaal went out at the head of the townsmen of Shechem and made war on Abimelech.,,,,,,,
5322,And Abimelech went after him and he went in flight before him; and a great number were falling by the sword all the way up to the town.,,,,,,,
5323,Then Abimelech went back to Arumah; and Zebul sent Gaal and his brothers away and would not let them go on living in Shechem.,,,,,,,
5324,"Now the day after, the people went out into the fields; and news of it came to Abimelech.",,,,,,,
5325,"And he took his people, separating them into three bands, and was waiting secretly in the field; and when he saw the people coming out of the town, he went up and made an attack on them.",,,,,,,
5326,"And Abimelech with his band made a rush, and took up their position at the doorway into the town; and the other two bands made a rush on all those who were in the fields, and overcame them.",,,,,,,
5327,"And all that day Abimelech was fighting against the town; and he took it, and put to death the people who were in it, and had the town pulled down and covered with salt.",,,,,,,
5328,"Then all the townsmen of the tower of Shechem, hearing of it, went into the inner room of the house of El-berith.",,,,,,,
5329,And word was given to Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were there together.,,,,,,,
5330,"Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, with all his people; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and, cutting down branches of trees, took them and put them on his back. And he said to the people who were with him, Be quick and do as you have seen me d",.,,,,,,
5331,"So all the people got branches, every man cutting down a branch, and they went with Abimelech at their head and, massing the branches against the inner room, put fire to the room over them; so all those who were in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand",en and women,we,e,bur,ed t,de,th wi
5332,"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and put his army in position against Thebez and took it.",,,,,,,
5333,"But in the middle of the town there was a strong tower, to which all the men and women of the town went in flight and, shutting themselves in, went up to the roof of the tower.",,,,,,,
5334,"And Abimelech came to the tower and made an attack on it, and got near to the door of the tower for the purpose of firing it.",,,,,,,
5335,"But a certain woman sent a great stone, such as is used for crushing grain, on to the head of Abimelech, cracking the bone.",,,,,,,
5336,"Then quickly crying out to his body-servant, he said to him, Take out your sword and put an end to me straight away, so that men may not say of me, His death was the work of a woman. So the young man put his sword through him, causing his death.",,,,,,,
5337,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they went away, every man to his place.",,,,,,,
5338,In this way Abimelech was rewarded by God for the evil he had done to his father in putting his seventy brothers to death;,,,,,,,
5339,"And God sent back on to the heads of the men of Shechem all the evil they had done, and the curse of Jotham, the son of Jerubbaal, came on them.Now after Abimelech, Tola, the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, became the saviour of Israel;",e was living,in,h,mir,in t,e h,ll-co
5340,He was judge over Israel for twenty-three years; and at his death his body was put to rest in the earth in Shamir.,,,,,,,
5341,"And after him came Jair the Gileadite, who was judge over Israel for twenty-two years.",,,,,,,
5342,"And he had thirty sons, who went on thirty young asses; and they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which are named Havvoth-Jair to this day.",,,,,,,
5343,And at the death of Jair his body was put to rest in the earth in Kamon.,,,,,,,
5344,"And again the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord, worshipping the Baals and Astartes, and the gods of Aram and the gods of Zidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines; they gave up the",Lord and wer,se,v,nts,to h,m n,long
5345,"And the wrath of the Lord was burning against Israel, and he gave them up into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
5346,"And that year the children of Israel were crushed under their yoke; for eighteen years all the children of Israel on the other side of Jordan, in the land of the Amorites which is in Gilead, were cruelly crushed down.",,,,,,,
5347,"And the children of Ammon went over Jordan, to make war against Judah and Benjamin and the house of Ephraim; and Israel was in great trouble.",,,,,,,
5348,"Then the children of Israel, crying out to the Lord, said, Great is our sin against you, for we have given up our God and have been servants to the Baals.",,,,,,,
5349,"And the Lord said to the children of Israel, Were not the Egyptians and the Amorites and the children of Ammon and the Philistines",,,,,,,
5350,"And the Zidonians and Amalek and Midian crushing you down, and in answer to your cry did I not give you salvation from their hands?",,,,,,,
5351,"But, for all this, you have given me up and have been servants to other gods: so I will be your saviour no longer.",,,,,,,
5352,"Go, send up your cry for help to the gods of your selection; let them be your saviours in the time of your trouble.",,,,,,,
5353,"And the children of Israel said to the Lord, We are sinners; do to us whatever seems good to you: only give us salvation this day.",,,,,,,
5354,"So they put away the strange gods from among them, and became the Lord's servants; and his soul was angry because of the sorrows of Israel.",,,,,,,
5355,Then the children of Ammon came together and put their army in position in Gilead. And the children of Israel came together and put their army in position in Mizpah.,,,,,,,
5356,"And the people of Israel said to one another, Who will be the first to make an attack on the children of Ammon? We will make him head over all Gilead.Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a great man of war; he was the son of a loose woman, and Gilead was his f",ther.,,,,,,
5357,"And Gilead's wife gave birth to sons, and when her sons became men, they sent Jephthah away, saying, You have no part in the heritage of our father's house, for you are the son of another woman.",,,,,,,
5358,"So Jephthah went in flight from his brothers and was living in the land of Tob, where a number of good-for-nothing men, joining Jephthah, went out with him on his undertakings.",,,,,,,
5359,Now after a time the children of Ammon made war against Israel.,,,,,,,
5360,"And when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the responsible men of Gilead went to get Jephthah back from the land of Tob;",,,,,,,
5361,"And they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief so that we may make war against the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
5362,"But Jephthah said to the responsible men of Gilead, Did you not, in your hate for me, send me away from my father's house? Why do you come to me now when you are in trouble?",,,,,,,
5363,"And the responsible men of Gilead said to Jephthah, That is the reason we have come back to you; so go with us and make war against the children of Ammon, and we will make you our head over all the people of Gilead.",,,,,,,
5364,"Then Jephthah said to the responsible men of Gilead, If you take me back to make war against the children of Ammon, and if with the help of the Lord I overcome them, will you make me your head?",,,,,,,
5365,"And the responsible men of Gilead said to Jephthah, May the Lord be our witness: we will certainly do as you say.",,,,,,,
5366,"So Jephthah went with the responsible men of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah said all these things before the Lord in Mizpah.",,,,,,,
5367,"Then Jephthah sent men to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you against me that you have come to make war against my land?",,,,,,,
5368,"And the king of the children of Ammon said to the men sent by Jephthah, Because Israel, when he came up out of Egypt, took away my land, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and as far as Jordan: so now, give me back those lands quietly.",,,,,,,
5369,"And Jephthah sent again to the king of the children of Ammon,",,,,,,,
5370,"And said to him, This is the word of Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the children of Ammon;",,,,,,,
5371,"But when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the waste land to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh;",,,,,,,
5372,"Then Israel sent men to the king of Edom saying, Let me now go through your land; but the king of Edom did not give ear to them. And in the same way he sent to the king of Moab, but he would not; so Israel went on living in Kadesh.",,,,,,,
5373,"Then he went on through the waste land and round the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and put up their tents on the other side of the Arnon; they did not come inside the limit of Moab, for the Arnon was th",limit of Mo,b.,,,,,
5374,"And Israel sent men to Sihon, king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let me now go through your land to my place.",,,,,,,
5375,"But Sihon would not give way and let Israel go through his land; and Sihon got together all his people, and put his army in position in Jahaz, and made war on Israel.",,,,,,,
5376,"And the Lord, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hands of Israel, and they overcame them; so all the land of the Amorites, the people of that land, became Israel's.",,,,,,,
5377,"All the limit of the Amorites was theirs, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and from the waste land even to Jordan.",,,,,,,
5378,"So now the Lord, the God of Israel, has taken away their land from the Amorites and given it to his people Israel; are you then to have it?",,,,,,,
5379,Do you not keep the lands of those whom Chemosh your god sends out from before you? So we will keep all the lands of those whom the Lord our God sends out from before us.,,,,,,,
5380,"What! are you any better than Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever take up a cause against Israel or make war against them?",,,,,,,
5381,"While Israel was living in Heshbon and its daughter-towns and in Aroer and its daughter-towns and in all the towns which are by the side of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not get them back at that time?",,,,,,,
5382,"So I have done no wrong against you, but you are doing wrong to me in fighting against me: may the Lord, who is Judge this day, be judge between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
5383,"The king of the children of Ammon, however, did not give ear to the words which Jephthah sent to him.",,,,,,,
5384,"Then the spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah, and he went through Gilead and Manasseh, and came to Mizpeh of Gilead; and from Mizpeh of Gilead he went over to the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
5385,"And Jephthah took an oath to the Lord, and said, If you will give the children of Ammon into my hands,",,,,,,,
5386,"Then whoever comes out from the door of my house, meeting me when I come back in peace from the children of Ammon, will be the Lord's and I will give him as a burned offering.",,,,,,,
5387,So Jephthah went over to the children of Ammon to make war on them; and the Lord gave them into his hands.,,,,,,,
5388,"And he made an attack on them from Aroer all the way to Minnith, overrunningtwenty towns, as far as Abel-cheramim, and put great numbers to the sword. So the children of Ammon were crushed before the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
5389,"Then Jephthah came back to his house in Mizpah, and his daughter came out, meeting him on his way with music and with dances; she was his only child; he had no other sons or daughters.",,,,,,,
5390,"And when he saw her he was overcome with grief, and said, Ah! my daughter! I am crushed with sorrow, and it is you who are the chief cause of my trouble; for I have made an oath to the Lord and I may not take it back.",,,,,,,
5391,"And she said to him, My father, you have made an oath to the Lord; do then to me whatever you have said; for the Lord has sent a full reward on your haters, on the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
5392,"Then she said to her father, Only do this for me: let me have two months to go away into the mountains with my friends, weeping for my sad fate.",,,,,,,
5393,"And he said, Go then. So he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends to the mountains, weeping for her sad fate.",,,,,,,
5394,"And at the end of two months she went back to her father, who did with her as he had said in his oath: and she had never been touched by a man. So it became a rule in Israel,",,,,,,,
5395,"For the women to go year by year sorrowing for the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in every year.Now the men of Ephraim came together and took up arms and went over to Zaphon; and they said to Jephthah, Why did you go over to make war again",t the childr,n o,,mmo,wit,out,sendi
5396,"And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were in danger, and the children of Ammon were very cruel to us, and when I sent for you, you gave me no help against them.",,,,,,,
5397,"So when I saw that there was no help to be had from you, I put my life in my hand and went over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord gave them into my hands: why then have you come up to me this day to make war on me?",,,,,,,
5398,Then Jephthah got together all the men of Gilead and made war on Ephraim; and the men of Gilead overcame Ephraim.,,,,,,,
5399,"And the Gileadites took the crossing-places of Jordan against the Ephraimites; and when any of the men of Ephraim who had gone in flight said, let me go over; the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? And if he said, No;",,,,,,,
5400,"Then they said to him, Now say Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth, and was not able to say it in the right way; then they took him and put him to death at the crossing-places of Jordan; and at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites were put to death.",,,,,,,
5401,"Now Jephthah was judge of Israel for six years. And Jephthah the Gileadite came to his death, and his body was put to rest in his town, Mizpeh of Gilead.",,,,,,,
5402,"And after him, Ibzan of Beth-lehem was judge of Israel.",,,,,,,
5403,"He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he sent to other places, and he got thirty wives from other places for his sons. And he was judge of Israel for seven years.",,,,,,,
5404,And Ibzan came to his death and his body was put to rest at Beth- lehem.,,,,,,,
5405,"And after him, Elon the Zebulonite was judge of Israel; and he was judge of Israel for ten years.",,,,,,,
5406,"And Elon the Zebulonite came to his death, and his body was put to rest in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.",,,,,,,
5407,"And after him, Abdon, the son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, was judge of Israel.",,,,,,,
5408,He had forty sons and thirty sons' sons who went on seventy young asses; and he was judge of Israel for eight years.,,,,,,,
5409,"And Abdon, the son of Hillel, came to his death, and his body was put to rest in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord gave them into the han",s of the Phi,ist,n,s f,r fo,ty,ears.
5410,"Now there was a certain man of Zorah of the family of the Danites, and his name was Manoah; and his wife had never given birth to a child.",,,,,,,
5411,"And the angel of the Lord came to the woman, and said to her, See now! though you have never given birth to children, you will be with child and give birth to a son.",,,,,,,
5412,Now then take care to have no wine or strong drink and to take no unclean thing for food;,,,,,,,
5413,"For you are with child and will give birth to a son; his hair is never to be cut, for the child is to be separate to God from his birth; and he will take up the work of freeing Israel from the hands of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
5414,"Then the woman came in, and said to her husband, A man came to me, and his form was like the form of a god, causing great fear; I put no question to him about where he came from, and he did not give me his name;",,,,,,,
5415,"But he said to me, You are with child and will give birth to a son; and now do not take any wine or strong drink or let anything unclean be your food; for the child will be separate to God from his birth to the day of his death.",,,,,,,
5416,"Then Manoah made prayer to the Lord, and said, O Lord, let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and make clear to us what we are to do for the child who is to come.",,,,,,,
5417,And God gave ear to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came to the woman again when she was seated in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.,,,,,,,
5418,"So the woman, running quickly, gave her husband the news, saying, I have seen the man who came to me the other day.",,,,,,,
5419,"And Manoah got up and went after his wife, and came up to the man and said to him, Are you the man who was talking to this woman? And he said, I am.",,,,,,,
5420,"And Manoah said, Now when your words come true, what is to be the rule for the child and what will be his work?",,,,,,,
5421,"And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Let the woman take note of what I have said to her.",,,,,,,
5422,"She is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food, and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean; let her take care to do all I have given her orders to do.",,,,,,,
5423,"And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, Now let us keep you while we make ready a young goat for you.",,,,,,,
5424,"And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Though you keep me I will not take of your food; but if you will make a burned offering, let it be offered to the Lord. For it had not come into Manoah's mind that he was the angel of the Lord.",,,,,,,
5425,"Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, What is your name, so that when your words come true we may give you honour?",,,,,,,
5426,"But the angel of the Lord said to him, Why are you questioning me about my name, seeing that it is a wonder?",,,,,,,
5427,"So Manoah took the young goat with its meal offering, offering it on the rock to the Lord, who did strange things.",,,,,,,
5428,"And when the flame went up to heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar, while Manoah and his wife were looking on; and they went down on their faces to the earth.",,,,,,,
5429,But the angel of the Lord was seen no more by Manoah and his wife. Then it was clear to Manoah that he was the angel of the Lord.,,,,,,,
5430,"And Manoah said to his wife, Death will certainly be our fate, for it is a god whom we have seen.",,,,,,,
5431,"But his wife said to him, If the Lord was purposing our death, he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering, or have given us such orders about the child.",,,,,,,
5432,"So the woman gave birth to a son, and gave him the name Samson; and he became a man and the blessing of the Lord was on him.",,,,,,,
5433,"And the spirit of the Lord first came on him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah, of the daughters of the Philistines;",,,,,,,
5434,"And when he came back he said to his father and mother, I have seen a woman in Timnah, of the daughters of the Philistines: get her now for me for my wife.",,,,,,,
5435,"Then his father and mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of your relations or among all my people, that you have to go for your wife to the Philistines, who are without circumcision? But Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for",she is pleas,ng,o,me.,,,
5436,"Now his father and mother had no knowledge that this was the purpose of the Lord, who had the destruction of the Philistines in mind. Now the Philistines at that time were ruling over Israel.",,,,,,,
5437,"Then Samson went down to Timnah (and his father and his mother,) and came to the vine-gardens of Timnah; and a young lion came rushing out at him.",,,,,,,
5438,"And the spirit of the Lord came on him with power, and, unarmed as he was, pulling the lion in two as one might do to a young goat, he put him to death; (but he said nothing to his father and mother of what he had done.)",,,,,,,
5439,So he went down and had talk with the woman; and she was pleasing to Samson.,,,,,,,
5440,"Then after a time he went back to take her; and turning from the road to see the dead body of the lion, he saw a mass of bees in the body of the lion, and honey there.",,,,,,,
5441,"And he took the honey in his hand, and went on, tasting it on the way; and when he came to his father and mother he gave some to them; but did not say that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.",,,,,,,
5442,"Then Samson went down to the woman, and made a feast there, as was the way among young men.",,,,,,,
5443,"And he took thirty friends, and they were with him.",,,,,,,
5444,"And Samson said, Now I have a hard question for you: if you are able to give me the answer before the seven days of the feast are over, I will give you thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing;",,,,,,,
5445,"But if you are not able to give me the answer, then you will have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Put your hard question and let us see what it is.",,,,,,,
5446,"And he said, Out of the taker of food came food, and out of the strong came the sweet. And at the end of three days they were still not able to give the answer.",,,,,,,
5447,"So on the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, Get from your husband the answer to his question by some trick or other, or we will have you and your father's house burned with fire; did you get us here to take all we have?",,,,,,,
5448,"Then Samson's wife, weeping over him, said, Truly you have no love for me but only hate; you have put a hard question to the children of my people and have not given me the answer. And he said to her, See, I have not given the answer even to my father or",my mother; a,I,o,giv,it,o y,u?
5449,"And all the seven days of the feast she went on weeping over him; and on the seventh day he gave her the answer, because she gave him no peace; and she sent word of it to the children of her people.",,,,,,,
5450,"Then on the seventh day, before he went into the bride's room, the men of the town said to him, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If you had not been ploughing with my cow you would not have got the answer",to my questi,n.,,,,,
5451,"And the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him, and he went down to Ashkelon and, attacking thirty men there, took their clothing from them, and gave it to the men who had given the answer to his hard question. Then, full of wrath, he went back to his fa",her's house.,,,,,,
5452,"But Samson's wife was given to the friend who had been his best man.Now a short time after, at the time of the grain-cutting, Samson, taking with him a young goat, went to see his wife; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the bride's room. But her",ather would,ot,e,hi,go,n.,
5453,"And her father said, It seemed to me that you had only hate for her; so I gave her to your friend: but is not her younger sister fairer than she? so please take her in place of the other.",,,,,,,
5454,"Then Samson said to them, This time I will give payment in full to the Philistines, for I am going to do them great evil.",,,,,,,
5455,So Samson went and got three hundred foxes and some sticks of fire-wood; and he put the foxes tail to tail with a stick between every two tails;,,,,,,,
5456,"Then firing the sticks, he let the foxes loose among the uncut grain of the Philistines, and all the corded stems as well as the living grain and the vine-gardens and the olives went up in flames.",,,,,,,
5457,"Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his friend. So the Philistines came up and had her and her father's house burned.",,,,,,,
5458,"And Samson said to them, If you go on like this, truly I will take my full payment from you; and that will be the end of it.",,,,,,,
5459,"And he made an attack on them, driving them in uncontrolled flight, and causing great destruction; then he went away to his safe place in the crack of the rock at Etam.",,,,,,,
5460,"Then the Philistines went and put up their tents in Judah, all round Lehi.",,,,,,,
5461,"And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? And they said, We have come up to take Samson, and to do to him as he has done to us.",,,,,,,
5462,"Then three thousand of the men of Judah went down to the crack of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Is it not clear to you that the Philistines are our rulers? What is this you have done to us? And he said to them, I only did to them as they did to m",.,,,,,,
5463,"Then they said to him, We have come down to take you and give you up into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Give me your oath that you will not make an attack on me yourselves.",,,,,,,
5464,"And they said, No; we will take you and give you up into their hands, but truly we will not put you to death. So knotting two new cords round him they took him up from the rock.",,,,,,,
5465,"And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines came out, meeting him with loud cries; then the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him, and the cords on his arms became like grass which has been burned with fire, and the bands came falling off his hands.",,,,,,,
5466,"And taking up the mouth-bone of an ass newly dead, which he saw by chance on the earth, he put to death a thousand men with it.",,,,,,,
5467,"And Samson said, With a red ass's mouth-bone I have made them red with blood, with a red ass's mouth-bone I have sent destruction on a thousand men.",,,,,,,
5468,"And having said these words, he let the mouth-bone go out of his hand; so that place was named Ramath-lehi.",,,,,,,
5469,"After this, he was in great need of water, and crying out to the Lord, he said, You have given this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and now need of water will be my death; and I will be given into the hands of this people who are without cir",umcision.,,,,,,
5470,"Then God made a crack in the hollow rock in Lehi and water came out of it; and after drinking, his spirit came back to him and he was strong again; so that place was named En-hakkore; it is in Lehi to this day.",,,,,,,
5471,"And he was judge of Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years.Now Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a loose woman and went in to her.",,,,,,,
5472,"And it was said to the Gazites, Samson is here. So they went round, watching for him all day at the doorway of the town, but at night they kept quiet, saying, When daylight comes we will put him to death.",,,,,,,
5473,"And Samson was there till the middle of the night; then he got up, and took a grip on the doors of the town, pulling them up, together with their two supports and their locks, and put them on his back and took them up to the top of the hill in front of H",bron.,,,,,,
5474,"Now after this, he was in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, named Delilah.",,,,,,,
5475,"And the chiefs of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Make use of your power over him and see what is the secret of his great strength, and how we may get the better of him, and put bands on him, so that we may make him feeble; and every one",of us will g,ve,o,el,ven,und,ed sh
5476,"So Delilah said to Samson, Make clear to me now what is the secret of your great strength, and how you may be put in bands and made feeble.",,,,,,,
5477,"And Samson said to her, If seven new bow-cords which have never been made dry are knotted round me, I will become feeble and will be like any other man.",,,,,,,
5478,"So the chiefs of the Philistines gave her seven new bow-cords which had never been made dry, and she had them tightly knotted round him.",,,,,,,
5479,"Now she had men waiting secretly in the inner room; and she said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And the cords were broken by him as a twist of thread is broken when touched by a flame. So the secret of his strength did not come to light.",,,,,,,
5480,"Then Delilah said to Samson, See, you have been making sport of me with false words; now, say truly how may you be put in bands?",,,,,,,
5481,"And he said to her, If they only put round me new thick cords which have never been used, then I will become feeble and will be like any other man.",,,,,,,
5482,"So Delilah took new thick cords, knotting them tightly round him, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And men were waiting secretly in the inner room. And the cords were broken off his arms like threads.",,,,,,,
5483,"Then Delilah said to Samson, Up to now you have made sport of me with false words; now say truly, how may you be put in bands? And he said to her, If you get the seven twists of my hair worked into the cloth you are making and fixed with the pin, I will",ecome feeble,and,w,ll,e li,e a,y oth
5484,"So while he was sleeping she got the seven twists of his hair worked into her cloth and fixed with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. Then awaking from his sleep, he got up quickly, pulling up cloth and machine together.",,,,,,,
5485,"And she said to him, Why do you say you are my lover when your heart is not mine? Three times you have made sport of me, and have not made clear to me the secret of your great strength.",,,,,,,
5486,"So day after day she gave him no peace, for ever questioning him till his soul was troubled to death.",,,,,,,
5487,"And opening all his heart to her, he said to her, My head has never been touched by a blade, for I have been separate to God from the day of my birth: if my hair is cut off, then my strength will go from me and I will become feeble, and will be like any",ther man.,,,,,,
5488,"And when Delilah saw that he had let her see into his heart, she sent word to the chiefs of the Philistines saying, Come up this time, for he has let out all his heart to me. Then the chiefs of the Philistines came to her, with the money in their hands.",,,,,,,
5489,And she made him go to sleep on her knees; and she sent for a man and had his seven twists of hair cut off; and while it was being done he became feeble and his strength went from him.,,,,,,,
5490,"Then she said, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And awaking from his sleep, he said, I will go out as at other times, shaking myself free. But he was not conscious that the Lord had gone from him.",,,,,,,
5491,"So the Philistines took him and put out his eyes; then they took him down to Gaza, and, chaining him with bands of brass, put him to work crushing grain in the prison-house.",,,,,,,
5492,But the growth of his hair was starting again after it had been cut off.,,,,,,,
5493,"And the chiefs of the Philistines came together to make a great offering to Dagon their god, and to be glad; for they said, Our god has given into our hands Samson our hater.",,,,,,,
5494,"And when the people saw him, they gave praise to their god; for they said, Our god has given into our hands the one who was fighting against us, who made our country waste, and who put great numbers of us to death.",,,,,,,
5495,"Now when their hearts were full of joy, they said, Send for Samson to make sport for us. And they sent for Samson out of the prison-house, and he made sport before them; and they put him between the pillars.",,,,,,,
5496,"And Samson said to the boy who took him by the hand, Let me put my hand on the pillars supporting the house, so that I may put my back against them.",,,,,,,
5497,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and about three thousand men and women were on the roof, looking on while Samson made sport.",,,,,,,
5498,"And Samson, crying out to the Lord, said, O Lord God, do have me now in mind, and do make me strong only this once, O God, so that I may take one last payment from the Philistines for my two eyes.",,,,,,,
5499,"Then Samson put his arms round the two middle pillars supporting the house, putting his weight on them, on one with his right hand and on the other with his left.",,,,,,,
5500,"And Samson said, Let death overtake me with the Philistines. And he put out all his strength, and the house came down on the chiefs and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he sent to destruction by his death were more than all those on who",he had sent,des,r,cti,n in,his,life.
5501,Then his brothers and his father's people came down and took him up and put his body to rest in the earth between Zorah and Eshtaol in the resting-place of Manoah his father. And he had been judge of Israel for twenty years.Now there was a man of the hil,-country of,phr,i,na,ed M,cah,
5502,"And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver which were taken from you, about which you took an oath and said in my hearing, I have given this silver to the Lord from my hand for myself, to make a pictured image and a metal image: see,",I have the s,lve,",",for,I to,k i,: so
5503,"And he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, and his mother said, I have made the silver holy to the Lord from me for my son, to make a pictured image and a metal image.",,,,,,,
5504,So he gave the silver back to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metal-worker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them: and it was in the house of Micah.,,,,,,,
5505,And the man Micah had a house of gods; and he made an ephod and family gods and put one of his sons in the position of priest.,,,,,,,
5506,In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did as seemed right to him.,,,,,,,
5507,"Now there was a young man living in Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah and a Levite, who was not a townsman of the place.",,,,,,,
5508,"And he went away from the town of Beth-lehem-judah, looking for somewhere to make his living-place; and on his journey he came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah.",,,,,,,
5509,"And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Beth-lehem-judah, and I am looking for a living-place.",,,,,,,
5510,"Then Micah said to him, Make your living-place with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver a year and your clothing and food.",,,,,,,
5511,"And the Levite said he would make his living-place with the man, and he became to him as one of his sons.",,,,,,,
5512,"And Micah gave the position to the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.",,,,,,,
5513,"Then Micah said, Now I am certain that the Lord will do me good, seeing that the Levite has become my priest.In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the Danites were looking for a heritage for themselves, to be their living-place; fo",up to that,ime,n,di,trib,tio,of l
5514,"So the children of Dan sent five men from among their number, strong men, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to take a look at the land and make a search through it; and they said to them, Go and make a search through the land; and they came to the hill-countr","of Ephraim,",to,h,ho,se o,Mi,"ah, w"
5515,"When they were near the house of Micah, hearing a voice which was not strange to them, that of the young Levite, they went out of their road to his place, and said to him, How did you come here? and what are you doing in this place? and why are you here?",,,,,,,
5516,"And he said to them, This is what Micah did for me, and he gave me payment and I became his priest.",,,,,,,
5517,"Then they said, Do get directions from God for us, to see if the journey on which we are going will have a good outcome.",,,,,,,
5518,"And the priest said to them, Go in peace: your way is guided by the Lord.",,,,,,,
5519,"Then the five men went on their way and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, living without thought of danger, like the Zidonians, quiet and safe; for they had everything on earth for their needs, and they were far from the Zidonians and had",o business w,th,r,m.,,,
5520,"So they came back to their brothers in Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brothers said to them, What news have you?",,,,,,,
5521,"And they said, Up! and let us go against Laish; for we have seen the land, and it is very good: why are you doing nothing? Do not be slow to go in and take the land for your heritage.",,,,,,,
5522,"When you come there you will come to a people living without thought of danger; and the land is wide, and God has given it into your hands: a place where there is everything on earth for man's needs.",,,,,,,
5523,So six hundred men of the Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol went out armed with instruments of war.,,,,,,,
5524,And they went up and put up their tents in Kiriath-jearim in Judah: so that place is named Mahaneh-dan to this day. It is to the west of Kiriath-jearim.,,,,,,,
5525,From there they went on to the hill-country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.,,,,,,,
5526,"Then the five men who had gone to make a search through the country of Laish, said to their brothers, Have you knowledge that in these houses there is an ephod and family gods and a pictured image and a metal image? So now you see what to do.",,,,,,,
5527,"And turning from their road they came to the house of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and said to him, Is it well with you?",,,,,,,
5528,And the six hundred armed men of the Danites took their places by the doorway.,,,,,,,
5529,"Then the five men who had gone to make a search through the land, went in and took the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image; and the priest was by the doorway with the six hundred armed men.",,,,,,,
5530,"And when they went into Micah's house and took out the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image, the priest said to them, What are you doing?",,,,,,,
5531,"And they said to him, Be quiet; say nothing, and come with us and be our father and priest; is it better for you to be priest to one man's house or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?",,,,,,,
5532,"Then the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod and the family gods and the pictured image and went with the people.",,,,,,,
5533,"So they went on their way again, putting the little ones and the oxen and the goods in front of them.",,,,,,,
5534,"When they had gone some way from the house of Micah, the men from the houses near Micah's house came together and overtook the children of Dan,",,,,,,,
5535,"Crying out to them. And the Danites, turning round, said to Micah, What is your trouble, that you have taken up arms?",,,,,,,
5536,"And he said, You have taken my gods which I made, and my priest, and have gone away; what is there for me now? Why then do you say to me, What is your trouble?",,,,,,,
5537,"And the children of Dan said to him, Say no more, or men of bitter spirit may make an attack on you, causing loss of your life and the lives of your people.",,,,,,,
5538,"Then the children of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were stronger than he, he went back to his house.",,,,,,,
5539,"And they took that which Micah had made, and his priest, and came to Laish, to a people living quietly and without thought of danger, and they put them to the sword without mercy, burning down their town.",,,,,,,
5540,"And they had no saviour, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with Aram; and it was in the valley which is the property of Beth-rehob. And building up the town again they took it for their living-place.",,,,,,,
5541,"And they gave the town the name of Dan, after Dan their father, who was the son of Israel: though the town had been named Laish at first.",,,,,,,
5542,"(And the children of Dan put up the pictured image for themselves; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of the Danites till the day when the ark was taken prisoner.)",,,,,,,
5543,"And they put up for themselves the image which Micah had made, and it was there all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.Now in those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was living in the inmost parts of the hill-country of E","hraim, and h",go,,or,imse,f a,serva
5544,"And his servant-wife was angry with him, and went away from him to her father's house at Beth-lehem-judah, and was there for four months.",,,,,,,
5545,"Then her husband got up and went after her, with the purpose of talking kindly to her, and taking her back with him; he had with him his young man and two asses: and she took him into her father's house, and her father, when he saw him, came forward to h",m with joy.,,,,,,
5546,"And his father-in-law, the girl's father, kept him there for three days; and they had food and drink and took their rest there.",,,,,,,
5547,"Now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning and he made ready to go away; but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, Take a little food to keep up your strength, and then go on your way.",,,,,,,
5548,"So seating themselves they had food and drink, the two of them together; and the girl's father said to the man, If it is your pleasure, take your rest here tonight, and let your heart be glad.",,,,,,,
5549,"And the man got up to go away, but his father-in-law would not let him go, so he took his rest there again for the night.",,,,,,,
5550,"Then early on the morning of the fifth day he got up to go away; but the girl's father said, Keep up your strength; so the two of them had a meal, and the man and his woman and his servant did not go till after the middle of the day.",,,,,,,
5551,"And when they got up to go away, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, Now evening is coming on, so do not go tonight; see, the day is almost gone; take your rest here and let your heart be glad, and tomorrow early, go on your way back to yo",r house.,,,,,,
5552,"But the man would not be kept there that night, and he got up and went away and came opposite to Jebus (which is Jerusalem); and he had with him the two asses, ready for travelling, and his woman.",,,,,,,
5553,"When they got near Jebus the day was far gone; and the servant said to his master, Now let us go from our road into this town of the Jebusites and take our night's rest there.",,,,,,,
5554,"But his master said to him, We will not go out of our way into a strange town, whose people are not of the children of Israel; but we will go on to Gibeah.",,,,,,,
5555,"And he said to his servant, Come, let us go on to one of these places, stopping for the night in Gibeah or Ramah.",,,,,,,
5556,So they went on their way; and the sun went down when they were near Gibeah in the land of Benjamin.,,,,,,,
5557,"And they went off the road there with the purpose of stopping for the night in Gibeah: and he went in, seating himself in the street of the town, for no one took them into his house for the night.",,,,,,,
5558,Now when it was evening they saw an old man coming back from his work in the fields; he was from the hill-country of Ephraim and was living in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.,,,,,,,
5559,"And when he saw the traveller in the street of the town, the old man said, Where are you going? and where do you come from?",,,,,,,
5560,"And he said to him, We are on our way from Beth-lehem-judah to the inmost parts of the hill-country of Ephraim: I came from there and went to Beth-lehem-judah: now I am on my way back to my house, but no man will take me into his house.",,,,,,,
5561,"But we have dry grass and food for our asses, as well as bread and wine for me, and for the woman, and for the young man with us: we have no need of anything.",,,,,,,
5562,"And the old man said, Peace be with you; let all your needs be my care; only do not take your rest in the street.",,,,,,,
5563,So he took them into his house and gave the asses food; and after washing their feet they took food and drink.,,,,,,,
5564,"While they were taking their pleasure at the meal, the good-for-nothing men of the town came round the house, giving blows on the door; and they said to the old man, the master of the house, Send out that man who came to your house, so that we may take o",r pleasure w,th,i,.,,,
5565,"So the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said, No, my brothers, do not this evil thing; this man has come into my house, and you are not to do him this wrong.",,,,,,,
5566,"See, here is my daughter, a virgin, and his servant-wife: I will send them out for you to take them and do with them whatever you will. But do no such thing of shame to this man.",,,,,,,
5567,"But the men would not give ear to him: so the man took his woman and sent her out to them; and they took her by force, using her for their pleasure all night till the morning; and when dawn came they let her go.",,,,,,,
5568,"Then at the dawn of day the woman came, and, falling down at the door of the man's house where her master was, was stretched there till it was light.",,,,,,,
5569,"In the morning her master got up, and opening the door of the house went out to go on his way; and he saw his servant-wife stretched on the earth at the door of the house with her hands on the step.",,,,,,,
5570,"And he said to her, Get up and let us be going; but there was no answer; so he took her up and put her on the ass, and went on his way and came to his house.",,,,,,,
5571,"And when he had come to his house, he got his knife, and took the woman, cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts, which he sent through all Israel.",,,,,,,
5572,"And he gave orders to the men whom he sent, saying, This is what you are to say to all the men of Israel, Has ever an act like this been done from the day when the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day? Give thought to it, turning it over in y","ur minds, an",gi,e,you,opi,ion,of it
5573,"And the chiefs of the people, out of all the tribes of Israel, took their places in the meeting of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen armed with swords.",,,,,,,
5574,"(Now the children of Benjamin had word that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Make clear how this evil thing took place.",,,,,,,
5575,"Then the Levite, the husband of the dead woman, said in answer, I came to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin, I and my servant-wife, for the purpose of stopping there for the night.",,,,,,,
5576,"And the townsmen of Gibeah came together against me, going round the house on all sides by night; it was their purpose to put me to death, and my servant-wife was violently used by them and is dead.",,,,,,,
5577,"So I took her, cutting her into parts which I sent through all the country of the heritage of Israel: for they have done an act of shame in Israel.",,,,,,,
5578,"Here you all are, you children of Israel; give now your suggestions about what is to be done.",,,,,,,
5579,"Then all the people got up as one man and said, Not one of us will go to his tent or go back to his house:",,,,,,,
5580,But this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by the decision of the Lord;,,,,,,,
5581,"And we will take ten men out of every hundred, through all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, a thousand out of every ten thousand, to get food for the people, so that they may give to Gibeah of Benjamin the right punishment for the a",t of shame t,ey,a,e d,ne i,Is,ael.
5582,"So all the men of Israel were banded together against the town, united like one man.",,,,,,,
5583,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying, What is this evil which has been done among you?",,,,,,,
5584,"Now give up those good-for-nothing persons in Gibeah so that we may put them to death, clearing away the evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not give ear to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
5585,"And the children of Benjamin came together from all their towns to Gibeah, to go to war with the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
5586,"And the children of Benjamin who came that day from the towns were twenty-six thousand men armed with swords, in addition to the people of Gibeah, numbering seven hundred of the best fighting-men,",,,,,,,
5587,"Who were left-handed, able to send a stone at a hair without error.",,,,,,,
5588,"And the men of Israel, other than Benjamin, were four hundred thousand in number, all armed with swords; they were all men of war.",,,,,,,
5589,"And they got up and went up to Beth-el to get directions from God, and the children of Israel said, Who is to be the first to go up to the fight against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah is to go up first.",,,,,,,
5590,So the children of Israel got up in the morning and put themselves in position against Gibeah.,,,,,,,
5591,And the men of Israel went out to war against Benjamin (and the men of Israel put their forces in fighting order against them at Gibeah).,,,,,,,
5592,"Then the children of Benjamin came out from Gibeah, cutting down twenty- two thousand of the Israelites that day.",,,,,,,
5593,"But the people, the men of Israel, taking heart again, put their forces in order and took up the same position as on the first day.",,,,,,,
5594,"Now the children of Israel went up, weeping before the Lord till evening, requesting the Lord and saying, Am I to go forward again to the fight against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord said, Go up against him.",,,,,,,
5595,So the children of Israel went forward against the children of Benjamin the second day.,,,,,,,
5596,"And the second day Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah, cutting down eighteen thousand men of the children of Israel, all swordsmen.",,,,,,,
5597,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up to Beth-el, weeping and waiting there before the Lord, going without food all day till evening, and offering burned offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord.",,,,,,,
5598,"And the children of Israel made request to the Lord, (for the ark of the agreement of the Lord was there in those days,",,,,,,,
5599,"And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was in his place before it,) and said, Am I still to go on with the fight against the children of Benjamin my brother, or am I to give it up? And the Lord said, Go on; for tomorrow I will give him into",our hands.,,,,,,
5600,So Israel put men secretly all round Gibeah to make a surprise attack on it.,,,,,,,
5601,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in fighting order against Gibeah as before.",,,,,,,
5602,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, moving away from the town; and as before, at their first attack, they put to death about thirty men of Israel on the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-el and the other to Gibeah, and in the o",en country.,,,,,,
5603,"And the children of Benjamin said, They are giving way before us as at first. But the children of Israel said, Let us go in flight and get them away from the town, into the highways.",,,,,,,
5604,So all the men of Israel got up and put themselves in fighting order at Baal-tamar: and those who had been waiting secretly to make a surprise attack came rushing out of their place on the west of Geba.,,,,,,,
5605,"And they came in front of Gibeah, ten thousand of the best men in all Israel, and the fighting became more violent; but the children of Benjamin were not conscious that evil was coming on them.",,,,,,,
5606,"Then the Lord sent sudden fear on Benjamin before Israel; and that day the children of Israel put to death twenty-five thousand, one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them swordsmen.",,,,,,,
5607,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were overcome: and the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, putting their faith in the watchers who were to make the surprise attack on Gibeah.",,,,,,,
5608,"And the watchers, rushing on Gibeah and overrunning it, put all the town to the sword without mercy.",,,,,,,
5609,"Now the sign fixed between the men of Israel and those making the surprise attack was that when they made a pillar of smoke go up from the town,",,,,,,,
5610,"The men of Israel were to make a turn about in the fight. And Benjamin had overcome and put to death about thirty of the men of Israel, and were saying, Certainly they are falling back before us as in the first fight.",,,,,,,
5611,"Then the sign went up out of the town in the pillar of smoke, and the Benjamites, turning back, saw all the town going up in smoke to heaven.",,,,,,,
5612,"And the men of Israel had made a turn about, and the men of Benjamin were overcome with fear, for they saw that evil had overtaken them.",,,,,,,
5613,"So turning their backs on the men of Israel, they went in the direction of the waste land; but the fight overtook them; and those who came out of the town were heading them off and putting them to the sword.",,,,,,,
5614,"And crushing Benjamin down, they went after them, driving them from Nohah as far as the east side of Gibeah.",,,,,,,
5615,"Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin came to their death, all strong men of war.",,,,,,,
5616,"And turning, they went in flight to the rock of Rimmon in the waste land: and on the highways five thousand of them were cut off by the men of Israel, who, pushing on hard after them to Geba, put to death two thousand more.",,,,,,,
5617,"So twenty-five thousand of the swordsmen of Benjamin came to their end that day, all strong men of war.",,,,,,,
5618,"But six hundred men, turning back, went in flight to the rock of Rimmon in the waste land, and were living on the rock of Rimmon for four months.",,,,,,,
5619,"And the men of Israel, turning again against the children of Benjamin, put to the sword without mercy all the towns and the cattle and everything there was, burning every town which came into their hands.Now the men of Israel had taken an oath in Mizpah,","saying, Not",ne,f,us,ill,ive,his d
5620,"And the people came to Beth-el, waiting there till evening before God, and gave themselves up to bitter weeping.",,,,,,,
5621,"And they said, O Lord, the God of Israel, why has this fate come on Israel, that today one tribe has been cut off from Israel?",,,,,,,
5622,"Then on the day after, the people got up early and made an altar there, offering burned offerings and peace-offerings.",,,,,,,
5623,"And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel, who did not come up to the Lord at the meeting of all Israel? For they had taken a great oath that whoever did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord was to be put to death.",,,,,,,
5624,"And the children of Israel were moved with pity for Benjamin their brother, saying, Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel.",,,,,,,
5625,What are we to do about wives for those who are still living? For we have taken an oath by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters for wives.,,,,,,,
5626,"And they said, Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord? And it was seen that no one had come from Jabesh-gilead to the meeting.",,,,,,,
5627,"For when the people were numbered, not one man of the people of Jabesh-gilead was present.",,,,,,,
5628,"So they (the meeting) sent twelve thousand of the best fighting-men, and gave them orders, saying, Go and put the people of Jabesh-gilead to the sword without mercy, with their women and their little ones.",,,,,,,
5629,"And this is what you are to do: every male, and every woman who has had sex relations with a man, you are to put to the curse, but you are to keep safe the virgins. And they did so.",,,,,,,
5630,Now there were among the people of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had never had sex relations with a man; these they took to their tents in Shiloh in the land of Canaan.,,,,,,,
5631,"And all the meeting sent to the men of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, offering them peace.",,,,,,,
5632,Then Benjamin came back; and they gave them the women whom they had kept from death among the women of Jabesh-gilead: but still there were not enough for them.,,,,,,,
5633,"And the people were moved with pity for Benjamin, because the Lord had let his wrath loose on the tribes of Israel.",,,,,,,
5634,"Then the responsible men of the meeting said, What are we to do about wives for the rest of them, seeing that the women of Benjamin are dead?",,,,,,,
5635,"And they said, How is the rest of Benjamin to be given offspring so that one tribe of Israel may not be put out of existence,",,,,,,,
5636,"Seeing that we may not give them our daughters as wives? For the children of Israel had taken an oath, saying, Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.",,,,,,,
5637,"And they said, See, every year there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is to the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway which goes up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.",,,,,,,
5638,"And they said to the men of Benjamin, Go into the vine-gardens, waiting there secretly,",,,,,,,
5639,"And watching; and if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then come from the vine-gardens and take a wife for every one of you from among the daughters of Shiloh, and go back to the land of Benjamin.",,,,,,,
5640,"And when their fathers or their brothers come and make trouble, you are to say to them, Give them to us as an act of grace; for we did not take them as wives for ourselves in war; and if you yourselves had given them to us you would have been responsible",for the brok,n o,t,.,,,
5641,"So the men of Benjamin did this, and got wives for themselves for every one of their number, taking them away by force from the dance; then they went back to their heritage, building up their towns and living in them.",,,,,,,
5642,"Then the children of Israel went away from there, every man to his tribe and his family, every man went back to his heritage.",,,,,,,
5643,"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did what seemed right to him.Now there came a time, in the days of the judges, when there was no food in the land. And a certain man went from Beth-lehem-judah, he and his wife and his two sons, to mak",a living-pl,ce,n,the,coun,ry,f Moa
5644,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and were there for some time.",,,,,,,
5645,"And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, came to his end; and only her two sons were with her.",,,,,,,
5646,"And they took two women of Moab as their wives: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they went on living there for about ten years.",,,,,,,
5647,And Mahlon and Chilion came to their end; and the woman was without her two sons and her husband.,,,,,,,
5648,"So she and her daughters-in-law got ready to go back from the country of Moab, for news had come to her in the country of Moab that the Lord, in mercy for his people, had given them food.",,,,,,,
5649,"And she went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah.",,,,,,,
5650,"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go back to your mothers' houses: may the Lord be good to you as you have been good to the dead and to me:",,,,,,,
5651,May the Lord give you rest in the houses of your husbands. Then she gave them a kiss; and they were weeping bitterly.,,,,,,,
5652,"And they said to her, No, but we will go back with you to your people.",,,,,,,
5653,"But Naomi said, Go back, my daughters; why will you come with me? Have I more sons in my body, to become your husbands?",,,,,,,
5654,"Go back, my daughters, and go on your way; I am so old now that I may not have another husband. If I said, I have hopes, if I had a husband tonight, and might have sons,",,,,,,,
5655,"Would you keep yourselves till they were old enough? would you keep from having husbands for them? No, my daughters; but I am very sad for you that the hand of the Lord is against me.",,,,,,,
5656,"Then again they were weeping; and Orpah gave her mother-in-law a kiss, but Ruth would not be parted from her.",,,,,,,
5657,"And Naomi said, See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods: go back after your sister-in-law.",,,,,,,
5658,"But Ruth said, Give up requesting me to go away from you, or to go back without you: for where you go I will go; and where you take your rest I will take my rest; your people will be my people, and your God my God.",,,,,,,
5659,"Wherever death comes to you, death will come to me, and there will be my last resting-place; the Lord do so to me and more if we are parted by anything but death.",,,,,,,
5660,And when she saw that Ruth was strong in her purpose to go with her she said no more.,,,,,,,
5661,"So the two of them went on till they came to Beth-lehem. And when they came to Beth-lehem all the town was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?",,,,,,,
5662,"And she said to them, Do not let my name be Naomi, but Mara, for the Ruler of all has given me a bitter fate.",,,,,,,
5663,"I went out full, and the Lord has sent me back again with nothing; why do you give me the name Naomi, seeing that the Lord has given witness against me, and the Ruler of all has sent sorrow on me?",,,,,,,
5664,"So Naomi came back out of the country of Moab, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her; and they came to Beth-lehem in the first days of the grain-cutting.And Naomi had a relation of her husband, a man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech;",and his name,was,B,az.,,,
5665,"And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Now let me go into the field and take up the heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may have grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.",,,,,,,
5666,"And she went, and came and took up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters; and by chance she went into that part of the field which was the property of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.",,,,,,,
5667,"And Boaz came from Beth- lehem, and said to the grain-cutters, The Lord be with you. And they made answer, The Lord give you his blessing.",,,,,,,
5668,"Then Boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters, Whose girl is this?",,,,,,,
5669,"And the servant who was in authority over the cutters said, It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab;",,,,,,,
5670,"And she said to me, Let me come into the grain-field and take up the grain after the cutters. So she came, and has been here from morning till now, without resting even for a minute.",,,,,,,
5671,"Then said Boaz to Ruth, Give ear to me, my daughter: do not go to take up the grain in another field, or go away from here, but keep here by my young women:",,,,,,,
5672,"Keep your eyes on the field they are cutting, and go after them; have I not given orders to the young men not to put a hand on you? And when you are in need of drink go to the vessels and take of what the young men have put there.",,,,,,,
5673,"Then she went down on her face to the earth, and said to him, Why have I grace in your eyes, that you give attention to me, seeing I am from a strange people?",,,,,,,
5674,"And Boaz answering said to her, I have had news of everything you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband; how you went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people who are strange to you.",,,,,,,
5675,"The Lord give you a reward for what you have done, and may a full reward be given to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take cover.",,,,,,,
5676,"Then she said, May I have grace in your eyes, my lord, for you have given me comfort, and you have said kind words to your servant, though I am not like one of your servants.",,,,,,,
5677,"And at meal-time Boaz said to her, Come here, and take some of the bread, and put your bit into the wine. And she took her seat among the grain-cutters: and he gave her dry grain, and she took it, and there was more than enough for her meal.",,,,,,,
5678,"And when she got ready to take up the grain, Boaz gave his young men orders, saying, Let her take it even from among the cut grain, and say nothing to her.",,,,,,,
5679,"And let some heads of grain be pulled out of what has been corded up, and dropped for her to take, and let no sharp word be said to her.",,,,,,,
5680,So she went on getting together the heads of grain till evening; and after crushing out the seed it came to about an ephah of grain.,,,,,,,
5681,"And she took it up and went into the town; and she let her mother-in-law see what she had got, and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest.",,,,,,,
5682,"And her mother-in-law said to her, Where did you take up the grain today, and where were you working? May a blessing be on him who gave such attention to you. And she gave her mother-in-law an account of where she had been working, and said, The name of",he man with,hom,I,was,work,ng,oday
5683,"And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, May the blessing of the Lord, who has at all times been kind to the living and to the dead, be on him. And Naomi said to her, The man is of our family, one of our near relations.",,,,,,,
5684,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, Truly, he said to me, Keep near my young men till all my grain is cut.",,,,,,,
5685,"And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, It is better, my daughter, for you to go out with his servant-girls, so that no danger may come to you in another field.",,,,,,,
5686,"So she kept near the servant-girls of Boaz to take up the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain were ended; and she went on living with her mother-in-law.AndNaomi, hermother-in-law, saidtoher, Mydaughter, amInottoget",ouaresting-,lac,,her,you,may,be in
5687,"And now, is there not Boaz, our relation, with whose young women you were? See, tonight he is separating the grain from the waste in his grain-floor.",,,,,,,
5688,"So take a bath, and, after rubbing your body with sweet oil, put on your best robe, and go down to the grain-floor; but do not let him see you till he has come to the end of his meal.",,,,,,,
5689,"But see to it, when he goes to rest, that you take note of the place where he is sleeping, and go in there, and, uncovering his feet, take your place by him; and he will say what you are to do.",,,,,,,
5690,"And she said, I will do all you say.",,,,,,,
5691,So she went down to the grain-floor and did all her mother-in-law had said to her.,,,,,,,
5692,"Now when Boaz had taken meat and drink, and his heart was glad, he went to take his rest at the end of the mass of grain; then she came softly and, uncovering his feet, went to rest.",,,,,,,
5693,"Now in the middle of the night, the man awaking from his sleep in fear, and lifting himself up, saw a woman stretched at his feet.",,,,,,,
5694,"And he said, Who are you? And she answering said, I am your servant Ruth: take your servant as wife, for you are a near relation.",,,,,,,
5695,"And he said, May the Lord give you his blessing, my daughter: even better than what you did at the first is this last kind act you have done, in not going after young men, with or without wealth.",,,,,,,
5696,"And now, my daughter, have no fear; I will do for you whatever you say: for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue.",,,,,,,
5697,Now it is true that I am a near relation: but there is a relation nearer than I.,,,,,,,
5698,"Take your rest here tonight; and in the morning, if he will do for you what it is right for a relation to do, very well, let him do so: but if he will not, then by the living Lord I myself will do so.",,,,,,,
5699,"And she took her rest at his feet till the morning: and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another. And he said, Let it not come to anyone's knowledge that the woman came to the grain-floor.",,,,,,,
5700,"And he said, Take your robe, stretching it out in your hands: and she did so, and he took six measures of grain and put them into it, and gave it her to take: and she went back to the town.",,,,,,,
5701,"And when she came back her mother-in-law said to her, How did it go with you, my daughter? And she gave her an account of all the man had done to her.",,,,,,,
5702,"And she said, He gave me these six measures of grain, saying, Do not go back to your mother-in-law with nothing in your hands.",,,,,,,
5703,"Then she said, Do nothing now, my daughter, till you see what will come of this; for the man will take no rest till he has put this thing through.And Boaz went up to the public place of the town, and took his seat there: and the near relation of whom he",ad been talk,ng,a,e b,; an,Bo,"z, cr"
5704,"Then he got ten of the responsible men of the town, and said, Be seated here. And they took their seats.",,,,,,,
5705,"Then he said to the near relation, Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother Elimelech's:",,,,,,,
5706,"And it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it, with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people. If you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do, then do it: but if you will not do it, say so to me n",w; for there,is,o,one,who,as,he ri
5707,"Then Boaz said, On the day when you take this field, you will have to take with it Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage.",,,,,,,
5708,"And the near relation said, I am not able to do the relation's part, for fear of damaging the heritage I have: you may do it in my place, for I am not able to do it myself.",,,,,,,
5709,"Now, in earlier times this was the way in Israel when property was taken over by a near relation, or when there was a change of owner. To make the exchange certain one man took off his shoe and gave it to the other; and this was a witness in Israel.",,,,,,,
5710,"So the near relation said to Boaz, Take it for yourself. And he took off his shoe.",,,,,,,
5711,"Then Boaz said to the responsible men and to all the people, You are witnesses today that I have taken at a price from Naomi all the property which was Elimelech's, and everything which was Chilion's and Mahlon's.",,,,,,,
5712,"And, further, I have taken Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, to keep the name of the dead man living in his heritage, so that his name may not be cut off from among his countrymen, and from the memory of his town: you are wi",nesses this,ay.,,,,,
5713,"And all the people who were in the public place, and the responsible men, said, We are witnesses. May the Lord make this woman, who is about to come into your house, like Rachel and Leah, which two were the builders of the house of Israel: and may you ha",e wealth in,phr,t,"ah,",and,e g,eat i
5714,"May your family be like the family of Perez, the son whom Tamar gave to Judah, from the offspring which the Lord may give you by this young woman.",,,,,,,
5715,"So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son.",,,,,,,
5716,"And the women said to Naomi, A blessing on the Lord, who has not let you be this day without a near relation, and may his name be great in Israel.",,,,,,,
5717,"He will be a giver of new life to you, and your comforter when you are old, for your daughter-in-law, who, in her love for you, is better than seven sons, has given birth to him.",,,,,,,
5718,"And Naomi took the child and put her arms round it, and she took care of it.",,,,,,,
5719,"And the women who were her neighbours gave it a name, saying, Naomi has a child; and they gave him the name of Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.",,,,,,,
5720,Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron;,,,,,,,
5721,"And Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab;",,,,,,,
5722,"And Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon;",,,,,,,
5723,"And Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed;",,,,,,,
5724,"And Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite of the hill-country of Ephraim, named Elkanah; he was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an",Ephraimite:,,,,,,
5725,"And he had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah: and Peninnah was the mother of children, but Hannah had no children.",,,,,,,
5726,"Now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make offerings to the Lord of armies in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.",,,,,,,
5727,"And when the day came for Elkanah to make his offering, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, their part of the feast:",,,,,,,
5728,"But to Hannah he gave one part, though Hannah was very dear to him, but the Lord had not let her have children.",,,,,,,
5729,"And the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy, because the Lord had not let her have children;",,,,,,,
5730,"And year by year, whenever she went up to the house of the Lord, she kept on attacking her, so that Hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food.",,,,,,,
5731,"Then her husband Elkanah said to her, Hannah, why are you weeping? and why are you taking no food? why is your heart troubled? am I not more to you than ten sons?",,,,,,,
5732,"So after they had taken food and wine in the guest room, Hannah got up. Now Eli the priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the Temple of the Lord.",,,,,,,
5733,"And with grief in her soul, weeping bitterly, she made her prayer to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5734,"And she made an oath, and said, O Lord of armies, if you will truly take note of the sorrow of your servant, not turning away from me but keeping me in mind, and will give me a man-child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and his",hair will ne,er,e,cut,,,
5735,"Now while she was a long time in prayer before the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.",,,,,,,
5736,"For Hannah's prayer came from her heart, and though her lips were moving she made no sound: so it seemed to Eli that she was overcome with wine.",,,,,,,
5737,"And Eli said to her, How long are you going to be the worse for drink? Put away the effects of your wine from you.",,,,,,,
5738,"And Hannah, answering him, said, No, my lord, I am a woman whose spirit is broken with sorrow: I have not taken wine or strong drink, but I have been opening my heart before the Lord.",,,,,,,
5739,Do not take your servant to be a good-for-nothing woman: for my words have come from my stored-up sorrow and pain.,,,,,,,
5740,"Then Eli said to her, Go in peace: and may the God of Israel give you an answer to the prayer you have made to him.",,,,,,,
5741,"And she said, May your servant have grace in your eyes. So the woman went away, and took part in the feast, and her face was no longer sad.",,,,,,,
5742,"And early in the morning they got up, and after worshipping before the Lord they went back to Ramah, to their house: and Elkanah had connection with his wife; and the Lord kept her in mind.",,,,,,,
5743,"Now the time came when Hannah, being with child, gave birth to a son; and she gave him the name Samuel, Because, she said, I made a prayer to the Lord for him.",,,,,,,
5744,"And the man Elkanah with all his family went up to make the year's offering to the Lord, and to give effect to his oath.",,,,,,,
5745,"But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go till the child has been taken from the breast, and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord, where he may be for ever.",,,,,,,
5746,"And her husband Elkanah said to her, Do whatever seems right to you, but not till you have taken him from the breast; only may the Lord do as he has said. So the woman, waiting there, gave her son milk till he was old enough to be taken from the breast.",,,,,,,
5747,"Then when she had done so, she took him with her, with a three-year old ox and an ephah of meal and a skin full of wine, and took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh: now the child was still very young.",,,,,,,
5748,"And when they had made an offering of the ox, they took the child to Eli.",,,,,,,
5749,"And she said, O my lord, as your soul is living, my lord, I am that woman who was making a prayer to the Lord here by your side:",,,,,,,
5750,My prayer was for this child; and the Lord has given him to me in answer to my request:,,,,,,,
5751,"So I have given him to the Lord; for all his life he is the Lord's. Then he gave the Lord worship there.And Hannah, in prayer before the Lord, said, My heart is glad in the Lord, my horn is lifted up in the Lord: my mouth is open wide over my haters; bec",use my joy i,in,y,ur,alva,ion,
5752,"No other is holy as the Lord, for there is no other God but you: there is no Rock like our God.",,,,,,,
5753,"Say no more words of pride; let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him acts are judged.",,,,,,,
5754,"The bows of the men of war are broken, and the feeble are clothed with strength.",,,,,,,
5755,"Those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread; those who were in need are at rest; truly, she who had no children has become the mother of seven; and she who had a family is wasted with sorrow.",,,,,,,
5756,The Lord is the giver of death and life: sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up.,,,,,,,
5757,The Lord gives wealth and takes a man's goods from him: crushing men down and again lifting them up;,,,,,,,
5758,"Lifting the poor out of the dust, and him who is in need out of the lowest place, to give them their place among rulers, and for their heritage the seat of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's and he has made them the base of the world.",,,,,,,
5759,"He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the evil-doers will come to their end in the dark night, for by strength no man will overcome.",,,,,,,
5760,"Those who make war against the Lord will be broken; against them he will send his thunder from heaven: the Lord will be judge of the ends of the earth, he will give strength to his king, lifting up the horn of him on whom the holy oil has been put.",,,,,,,
5761,Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child became the servant of the Lord under the direction of Eli the priest.,,,,,,,
5762,"Now the sons of Eli were evil and good-for- nothing men, having no knowledge of the Lord.",,,,,,,
5763,"And the priests' way with the people was this: when any man made an offering, the priest's servant came while the flesh was being cooked, having in his hand a meat-hook with three teeth;",,,,,,,
5764,"This he put into the pot, and everything which came up on the hook the priest took for himself. This they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.",,,,,,,
5765,"And more than this, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was making the offering, Give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest; he has no taste for meat cooked in water, but would have you give it unc",oked.,,,,,,
5766,"And if the man said to him, First let the fat be burned, then take as much as you will; then the servant would say, No, you are to give it to me now, or I will take it by force.",,,,,,,
5767,And the sin of these young men was very great before the Lord; for they gave no honour to the Lord's offerings.,,,,,,,
5768,"But Samuel did the work of the Lord's house, while he was a child, dressed in a linen ephod.",,,,,,,
5769,And his mother made him a little robe and took it to him every year when she came with her husband for the year's offering.,,,,,,,
5770,"And every year Eli gave Elkanah and his wife a blessing, saying, May the Lord give you offspring by this woman in exchange for the child you have given to the Lord. And they went back to their house.",,,,,,,
5771,And the Lord had mercy on Hannah and she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the young Samuel became older before the Lord.,,,,,,,
5772,Now Eli was very old; and he had news from time to time of what his sons were doing to all Israel.,,,,,,,
5773,"And he said to them, Why are you doing such things? for from all this people I get accounts of your evil ways.",,,,,,,
5774,"No, my sons, the account which is given me, which the Lord's people are sending about, is not good.",,,,,,,
5775,"If one man does wrong to another, God will be his judge: but if a man's sin is against the Lord, who will take up his cause? But they gave no attention to the voice of their father, for it was the Lord's purpose to send destruction on them.",,,,,,,
5776,"And the young Samuel, becoming older, had the approval of the Lord and of men.",,,,,,,
5777,"And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, The Lord says, Did I let myself be seen by your father's people when they were in Egypt, servants in Pharaoh's house?",,,,,,,
5778,Did I take him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod? Did I give to your father's family all the offerings made by fire by the children of Israel?,,,,,,,
5779,"Why then are you looking with envy on my offerings of meat and of meal which were ordered by my word, honouring your sons before me, and making yourselves fat with all the best of the offerings of Israel, my people?",,,,,,,
5780,"For this reason the Lord God of Israel has said, Truly I did say that your family and your father's people would have their place before me for ever: but now the Lord says, Let it not be so; I will give honour to those by whom I am honoured, and those wh",have no res,ect,f,r m,wil,be,of sm
5781,"See, the days are coming when your arm and the arm of your father's people will be cut off;",,,,,,,
5782,And never again will there be an old man in your family.,,,,,,,
5783,"But one man of your family will not be cut off by my hand, and his eyes will be made dark, and grief will be in his heart: and all the offspring of your family will come to their end by the sword of men.",,,,,,,
5784,"And this will be the sign to you, which will come on Hophni and Phinehas, your sons; death will overtake them on the same day.",,,,,,,
5785,"And I will make a true priest for myself, one who will do what is in my heart and in my mind: and I will make for him a family which will not come to an end; and his place will be before my holy one for ever.",,,,,,,
5786,"Then it will be that the rest of your family, anyone who has not been cut off, will go down on his knees to him for a bit of silver or a bit of bread, and say, Be pleased to put me into one of the priest's places so that I may have a little food.Now the",oung Samuel,as,h,se,vant,of,he Lo
5787,"And at that time, when Eli was resting in his place, (now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see,)",,,,,,,
5788,"And the light of God was still burning, while Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord where the ark of God was,",,,,,,,
5789,"The voice of the Lord said Samuel's name; and he said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
5790,"And running to Eli he said, Here am I, for you said my name. And Eli said, I did not say your name; go to your rest again. So he went back to his bed.",,,,,,,
5791,"And again the Lord said, Samuel. And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. But he said in answer, I said nothing, my son; go to your rest again.",,,,,,,
5792,"Now at that time Samuel had no knowledge of the Lord, and the revelation of the word of the Lord had not come to him.",,,,,,,
5793,"And for the third time the Lord said Samuel's name. And he got up and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. Then it was clear to Eli that the voice which had said the child's name was the Lord's.",,,,,,,
5794,"So Eli said to Samuel, Go back: and if the voice comes again, let your answer be, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open. So Samuel went back to his bed.",,,,,,,
5795,"Then the Lord came and said as before, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel made answer, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open.",,,,,,,
5796,"And the Lord said to Samuel, See, I will do a thing in Israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning.",,,,,,,
5797,"In that day I will do to Eli everything which I have said about his family, from first to last.",,,,,,,
5798,"And you are to say to him that I will send punishment on his family for ever, for the sin which he had knowledge of; because his sons have been cursing God and he had no control over them.",,,,,,,
5799,So I have made an oath to the family of Eli that no offering of meat or of meal which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family.,,,,,,,
5800,"And Samuel kept where he was, not moving till the time came for opening the doors of the house of God in the morning. And fear kept him from giving Eli an account of his vision.",,,,,,,
5801,"Then Eli said, Samuel, my son. And Samuel answering said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
5802,"And he said, What did the Lord say to you? Do not keep it from me: may God's punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you.",,,,,,,
5803,"Then Samuel gave him an account of everything, keeping nothing back. And he said, It is the Lord; let him do what seems good to him.",,,,,,,
5804,"And Samuel became older, and the Lord was with him and let not one of his words be without effect.",,,,,,,
5805,And it was clear to all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba that Samuel had been made a prophet of the Lord.,,,,,,,
5806,"And the Lord was seen again in Shiloh; for the Lord gave to Samuel in Shiloh the revelation of his word.Now at that time the Philistines came together to make war against Israel, and the men of Israel went out to war against the Philistines and took up t",eir position,at,h,si,e of,Ebe,-ezer
5807,"And the Philistines put their forces in order against Israel, and the fighting was hard, and Israel was overcome by the Philistines, who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field.",,,,,,,
5808,"And when the people came back to their tents, the responsible men of Israel said, Why has the Lord let the Philistines overcome us today? Let us get the ark of the Lord's agreement here from Shiloh, so that it may be with us and give us salvation from th",hands of th,se,h,ar,aga,nst,us.
5809,"So the people sent to Shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the Lord of armies whose resting-place is between the winged ones; and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were there with the ark of God's agreement.",,,,,,,
5810,"And when the ark of the Lord's agreement came into the tent-circle, all Israel gave a great cry, so that the earth was sounding with it.",,,,,,,
5811,"And the Philistines, hearing the noise of their cry, said, What is this great cry among the tents of the Hebrews? Then it became clear to them that the ark of the Lord had come to the tent-circle.",,,,,,,
5812,"And the Philistines, full of fear, said, God has come into their tents. And they said, Trouble is ours! for never before has such a thing been seen.",,,,,,,
5813,Trouble is ours! Who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods? These are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the Egyptians in the waste land.,,,,,,,
5814,"Be strong, O Philistines, be men! Do not be servants to the Hebrews as they have been to you: go forward to the fight without fear.",,,,,,,
5815,"So the Philistines went to the fight, and Israel was overcome, and every man went in flight to his tent: and great was the destruction, for thirty thousand footmen of Israel were put to the sword.",,,,,,,
5816,"And the ark of God was taken; and Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were put to the sword.",,,,,,,
5817,And a man of Benjamin went running from the fight and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head.,,,,,,,
5818,"And when he came, Eli was seated by the wayside watching: and in his heart was fear for the ark of God. And when the man came into the town and gave the news, there was a great outcry.",,,,,,,
5819,"And Eli, hearing the noise and the cries, said, What is the reason of this outcry? And the man came quickly and gave the news to Eli.",,,,,,,
5820,"Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able to see.",,,,,,,
5821,"And the man said to Eli, I have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight. And he said, How did it go, my son?",,,,,,,
5822,"And the man said, Israel went in flight from the Philistines, and there has been great destruction among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken.",,,,,,,
5823,"And at these words about the ark of God, Eli, falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town, came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him, for he was an old man and of great weight. He had been judging Is",ael for fort,ye,r,.,,,
5824,"And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child and near the time when she would give birth; and when she had the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, her pains came on her suddenly a",d she gave b,rth,,,,,
5825,"And when she was very near death the women who were with her said, Have no fear, for you have given birth to a son. But she made no answer and gave no attention to it.",,,,,,,
5826,"And she gave the child the name of Ichabod, saying, The glory has gone from Israel: because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.",,,,,,,
5827,"And she said, The glory is gone from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.Now the Philistines, having taken the ark of God, took it with them from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.",,,,,,,
5828,They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and put it by the side of Dagon.,,,,,,,
5829,"And when the people of Ashdod got up early on the morning after, they saw that Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon up and put him in his place again.",,,,,,,
5830,"And when they got up early on the morning after, Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord; and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep; only the base was in its place.",,,,,,,
5831,"So to this day no priest of Dagon, or any who come into Dagon's house, will put his foot on the doorstep of the house of Dagon in Ashdod.",,,,,,,
5832,But the hand of the Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of Ashdod.,,,,,,,
5833,"And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, Let not the ark of the God of Israel be with us, for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god.",,,,,,,
5834,"So they sent for all the lords of the Philistines to come together there, and said, What are we to do with the ark of the God of Israel? And their answer was, Let the ark of the God of Israel be taken away to Gath. So they took the ark of the God of Isra",l away.,,,,,,
5835,"But after they had taken it away, the hand of the Lord was stretched out against the town for its destruction: and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town, small and great.",,,,,,,
5836,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of the town made an outcry, saying, They have sent the ark of the God of Israel to us for the destruction of us and of our people.",,,,,,,
5837,"So they sent and got together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its place, so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to our people: for there was a great fear of death",hrough all t,e t,w,; t,e ha,d o,God
5838,And those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased: and the cry of the town went up to heaven.Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.,,,,,,,
5839,"And the Philistines sent for the priests and those who were wise in secret arts, and said to them, What are we to do with the ark of the Lord? How are we to send it away to its place?",,,,,,,
5840,"And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it without an offering, but send him a sin-offering with it: then you will have peace again, and it will be clear to you why the weight of his hand has not been lifted from you.",,,,,,,
5841,"Then they said, What sin-offering are we to send to him? And they said, Five gold images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice, one for every lord of the Philistines: for the same disease came on you and on your lords.",,,,,,,
5842,So make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land; and give glory to the God of Israel: it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land.,,,,,,,
5843,"Why do you make your hearts hard, like the hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians? When he had made sport of them, did they not let the people go, and they went away?",,,,,,,
5844,"So now, take and make ready a new cart, and two cows which have never come under the yoke, and have the cows yoked to the cart, and take their young ones away from them:",,,,,,,
5845,"And put the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the gold images which you are sending as a sin-offering in a chest by its side; and send it away so that it may go.",,,,,,,
5846,"If it goes by the land of Israel to Beth-shemesh, then this great evil is his work; but if not, then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing, but was the working of chance.",,,,,,,
5847,"And the men did so; they took two cows, yoking them to the cart and shutting up their young ones in their living-place:",,,,,,,
5848,And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images.,,,,,,,
5849,"And the cows took the straight way, by the road to Beth-shemesh; they went by the highway, not turning to the right or to the left, and the sound of their voices was clear on the road; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the edge o",Beth-shemes,.,,,,,
5850,"And the people of Beth-shemesh were cutting their grain in the valley, and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it.",,,,,,,
5851,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and came to a stop there by a great stone: and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5852,"Then the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest in which were the gold images, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the Lord.",,,,,,,
5853,"And the five lords of the Philistines, having seen it, went back to Ekron the same day.",,,,,,,
5854,"Now these are the gold images which the Philistines sent as a sin-offering to the Lord; one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;",,,,,,,
5855,"And the gold mice, one for every town of the Philistines, the property of the five lords, walled towns as well as country places: and the great stone where they put the ark of the Lord is still in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite to this day.",,,,,,,
5856,But the Lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of Beth-shemesh for looking into the ark of the Lord; and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which the Lord had sent on them.,,,,,,,
5857,"And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to keep his place before the Lord, this holy God? and to whom may he go from us?",,,,,,,
5858,"And they sent men to the people living in Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have sent back the ark of the Lord; come and take it up to your country.So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the Lord to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, a",d they made,is,o,El,azar,hol,and
5859,"And the ark was in Kiriath-jearim for a long time, as much as twenty years: and all Israel was searching after the Lord with weeping.",,,,,,,
5860,"Then Samuel said to all Israel, If with all your hearts you would come back to the Lord, then put away all the strange gods and the Astartes from among you, and let your hearts be turned to the Lord, and be servants to him only: and he will make you safe",from the han,s o,,he,hili,tin,s.
5861,"So the children of Israel gave up the worship of Baal and Astarte, and became worshippers of the Lord only.",,,,,,,
5862,"Then Samuel said, Let all Israel come to Mizpah and I will make prayer to the Lord for you.",,,,,,,
5863,"So they came together to Mizpah, and got water, draining it out before the Lord, and they took no food that day, and they said, We have done evil against the Lord. And Samuel was judge of the children of Israel in Mizpah.",,,,,,,
5864,"Now when the Philistines had news that the children of Israel had come together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the children of Israel, hearing of it, were full of fear.",,,,,,,
5865,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Go on crying to the Lord our God for us to make us safe from the hands of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
5866,"And Samuel took a young lamb, offering all of it as a burned offering to the Lord; and Samuel made prayers to the Lord for Israel and the Lord gave him an answer.",,,,,,,
5867,"And while Samuel was offering the burned offering, the Philistines came near for the attack on Israel; but at the thunder of the Lord's voice that day the Philistines were overcome with fear, and they gave way before Israel.",,,,,,,
5868,"And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and went after the Philistines, attacking them till they came under Beth-car.",,,,,,,
5869,"Then Samuel took a stone and put it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, naming it Eben-ezer, and saying, Up to now the Lord has been our help.",,,,,,,
5870,"So the Philistines were overcome, and did not come into the country of Israel again: and all the days of Samuel the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.",,,,,,,
5871,"And the towns which the Philistines had taken were given back to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and all the country round them Israel made free from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.",,,,,,,
5872,And Samuel was judge of Israel all the days of his life.,,,,,,,
5873,"From year to year he went in turn to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.",,,,,,,
5874,"And his base was at Ramah, where his house was; there he was judge of Israel and there he made an altar to the Lord.Now when Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.",,,,,,,
5875,The name of his first son was Joel and the name of his second Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.,,,,,,,
5876,"And his sons did not go in his ways, but moved by the love of money took rewards, and were not upright in judging.",,,,,,,
5877,"Then all the responsible men of Israel got together and went to Samuel at Ramah,",,,,,,,
5878,"And said to him, See now, you are old, and your sons do not go in your ways: give us a king now to be our judge, so that we may be like the other nations.",,,,,,,
5879,"But Samuel was not pleased when they said to him, Give us a king to be our judge. And Samuel made prayer to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5880,"And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you: they have not been turned away from you, but they have been turned away from me, not desiring me to be king over them.",,,,,,,
5881,"As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to you.",,,,,,,
5882,"Give ear now to their voice: but make a serious protest to them, and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler.",,,,,,,
5883,And Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a king.,,,,,,,
5884,"And he said, This is the sort of king who will be your ruler: he will take your sons and make them his servants, his horsemen, and drivers of his war-carriages, and they will go running before his war-carriages;",,,,,,,
5885,And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties; some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war-carriages.,,,,,,,
5886,Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread-makers.,,,,,,,
5887,"He will take your fields and your vine-gardens and your olive-gardens, all the best of them, and give them to his servants.",,,,,,,
5888,He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants.,,,,,,,
5889,"He will take your men-servants and your servant-girls, and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work.",,,,,,,
5890,He will take a tenth of your sheep: and you will be his servants.,,,,,,,
5891,Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day.,,,,,,,
5892,"But the people gave no attention to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but we will have a king over us,",,,,,,,
5893,"So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war.",,,,,,,
5894,"Then Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5895,"And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to their voice and make a king for them. Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let every man go back to his town.Now there was a man of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, t",e son of Aph,"ah,",a,Ben,amit,", a",man o
5896,"He had a son named Saul, a specially good-looking young man; there was no one better-looking among the children of Israel: he was taller by a head than any other of the people.",,,,,,,
5897,"Now the asses of Saul's father Kish had gone wandering away. And Kish said to his son Saul, Take one of the servants with you, and get up and go in search of the asses.",,,,,,,
5898,"So they went through the hill-country of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah, but they saw no sign of them: then they went through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there: and they went through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not come",across them.,,,,,,
5899,"And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, Come, let us go back, or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us.",,,,,,,
5900,"But the servant said to him, See now, in this town there is a man of God, who is highly honoured, and everything he says comes true: let us go there now; it may be that he will give us directions about our journey.",,,,,,,
5901,"Then Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what are we to take the man? all our bread is gone, and we have no offering to take to the man of God: what are we to do?",,,,,,,
5902,"But the servant said in answer, I have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will give that to the man of God, and he will give us directions about our way.",,,,,,,
5903,"(In the past in Israel, when a man went to get directions from God, he said, Come let us go to the Seer, for he who now is named Prophet was in those days given the name of Seer.)",,,,,,,
5904,"Then Saul said to his servant, You have said well; come, let us go. So they went to the town where the man of God was.",,,,,,,
5905,"And when they were on the way up to the town, they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them, Is the seer here?",,,,,,,
5906,"And they said, He is; in fact he is before you: go quickly now, for he has come into the town today, for the people are making an offering in the high place today:",,,,,,,
5907,"When you come into the town you will see him straight away, before he goes up to the high place for the feast: the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast, and after that the guests will take part in it. So go up now and you will se",him.,,,,,,
5908,"So they went up to the town, and when they came inside the town, Samuel came face to face with them on his way to the high place.",,,,,,,
5909,"Now the day before Saul came, the word of God had come to Samuel, saying,",,,,,,,
5910,"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and on him you are to put the holy oil, making him ruler over my people Israel, and he will make my people safe from the hands of the Philistines: for I have seen the sorrow of my","eople, whose",cry,h,s c,me u,to,me.
5911,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, This is the man of whom I gave you word! he it is who is to have authority over my people.",,,,,,,
5912,"Then Saul came up to Samuel in the doorway of the town and said, Give me directions, if you will be so good, to the house of the seer.",,,,,,,
5913,"Then Samuel said to Saul, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place and take food with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, after opening to you all the secrets of your heart.",,,,,,,
5914,"As for your asses which have been wandering for three days, give no thought to them, for they have come back. And for whom are all the desired things in Israel? are they not for you and your father's family?",,,,,,,
5915,"And Saul said, Am I not a man of Benjamin, the smallest of all the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of the families of Benjamin? why then do you say these words to me?",,,,,,,
5916,"Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room, and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there, about thirty persons.",,,,,,,
5917,"And Samuel said to the cook, Give me that part which I gave you orders to keep by you.",,,,,,,
5918,"And the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it, and put it before Saul. And Samuel said, This is the part which has been kept for you: take it as your part of the feast; because it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests",ere present.,So,h,t d,y Sa,l t,ok fo
5919,"And when they had come down from the high place into the town, where a bed was made ready for Saul, he went to rest.",,,,,,,
5920,"And about dawn Samuel said to Saul on the roof, Get up so that I may send you away. So Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out together.",,,,,,,
5921,"And on their way down to the end of the town, Samuel said to Saul, Give your servant orders to go on in front of us, (so he went on,) but you keep here, so that I may give you the word of God.Then Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on his hea",and gave hi,a,i,s a,d sa,"d,",s not
5922,"When you have gone away from me today, you will see two men by the resting-place of Rachel's body, in the land of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went in search of have come back, and now your father, caring no longer fo","the asses,",s t,o,ble,abo,t y,"u, sa"
5923,"Then you are to go on from there, and when you come to the oak-tree of Tabor, you will see three men going up to God to Beth-el, one having with him three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine:",,,,,,,
5924,"They will say, Peace be with you, and will give you two cakes of bread, which you are to take from them.",,,,,,,
5925,"After that you will come to Gibeah, the hill of God, where an armed force of the Philistines is stationed: and when you come to the town, you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them; and they will",be acting li,e p,o,het,:,,
5926,"And the spirit of the Lord will come on you with power, and you will be acting like a prophet with them, and will be changed into another man.",,,,,,,
5927,"And when these signs come to you, see that you take the chance which is offered you; for God is with you.",,,,,,,
5928,"Then you are to go down before me to Gilgal, where I will come to you, for the offering of burned offerings and peace-offerings: go on waiting there for seven days till I come to you and make clear to you what you have to do.",,,,,,,
5929,"And it came about, that when he went away from Samuel, God gave him a changed heart: and all those signs took place that day.",,,,,,,
5930,"And when they came to Gibeah, a band of prophets came face to face with him; and the spirit of God came on him with power and he took his place among them as a prophet.",,,,,,,
5931,"Now when Saul's old friends saw him among the band of prophets, the people said to one another, What has come to Saul, the son of Kish? Is even Saul among the prophets?",,,,,,,
5932,"And one of the people of that place said in answer, And who is their father? So it became a common saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?",,,,,,,
5933,"Then going away from the prophets, he came to the house.",,,,,,,
5934,"And Saul's father's brother said to him and his servant, Where have you been? And he said, Searching for the asses: and when we saw no sign of them, we came to Samuel.",,,,,,,
5935,"Then he said, And what did Samuel say to you?",,,,,,,
5936,"And Saul, answering him, said, He gave us word that the asses had come back. But he said nothing to him of Samuel's words about the kingdom.",,,,,,,
5937,Then Samuel sent for the people to come together before the Lord at Mizpah;,,,,,,,
5938,"And he said to the children of Israel, The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, I took Israel out of Egypt, and made you free from the hands of the Egyptians and from all the kingdoms which kept you down:",,,,,,,
5939,"But today you are turned away from your God, who himself has been your saviour from all your troubles and sorrows; and you have said to him, Put a king over us. So now, take your places before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.",,,,,,,
5940,"So Samuel made all the tribes of Israel come near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.",,,,,,,
5941,"Then he made the tribe of Benjamin come near by families, and the family of the Matrites was taken: and from them, Saul, the son of Kish, was taken: but when they went in search of him he was nowhere to be seen.",,,,,,,
5942,"So they put another question to the Lord, Is the man present here? And the answer of the Lord was, He is keeping himself from view among the goods.",,,,,,,
5943,"So they went quickly and made him come out; and when he took his place among the people, he was taller by a head than any of the people.",,,,,,,
5944,"And Samuel said to all the people, Do you see the man of the Lord's selection, how there is no other like him among all the people? And all the people with loud cries said, Long life to the king!",,,,,,,
5945,"Then Samuel gave the people the laws of the kingdom, writing them in a book which he put in a safe place before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.",,,,,,,
5946,"And Saul went to Gibeah, to his house; and with him went the men of war whose hearts had been touched by God.",,,,,,,
5947,"But certain good-for-nothing persons said, How is this man to be our saviour? And having no respect for him, they gave him no offering.Then about a month after this, Nahash the Ammonite came up and put his forces in position for attacking Jabesh-gilead:",nd all the m,n o,,abe,h sa,d t,Naha
5948,"And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, I will make an agreement with you on this condition, that all your right eyes are put out; so that I may make it a cause of shame to all Israel.",,,,,,,
5949,"Then the responsible men of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days, so that we may send men to every part of Israel: and then, if no one comes to our help, we will come out to you.",,,,,,,
5950,"So they sent representatives to Saul's town Gibeah, and these gave the news to the people: and all the people gave themselves to weeping.",,,,,,,
5951,"Now Saul came from the field, driving the oxen before him; and he said, Why are the people weeping? And they gave him word of what the men of Jabesh had said.",,,,,,,
5952,"And at their words, the spirit of God came on Saul with power, and he became very angry.",,,,,,,
5953,"And he took two oxen and, cutting them up, sent them through all the land of Israel by the hand of runners, saying, If any man does not come out after Saul and Samuel, this will be done to his oxen. And the fear of the Lord came on the people and they ca",e out like o,e m,n,,,,
5954,"And he had them numbered in Bezek: the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.",,,,,,,
5955,"Then he said to the representatives who had come, Say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is high, you will be made safe. And the representatives came and gave the news to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.",,,,,,,
5956,"So the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.",,,,,,,
5957,"Now on the day after, Saul put the people into three bands, and in the morning watch they came to the tents of the Ammonites, and they went on attacking them till the heat of the day: and those who were not put to death were put to flight in every direct","on, so that",o t,o,of,hem,ere,toget
5958,"And the people said to Samuel, Who was it who said, Is Saul to be our king? give the men up, so that we may put them to death.",,,,,,,
5959,"And Saul said, Not a man is to be put to death today: for today the Lord has made Israel safe.",,,,,,,
5960,"Then Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal and there make the kingdom strong in the hands of Saul.",,,,,,,
5961,"So all the people went to Gilgal; and there in Gilgal they made Saul king before the Lord; and peace-offerings were offered before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel were glad with great joy.And Samuel said to all Israel, You see that I h",ve given ear,to,v,ryt,ing,ou,aid t
5962,"And now, see, the king is before you: and I am old and grey-headed, and my sons are with you: I have been living before your eyes from my early days till now.",,,,,,,
5963,Here I am: give witness against me before the Lord and before the man on whom he has put the holy oil: whose ox or ass have I taken? to whom have I been untrue? who has been crushed down by me? from whose hand have I taken a price for the blinding of my,yes? I will,ive,i,al,bac,to,you.
5964,"And they said, You have never been untrue to us or cruel to us; you have taken nothing from any man.",,,,,,,
5965,"Then he said, The Lord is witness against you, and the man on whom he has put the holy oil is witness this day that you have seen no wrong in me. And they said, He is witness.",,,,,,,
5966,"And Samuel said to the people, The Lord is witness, who gave authority to Moses and Aaron, and who took your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
5967,"Keep your places now, while I take up the argument with you before the Lord, and give you the story of the righteousness of the Lord, which he has made clear by his acts to you and to your fathers.",,,,,,,
5968,"When Jacob and his sons had come into Egypt, and were crushed by the Egyptians, the prayers of your fathers came up to the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who took your fathers out of Egypt, and he put them into this place.",,,,,,,
5969,"But they were false to the Lord their God, and he gave them up into the hands of Sisera, captain of the army of Jabin, king of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the king of Moab, who made war against them.",,,,,,,
5970,"Then crying out to the Lord, they said, We have done evil, because we have been turned away from the Lord, worshipping the Baals and the Astartes: but now, make us safe from those who are against us and we will be your servants.",,,,,,,
5971,"So the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and took you out of the power of those who were fighting against you on every side, and made you safe.",,,,,,,
5972,"And when you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming against you, you said to me, No more of this; we will have a king for our ruler: when the Lord your God was your king.",,,,,,,
5973,"Here, then, is the king marked out by you: the Lord has put a king over you.",,,,,,,
5974,"If in the fear of the Lord you are his servants, hearing his voice and not going against the orders of the Lord, but being true to the Lord your God, you and the king ruling over you, then all will be well:",,,,,,,
5975,"But if you do not give ear to the voice of the Lord, but go against his orders, then the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your king for your destruction, as it was against your fathers.",,,,,,,
5976,Now keep where you are and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes.,,,,,,,
5977,Is it not now the time of the grain cutting? My cry will go up to the Lord and he will send thunder and rain: so that you may see and be conscious of your great sin which you have done in the eyes of the Lord in desiring a king for yourselves.,,,,,,,
5978,So Samuel made prayer to the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people were in fear of the Lord and of Samuel.,,,,,,,
5979,"And all the people said to Samuel, Make prayer for us to the Lord your God so that death may not overtake us: for in addition to all our sins we have done this evil, in desiring a king.",,,,,,,
5980,"Then Samuel said to the people, Have no fear: truly you have done evil, but do not be turned away from the Lord; be his servants with all your heart;",,,,,,,
5981,"And do not go from the right way turning to those false gods in which there is no profit and no salvation, for they are false.",,,,,,,
5982,"For the Lord will not give his people up, because of the honour of his name; for it was the Lord's pleasure to make of you a people for himself.",,,,,,,
5983,"And as for me, never will I go against the orders of the Lord by giving up my prayers for you: but I will go on teaching you the good and right way.",,,,,,,
5984,"Only go in the fear of the Lord, and be his true servants with all your heart, keeping in mind what great things he has done for you.",,,,,,,
5985,"But if you still do evil, destruction will overtake you and your king.***",,,,,,,
5986,"And Saul took for himself three thousand men of Israel, of whom he kept two thousand with him in Michmash and in the mountain of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: the rest of the people he sent back to their te",ts.,,,,,,
5987,"And Jonathan made an attack on the armed force of the Philistines stationed at Gibeah; and news was given to the Philistines that the Hebrews were turned against them. And Saul had a horn sounded through all the land,",,,,,,,
5988,"And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines, and that Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines. And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal.",,,,,,,
5989,"And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel, three thousand war-carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number: they came up and took up their position in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.",,,,,,,
5990,"When the men of Israel saw the danger they were in, (for the people were troubled,) they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows.",,,,,,,
5991,"And a great number of the people had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people went after him shaking in fear.",,,,,,,
5992,"And he went on waiting there for seven days, the time fixed by Samuel: but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were starting to go away from him.",,,,,,,
5993,"Then Saul said, Come here and give me the burned offering and the peace-offerings. And he made a burned offering to the Lord.",,,,,,,
5994,"And when the burned offering was ended, Samuel came; and Saul went out to see him and to give him a blessing.",,,,,,,
5995,"And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were going away from me, and you had not come at the time which had been fixed, and the Philistines had come together at Michmash;",,,,,,,
5996,"I said, Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal, and I have made no prayer for help to the Lord: and so, forcing myself to do it, I made a burned offering.",,,,,,,
5997,"And Samuel said to Saul, You have done a foolish thing: you have not kept the rules which the Lord your God gave you; it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority over Israel safe for ever.",,,,,,,
5998,"But now, your authority will not go on: the Lord, searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way, has given him the place of ruler over his people, because you have not done what the Lord gave you orders to do.",,,,,,,
5999,"Then Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul against the men of war, and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: and Saul took the number of the people who were with him, about six hundred men.",,,,,,,
6000,"And Saul, with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them, was waiting in Geba in the land of Benjamin: but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash.",,,,,,,
6001,"And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack; one band went by the road which goes to Ophrah, into the land of Shual:",,,,,,,
6002,"And another went in the direction of Beth-horon: and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of Zeboiim, in the direction of the waste land.",,,,,,,
6003,"Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears:",,,,,,,
6004,But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp;,,,,,,,
6005,"For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes, and for putting iron points on their ox-driving rods.",,,,,,,
6006,"So on the day of the fight at Michmash, not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan: only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.",,,,,,,
6007,"And the armed force of the Philistines went out to the narrow way of Michmash.Now one day Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was with him, looking after his arms, Come, let us go over to the Philistine force over there. But he said noth",ng to his fa,her,,,,,
6008,"And Saul was still waiting in the farthest part of Geba, under the fruit-tree in Migron: there were about six hundred men with him;",,,,,,,
6009,"And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, who had the ephod. And the people had no idea that Jonathan had gone.",,,,,,,
6010,"Now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which Jonathan was making his way to the Philistines' forces, there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.",,,,,,,
6011,The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba.,,,,,,,
6012,"And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms, Come, let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision: it may be that the Lord will give us help, for there is no limit to his power; the Lord is able to give salvation by a grea",army or by,sm,l,ba,d.,,
6013,"And his servant said to him, Do whatever is in your mind: see, I am with you in every impulse of your heart.",,,,,,,
6014,"Then Jonathan said, Now we will go over to these men and let them see us.",,,,,,,
6015,"If they say to us, Keep quiet where you are till we come to you; then we will keep our places and not go up to them.",,,,,,,
6016,"But if they say, Come up to us; then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hands: and this will be the sign to us.",,,,,,,
6017,"And they let the Philistine force see the two of them: and the Philistines said, Look! the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover.",,,,,,,
6018,"And the armed men of the force gave Jonathan and his servant their answer, saying, Come up here to us, and we will let you see something. Then Jonathan said to his servant, Come up after me: for the Lord has given them up into the hands of Israel.",,,,,,,
6019,"And Jonathan went up, gripping with his hands and his feet, his servant going up after him; and the Philistines gave way before Jonathan when he made an attack on them, and his servant put them to death after him.",,,,,,,
6020,"And at their first attack, Jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men, all inside the space of half an acre of land.",,,,,,,
6021,"And there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force, and the attackers were shaking with fear; even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from God.",,,,,,,
6022,"And the watchmen of Saul, looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin, saw all the army flowing away and running here and there.",,,,,,,
6023,"Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us. And when they had been numbered, it was seen that Jonathan and his servant were not there.",,,,,,,
6024,"And Saul said to Ahijah, Let the ephod come here. For he went before Israel with the ephod at that time.",,,,,,,
6025,"Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the noise in the tents of the Philistines became louder and louder; and Saul said to the priest, Take back your hand.",,,,,,,
6026,"And Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight: and every man's sword was turned against the man at his side, and there was a very great noise.",,,,,,,
6027,"Then the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time, and had gone up with them to their tents, turning round were joined to those who were with Saul and Jonathan.",,,,,,,
6028,"And all the men of Israel who had taken cover in the hill-country of Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight, went after them, attacking them.",,,,,,,
6029,So the Lord made Israel safe that day: and the fight went over to Beth-aven.,,,,,,,
6030,"And all the people were with Saul, about twenty thousand men, and the fight was general through all the hill-country of Ephraim; but Saul made a great error that day, by putting the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes food befo",e evening co,es,n,I,ave,ive,puni
6031,"And there was honey on the face of the field, and all the people came to the honey, the bees having gone from it;",,,,,,,
6032,But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse.,,,,,,,
6033,"But Jonathan, having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people, stretching out the rod which was in his hand, put the end of it in the honey, and put it to his mouth; then his eyes were made bright.",,,,,,,
6034,"Then one of the people said to him, Your father put the people under an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed who takes any food this day. And the people were feeble, needing food.",,,,,,,
6035,"Then Jonathan said, My father has made trouble come on the land: now see how bright my eyes have become because I have taken a little of this honey.",,,,,,,
6036,How much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them! would there not have been much greater destruction among the Philistines?,,,,,,,
6037,That day they overcame the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were feeble from need of food.,,,,,,,
6038,"And rushing at the goods taken in the fight, the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen, and put them to death there on the earth, and had a meal, taking the flesh with the blood in it.",,,,,,,
6039,"Then it was said to Saul, See, the people are sinning against the Lord, taking the blood with the flesh. And he said to those who gave him the news, Now let a great stone be rolled to me here.",,,,,,,
6040,"And Saul said, Go about among the people and say to them, Let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep, and put them to death here, and take his meal: do no sin against the Lord by taking the blood with the flesh. So all the people took their",xen with the,th,t,nig,t an,pu,them
6041,And Saul put up an altar to the Lord: this was the first altar which he put up to the Lord.,,,,,,,
6042,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, attacking them till the morning, till there is not a man of them living. And they said, Do whatever seems right to you. Then the priest said, Let us come near to God.",,,,,,,
6043,"And Saul, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go down after the Philistines? will you give them up into the hands of Israel? But he gave him no answer that day.",,,,,,,
6044,"And Saul said, Come near, all you chiefs of the people, and let us get word from God and see in whom is this sin today.",,,,,,,
6045,"For, by the living Lord, the saviour of Israel, even if the sinner is Jonathan, my son, death will certainly be his fate. But not a man among all the people gave him any answer.",,,,,,,
6046,"Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do whatever seems good to you.",,,,,,,
6047,"Then Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, Why have you not given me an answer today? If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son, O Lord God of Israel, give Urim, and if it is in your people Israel, give Thummim. And by the decision of the Lord, Saul",nd Jonathan,ere,m,rke,out,an,the

6049,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Give me an account of what you have done. And Jonathan gave him the story and said, Certainly I took a little honey on the end of my rod; and now death is to be my fate.",,,,,,,
6050,"And Saul said, May God's punishment be on me if death is not your fate, Jonathan.",,,,,,,
6051,"And the people said to Saul, Is death to come to Jonathan, the worker of this great salvation for Israel? Let it not be so: by the living Lord, not one hair of his head is to be touched, for he has been working with God today. So the people kept Jonathan",from death.,,,,,,
6052,"Then Saul, turning back, went after the Philistines no longer: and the Philistines went back to their place.",,,,,,,
6053,"Now when Saul had taken his place as ruler of Israel, he made war on those who were against him on every side, Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and the kings of Zobah and the Philistines: and whichever way he went, he overcame them.",,,,,,,
6054,"And he did great things, and overcame the Amalekites, and made Israel safe from the hands of their attackers.",,,,,,,
6055,Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and these are the names of his daughters: the older was named Merab and the younger Michal;,,,,,,,
6056,"The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, brother of Saul's father.",,,,,,,
6057,"Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were sons of Abiel.",,,,,,,
6058,"All through the life of Saul there was bitter war against the Philistines; and whenever Saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man, he kept him near himself.And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make you king o",er his peopl,", o",e,Is,ael:,so,ive e
6059,"The Lord of armies says, I will give punishment to Amalek for what he did to Israel, fighting against him on the way when Israel came out of Egypt.",,,,,,,
6060,"Go now and put Amalek to the sword, putting to the curse all they have, without mercy: put to death every man and woman, every child and baby at the breast, every ox and sheep, camel and ass.",,,,,,,
6061,"And Saul sent for the people and had them numbered in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.",,,,,,,
6062,"And Saul came to the town of Amalek, and took up his position in the valley secretly.",,,,,,,
6063,"And Saul said to the Kenites, Go away, take yourselves out from among the Amalekites, or destruction will overtake you with them: for you were kind to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt. So the Kenites went away from among the Amalekites.",,,,,,,
6064,"And Saul made an attack on the Amalekites from Havilah on the road to Shur, which is before Egypt.",,,,,,,
6065,"He took Agag, king of the Amalekites, prisoner, and put all the people to the sword without mercy.",,,,,,,
6066,"But Saul and the people did not put Agag to death, and they kept the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs, and whatever was good, not desiring to put them to the curse: but everything which was bad and of no use they put to the",curse.,,,,,,
6067,"Then the Lord said to Samuel,",,,,,,,
6068,"It is no longer my pleasure for Saul to be king; for he is turned back from going in my ways, and has not done my orders. And Samuel was very sad, crying to the Lord in prayer all night.",,,,,,,
6069,"And early in the morning he got up and went to Saul; and word was given to Samuel that Saul had come to Carmel and put up a pillar, and had gone from there down to Gilgal.",,,,,,,
6070,"And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, May the blessing of the Lord be with you: I have done what was ordered by the Lord.",,,,,,,
6071,"And Samuel said, What then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of oxen which comes to my ears?",,,,,,,
6072,"And Saul said, They have taken them from the Amalekites: for the people have kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the Lord your God; all the rest we have given up to destruction.",,,,,,,
6073,"Then Samuel said to Saul, Say no more! Let me give you word of what the Lord has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.",,,,,,,
6074,"And Samuel said, Though you may seem little to yourself, are you not head of the tribes of Israel? for the Lord with the holy oil made you king over Israel,",,,,,,,
6075,"And the Lord sent you on a journey and said, Go and put to the curse those sinners, the Amalekites, fighting against them till every one is dead.",,,,,,,
6076,"Why then did you not do the orders of the Lord, but by violently taking their goods did evil in the eyes of the Lord?",,,,,,,
6077,"And Saul said, Truly, I have done the orders of the Lord and have gone the way the Lord sent me; I have taken Agag, the king of Amalek, and have given the Amalekites up to destruction.",,,,,,,
6078,"But the people took some of their goods, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which were put to the curse, to make an offering of them to the Lord your God in Gilgal.",,,,,,,
6079,"And Samuel said, Has the Lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings as in the doing of his orders? Truly, to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings, and to give ear to him than the fat of sheep.",,,,,,,
6080,"For to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts, and pride is like giving worship to images. Because you have put away from you the word of the Lord, he has put you from your place as king.",,,,,,,
6081,"And Saul said to Samuel, Great is my sin: for I have gone against the orders of the Lord and against your words: because, fearing the people, I did what they said.",,,,,,,
6082,"So now, let my sin have forgiveness, and go back with me to give worship to the Lord.",,,,,,,
6083,"And Samuel said to Saul, I will not go back with you: for you have put away from you the word of the Lord, and the Lord has put you from your place as king over Israel.",,,,,,,
6084,"And when Samuel was turning round to go away, Saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand, and the cloth came away.",,,,,,,
6085,"And Samuel said to him, The Lord has taken away the kingdom of Israel from you this day by force, and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you.",,,,,,,
6086,"And further, the Glory of Israel will not say what is false, and his purpose may not be changed: for he is not a man, whose purpose may be changed.",,,,,,,
6087,"Then he said, Great is my sin: but still, give me honour now before the heads of my people and before Israel, and come back with me so that I may give worship to the Lord your God.",,,,,,,
6088,"So Samuel went back after Saul, and Saul gave worship to the Lord.",,,,,,,
6089,"Then Samuel said, Make Agag, the king of the Amalekites, come here to me. And Agag came to him shaking with fear. And Agag said, Truly the pain of death is past.",,,,,,,
6090,"And Samuel said, As your sword has made women without children, so now your mother will be without children among women. And Agag was cut up by Samuel, bone from bone, before the Lord in Gilgal.",,,,,,,
6091,"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah, in the land of Saul.",,,,,,,
6092,"And Samuel never saw Saul again till the day of his death; but Samuel was sorrowing for Saul: and it was no longer the Lord's pleasure for Saul to be king over Israel.And the Lord said to Samuel, How long will you go on sorrowing for Saul, seeing that I",ave put him,rom,h,s p,ace,s k,ng ov
6093,"And Samuel said, How is it possible for me to go? If Saul gets news of it he will put me to death. And the Lord said, Take a young cow with you and say, I have come to make an offering to the Lord.",,,,,,,
6094,"And send for Jesse to be present at the offering, and I will make clear to you what you are to do: and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name I give you.",,,,,,,
6095,"And Samuel did as the Lord said and came to Beth-lehem. And the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said, Do you come in peace?",,,,,,,
6096,"And he said, In peace: I have come to make an offering to the Lord: make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering. And he made Jesse and his sons clean, and sent for them to be present at the offering.",,,,,,,
6097,"Now when they came, looking at Eliab, he said, Clearly the man of the Lord's selection is before him.",,,,,,,
6098,"But the Lord said to Samuel, Do not take note of his face or how tall he is, because I will not have him: for the Lord's view is not man's; man takes note of the outer form, but the Lord sees the heart.",,,,,,,
6099,"Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before Samuel. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.",,,,,,,
6100,"Then Jesse made Shammah come before him. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.",,,,,,,
6101,"And Jesse made his seven sons come before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The Lord has not taken any of these.",,,,,,,
6102,"Then Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your children here? And he said, There is still the youngest, and he is looking after the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and make him come here: for we will not take our seats till he is here.",,,,,,,
6103,"So he sent and made him come in. Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks. And the Lord said, Come, put the oil on him, for this is he.",,,,,,,
6104,"Then Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on him there among his brothers: and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power. So Samuel went back to Ramah.",,,,,,,
6105,"Now the spirit of the Lord had gone from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord was troubling him.",,,,,,,
6106,"And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God is troubling you.",,,,,,,
6107,"Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument: and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will make music for you on his instrument, and you will get",ell.,,,,,,
6108,"And Saul said to his servants, Then get me a man who is an expert player, and make him come to me.",,,,,,,
6109,"Then one of the servants in answer said, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Beth-lehemite, who is expert at playing, and a strong man and a man of war; and he is wise in his words, and pleasing in looks, and the Lord is with him.",,,,,,,
6110,"So Saul sent his servants to Jesse and said, Send me your son David who is with the sheep.",,,,,,,
6111,And Jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to Saul by David.,,,,,,,
6112,"And David came to Saul, waiting before him: and he became very dear to Saul, who made him his servant, giving him the care of his arms.",,,,,,,
6113,"And Saul sent to Jesse saying, Let David be with me, for he is pleasing to me.",,,,,,,
6114,"And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David took his instrument and made music: so new life came to Saul, and he got well, and the evil spirit went away from him.Now the Philistines got their armies together for war, and came together at So",oh in the la,d o,,uda,", an",to,k up
6115,"And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah, and put their forces in order against the Philistines.",,,,,,,
6116,The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and Israel on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.,,,,,,,
6117,"And a fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath; he was more than six cubits tall.",,,,,,,
6118,"And he had a head-dress of brass on his head, and he was dressed in a coat of metal, the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass.",,,,,,,
6119,His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass.,,,,,,,
6120,"The stem of his spear was as long as a cloth-worker's rod, and its head was made of six hundred shekels' weight of iron: and one went before him with his body-cover.",,,,,,,
6121,"He took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of Israel, Why have you come out to make war? Am I not a Philistine and you servants of Saul? Send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.",,,,,,,
6122,"If he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me, then we will be your servants: but if I am able to overcome him, then you will be our servants and do work for us.",,,,,,,
6123,"And the Philistine said, I have put to shame the armies of Israel this day; give me a man so that we may have a fight together.",,,,,,,
6124,"And Saul and all Israel, hearing those words of the Philistine, were troubled and full of fear.",,,,,,,
6125,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah named Jesse, who had eight sons; and he was an old man in Saul's day, and far on in years.",,,,,,,
6126,"And the three oldest sons of Jesse had gone with Saul to the fight: the names of the three who went to the fight were Eliab, the oldest, and Abinadab the second, and Shammah the third.",,,,,,,
6127,And David was the youngest: and the three oldest were with Saul's army.,,,,,,,
6128,"Now David went to and from Saul, looking after his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.",,,,,,,
6129,And the Philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days.,,,,,,,
6130,"And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread, and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers;",,,,,,,
6131,"And take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are.",,,,,,,
6132,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.",,,,,,,
6133,"And David got up early in the morning, and, giving the sheep into the care of a keeper, took the things and went as Jesse had said; and he came to the lines where the carts were, when the army was going out to the fight giving their war-cry.",,,,,,,
6134,"And Israel and the Philistines had put their forces in position, army against army.",,,,,,,
6135,"And David gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores, and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them.",,,,,,,
6136,"And while he was talking to them, the fighter, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came out from the Philistines' lines and said the same words, in David's hearing.",,,,,,,
6137,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw him, went in flight, overcome with fear.",,,,,,,
6138,"And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man? Clearly he has come out to put shame on Israel: and it is certain that if any man overcomes him, the king will give that man great wealth, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's family fr",e in Israel.,,,,,,
6139,"And David said to the men near him, What will be done to the man who overcomes this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel? for who is this Philistine, a man without circumcision, that he has put shame on the armies of the living God?",,,,,,,
6140,"And the people gave him this answer, So it will be done to the man who overcomes him.",,,,,,,
6141,"And Eliab, his oldest brother, hearing what David said to the men, was moved to wrath against David, and said, Why have you come here? Into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land? I have knowledge of your pride and the evi",of your hea,"t,",o,ha,e co,e d,wn to
6142,"And David said, What have I done now? was it not only a word?",,,,,,,
6143,"And turning away from him to one of the other men, he said the same words: and the people gave him the same answer.",,,,,,,
6144,"And, hearing what David said, they gave Saul word of it: and he sent for him.",,,,,,,
6145,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart become feeble because of him; I, your servant, will go out and have a fight with this Philistine.",,,,,,,
6146,"And Saul said to David, You are not able to go out against this Philistine and have a fight with him: for you are only a boy, and he has been a man of war from his earliest days.",,,,,,,
6147,"And David said to Saul, Your servant has been keeper of his father's sheep; and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,",,,,,,,
6148,"I went out after him, and overcame him, and took it out of his mouth: and if, turning on me, he came at me, I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death.",,,,,,,
6149,"Your servant has overcome lion and bear: and the fate of this Philistine, who is without circumcision, will be like theirs, seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living God.",,,,,,,
6150,"And David said, The Lord, who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear, will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go! and may the Lord be with you.",,,,,,,
6151,"Then Saul gave David his clothing of war, and put a head-dress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal.",,,,,,,
6152,"And David took Saul's sword and put the band round him over the metal coat, and was unable to go forward; for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, It is not possible for me to go out with these, for I am not used to them. So David took them",ff.,,,,,,
6153,"Then he took his stick in his hand, and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep-keepers; and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones: and so he went in the direction of the Philistin",.,,,,,,
6154,And the Philistine came nearer to David; and the man who had his body-cover went before him.,,,,,,,
6155,"And when the Philistine, taking note, saw David, he had a poor opinion of him: for he was only a boy, red-haired and good-looking.",,,,,,,
6156,"And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come out to me with sticks? And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods.",,,,,,,
6157,"And the Philistine said to David, Come here to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.",,,,,,,
6158,"Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin: but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies, the God of the armies of Israel on which you have put shame.",,,,,,,
6159,"This day the Lord will give you up into my hands, and I will overcome you, and take your head off you; and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today, so that all the earth may see that Israel",as a God;,,,,,,
6160,"And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give salvation by sword and spear: for the fight is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hands.",,,,,,,
6161,"Now when the Philistine made a move and came near to David, David quickly went at a run in the direction of the army, meeting the Philistine face to face.",,,,,,,
6162,"And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the Philistine, and the stone went deep into his brow, and he went down to the earth, falling on his face.",,,,,,,
6163,"So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone, wounding the Philistine and causing his death: but David had no sword in his hand.",,,,,,,
6164,"So running up to the Philistine and putting his foot on him, David took his sword out of its cover, and put him to death, cutting off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their fighter was dead, they went in flight.",,,,,,,
6165,"And the men of Israel and of Judah got up, and gave a cry, and went after the Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines were falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to Gath and Ekron.",,,,,,,
6166,"Then the children of Israel came back from going after the Philistines, and took their goods from the tents.",,,,,,,
6167,"And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, but the metal war-dress and the arms he put in his tent.",,,,,,,
6168,"And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, On your life, O king, I have no idea.",,,,,,,
6169,"And the king said, Make search and see whose son this young man is.",,,,,,,
6170,"And when David was coming back after the destruction of the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.",,,,,,,
6171,"And Saul said to him, Young man, whose son are you? And David in answer said, I am the son of your servant Jesse of Beth-lehem.Now after David's talk with Saul was ended, the soul of Jonathan was joined with the soul of David, and David became as dear to",him as his v,ry,i,e.,,,
6172,And that day Saul took David and would not let him go back to his father's house.,,,,,,,
6173,"Then Jonathan and David made an agreement together, because of Jonathan's love for David.",,,,,,,
6174,"And Jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to David, with all his military dress, even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body.",,,,,,,
6175,"And David went wherever Saul sent him, and did wisely: and Saul put him at the head of his men of war, and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Saul's servants.",,,,,,,
6176,"Now on their way, when David came back after the destruction of the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, with songs and dances, meeting David with melody and joy and instruments of music.",,,,,,,
6177,"And the women, answering one another in their song, said, Saul has put to death his thousands and David his tens of thousands.",,,,,,,
6178,"And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him; and he said, They have given David credit for tens of thousands, and to me for only thousands: what more is there for him but the kingdom?",,,,,,,
6179,And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David.,,,,,,,
6180,"Now on the day after, an evil spirit from God came on Saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house, while David was making music for him, as he did day by day: and Saul had his spear in his hand.",,,,,,,
6181,"And Saul, balancing the spear in his hand, said, I will give David a blow, pinning him to the wall. And David got away from him twice.",,,,,,,
6182,"And Saul went in fear of David, because the Lord was with David and had gone away from Saul.",,,,,,,
6183,"So Saul sent him away, and made him a captain over a thousand; and he went about his business before the people.",,,,,,,
6184,And in all his undertakings David did wisely; and the Lord was with him.,,,,,,,
6185,"And when Saul saw how wisely he did, he was in fear of him.",,,,,,,
6186,"But David was loved by all Israel and Judah, for he went out and came in before them.",,,,,,,
6187,"And Saul said to David, Here is my oldest daughter Merab, whom I will give you for your wife: only be strong for me, fighting in the Lord's wars. For Saul said, Let it not be through me that his fate comes to him, but through the Philistines.",,,,,,,
6188,"And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's family in Israel, that I am to be son-in-law to the king?",,,,,,,
6189,"But when the time came to give Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, she was given to Adriel of Meholath.",,,,,,,
6190,And Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David: and Saul had word of it and was pleased.,,,,,,,
6191,"And Saul said, I will give her to him, so that she may be a cause of danger to him, and so that the hands of the Philistines may be against him. So Saul said to David, Today you are to become my son-in-law for the second time.",,,,,,,
6192,"And Saul gave his servants orders saying, Have talk with David secretly and say to him, See how the king has delight in you, and how you are loved by all his servants: then be the king's son-in-law.",,,,,,,
6193,"And Saul's servants said these things to David. And David said, Does it seem to you a small thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, of no great name?",,,,,,,
6194,And the servants of Saul gave him an account of what David had said.,,,,,,,
6195,"And Saul said, Then say to David, The king has no desire for any bride-price, but only for the private parts of a hundred Philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters. But it was in Saul's mind that David might come to his end by the han",s of the Phi,ist,n,s.,,,
6196,"And when his servants said these words to David, he was well pleased to be the son-in-law of the king. And the days were still not past.",,,,,,,
6197,"So David and his men got up and went, and put to death two hundred of the Philistines; and David took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king, so that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for h",s wife.,,,,,,
6198,And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David; and he was loved by all Israel.,,,,,,,
6199,"And Saul's fear of David became all the greater, and he went on hating him, day by day.",,,,,,,
6200,"Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war: and whenever they went out, David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul, so that his name became greatly honoured.And Saul gave orders to his son Jonathan and to all his servants to put Da",id to death.,But,S,ul',son,Jon,than
6201,"And Jonathan said to David, Saul, my father, is purposing your death: so now, take care in the morning, and keep yourself safe in a secret place:",,,,,,,
6202,"And I will go out and take my place by my father's side in the field near where you are; and I will get into talk with my father about you, and when I see how things are, I will give you word.",,,,,,,
6203,"And Jonathan gave his father Saul a good account of David, and said to him, Let not the king do wrong against his servant, against David; because he has done you no wrong, and all his acts have had a good outcome for you:",,,,,,,
6204,"For he put his life in danger and overcame the Philistine, and the Lord gave all Israel salvation: you saw it and were glad: why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong, desiring the death of David without cause?",,,,,,,
6205,"And Saul gave ear to the voice of Jonathan, and said with an oath, By the living Lord, he is not to be put to death.",,,,,,,
6206,"Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things. And Jonathan took David to Saul, who kept him by his side as in the past.",,,,,,,
6207,"And there was war again: and David went out fighting the Philistines, causing great destruction among them; and they went in flight before him.",,,,,,,
6208,"And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul, when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand; and David made music for him.",,,,,,,
6209,"And Saul would have sent his spear through him, pinning him to the wall, but he got away and the spear went into the wall: and that night David went in flight and got away.",,,,,,,
6210,"Then in that night Saul sent men to David's house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning: and David's wife Michal said to him, If you do not go away to a safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning.",,,,,,,
6211,"So Michal let David down through the window, and he went in flight and got away.",,,,,,,
6212,"Then Michal took the image and put it in the bed, with a cushion of goat's hair at its head, and she put clothing over it.",,,,,,,
6213,"And when Saul sent men to take David, she said, He is ill.",,,,,,,
6214,"And Saul sent his men to see David, saying, Do not come back without him, take him in his bed, so that I may put him to death.",,,,,,,
6215,"And when the men came in, there was the image in the bed, with the cushion of goat's hair at its head",,,,,,,
6216,"And Saul said to Michal, why have you been false to me, letting my hater go and get safely away? And in answer Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go, or I will put you to death.",,,,,,,
6217,"So David went in flight and got away and came to Ramah, to Samuel, and gave him an account of all Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and were living in Naioth.",,,,,,,
6218,And word was given to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah.,,,,,,,
6219,"And Saul sent men to take David; and when they saw the band of prophets at work, with Samuel in his place at their head, the spirit of God came on Saul's men, and they became like prophets.",,,,,,,
6220,"And Saul, having news of this, sent other men, who in the same way became like prophets. And a third time Saul sent men, and they like the others became like prophets.",,,,,,,
6221,"Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great water-spring in Secu; and questioning the people he said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, They are at Naioth in Ramah.",,,,,,,
6222,"And he went on from there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God came on him, and he went on, acting like a prophet, till he came to Naioth in Ramah.",,,,,,,
6223,"And he took off his clothing, acting like a prophet before Samuel, and falling down he was stretched out, without his clothing, all that day and all that night. This is the reason for the saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?And David went in flight f",om Naioth in,Ram,h,and,came,to,onath
6224,"And he said to him, Far be the thought: you will not be put to death: see, my father does nothing, great or small, without giving me word of it: would he keep this secret from me? It is not so.",,,,,,,
6225,"But David took his oath again and said, Your father sees that I am dear to you; so he says to himself, Let Jonathan have no idea of this, for it will be a grief to him; but as the Lord is living, and as your soul is living, there is only a step between m",and death.,,,,,,
6226,"Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.",,,,,,,
6227,"And David said to Jonathan, Tomorrow is the new moon, and I will not be seated with the king at his table: but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening.",,,,,,,
6228,"And if your father takes note of the fact that I am away, say, David made a request to me for himself that he might go to Beth-lehem, to his town: for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year.",,,,,,,
6229,"If he says, It is well, your servant will be at peace: but if he is angry, then it will be clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me.",,,,,,,
6230,"So, then, be kind to your servant; for you have been united with your servant in an agreement made before the Lord: but if there is any wrongdoing in me, put me to death yourself; why take me to your father?",,,,,,,
6231,"And Jonathan said, Do not have such a thought: for if I saw that my father was designing evil against you, would I not give you word of it?",,,,,,,
6232,"Then David said to Jonathan, Who will give me word if your father gives you a rough answer?",,,,,,,
6233,"And Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go out into the country. And the two of them went out together into the open country.",,,,,,,
6234,"And Jonathan said to David, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be witness; when I have had a chance of talking to my father, about this time tomorrow, if his feelings to David are good, will I not send and give you the news?",,,,,,,
6235,"May the Lord's punishment be on Jonathan, if it is my father's pleasure to do you evil and I do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace: and may the Lord be with you, as he has been with my father.",,,,,,,
6236,"And may you, while I am still living, O may you be kind to me, as the Lord is kind, and keep me from death!",,,,,,,
6237,"And let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family, even when the Lord has sent destruction on all David's haters, cutting them off from the face of the earth.",,,,,,,
6238,"And if it comes about that the name of Jonathan is cut off from the family of David, the Lord will make David responsible.",,,,,,,
6239,"And Jonathan again took an oath to David, because of his love for him: for David was as dear to him as his very soul.",,,,,,,
6240,"Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and it will be seen that you are not present, for there will be no one in your seat.",,,,,,,
6241,"And on the third day it will be specially noted, and you will go to the place where you took cover when the other business was in hand, waiting by the hill over there.",,,,,,,
6242,And on the third day I will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark.,,,,,,,
6243,"And I will send my boy to have a look for the arrow. And if I say to him, See, the arrow is on this side of you; take it up! then you may come; for there is peace for you and no evil, by the living Lord.",,,,,,,
6244,"But if I say to the boy, See, the arrow has gone past you: then go on your way, for the Lord has sent you away.",,,,,,,
6245,"As for what you and I were talking of, the Lord is between you and me for ever.",,,,,,,
6246,"So David went to a secret place in the country: and when the new moon came, the king took his place at the feast.",,,,,,,
6247,"And the king took his seat, as at other times, by the wall: and Jonathan was in front, and Abner was seated by Saul's side, but there was no one in David's seat.",,,,,,,
6248,"But Saul said nothing that day, for his thought was, Something has taken place making him unclean; it is clear that he is not clean.",,,,,,,
6249,"And on the day after the new moon, that is, the second day, there was still no one in David's seat: and Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today?",,,,,,,
6250,"And answering Saul, Jonathan said, He made a request to me that he might go to Beth-lehem,",,,,,,,
6251,"Saying, Our family is making an offering in the town, and my brothers have given me orders to be there: so now, if I have grace in your eyes, let me go away and see my brothers. This is why he has not come to the king's table.",,,,,,,
6252,"Then Saul was moved to wrath against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of an evil and uncontrolled woman, have I not seen how you have given your love to the son of Jesse, to your shame and the shame of your mother?",,,,,,,
6253,"For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth, your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger. So make him come here to me, for it is certainly right for him to be put to death.",,,,,,,
6254,"And Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said to him, Why is he to be put to death? What has he done?",,,,,,,
6255,"And Saul, pointing his spear at him, made an attempt to give him a wound: from which it was clear to Jonathan that his father's purpose was to put David to death.",,,,,,,
6256,"So Jonathan got up from the table, burning with wrath, and took no part in the feast the second day of the month, being full of grief for David because his father had put shame on him.",,,,,,,
6257,"Now in the morning, Jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to David, and he had a little boy with him.",,,,,,,
6258,"And he said to the boy, Go and get the arrow I let loose from my bow. And while the boy was running, he sent an arrow past him.",,,,,,,
6259,"And when the boy came to the place where the arrow was, Jonathan, crying out after the boy, said, Has it not gone past you?",,,,,,,
6260,"And Jonathan went on crying out after the boy, Be quick, do not keep waiting about, go quickly. And Jonathan's boy got the arrow and came back to his master.",,,,,,,
6261,But the boy had no idea what was going on; only Jonathan and David had knowledge of it.,,,,,,,
6262,"And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy, and said to him, Take these and go back to the town.",,,,,,,
6263,"And when the boy had gone, David came from his secret place by the hill, and falling to the earth went down on his face three times: and they gave one another a kiss, weeping together, till David's grief was the greater.",,,,,,,
6264,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, for we two have taken an oath, in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord will be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. Then David went away, and Jonathan went into the town.Then David cam","to Nob, to",him,l,ch,he p,ies,: and
6265,"And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has given me orders and has said to me, Say nothing to anyone about the business on which I am sending you and the orders I have given you: and a certain place has been fixed to which the young men are to",o.,,,,,,
6266,"So now, if you have here five cakes of bread, give them into my hand, or whatever you have.",,,,,,,
6267,"And the priest, answering David, said, I have no common bread here but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.",,,,,,,
6268,"And David in answer said to the priest, Certainly women have been kept from us; and as has been done before when I have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy, even though it was a common journey; how much more today will their arms be made ho",y.,,,,,,
6269,"So the priest gave him the holy bread: there was no other, only the holy bread which had been taken from before the Lord, so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it was taken away.",,,,,,,
6270,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, kept back before the Lord; his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the strongest of Saul's runners.",,,,,,,
6271,"And David said to Ahimelech, Have you no sword or spear with you here? for I have come without my sword and other arms, because the king's business had to be done quickly.",,,,,,,
6272,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you put to death in the valley of Elah, is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod: take that, if you will, for there is no other sword here. And David said, there is no other sword l",ke that; giv,it,t,me,,,
6273,"Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish, the king of Gath.",,,,,,,
6274,"And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? did they not make songs about him in their dances, saying, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?",,,,,,,
6275,"And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath.",,,,,,,
6276,"So changing his behaviour before them, he made it seem as if he was off his head, hammering on the doors of the town, and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin.",,,,,,,
6277,"Then Achish said to his servants, Look! the man is clearly off his head; why have you let him come before me?",,,,,,,
6278,"Are there not enough unbalanced men about me, that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me? is such a man to come into my house?So David went away from there and took cover in a strong place at Adullam; and his brothers and all his fat","er's people,",hea,i,g o,"it,",wen,down
6279,"And everyone who was in trouble, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, came together to him, and he became captain over them: about four hundred men were joined to him.",,,,,,,
6280,"And from there David went to Mizpeh in the land of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and mother come and make their living-place with you till it is clear to me what God will do for me.",,,,,,,
6281,And he took them to the king of Moab and they went on living with him while David was in his safe place.,,,,,,,
6282,"And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not go on living in this place but go into the land of Judah. Then David went away and came to the woodland of Hereth.",,,,,,,
6283,"And news was given to Saul that David had been seen, and the men who were with him: now Saul was in Gibeah, seated under the tree in the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were in their places before him.",,,,,,,
6284,"Then Saul said to his servants who were there about him, Give ear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give to every one of you fields and vine-gardens, will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands;",,,,,,,
6285,"That all of you have made designs against me, and not one of you gave me word when my son made an agreement with the son of Jesse, and not one of you has pity for me or has made my eyes open to the fact that my servant has been moved by my son against me",as at this,ay?,,,,,
6286,"Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was by the side of the servants of Saul, in answer said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.",,,,,,,
6287,"And he got directions from the Lord for him, and gave him food, and put in his hand the sword of Goliath the Philistine.",,,,,,,
6288,"Then the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for all the men of his father's family who were priests in Nob: and they all came to the king.",,,,,,,
6289,"And Saul said, Give ear now, O son of Ahitub. And answering he said, Here I am, my lord.",,,,,,,
6290,"And Saul said to him, Why have you made designs against me with the son of Jesse, giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the Lord for him, and helping him to take up arms against me, and to be on the watch to make a secret attack on me a",he is doing,now,,,,,
6291,"Then Ahimelech answering said to the king, Who among all your servants is so true to you as David, who is the king's son-in- law, and is a captain of your armed men, and has a place of honour in your house?",,,,,,,
6292,"Is this the first time I have got directions from God for him? Far be the thought! let the king make no such statement against his servant or my father's family, for your servant has no knowledge, great or small, of this thing.",,,,,,,
6293,"And the king said, You will certainly be put to death, Ahimelech, you and all your father's family.",,,,,,,
6294,"Then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him, Put the priests of the Lord to death; because they are on David's side, and having knowledge of his flight, did not give me word of it. But the king's servants would not put out their hands to",ake an attac,on,t,e L,rd's,pri,sts.
6295,"Then the king said to Doeg, You are to put the priests to death. And Doeg the Edomite, turning on the priests and attacking them, put to death that day eighty-five men who took up the ephod.",,,,,,,
6296,"And Nob, the town of the priests, he put to the sword, all the men and women, children and babies at the breast, and oxen and asses and sheep.",,,,,,,
6297,"And Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, got away and went in flight after David;",,,,,,,
6298,And gave him the news of how Saul had put to death the Lord's priests.,,,,,,,
6299,"And David said to Abiathar, I was certain that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would take the news to Saul: I am responsible for the lives of all your father's family.",,,,,,,
6300,"Keep here with me and have no fear; for he who has designs on my life has designs on yours: but with me you will be safe.And they sent word to David, saying, The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and taking the grain from the grain-floors.",,,,,,,
6301,"So David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go and make an attack on these Philistines? And the Lord said to David, Go and make an attack on the Philistines so that Keilah may be kept from falling into their hands.",,,,,,,
6302,"And David's men said to him, Even here in Judah we are full of fear: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?",,,,,,,
6303,"Then David put the question to the Lord again, and the Lord answering said, Up! go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into your hands.",,,,,,,
6304,"So David and his men went to Keilah, and had a fight with the Philistines, and took away their cattle, and put them to the sword with great destruction. So David was the saviour of the people of Keilah.",,,,,,,
6305,"Now when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, went in flight to David, he came down to Keilah with the ephod in his hand.",,,,,,,
6306,"And news was given to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, Now God has given him into my hands; for by going into a walled town with locked doors, he has let himself be shut in.",,,,,,,
6307,"And Saul sent for all the people to come to the fight, and go down to Keilah to make an attack on David and his men.",,,,,,,
6308,"And it was clear to David that Saul had evil designs against him, and he said to Abiathar the priest, Come here with the ephod.",,,,,,,
6309,"Then David said, O Lord, the God of Israel, news has been given to your servant that it is Saul's purpose to come to Keilah and send destruction on the town because of me.",,,,,,,
6310,"And now, is it true, as they have said to me, that Saul is coming? O Lord, the God of Israel, give ear to your servant, and say if these things are so. And the Lord said, He is coming down.",,,,,,,
6311,"Then David said, Will the men of Keilah give me and my men up to Saul? and the Lord said, They will give you up.",,,,,,,
6312,"Then David and his men, about six hundred of them, went out of Keilah, and got away wherever they were able to go. And Saul, hearing that David had got away from Keilah, did not go there.",,,,,,,
6313,"And David kept in the waste land, in safe places, waiting in the hill-country in the waste land of Ziph. And Saul was searching for him every day, but God did not give him up into his hands.",,,,,,,
6314,"And David was full of fear, in the knowledge that Saul had come out to take his life; and David was in the waste land of Ziph, in Horesh.",,,,,,,
6315,"And Saul's son Jonathan went to David in Horesh, and made his hands strong in God;",,,,,,,
6316,"And said to him, Have no fear, for Saul my father will not get you into his power; and you will be king of Israel, and I will be by your side, and my father Saul is certain of this.",,,,,,,
6317,"And the two of them made an agreement before the Lord: and David went on living in Horesh, and Jonathan went back to his house.",,,,,,,
6318,"Then the Ziphites came up to Gibeah to see Saul, and said, Is not David living secretly among us in the strong places in Horesh, in the hill of Hachilah to the south of the waste land?",,,,,,,
6319,"So now, O king, have your soul's desire and come down, and we, for our part, will give him up into the king's hands.",,,,,,,
6320,"And Saul said, The Lord's blessing will be yours, for you have had pity on me.",,,,,,,
6321,"Go now, and take more steps, and see where he is living: for they say that he is expert in deceit.",,,,,,,
6322,"So take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover, and be certain to come back to me, and I will go with you: and without doubt, if he is anywhere in the land, I will get him, among all the families of Judah.",,,,,,,
6323,"And they went back and came to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the waste land of Maon, in the dry land south of the waste land.",,,,,,,
6324,"And Saul and his men went in search of him. And David had word of it, so he came down to the rock in the waste land of Maon. And Saul, hearing of this, went after David into the waste land of Maon.",,,,,,,
6325,"And Saul and his men went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men went on the other: and David's purpose was to get away as quickly as possible, for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men were making a circle round David and his men in order to ta",e them.,,,,,,
6326,"But a man came to Saul saying, Be quick and come; for the Philistines have made an attack on the land.",,,,,,,
6327,"So turning back from going after David, Saul went against the Philistines: so that place was named Sela-hammah-lekoth.",,,,,,,
6328,"And from there, David went up and took cover in the safe place of En-gedi.Now when Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, news was given him that David was in the waste land of En-gedi.",,,,,,,
6329,"Then Saul took three thousand of the best men out of all Israel, and went in search of David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats.",,,,,,,
6330,"And on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept, where there was a hollow in the rock; and Saul went in for a private purpose. Now David and his men were in the deepest part of the hollow.",,,,,,,
6331,"And David's men said to him, Now is the time when the Lord says to you, I will give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you. Then David, getting up, took the skirt of Saul's robe in his hand, cutting off the end of it with",ut his knowl,dge,,,,,
6332,"And later, David was full of regret for cutting off Saul's skirt.",,,,,,,
6333,"And David said to his men, Before the Lord, never let it be said that my hand was lifted up against my lord, the man of the Lord's selection, for the Lord's holy oil has been put on him.",,,,,,,
6334,"So with these words David kept his servants back, and did not let them make an attack on Saul. And Saul got up and went on his way.",,,,,,,
6335,"And after that David came out of the hollow rock, and crying after Saul said, My lord the king. And when Saul gave a look back, David went down on his face and gave him honour.",,,,,,,
6336,"And David said to Saul, Why do you give any attention to those who say that it is my desire to do you wrong?",,,,,,,
6337,"Look! you have seen today how the Lord gave you up into my hands even now in the hollow of the rocks: and some would have had me put you to death, but I had pity on you: for I said, Never will my hand be lifted up against my lord, who has been marked wit",the holy oi,.,,,,,
6338,"And see, my father, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for the fact that I took off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that I have no evil purpose, and I have done you no wrong, though you are waiting for my life to take i",.,,,,,,
6339,"May the Lord be judge between me and you, and may the Lord give me my rights against you, but my hand will never be lifted up against you.",,,,,,,
6340,"There is an old saying, From the evil-doer comes evil: but my hand will never be lifted up against you.",,,,,,,
6341,"After whom has the king of Israel come out? for whom are you searching? for a dead dog, an insect.",,,,,,,
6342,"So let the Lord be judge, and give a decision between me and you, and see and give support to my cause, and keep me from falling into your hands.",,,,,,,
6343,"Now when David had said these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this your voice, David, my son? And Saul was overcome with weeping.",,,,,,,
6344,"And he said to David, You are right and I am wrong: for you have given me back good, but I have given you evil.",,,,,,,
6345,"And you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today: because, when the Lord gave me up into your hands, you did not put me to death.",,,,,,,
6346,"If a man comes across his hater, will he let him get away safe? so may you be rewarded by the Lord for what you have done for me today.",,,,,,,
6347,"And now I am certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be made strong under your authority.",,,,,,,
6348,"So give me your oath by the Lord, that you will not put an end to my seed after me or let my name be cut off from my father's family.",,,,,,,
6349,"And David gave Saul his oath. And Saul went back to his house; but David and his men went up to their safe place.And death came to Samuel; and all Israel came together, weeping for him, and put his body in its resting-place in his house at Ramah. Then Da",id went down,to,h,wa,te l,nd,f Mao
6350,Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats: and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in Carmel.,,,,,,,
6351,"Now this man was named Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail: she was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks: but the man was cruel and evil in his ways; he was of the family of Caleb.",,,,,,,
6352,And David had word in the waste land that Nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep.,,,,,,,
6353,"And David sent ten young men, and said to them, Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and say kind words to him in my name;",,,,,,,
6354,"And say this to my brother, May all be well for you: peace be to you and your house and all you have.",,,,,,,
6355,"I have had word that you have wool-cutters: now the keepers of your sheep have been with us, and we have done them no evil, and taken nothing of theirs while they were in Carmel.",,,,,,,
6356,"If your young men are questioned they will say the same thing. So now, let my young men have grace in your eyes, for we are come at a good time; please give anything you may have by you to your servants and to your son David.",,,,,,,
6357,"And when David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal, in David's name, and said nothing more.",,,,,,,
6358,"And Nabal gave them his answer and said, Who is David? who is the son of Jesse? there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters.",,,,,,,
6359,Am I to take my bread and my wine and the meat I have got ready for my wool-cutters and give it to men coming from I have no idea where?,,,,,,,
6360,"So David's young men, turning away, went back and gave him an account of everything he had said.",,,,,,,
6361,"And David said to his men, Put on your swords, every one of you. And every man put on his sword; and David did the same; and about four hundred men went up with David, and two hundred kept watch over their goods.",,,,,,,
6362,"But one of the young men said to Nabal's wife Abigail, David sent men from the waste land to say kind words to our master, and he gave them a rough answer.",,,,,,,
6363,But these men have been very good to us; they did us no wrong and nothing of ours was touched while we were with them in the fields:,,,,,,,
6364,"But day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them, looking after the sheep.",,,,,,,
6365,"So now, give thought to what you are going to do; for evil is in store for our master and all his house: for he is such a good-for-nothing person that it is not possible to say anything to him.",,,,,,,
6366,"Then Abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry grapes and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them on asses.",,,,,,,
6367,"And she said to her young men, Go on in front of me and I will come after you. But she said nothing to her husband Nabal.",,,,,,,
6368,"Now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass, David and his men came down against her, and suddenly she came face to face with them.",,,,,,,
6369,"Now David had said, What was the use of my taking care of this man's goods in the waste land, so that there was no loss of anything which was his? he has only given me back evil for good.",,,,,,,
6370,"May God's punishment be on David, if when morning comes there is so much as one male of his people still living.",,,,,,,
6371,"And when Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her ass, falling down on her face before him.",,,,,,,
6372,"And falling at his feet she said, May the wrong be on me, my lord, on me: let your servant say a word to you, and give ear to the words of your servant.",,,,,,,
6373,"Let my lord give no attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing: for as his name is, so is he, a man without sense: but I, your servant, did not see the young men whom my lord sent.",,,,,,,
6374,"So now, my lord, by the living God and by your living soul, seeing that the Lord has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your wrongs, may all your haters, and those who would do evil to my lord, be like Nab",l.,,,,,,
6375,"And let this offering, which your servant gives to my lord, be given to the young men who are with my lord.",,,,,,,
6376,"And may the sin of your servant have forgiveness: for the Lord will certainly make your family strong, because my lord is fighting in the Lord's war; and no evil will be seen in you all your days.",,,,,,,
6377,"And though a man has taken up arms against you, putting your life in danger, still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the Lord your God; and the souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him,",like stones,rom,a,bag,,,
6378,"And when the Lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said he will do for you, and has made you a ruler over Israel;",,,,,,,
6379,"Then you will have no cause for grief, and my lord's heart will not be troubled because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs: and when the Lord has been good to you, then give a thought to your servant.",,,,,,,
6380,"And David said to Abigail, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be praised, who sent you to me today:",,,,,,,
6381,"A blessing on your good sense and on you, who have kept me today from the crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs.",,,,,,,
6382,"For truly, by the living Lord, the God of Israel, who has kept me from doing you evil, if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me, by dawn there would not have been in Nabal's house so much as one male living.",,,,,,,
6383,"Then David took from her hands her offering: and he said to her, Go back to your house in peace; see, I have given ear to your voice, and taken your offering with respect.",,,,,,,
6384,"And Abigail went back to Nabal; and he was feasting in his house like a king; and Nabal's heart was full of joy, for he had taken much wine; so she said nothing to him till dawn came.",,,,,,,
6385,"And in the morning, when the effect of the wine was gone, Nabal's wife gave him an account of all these things, and all the heart went out of him, and he became like stone.",,,,,,,
6386,"And about ten days after, the Lord sent disease on Nabal and death came to him.",,,,,,,
6387,"And David, hearing that Nabal was dead, said, May the Lord be praised, who has taken up my cause against Nabal for the shame which he put on me, and has kept back his servant from evil, and has sent on Nabal's head the reward of his evil-doing. And David",sent word to,Abi,a,"l,",esir,ng,o tak
6388,"And when David's servants came to Carmel, to Abigail, they said to her, David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.",,,,,,,
6389,"And she got up, and going down on her face to the earth, said, See, I am ready to be a servant-girl, washing the feet of the servants of my lord.",,,,,,,
6390,"Then Abigail got up quickly and went on her ass, with five of her young women, after the men whom David had sent; and she became David's wife.",,,,,,,
6391,"And David had taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, to be his wife; these two were his wives.",,,,,,,
6392,"Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish of Gallim.And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, and said, Is not David waiting secretly near us in the hill of Hachilah, before the waste land?",,,,,,,
6393,"Then Saul went down to the waste land of Ziph, taking with him three thousand of the best men of Israel, to make search for David in the waste land of Ziph.",,,,,,,
6394,"And Saul put up his tents on the hill of Hachilah, which is in front of the waste land on the road. But David was in the waste land, and he saw that Saul was coming after him.",,,,,,,
6395,"And so David sent out watchers, and got word from them that Saul was certainly coming.",,,,,,,
6396,"And David got up and came to the place where Saul's tents were: and David had a view of the place where Saul was sleeping with Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts, and the tents of the people wer",all round h,m.,,,,,
6397,"Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, Who will go down with me to the tents of Saul? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.",,,,,,,
6398,So David and Abishai came down to the army by night: and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts with his spear planted in the earth by his head: and Abner and the people were sleeping round him.,,,,,,,
6399,"Then Abishai said to David, God has given up your hater into your hands today; now let me give him one blow through to the earth with his spear, and there will be no need to give him a second.",,,,,,,
6400,"And David said to Abishai Do not put him to death; for who, without sin, may put out his hand against the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil?",,,,,,,
6401,"And David said, By the living Lord, the Lord will send destruction on him; the natural day of his death will come, or he will go into the fight and come to his end.",,,,,,,
6402,"Never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil; but take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water, and let us go.",,,,,,,
6403,"So David took the spear and the vessel of water from Saul's head; and they got away without any man seeing them, or being conscious of their coming, or awaking; for they were all sleeping because a deep sleep from the Lord had come on them.",,,,,,,
6404,"Then David went over to the other side, and took his place on the top of a mountain some distance away, with a great space between them;",,,,,,,
6405,"And crying out to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, David said, Have you no answer to give, Abner? Then Abner said, Who is that crying out to the king?",,,,,,,
6406,"And David said to Abner, Are you not a man of war? is there any other like you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? for one of the people came in to put the king your lord to death.",,,,,,,
6407,"What you have done is not good. By the living Lord, death is the right fate for you, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil. Now see, where is the king's spear, and the vessel of water which was by h",s head?,,,,,,
6408,"And Saul, conscious that the voice was David's, said, Is that your voice, David, my son? And David said, It is my voice, O my lord king.",,,,,,,
6409,"And he said, Why does my lord go armed against his servant? what have I done? or what evil is there in me?",,,,,,,
6410,"Let my lord the king give ear now to the words of his servant. If it is the Lord who is moving you against me, let him take an offering: but if it is the children of men, may they be cursed before the Lord, for driving me out today and keeping me from my",place in the,her,t,ge,f th,Lo,"d, sa"
6411,"Then do not let my blood be drained out on the earth away from the face of the Lord: for the king of Israel has come out to take my life, like one going after birds in the mountains.",,,,,,,
6412,"Then Saul said, I have done wrong: come back to me, David my son: I will do you no more wrong, because my life was dear to you today truly, I have been foolish and my error is very great.",,,,,,,
6413,"Then David said, Here is the king's spear! let one of the young men come over and get it.",,,,,,,
6414,"And the Lord will give to every man the reward of his righteousness and his faith: because the Lord gave you into my hands today, and I would not put out my hand against the man who has been marked with the holy oil.",,,,,,,
6415,"And so, as your life was dear to me today, may my life be dear to the Lord, and may he make me free from all my troubles.",,,,,,,
6416,"Then Saul said to David, May a blessing be on you, David, my son; you will do great things and without doubt you will overcome. Then David went on his way, and Saul went back to his place.And David said to himself, Some day death will come to me by the h",nd of Saul:,he,n,y t,ing,or,e to
6417,"So David and the six hundred men who were with him went over to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.",,,,,,,
6418,"And David and his men were living with Achish at Gath; every man had his family with him, and David had his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, who had been the wife of Nabal.",,,,,,,
6419,"And Saul, hearing that David had gone to Gath, went after him no longer.",,,,,,,
6420,"Then David said to Achish, If now I have grace in your eyes, let me have a place in one of the smaller towns of your land, to be my living-place; for it is not right for your servant to be living with you in the king's town.",,,,,,,
6421,So Achish straight away gave him Ziklag: and for that reason Ziklag has been the property of the kings of Judah to this day.,,,,,,,
6422,And David was living in the land of the Philistines for the space of a year and four months.,,,,,,,
6423,"And David and his men went up and made attacks on the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites; for these were the people who were living in the land from Telam on the way to Shur, as far as Egypt.",,,,,,,
6424,And David again and again made attacks on the land till not a man or a woman was still living; and he took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the clothing; and he came back to Achish.,,,,,,,
6425,"And every time Achish said, Where have you been fighting today? David said, Against the South of Judah and the South of the Jerahmeelites and the South of the Kenites.",,,,,,,
6426,"Not one living man or woman did David ever take back with him to Gath, fearing that they might give an account of what had taken place, and say, This is what David did, and so has he been doing all the time while he has been living in the land of the Phi",istines.,,,,,,
6427,"And Achish had belief in what David said, saying, He has made himself hated by all his people Israel, and so he will be my servant for ever.Now in those days the Philistines got their forces together to make war on Israel. And Achish said to David, Certa",nly you and,our,m,n a,e to,go,ut wi
6428,"And David said to Achish, You will see now what your servant will do. And Achish said to David, Then I will make you keeper of my head for ever.",,,,,,,
6429,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel, after weeping for him, had put his body in its last resting-place in Ramah, his town. And Saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts.",,,,,,,
6430,And the Philistines came together and put their forces in position in Shunem; and Saul got all Israel together and they took up their positions in Gilboa.,,,,,,,
6431,"And when Saul saw the Philistine army he was troubled, and his heart was moved with fear.",,,,,,,
6432,"And when Saul went for directions to the Lord, the Lord gave him no answer, by a dream or by the Urim or by the prophets.",,,,,,,
6433,"Then Saul said to his servants, Get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that I may go to her and get directions. And his servants said to him, There is such a woman at En-dor.",,,,,,,
6434,"So Saul, putting on other clothing, so that he might not be seen to be the king, took two men with him and went to the woman by night; and he said, Now, with the help of the spirit which you have, make the person whose name I will give you come up.",,,,,,,
6435,"And the woman said to him, But you have knowledge of what Saul has done, how he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts: why would you, by a trick, put me in danger of death?",,,,,,,
6436,"And Saul made an oath to her by the Lord, saying, By the living Lord, no punishment will come to you for this.",,,,,,,
6437,"Then the woman said, Who am I to let you see? And he said, Make Samuel come up for me.",,,,,,,
6438,"And the woman saw that it was Saul, and she gave a loud cry, and said to Saul, Why have you made use of deceit? for you are Saul.",,,,,,,
6439,"And the king said to her, Have no fear: what do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.",,,,,,,
6440,"And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, It is an old man coming up covered with a robe. And Saul saw that it was Samuel, and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour.",,,,,,,
6441,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you made me come up, troubling my rest? And Saul in answer said, I am in great danger; for the Philistines are making war on me, and God has gone away from me and will no longer give me any answer, by the prophets or by",reams: so I,ave,s,nt,or y,u t,make
6442,"And Samuel said, Why do you put your questions to me, seeing that God has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you?",,,,,,,
6443,And the Lord himself has done what I said: the Lord has taken the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour David;,,,,,,,
6444,"Because you did not do what the Lord said, and did not give effect to his burning wrath against Amalek. So the Lord has done this thing to you today.",,,,,,,
6445,"And more than this, the Lord will give Israel up with you into the hands of the Philistines: and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me: and the Lord will give up the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
6446,"Then Saul went down flat on the earth, and was full of fear because of Samuel's words: and there was no strength in him, for he had taken no food all that day or all that night.",,,,,,,
6447,"And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was in great trouble, and said to him, See now, your servant has given ear to your words, and I have put my life in danger by doing what you said.",,,,,,,
6448,"So now, give ear to the voice of your servant, and let me give you a little bread; and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way.",,,,,,,
6449,"But he would not, saying, I have no desire for food. But his servants, together with the woman, made him take food, and he gave way to them. So he got up from the earth, and took his seat on the bed.",,,,,,,
6450,"And the woman had in the house a young cow, made fat for food; and she put it to death straight away; and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread;",,,,,,,
6451,"And she put it before Saul and his servants, and they had a meal. Then they got up and went away the same night.Now the Philistines got all their army together at Aphek: and the Israelites put their forces in position by the fountain in Jezreel.",,,,,,,
6452,"And the lords of the Philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his men came after with Achish.",,,,,,,
6453,"Then the rulers of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews doing here? And Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines, Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me for a year or two, and I have never seen any wro",g in him fro,th,,ime,when,he,ame t
6454,"But the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him, and said to him, Make the man go back to the place you have given him; do not let him go down with us to the fight, or he may be turned against us and be false to us: for how will this man make peace",with his lor,? w,l,it,not,e w,th th
6455,"Is this not David, who was named in their songs, when in the dance they said to one another, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands?",,,,,,,
6456,"Then Achish sent for David and said to him, By the living Lord, you are upright, and everything you have done with me in the army has been pleasing to me: I have seen no evil in you from the day when you came to me till now: but still, the lords are not",leased with,ou.,,,,,
6457,"So now go back, and go in peace, so that you do not make the lords of the Philistines angry.",,,,,,,
6458,"And David said to Achish, But what have I done? what have you seen in your servant while I have been with you till this day, that I may not go and take up arms against those who are now making war on my lord the king?",,,,,,,
6459,"And Achish in answer said, It is true that in my eyes you are good, like an angel of God: but still, the rulers of the Philistines have said, He is not to go up with us to the fight.",,,,,,,
6460,"So get up early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who are with you, and go to the place I have given you, and have no evil design in your heart, for you are good in my eyes; but when there is light enough in the morning, go away.",,,,,,,
6461,"So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made an attack on the South and on Ziklag, a",d had overco,e Z,k,ag,nd p,t i,on f
6462,"And had made the women and all who were there, small and great, prisoners: they had not put any of them to death, but had taken them all away.",,,,,,,
6463,"And when David and his men came to the town, they saw that it had been burned down, and their wives and their sons and daughters had been made prisoners.",,,,,,,
6464,Then David and the people who were with him gave themselves up to weeping till they were able to go on weeping no longer.,,,,,,,
6465,"And David's two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel, had been made prisoners.",,,,,,,
6466,"And David was greatly troubled; for the people were talking of stoning him, because their hearts were bitter, every man sorrowing for his sons and his daughters: but David made himself strong in the Lord his God.",,,,,,,
6467,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Come here to me with the ephod. And Abiathar took the ephod to David.",,,,,,,
6468,"Then David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go after this band? will I be able to overtake them? And in answer he said, Go after them, for you will certainly overtake them, and get back everything.",,,,,,,
6469,"So David went, and his six hundred men went with him, and they came to the stream Besor.",,,,,,,
6470,"And David, with four hundred men, went on: but two hundred of them were overcome with weariness, and not able to go across the stream.",,,,,,,
6471,"And in the fields they saw an Egyptian whom they took to David, and they gave him bread, and he had a meal, and they gave him water for drink;",,,,,,,
6472,"And they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes; and after the food, his spirit came back to him, for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights.",,,,,,,
6473,"And David said to him, Whose man are you and where do you come from? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master went on without me because three days back I became ill.",,,,,,,
6474,"We made an attack on the south part of the country of the Cherethites, and on the land which is Judah's, and on the south of Caleb; and we put Ziklag on fire.",,,,,,,
6475,"And David said to him, Will you take me down to this band? And he said, If you give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master, I will take you to them.",,,,,,,
6476,"And when he had taken him down, they saw them all, seated about on all sides, feasting and drinking among all the mass of goods which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah.",,,,,,,
6477,And David went on fighting them from evening till the evening of the day after; and not one of them got away but only four hundred young men who went in flight on camels.,,,,,,,
6478,And David got back everything the Amalekites had taken; and he got back his two wives.,,,,,,,
6479,"There was no loss of anything, small or great, sons or daughters or goods or anything which they had taken away: David got it all back.",,,,,,,
6480,"And they took all the flocks and herds, and driving them in front of him, said, These are David's.",,,,,,,
6481,"And David came to the two hundred men, who because of weariness had not gone with him, but were waiting at the stream Besor: and they went out, meeting David and the people who were with him; and when they came near them, they said, How are you?",,,,,,,
6482,"Then the bad and good-for- nothing men among those who went with David said, Because they did not go with us, we will give them nothing of the goods which we have got back, but only to every man his wife and children, so that he may take them and go.",,,,,,,
6483,"Then David said, You are not to do this, my brothers, after what the Lord has given us, who has kept us safe and given up the band which came against us into our hands.",,,,,,,
6484,Who is going to give any attention to you in this question? for an equal part will be given to him who went to the fight and to him who was waiting by the goods: they are all to have the same.,,,,,,,
6485,And so he made it a rule and an order for Israel from that day till now.,,,,,,,
6486,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of Judah, and to his friends, saying, Here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the Lord;",,,,,,,
6487,"He sent to those who were in Beth-el, and in Ramah of the South, and in Jattir;",,,,,,,
6488,And to those in Arara and Eshtemoa,,,,,,,
6489,"and Carmel and in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, and in the towns of the Kenites;",,,,,,,
6490,And to those who were in Hormah and in Bor-ashan and in Athach;,,,,,,,
6491,"And in Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men had been living.Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel: and the men of Israel went in flight before the Philistines, falling down wounded in Mount Gilboa.",,,,,,,
6492,"And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and they put to death Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi- shua, the sons of Saul.",,,,,,,
6493,"And the fight was going badly for Saul, and the archers came across him, and he was wounded by the archers.",,,,,,,
6494,"Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms, Take out your sword and put it through me, before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me. But his servant, full of fear, would not do so. Then Saul took out his sword, and fall","ng on it, pu",an,e,d t,him,elf,
6495,"And when his servant saw that Saul was dead, he did the same, and was united with him in death.",,,,,,,
6496,So death overtook Saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day.,,,,,,,
6497,"And when the men of Israel across the valley and on the other side of Jordan saw that the army of Israel was in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead, they came out of their towns and went in flight; and the Philistines came and took them for thems",lves.,,,,,,
6498,"Now on the day after, when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead, they saw Saul and his three sons dead on the earth in Mount Gilboa.",,,,,,,
6499,"And cutting off his head and taking away his war-dress, they sent word into the land of the Philistines round about, to take the news to their gods and to the people.",,,,,,,
6500,His war-dress they put in the house of Astarte; and his body was fixed on the wall of Beth-shan.,,,,,,,
6501,"And when the people of Jabesh-gilead had news of what the Philistines had done to Saul,",,,,,,,
6502,"All the fighting men got up and, travelling all night, took Saul's body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and had them burned there.",,,,,,,
6503,"And their bones they put in the earth under a tree in Jabesh; and for seven days they took no food.Now after the death of Saul, when David, having come back from the destruction of the Amalekites, had been in Ziklag for two days;",,,,,,,
6504,"On the third day a man came from Saul's tents, with his clothing out of order and earth on his head: and when he came to David, he went down on the earth and gave him honour.",,,,,,,
6505,"And David said to him, Where have you come from? And he said, I have come in flight from the tents of Israel.",,,,,,,
6506,"And David said to him, How did things go? Give me the news. And in answer he said, The people have gone in flight from the fight, and a great number of them are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.",,,,,,,
6507,"And David said to the young man who gave him the news, Why are you certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?",,,,,,,
6508,"And the young man said, I came by chance to Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul supporting himself on his spear; and the war-carriages and horsemen overtook him.",,,,,,,
6509,"And looking back, he saw me and gave a cry to me. And answering him I said, Here am I.",,,,,,,
6510,"And he said to me, Who are you? And I said, I am an Amalekite.",,,,,,,
6511,"Then he said to me, Come here to my side, and put me to death, for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me.",,,,,,,
6512,"So I put my foot on him and gave him his death-blow, because I was certain that he would not go on living after his fall: and I took the crown from his head and the band from his arm, and I have them here for my lord.",,,,,,,
6513,"Then David gave way to bitter grief, and so did all the men who were with him:",,,,,,,
6514,"And till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping, and took no food, weeping for Saul and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord and for the men of Israel; because they had come to their end by the sword.",,,,,,,
6515,"And David said to the young man who had given him the news, Where do you come from? And he said, I am the son of a man from a strange land; I am an Amalekite.",,,,,,,
6516,"And David said to him, Had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy oil?",,,,,,,
6517,"And David sent for one of his young men and said, Go near and put an end to him. And he put him to death.",,,,,,,
6518,"And David said to him, May your blood be on your head; for your mouth has given witness against you, saying, I have put to death the man marked with the holy oil.",,,,,,,
6519,"Then David made this song of grief for Saul and Jonathan, his son:",,,,,,,
6520,(It is recorded in the book of Jashar for teaching to the sons of Judah) and he said:,,,,,,,
6521,"The glory, O Israel, is dead on your high places! How have the great ones been made low!",,,,,,,
6522,"Give no news of it in Gath, let it not be said in the streets of Ashkelon; or the daughters of the Philistines will be glad, the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted in joy.",,,,,,,
6523,"O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain on you, you fields of death: for there the arms of the strong have been shamed, the arms of Saul, as if he had not been marked with the holy oil.",,,,,,,
6524,"From the blood of the dead, from the fat of the strong, the bow of Jonathan was not turned back, the sword of Saul did not come back unused.",,,,,,,
6525,"Saul and Jonathan were loved and pleasing; in their lives and in their death they were not parted; they went more quickly than eagles, they were stronger than lions.",,,,,,,
6526,"O daughters of Israel, have sorrow for Saul, by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red, with ornaments of gold on your dresses.",,,,,,,
6527,How have the great ones been made low in the fight! Jonathan is dead on your high places.,,,,,,,
6528,"I am full of grief for you, my brother Jonathan: very dear have you been to me: your love for me was a wonder, greater than the love of women.",,,,,,,
6529,"How have the great ones been made low, and the arms of war broken!Now after this, David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go up into any of the towns of Judah? And the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Where am I to go? And he said, To Hebron.",,,,,,,
6530,"So David went there, taking with him his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.",,,,,,,
6531,"And David took all his men with him, every man with his family: and they were living in the towns round Hebron.",,,,,,,
6532,"And the men of Judah came there, and with the holy oil made David king over the people of Judah. And word came to David that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who put Saul's body in its last resting-place.",,,,,,,
6533,"And David sent to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, May the Lord give you his blessing, because you have done this kind act to Saul your lord, and have put his body to rest!",,,,,,,
6534,"May the Lord be good and true to you: and I myself will see that your kind act is rewarded, because you have done this thing.",,,,,,,
6535,"Then let your hands be strong, and have no fear: though Saul your lord is dead, the people of Judah have made me their king.",,,,,,,
6536,"Now Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth over to Mahanaim,",,,,,,,
6537,"And made him king over Gilead and the Asherites and over Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin, that is, over all Israel.",,,,,,,
6538,"(Saul's son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was ruler for two years.) But Judah was on the side of David.",,,,,,,
6539,And the time when David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah was seven years and six months.,,,,,,,
6540,"And Abner, the son of Ner, with the servants of Saul's son Ish-bosheth, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.",,,,,,,
6541,"And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and came face to face with them by the pool of Gibeon; and they took up their position, facing one another on opposite sides of the pool.",,,,,,,
6542,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men give a test of their strength before us. And Joab said, Let them do so.",,,,,,,
6543,So they got up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and twelve of the servants of David.,,,,,,,
6544,"And every one got the other by the head, driving his sword into the other's side, so they all went down together: and that place was named the Field of Sides, and it is in Gibeon.",,,,,,,
6545,And there was hard fighting that day; and Abner and the men of Israel gave way before the servants of David.,,,,,,,
6546,"There were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel: and Asahel was as quick-footed as a roe of the fields.",,,,,,,
6547,"Asahel went running after Abner, not turning to the right or to the left.",,,,,,,
6548,"Then Abner, looking back, said, Is it you, Asahel? And he said, It is I.",,,,,,,
6549,"And Abner said, Then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the fighting-men and take his arms. But Asahel would not be turned away from going after Abner.",,,,,,,
6550,"Then again Abner said to Asahel, Go to one side, do not keep on coming after me: why will you make me put an end to you? for then I will be shamed before your brother Joab.",,,,,,,
6551,"But still he did not go to one side: so Abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear, so that the spear came out at his back; and he went down on the earth, wounded to death: and all those who came to the place where Asahel went down dead, ca",e to a stop.,,,,,,
6552,"But Joab and Abishai went after Abner: and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of the road through the waste land of Geba.",,,,,,,
6553,"And the men of Benjamin came together after Abner in one band, and took their places on the top of a hill.",,,,,,,
6554,"Then crying out to Joab, Abner said, Are fighting and destruction to go on for ever? do you not see that the end will only be bitter? how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen?",,,,,,,
6555,"And Joab said, By the living God, if you had not given the word, the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning.",,,,,,,
6556,"So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the people came to a stop, and gave up going after Israel and fighting them.",,,,,,,
6557,And all that night Abner and his men went through the Arabah; they went over Jordan and through all Bithron and came to Mahanaim.,,,,,,,
6558,"And Joab came back from fighting Abner: and when he had got all his men together, it was seen that nineteen of David's men, in addition to Asahel, were not with them.",,,,,,,
6559,But David's men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin and of Abner's men,,,,,,,
6560,"And they took Asahel's body and put it in the last resting-place of his father in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men, travelling all night, came to Hebron at dawn.Now there was a long war between Saul's people and David's people; and David became stronger","nd stronger,",but,t,ose,on S,ul',side
6561,"While David was in Hebron he became the father of sons: the oldest was Amnon, son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;",,,,,,,
6562,"And the second, Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;",,,,,,,
6563,"And the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;",,,,,,,
6564,"And the sixth, Ithream, whose mother was David's wife Eglah. These were the sons of David, whose birth took place in Hebron.",,,,,,,
6565,"Now while there was war between Saul's people and David's people, Abner was making himself strong among the supporters of Saul.",,,,,,,
6566,"Now Saul had among his wives a woman named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have you taken my father's wife?",,,,,,,
6567,"And Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth, and he said, Am I a dog's head of Judah? I am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father Saul and for his brothers and his friends, and have not given you up into the hands of David,",nd now you s,y I,h,ve,one,ron,with
6568,"May God's punishment be on Abner, if I do not for David as the Lord in his oath has said,",,,,,,,
6569,And if I do not take away the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David ruler over Israel and Judah from Dan as far as Beer-sheba!,,,,,,,
6570,And so great was Ish-bosheth's fear of Abner that he was not able to say a word in answer.,,,,,,,
6571,"And Abner sent men to David at Hebron, saying, Make an agreement with me, and I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side.",,,,,,,
6572,"And he said, It is well; I will make an agreement with you, but on one condition, which is, that when you come before me, Saul's daughter Michal is to come with you; till she comes you will not see my face.",,,,,,,
6573,"And David sent men to Saul's son Ish-bosheth, saying, Give me back Michal, my wife, whom I made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines.",,,,,,,
6574,"So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel, the son of Laish.",,,,,,,
6575,"And her husband went with her as far as Bahurim, weeping while he went. Then Abner said to him, Go back. And he went back.",,,,,,,
6576,"Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel, saying, In the past it was your desire to make David your king: so now, do it:",,,,,,,
6577,"For the Lord has said of David, By the hand of my servant David I will make my people Israel safe from the Philistines, and from all who are against them.",,,,,,,
6578,And Abner said the same things to Benjamin: and he went to David in Hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin.,,,,,,,
6579,"So Abner, with twenty men, came to Hebron, to David. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.",,,,,,,
6580,"And Abner said to David, Now I will go, and make all Israel come to my lord the king, so that they may make an agreement with you, and your kingdom may be as wide as your heart's desire. Then David sent Abner away and he went in peace.",,,,,,,
6581,"Now the servants of David and Joab had been out attacking a band of armed men, and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight: but Abner was no longer in Hebron with David, for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace.",,,,,,,
6582,"When Joab and his men came, news was given them that Abner, the son of Ner, had come to the king, who had let him go away again in peace.",,,,,,,
6583,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? when Abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go?",,,,,,,
6584,"Is it not clear to you that Abner, the son of Ner, came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing?",,,,,,,
6585,"And when Joab had come out from David, he sent men after Abner, and they overtook him at the water-spring of Sirah, and made him come back with them: but David had no knowledge of it.",,,,,,,
6586,"And when Abner was back in Hebron, Joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly, and there he gave him a wound in the stomach, causing his death in payment for the death of his brother Asahel.",,,,,,,
6587,"And when David had word of it he said, May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the Lord from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner:",,,,,,,
6588,"May it come on the head of Joab and all his father's family: among the men of Joab's family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers, or who do the work of women, or are put to the sword, or are wasted from need of food!",,,,,,,
6589,"So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner to death, because he had put to death their brother Asahel in the fight at Gibeon.",,,,,,,
6590,"And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him, Go in grief and put haircloth about you, in sorrow for Abner. And King David went after the dead body.",,,,,,,
6591,And they put Abner's body to rest in Hebron; and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the resting-place of Abner's body.,,,,,,,
6592,"And the king made a song of grief for Abner and said, Was the death of Abner to be like the death of a foolish man?",,,,,,,
6593,"Your hands were free, your feet were not chained: like the downfall of a man before evil men, so was your fall. And the weeping of the people over him went on again.",,,,,,,
6594,"And the people came to make David take food, while it was still day, but David with an oath said, May God's punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down!",,,,,,,
6595,"And all the people took note of it and were pleased: like everything the king did, it was pleasing to the people.",,,,,,,
6596,"So it was clear to Israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of Abner, the son of Ner.",,,,,,,
6597,"And the king said to his servants, Do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in Israel?",,,,,,,
6598,"While I, though I am crowned king, have little strength, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are out of my control: may the Lord give to the evil-doer the reward of his evil-doing!And when Saul's son Ish-bosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron, hi",hands becam,fe,b,"e,",nd a,l t,e Isr

6600,"But the people of Beeroth had gone in flight to Gittaim, where they have been living to this day.)",,,,,,,
6601,"Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son whose feet were damaged. He was five years old when news of the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight: and while she was getting him away as qui",kly as she w,s a,l,", h",had,a f,ll an

6603,And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in without being seen.,,,,,,,
6604,"And when they came into the house, Ish-bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom; and they made an attack on him and put him to death, and, cutting off his head, they took it with them and went by the road through the Arabah all night.",,,,,,,
6605,"And they took the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul your hater, who would have taken your life; the Lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from Saul and his s",ed today.,,,,,,
6606,"And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, By the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble,",,,,,,,
6607,"When one came to me with the news of Saul's death, in the belief that it would be good news, I took him and put him to death in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news:",,,,,,,
6608,"How much more, when evil men have put an upright person to death, in his house, sleeping on his bed, will I take payment from you for his blood, and have you cut off from the earth?",,,,,,,
6609,"And David gave orders to his young men and they put them to death, cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and put it in its last resting-place with Abner's body",n Hebron.The,al,,he,ribe,of,Israe
6610,"In the past when Saul was king over us, it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in: and the Lord said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people Israel and their ruler.",,,,,,,
6611,So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they put the holy oil on David and made him king over Israel.,,,,,,,
6612,"David was thirty years old when he became king, and he was king for forty years,",,,,,,,
6613,"Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah, for thirty-three years.",,,,,,,
6614,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the people of the land: and they said to David, You will not come in here, but the blind and the feeble-footed will keep you out; for they said, David will not be able to come in here.",,,,,,,
6615,"But David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David.",,,,,,,
6616,"And that day David said, Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites, let him go up by the water-pipe, and put to death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David. And this is why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the house",,,,,,,
6617,"So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo.",,,,,,,
6618,"And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him.",,,,,,,
6619,"And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made David a house.",,,,,,,
6620,"And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel.",,,,,,,
6621,"And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters.",,,,,,,
6622,These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon,,,,,,,
6623,And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia,,,,,,,
6624,And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.,,,,,,,
6625,"And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place.",,,,,,,
6626,"And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.",,,,,,,
6627,"And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands.",,,,,,,
6628,"And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So that place was named Baal-perazim.",,,,,,,
6629,"And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took them away.",,,,,,,
6630,"And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.",,,,,,,
6631,"And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice-trees.",,,,,,,
6632,"Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
6633,"And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer.And David got together all the fighting-men of Israel to the number of thirty thousand;",,,,,,,
6634,"And David, and all the people who were with him, went to Baal of Judah to get the ark of God, over which the holy name is named, the name of the Lord of armies, whose place is between the winged ones.",,,,,,,
6635,"And they put the ark of God on a new cart and took it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were the drivers of the cart.",,,,,,,
6636,"And Uzzah went by the side of the ark, while Ahio went before it.",,,,,,,
6637,"And David and all the men of Israel made melody before the Lord with all their power, with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass.",,,,,,,
6638,"And when they came to Nacon's grain-floor, Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to keep it safe in its place, for the oxen were out of control.",,,,,,,
6639,"And the wrath of the Lord, burning against Uzzah, sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark, and death came to him there by the ark of God.",,,,,,,
6640,"And David was angry because of the Lord's outburst of wrath against Uzzah: and he gave that place the name Perez-uzzah, which is its name to this day.",,,,,,,
6641,"And such was David's fear of the Lord that day, that he said, How may I let the ark of God come to me?",,,,,,,
6642,So David did not let the ark of the Lord come back to him to the town of David: but had it turned away and put into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.,,,,,,,
6643,And the ark of the Lord was in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months: and the Lord sent a blessing on Obed-edom and all his family.,,,,,,,
6644,"And they said to King David, The blessing of the Lord is on the family of Obed-edom and on all he has, because of the ark of God. And David went and took the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the town of David with joy.",,,,,,,
6645,"And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast.",,,,,,,
6646,"And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was dancing before the Lord with all his strength.",,,,,,,
6647,So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns.,,,,,,,
6648,"And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind he seemed foolish.",,,,,,,
6649,"And they took in the ark of the Lord, and put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it: and David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.",,,,,,,
6650,"And after David had made the burned offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies.",,,,,,,
6651,"And he gave to every man and woman among all the people, among all the masses of Israel, a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went away, every man to his house.",,,,,,,
6652,"Then David came back to give a blessing to his family. And Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to him and said, How full of glory was the king of Israel today, who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish person uncovering himself",ithout shame,,,,,,
6653,"And David said to Michal, I was dancing before the Lord, who put me over your father and all his sons, to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord, over his people Israel: and I will go on playing before the Lord;",,,,,,,
6654,"And I will do even worse than this, and make myself even lower in your eyes: but the servant-girls of whom you were talking will give me honour.",,,,,,,
6655,"And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child till the day of her death.Now when the king was living in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from war on every side;",,,,,,,
6656,"The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent.",,,,,,,
6657,"And Nathan said to the king, Go and do whatever is in your heart; for the Lord is with you.",,,,,,,
6658,"Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,",,,,,,,
6659,"Go and say to my servant David, The Lord says, Are you to be the builder of a house, a living-place for me?",,,,,,,
6660,"For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from place to place in a tent.",,,,,,,
6661,"In all the places where I went with all the children of Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, to whom I gave the care of my people Israel, Why have you not made me a house of cedar?",,,,,,,
6662,"Then say these words to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping the sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people, over my people Israel:",,,,,,,
6663,"And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make your name great, like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.",,,,,,,
6664,"And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel, planting them there, so that they may be living in the place which is theirs, and never again be moved; and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first,",,,,,,,
6665,From the time when I put judges over my people Israel; and I will give you peace from all who are against you. And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings.,,,,,,,
6666,"And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong.",,,,,,,
6667,"He will be the builder of a house for my name, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.",,,,,,,
6668,"I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men;",,,,,,,
6669,"But my mercy will not be taken away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.",,,,,,,
6670,And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever: the seat of your authority will never be overturned.,,,,,,,
6671,So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.,,,,,,,
6672,"Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?",,,,,,,
6673,"And this was only a small thing to you, O Lord God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your servant's family, O Lord God!",,,,,,,
6674,"What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant, O Lord God.",,,,,,,
6675,"Because of your word and from your heart, you have done all this great work, and let your servant see it.",,,,,,,
6676,"Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.",,,,,,,
6677,"And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, and to make a name for himself, and to do great and strange things for them, driving out a nation and its gods from before his people?",,,,,,,
6678,"But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel, to be your people for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.",,,,,,,
6679,"And now, O Lord God, may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family, be made certain for ever, and may you do as you have said!",,,,,,,
6680,"And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you!",,,,,,,
6681,"For you, O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I will make you the head of a family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make this prayer to you.",,,,,,,
6682,"And now, O Lord God, you are God and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing;",,,,,,,
6683,"So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you: (for you, O Lord God, have said it,) and may your blessing be on your servant's family line for ever!And it came about after this th",t David made,an,t,ack,on t,e P,ilist

6686,"And David took from him one thousand, seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen: and David had the leg-muscles of the horses cut, only keeping enough of them for a hundred war-carriages.",,,,,,,
6687,"And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand of the Aramaeans.",,,,,,,
6688,And David put armed forces in Aram of Damascus: and the Aramaeans became servants to David and gave him offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.,,,,,,,
6689,And David took their gold body- covers from the servants of Hadadezer and took them to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
6690,"And from Tebah and Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a great store of brass.",,,,,,,
6691,"And when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer,",,,,,,,
6692,"He sent his son Hadoram to David, with words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; and Hadoram took with him vessels of silver and gold and brass:",,,,,,,
6693,"These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he had overcome —",,,,,,,

6710,"Then Ziba said to the king, Every order which you have given to your servant will be done. As for Mephibosheth, he had a place at David's table, like one of the king's sons.",,,,,,,
6711,And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. And all the people living in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.,,,,,,,
6712,"So Mephibosheth went on living in Jerusalem; for he took all his meals at the king's table; and he had not the use of his feet.Now after this, death came to the king of the children of Ammon, and Hanun, his son, became king in his place.",,,,,,,
6713,"And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father was a friend to me. So David sent his servants, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
6714,"But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you? has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it, and overcome it",,,,,,,
6715,"So Hanun took David's servants, and after cutting off half the hair on their chins, and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle, he sent them away.",,,,,,,
6716,"When David had news of it, he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way, for the men were greatly shamed: and the king said, Go to Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.",,,,,,,
6717,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, they sent to the Aramaeans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, and got for payment twenty thousand footmen, and they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men, and from Tob twelve tho",sand.,,,,,,
6718,"And hearing of this, David sent Joab and all the army and the best fighting-men.",,,,,,,
6719,"And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town: and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.",,,,,,,
6720,"Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took the best of the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans;",,,,,,,
6721,"And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon, with Abishai, his brother, at their head.",,,,,,,
6722,"And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then you are to come to my help; but if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.",,,,,,,
6723,"Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him.",,,,,,,
6724,"Then Joab and the peoplewithhimwentforwardtothefightagainsttheAramaeans, andtheywentinflight before him.",,,,,,,
6725,"And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, and came into the town. So Joab went back from fighting the children of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
6726,"And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they got themselves together.",,,,,,,
6727,"And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.",,,,,,,
6728,"And word of this was given to David: and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam. And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David, and made an attack on him.",,,,,,,
6729,"And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven hundred Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and Shobach, the captain of the army, was wounded, and came to his death there.",,,,,,,
6730,"And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. So the Aramaeans, in fear, gave no more help to the children of Ammon.Now in the spring, at the time when",ings go out,o w,r,Da,id s,nt,oab a
6731,"Now one evening, David got up from his bed, and while he was walking on the roof of the king's house, he saw from there a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.",,,,,,,
6732,"And David sent to get knowledge who the woman was. And one said, Is this not Bath- sheba, the daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite?",,,,,,,
6733,"And David sent and took her; and she came to him, and he took her to his bed: (for she had been made clean;) then she went back to her house.",,,,,,,
6734,And the woman became with child; and she sent word to David that she was with child.,,,,,,,
6735,"And David sent to Joab saying, Send Uriah the Hittite to me. And Joab sent Uriah to David.",,,,,,,
6736,"And when Uriah came to him, David put questions to him about how Joab and the people were, and how the war was going.",,,,,,,
6737,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and let your feet be washed. And Uriah went away from the king's house, and an offering from the king was sent after him.",,,,,,,
6738,"But Uriah took his rest at the door of the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.",,,,,,,
6739,"And when word was given to David that Uriah had not gone down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have you not come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?",,,,,,,
6740,"And Uriah said to David, Israel and Judah with the ark are living in tents, and my lord Joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field; and am I to go to my house and take food and drink, and go to bed with my wife? By the living L","rd, and by t",e l,f,of,your,sou,", I w"
6741,"And David said to Uriah, Be here today, and after that I will let you go. So Uriah was in Jerusalem that day and the day after.",,,,,,,
6742,"And when David sent for him, he took meat and drink with him, and David made him the worse for drink: and when evening came, he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.",,,,,,,
6743,"Now in the morning, David gave Uriah a letter to take to Joab.",,,,,,,
6744,"And in the letter he said, Take care to put Uriah in the very front of the line, where the fighting is most violent, and go back from him, so that he may be overcome and put to death.",,,,,,,
6745,"So while Joab was watching the town, he put Uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were.",,,,,,,
6746,"And the men of the town went out and had a fight with Joab: and a number of David's men came to their death in the fight, and with them Uriah the Hittite.",,,,,,,
6747,Then Joab sent David news of everything which had taken place in the war:,,,,,,,
6748,"And he gave orders to the man who took the news, saying, After you have given the king all the news about the war,",,,,,,,
6749,"If the king is angry and says, Why did you go so near the town for the fight? was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall?",,,,,,,
6750,"Who put Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall, putting him to death at Thebez? why did you go so near the wall? Then say to him, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is among the dead.",,,,,,,
6751,"So the man went, and came to David, and gave him all the news which Joab had sent him to give; then David was angry with Joab and said, Why did you go so near the town for the fight? was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall? who put Abi","elech, the s",n o,,eru,baal,to,death
6752,"And the man said to David, Truly the men got the better of us, and came out against us into the open country, but we sent them back to the very doors of the town.",,,,,,,
6753,"And the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's servants are dead, and among them is your servant Uriah the Hittite.",,,,,,,
6754,"Then David said to the man, Go and say to Joab, Do not let this be a grief to you; for one man may come to his death by the sword like another: put up an even stronger fight against the town, and take it: and do you put heart into him.",,,,,,,
6755,"And when the wife of Uriah had news that her husband was dead, she gave herself up to weeping for him.",,,,,,,
6756,"And when the days of weeping were past, David sent for her, and took her into his house, and she became his wife and gave him a son. But the Lord was not pleased with the thing David had done.And the Lord sent Nathan to David. And Nathan came to him and","aid, There w",re,w,me,in,he,ame t
6757,The man of wealth had great numbers of flocks and herds;,,,,,,,
6758,"But the poor man had only one little she-lamb, which he had got and taken care of: from its birth it had been with him like one of his children; his meat was its food, and from his cup it took its drink, resting in his arms, and it was like a daughter to",him.,,,,,,
6759,"Now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth, but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and made it ready for the man who had come.",,,,,,,
6760,"And David was full of wrath against that man; and he said to Nathan, By the living Lord, death is the right punishment for the man who has done this:",,,,,,,
6761,"And he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb, because he has done this and because he had no pity.",,,,,,,
6762,"And Nathan said to David, You are that man. The Lord God of Israel says, I made you king over Israel, putting holy oil on you, and I kept you safe from the hands of Saul;",,,,,,,
6763,"I gave you your master's daughter and your master's wives for yourself, and I gave you the daughters of Israel and Judah; and if that had not been enough, I would have given you such and such things.",,,,,,,
6764,"Why then have you had no respect for the word of the Lord, doing what is evil in his eyes? You have put Uriah the Hittite to death with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife; you have put him to death with the sword of the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
6765,"So now the sword will never be turned away from your family; because you have had no respect for me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.",,,,,,,
6766,"The Lord says, From those of your family I will send evil against you, and before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to your neighbour, and he will take your wives to his bed by the light of this sun.",,,,,,,
6767,You did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and in the light of the sun.,,,,,,,
6768,"And David said to Nathan, Great is my sin against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, The Lord has put away your sin; death will not come on you.",,,,,,,
6769,"But still, because you have had no respect for the Lord, death will certainly overtake the child who has newly come to birth.",,,,,,,
6770,"Then Nathan went back to his house. And the hand of the Lord was on David's son, the child of Uriah's wife, and it became very ill.",,,,,,,
6771,"So David made prayer to God for the child; and he took no food day after day, and went in and, stretching himself out on the earth, was there all night.",,,,,,,
6772,"And the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up from the earth, but he would not; and he would not take food with them.",,,,,,,
6773,"And then on the seventh day the child's death took place. And David's servants were in fear of giving him the news of the child's death: for they said, Truly, while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him: what will h",do to himse,f i,,e g,ve h,m w,rd th
6774,"But when David saw that his servants were talking together quietly, he was certain that the child was dead: and he said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is.",,,,,,,
6775,"Then David got up from the earth, and after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing, he went into the house of the Lord and gave worship: then he went back to his house, and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal.",,,,,,,
6776,"Then his servants said to him, Why have you been acting in this way? you were weeping and going without food while the child was still living; but when the child was dead, you got up and had a meal.",,,,,,,
6777,"And he said, While the child was still living I went without food and gave myself up to weeping: for I said, Who is able to say that the Lord will not have mercy on me and give the child life?",,,,,,,
6778,"But now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food; am I able to make him come back to life? I will go to him, but he will never come back to me.",,,,,,,
6779,"And David gave comfort to his wife Bath-sheba, and he went in to her and had connection with her: and she had a son to whom she gave the name Solomon. And he was dear to the Lord.",,,,,,,
6780,"And he sent word by Nathan the prophet, who gave him the name Jedidiah, by the word of the Lord.",,,,,,,
6781,"Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah, in the land of the children of Ammon, and he took the water-town.",,,,,,,
6782,"And Joab sent men to David, saying, I have made war against Rabbah and have taken the water-town.",,,,,,,
6783,"So now, get the rest of the people together, and put them in position against the town and take it, for if I take it, it will be named after my name.",,,,,,,
6784,Then David got all the people together and went to Rabbah and made war on it and took it.,,,,,,,
6785,"And he took the crown of Milcom from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it were stones of great price; and it was put on David's head. And he took a great store of goods from the town.",,,,,,,
6786,"And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood-cutting instruments, and iron grain-crushers, and iron axes, and at brick-making: this he did to all the towns of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people went back to Jeru",alem.Now aft,r t,i,", i",cam,ab,ut th
6787,"And he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and so it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.",,,,,,,
6788,"But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother: and Jonadab was a very wise man.",,,,,,,
6789,"And he said to him, O son of the king, why are you getting thinner day by day? will you not say what your trouble is? And Amnon said to him, I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.",,,,,,,
6790,"Then Jonadab said to him, Go to your bed, and let it seem that you are ill: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread, and get the food ready before my eyes, so that I may see it and take it from her ha",d.,,,,,,
6791,"So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes, so that I may take food from her hand.",,,,,,,
6792,"Then David sent to the house for Tamar and said, Go now to your brother Amnon's house and get a meal for him.",,,,,,,
6793,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was in bed. And she took paste and made cakes before his eyes, cooking them over the fire.",,,,,,,
6794,"And she took the cooking-pot, and put the cakes before him, but he would not take them. And Amnon said, Let everyone go away from me. So they all went out.",,,,,,,
6795,"Then Amnon said to Tamar, Take the food and come into my bedroom, so that I may take it from your hand. So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother Amnon's bedroom.",,,,,,,
6796,"And when she took them to give them to him, he put his arms round her and said, Come to bed, my sister.",,,,,,,
6797,"And answering him, she said, O my brother, do not put shame on me; it is not right for such a thing to be done in Israel: do not this evil thing.",,,,,,,
6798,"What will become of me in my shame? and as for you, you will be looked down on with disgust by all Israel. Now then, go and make your request to the king, for he will not keep me from you.",,,,,,,
6799,"But he would not give attention to what she said: but being stronger than she, he took her by force, and had connection with her.",,,,,,,
6800,"Then Amnon was full of hate for her, hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her. And he said to her, Get up and be gone.",,,,,,,
6801,"And she said to him, Not so, my brother, for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you did to me before. But he gave no attention to her.",,,,,,,
6802,"Then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said, Put this woman out, and let the door be locked after her.",,,,,,,
6803,"Now she had on a long robe, such as in past times the king's virgin daughters were dressed in. Then the servant put her out, locking the door after her.",,,,,,,
6804,"And Tamar, in her grief, put dust on her head; and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly.",,,,,,,
6805,"And her brother Absalom said to her, Has your brother Amnon been with you? but now, let there be an end to your crying, my sister: he is your brother, do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar went on living uncomforted in her brother's house.",,,,,,,
6806,"But when King David had news of all these things he was very angry; but he did not make trouble for Amnon his son, for he was dear to David, being his oldest son.",,,,,,,
6807,"But Absalom said nothing to his brother Amnon, good or bad: for he was full of hate for him, because he had taken his sister Tamar by force.",,,,,,,
6808,"Now after two full years, Absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim: and he sent for all the king's sons to come to his feast.",,,,,,,
6809,"And Absalom came to the king and said, See now, your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep; will the king and his servants be pleased to come?",,,,,,,
6810,"And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, or the number will be over-great for you. And he made his request again, but he would not go, but he gave him his blessing.",,,,,,,
6811,"Then Absalom said, If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Is there any reason for him to go with you?",,,,,,,
6812,But Absalom went on requesting him till he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. And Absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king.,,,,,,,
6813,"Now Absalom had given orders to his servants, saying, Now take note when Amnon's heart is glad with wine; and when I say to you, Make an attack on Amnon, then put him to death without fear: have I not given you orders? be strong and without fear.",,,,,,,
6814,"So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as Absalom had given them orders. Then all the king's sons got up, and every man got on his beast and went in flight.",,,,,,,
6815,"Now while they were on their way, news was given to David that Absalom had put to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living.",,,,,,,
6816,"Then the king got up in great grief, stretching himself out on the earth: and all his servants were by his side, with their clothing parted.",,,,,,,
6817,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, Let not my lord have the idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead: this has been purposed by Absalom from the day when he took his sister Tamar by force.",,,,,,,
6818,"So now, let not my lord the king take this thing to heart, with the idea that all the king's sons are dead: for only Amnon is dead.",,,,,,,
6819,"But Absalom went in flight. And the young man who kept the watch, lifting up his eyes, saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons; and the watchman came and gave word to the king, saying, I saw men coming down by t",e way of the,Hor,n,", f",om t,e h,llsid
6820,"And Jonadab said to the king, See, the king's sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.",,,,,,,
6821,"And while he was talking, the king's sons came, with weeping and loud cries: and the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly.",,,,,,,
6822,"So Absalom went in flight and came to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur, where he was for three years.",,,,,,,
6823,And the king was sorrowing for his son all the time.,,,,,,,
6824,"And the heart of David was wasted with desire for Absalom: for he was comforted for the death of Amnon.Now it was clear to Joab, the son of Zeruiah, that the king's heart was turning to Absalom.",,,,,,,
6825,"And Joab sent to Tekoa and got from there a wise woman, and said to her, Now make yourself seem like one given up to grief, and put on the clothing of sorrow, not using any sweet oil for your body, but looking like one who for a long time has been weepin",for the dea,:,,,,,
6826,And come to the king and say these words to him. So Joab gave her words to say.,,,,,,,
6827,"And the woman of Tekoa came to the king, and falling on her face, gave him honour and said, Give me help, O king.",,,,,,,
6828,"And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And her answer was, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.",,,,,,,
6829,"And I had two sons, and the two of them had a fight in the field, and there was no one to come between them, and one with a blow put the other to death.",,,,,,,
6830,"And now all the family is turned against me, your servant, saying, Give up him who was the cause of his brother's death, so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his brother, whose life he took; and we will put an end to the one who wil",get the her,tag,:,so,hey,ill,put o
6831,"And the king said to the woman, Go to your house and I will give orders about this.",,,,,,,
6832,"And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, may the sin be on me and on my family, and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin!",,,,,,,
6833,"And the king said, If anyone says anything to you, make him come to me, and he will do you no more damage.",,,,,,,
6834,"Then she said, Let the king keep in mind the Lord your God, so that he who gives punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my son. And he said, By the living Lord, not a hair of your son's head will",ome to the e,rth,,,,,
6835,"Then the woman said, Will the king let his servant say one word more? And he said, Say on.",,,,,,,
6836,"And the woman said, Why have you had such a thought about the people of God? (for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away.)",,,,,,,
6837,"For death comes to us all, and we are like water drained out on the earth, which it is not possible to take up again; and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him.",,,,,,,
6838,"And now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king: and your servant said, I will put my cause before the king, and it may be that he will give effect to my request.",,,,,,,
6839,"For the king will give ear, and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of God.",,,,,,,
6840,"Then your servant said, May the word of my lord the king give me peace! for my lord the king is as the angel of God in his hearing of good and bad: and may the Lord your God be with you!",,,,,,,
6841,"Then the king said to the woman, Now give me an answer to the question I am going to put to you; keep nothing back. And the woman said, Let my lord the king say on.",,,,,,,
6842,"And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman in answer said, By the life of your soul, my lord the king, it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to the left from anything said by the king: your servant J",ab gave me o,der,",",and,put,ll,hese
6843,"This he did, hoping that the face of this business might be changed: and my lord is wise, with the wisdom of the angel of God, having knowledge of everything on earth.",,,,,,,
6844,"And the king said to Joab, See now, I will do this thing: go then and Come back with the young man Absalom.",,,,,,,
6845,"Then Joab, falling down on his face on the earth, gave the king honour and blessing; and Joab said, Today it is clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes, my lord king, because the king has given effect to the request of his servant.",,,,,,,
6846,So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom.,,,,,,,
6847,"And the king said, Let him go to his house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king.",,,,,,,
6848,Now in all Israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as Absalom: from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful.,,,,,,,
6849,"And when he had his hair cut, (which he did at the end of every year, because of the weight of his hair;) the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the king's weight.",,,,,,,
6850,"And Absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named Tamar, who was very beautiful.",,,,,,,
6851,For two full years Absalom was living in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king.,,,,,,,
6852,"Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.",,,,,,,
6853,"So he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley in it; go and put it on fire. And Absalom's servants put the field on fire.",,,,,,,
6854,"Then Joab came to Absalom in his house and said to him, Why have your servants put my field on fire?",,,,,,,
6855,"And Absalom's answer was, See, I sent to you saying, Come here, so that I may send you to the king to say, Why have I come back from Geshur? it would be better for me to be there still: let me now see the king's face, and if there is any sin in me, let h",m put me to,eat,.,,,,
6856,"So Joab went to the king and said these words to him: and when the king had sent for him, Absalom came, and went down on his face on the earth before the king: and the king gave him a kiss.Now after this, Absalom got for himself a carriage and horses, an",fifty runne,s t,,o b,fore,him,
6857,"And Absalom got up early, morning after morning, and took his place at the side of the public meeting-place: and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged, then Absalom, crying out to him, said, What is your town? and he would s","y, Your serv",nt,s,of,ne o,th,trib
6858,"And Absalom would say to him, See, your cause is true and right; but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing.",,,,,,,
6859,"And more than this, Absalom said, If only I was made judge in the land, so that every man who has any cause or question might come to me, and I would give a right decision for him!",,,,,,,
6860,"And if any man came near to give him honour, he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss.",,,,,,,
6861,"And this Absalom did to everyone in Israel who came to the king to have his cause judged: so Absalom, like a thief, took away the hearts of the men of Israel.",,,,,,,
6862,"Now at the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, Let me go to Hebron and give effect to the oath which I made to the Lord:",,,,,,,
6863,"For while I was living in Geshur in Aram, your servant made an oath, saying, If ever the Lord lets me come back to Jerusalem, I will give him worship in Hebron.",,,,,,,
6864,"And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he got up and went to Hebron.",,,,,,,
6865,"But Absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say, At the sound of the horn you are to say, Absalom is king in Hebron.",,,,,,,
6866,"And with Absalom, at his request, went two hundred men from Jerusalem, who were completely unconscious of his designs.",,,,,,,
6867,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David's helpers, from Giloh his town, while he was making the offerings. And the design against David became strong, for more and more people were joined to Absalom.",,,,,,,
6868,"And one came to David and said, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.",,,,,,,
6869,"And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Come, let us go in flight, or not one of us will be safe from Absalom: let us go without loss of time, or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us, and put the town to the sword.",,,,,,,
6870,"And the king's servants said to the king, See, your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done.",,,,,,,
6871,"So the king went out, taking with him all the people of his house, but for ten of his women, who were to take care of the house.",,,,,,,
6872,"And the king went out, and all his servants went after him, and made a stop at the Far House.",,,,,,,
6873,"And all the people went on by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on before the king.",,,,,,,
6874,"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you coming with us? go back and keep with the king: for you are a man of another country, you are far from the land of your birth.",,,,,,,
6875,"It was only yesterday you came to us; why then am I to make you go up and down with us? for I have to go where I may; go back then, and take your countrymen with you, and may the Lord's mercy and good faith be with you.",,,,,,,
6876,"And Ittai the Gittite in answer said, By the living Lord, and by the life of my lord the king, in whatever place my lord the king may be, for life or death, there will your servant be.",,,,,,,
6877,"And David said to Ittai, Go forward, then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all his men and all the little ones he had with him.",,,,,,,
6878,And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through; and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land.,,,,,,,
6879,"Then Zadok came, and Abiathar, and with them the ark of God's agreement: and they put down the ark of God, till all the people from the town had gone by.",,,,,,,
6880,"And the king said to Zadok, Take the ark of God back into the town: if I have grace in the eyes of the Lord, he will let me come back and see it and his House again:",,,,,,,
6881,"But if he says, I have no delight in you: then, here I am; let him do to me what seems good to him.",,,,,,,
6882,"The king said further to Zadok the priest, See, you and Abiathar are to go back to the town in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz, your son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.",,,,,,,
6883,"See, I will be waiting at the way across the river, in the waste land, till I get news from you.",,,,,,,
6884,"So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and did not go away from there.",,,,,,,
6885,"And David went up the slopes of the Mount of Olives weeping all the way, with his head covered and no shoes on his feet: and all the people who were with him, covering their heads, went up weeping.",,,,,,,
6886,"And word came to David, saying, Ahithophel is among those who are joined to Absalom. And David said, O Lord, let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish.",,,,,,,
6887,"Now when David had come to the top of the slope, where they gave worship to God, Hushai the Archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head:",,,,,,,
6888,"David said to him, If you go on with me, you will be a trouble to me:",,,,,,,
6889,"But if you go back to the town and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as in the past I have been your father's servant, so now I will be yours: then you will be able to keep Ahithophel's designs against me from being put into effect.",,,,,,,
6890,"And have you not there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? so whatever comes to your ears from the king's house, give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",,,,,,,
6891,"See, they have with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar; by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears.",,,,,,,
6892,"So Hushai, David's friend, went into the town, and Absalom came to Jerusalem.And when David had gone a little way past the top of the slope, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, came to him, with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a hun",red stems of,dry,g,ape,and,a h,ndred
6893,"And David said to Ziba, What is your reason for this? And Ziba said, The asses are for the use of the king's people, and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men; and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste la",d.,,,,,,
6894,"And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said, He is still at Jerusalem: for he said, Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father.",,,,,,,
6895,"Then the king said to Ziba, Truly everything which was Mephibosheth's is yours. And Ziba said, I give honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king!",,,,,,,
6896,"And when King David came to Bahurim, a man of Saul's family named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there, calling curses after him.",,,,,,,
6897,"And he sent stones at David and at all the king's servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side, on the right hand and on the left.",,,,,,,
6898,"And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, you good-for-nothing:",,,,,,,
6899,"The Lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of Saul, whose kingdom you have taken; and the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom, your son: now you yourself are taken in your evil, because you are a man of blood.",,,,,,,
6900,"Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, Is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king? let me go over and take off his head.",,,,,,,
6901,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him go on cursing, for the Lord has said, Put a curse on David, and who then may say, Why have you done so?",,,,,,,
6902,"And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, You see how my son, the offspring of my body, has made designs against my life: how much more then may this Benjamite do so? Let him be, and let him go on cursing; for the Lord has given him orders.",,,,,,,
6903,"It may be that the Lord will take note of my wrongs, and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today.",,,,,,,
6904,"So David and his men went on their way: and Shimei went by the hillside parallel with them, cursing and sending stones and dust at him.",,,,,,,
6905,"And the king and his people came tired to Jordan, and took their rest there.",,,,,,,
6906,"And Absalom and the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.",,,,,,,
6907,"Then Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom and said, Long life to the king, long life to the king!",,,,,,,
6908,"And Absalom said, Is this your love for your friend? why did you not go with your friend?",,,,,,,
6909,"And Hushai said to Absalom, Not so; I am for that man whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have taken as king, and I will take my place with him.",,,,,,,
6910,"And more than this! where is my place as a servant? is it not before his son? as I have been your father's servant, so will I be yours.",,,,,,,
6911,"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your opinion now, what are we to do?",,,,,,,
6912,"And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's women who are here looking after his house; then all Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father, and the hands of your supporters will be strong.",,,,,,,
6913,"So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's women before the eyes of all Israel.",,,,,,,
6914,"In those days the opinions of Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from God; so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom.Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me take out twelve thousand men and this very nig",t I will go,fte,,avi,:,,
6915,"And I will come up with him when he is tired and feeble, and make him full of fear: and all the people with him will go in flight; and I will make an attack on the king only:",,,,,,,
6916,And I will make all the people come back to you as a bride comes back to her husband: it is the life of only one man you are going after; so all the people will be at peace.,,,,,,,
6917,And the saying was pleasing to Absalom and to the responsible men of Israel.,,,,,,,
6918,"Then Absalom said, Now send for Hushai the Archite, and let us give ear to what he has to say.",,,,,,,
6919,"And when Hushai came, Absalom said to him, This is what Ahithophel has said: are we to do as he says? if not, what is your suggestion?",,,,,,,
6920,"And Hushai said to Absalom, Ahithophel's idea is not a good one at this time.",,,,,,,
6921,"Hushai said further, You have knowledge of your father and his men, that they are men of war, and that their feelings are bitter, like those of a bear in the field whose young ones have been taken from her: and your father is a man of war, and will not t",ke his night,s r,s,wi,h th,pe,ple;
6922,"But he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place; and if some of our people, at the first attack, are overcome, then any hearing of it will say, There is destruction among the people who are on Absalom's side.",,,,,,,
6923,"Then even the strongest, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will become like water; for all Israel is conscious that your father is a man of war, and those who are with him are strong and without fear.",,,,,,,
6924,"But my suggestion is that all Israel, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, comes together to you, a great army like the sands of the sea in number; and that you yourself go out among them.",,,,,,,
6925,"Then we will come on him in some place, wherever he may be, falling on him as the dew comes on the earth: and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his life.",,,,,,,
6926,"And if he has gone into some town, then let all Israel take strong cords to that town, and we will have it pulled into the valley, till not one small stone is to be seen there.",,,,,,,
6927,"Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, Hushai's suggestion is better than that of Ahithophel. For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom.",,,,,,,
6928,"Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them.",,,,,,,
6929,"So now send the news quickly to David, and say, Do not take your night's rest by the way across the river to the waste land, but be certain to go over; or the king and all the people with him will come to destruction.",,,,,,,
6930,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En-rogel; and a servant-girl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to King David, for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town.",,,,,,,
6931,"But a boy saw them, and gave word of it to Absalom: so the two of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a water-hole in his garden, and they went down into it.",,,,,,,
6932,"And a woman put a cover over the hole, and put crushed grain on top of it, and no one had any knowledge of it.",,,,,,,
6933,"And Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone from here to the stream. And after searching for them, and seeing nothing of them, they went back to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
6934,"Then after the servants had gone away, they came up out of the water-hole and went to give King David the news; and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such and such are Ahithophel's designs against you.",,,,,,,
6935,"So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan: when dawn came, every one of them had gone over Jordan.",,,,,,,
6936,"Now when Ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on, he got his ass ready, and went back to his house, to the town where he came from, and having put his house in order, he put himself to death by hanging; so he came to his end and was put in th",resting-pla,e o,,is,athe,.,
6937,"And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom, with all the men of Israel, went over Jordan.",,,,,,,
6938,"And Absalom put Amasa at the head of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had been the lover of Abigail, the daughter of Jesse, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.",,,,,,,
6939,And Israel and Absalom put up their tents in the land of Gilead.,,,,,,,
6940,"Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,",,,,,,,
6941,"Came with beds and basins and pots, and grain and meal, and all sorts of dry foods,",,,,,,,
6942,"And honey and butter and sheep and milk-cheeses, for David and his people: for they said, This people is in the waste land, needing food and drink and rest.And David had the people who were with him numbered, and he put over them captains of thousands an",captains of,hun,r,ds.,,,
6943,"And David sent the people out, a third of them under the orders of Joab, and a third under the orders of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, And I myself will certainly go out wit",you.,,,,,,
6944,"But the people said, It is better for you not to go out: for if we are put to flight, they will not give a thought to us, and if death overtakes half of us, it will be nothing to them: but you are of more value than ten thousand of us: so it is better fo",you to be r,ady,t,co,e to,our,help
6945,"And the king said to them, I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king took his place by the door of the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.",,,,,,,
6946,"And the king gave orders to Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Because of me, be gentle to the young man Absalom. And this order about Absalom was given in the hearing of all the people.",,,,,,,
6947,"So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the fight took place in the woods of Ephraim.",,,,,,,
6948,"And the people of Israel were overcome there by the servants of David, and there was a great destruction that day, and twenty thousand men were put to the sword.",,,,,,,
6949,And the fighting went on over all the face of the country: and the woods were responsible for more deaths than the sword.,,,,,,,
6950,"And Absalom came across some of David's men. And Absalom was seated on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree, and his head became fixed in the tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven, and the beast under him went",on.,,,,,,
6951,"And a certain man saw it and said to Joab, I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.",,,,,,,
6952,"And Joab said to the man who had given him the news, If you saw this, why did you not put your sword through him, and I would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your robe?",,,,,,,
6953,"And the man said to Joab, Even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver, I would not put out my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care that the young man Absalom is not touched",,,,,,,
6954,"And if I had falsely put him to death (and nothing may be kept secret from the king), you would have had nothing to do with me.",,,,,,,
6955,"Then Joab said, I would have made it safe for you. And he took three spears in his hand, and put them through Absalom's heart, while he was still living, in the branches of the tree.",,,,,,,
6956,"And ten young men, servants of Joab, came round Absalom and put an end to him.",,,,,,,
6957,"And Joab had the horn sounded, and the people came back from going after Israel, for Joab kept them back.",,,,,,,
6958,"And they took Absalom's body and put it into a great hole in the wood, and put a great mass of stones over it: and every man of Israel went in flight to his tent.",,,,,,,
6959,"Now Absalom, before his death, had put up for himself a pillar in the king's valley, naming it after himself; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and to this day it is named Absalom's pillar.",,,,,,,
6960,"Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, Let me go and give the king news of how the Lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him.",,,,,,,
6961,"And Joab said, You will take no news today; another day you may give him the news, but you will take no news today, because the king's son is dead.",,,,,,,
6962,"Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go and give the king word of what you have seen. And the Cushite, making a sign of respect to Joab, went off running.",,,,,,,
6963,"Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said to Joab again, Whatever may come of it, let me go after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why have you a desire to go, my son, seeing that you will get no reward for your news?",,,,,,,
6964,"Whatever may come of it, he said, I will go. Then he said to him, Go. So Ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the Cushite.",,,,,,,
6965,"Now David was seated between the two town doors; and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways, on the wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself.",,,,,,,
6966,"And the watchman gave news of it to the king. And the king said, If he is coming by himself, then he has news. And the man was travelling quickly, and came near.",,,,,,,
6967,"Then the watchman saw another man running: and crying out in the direction of the door he said, Here is another man running by himself. And the king said, He, like the other, comes with news.",,,,,,,
6968,"And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and his news will be good.",,,,,,,
6969,"And Ahimaaz, crying out to the king, said, It is well. And falling down before the king, with his face to the earth, he said, May the Lord your God be praised, who has given up the men who took up arms against my lord the king!",,,,,,,
6970,"And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said in answer, When Joab sent me, your servant, I saw a great outcry going on, but I had no knowledge of what it was.",,,,,,,
6971,"And the king said, Get back and take your place here. So turning to one side, he took his place there.",,,,,,,
6972,"And then the Cushite came and said, I have news for my lord the king: today the Lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you.",,,,,,,
6973,"And the king said to the Cushite, Is the young man Absalom safe? And the Cushite said in answer, May all the king's haters and those who do evil against the king, be as that young man is!",,,,,,,
6974,"Then the king was much moved, and went up into the room over the door, weeping, and saying, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! if only my life might have been given for yours, O Absalom, my son, my son!And word was given to Joab that the king was",eeping and s,rro,i,g f,r Ab,alo,.
6975,"And the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people: for it was said to the people, The king is in bitter grief for his son.",,,,,,,
6976,"And the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly, as those who are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war.",,,,,,,
6977,"But the king, covering his face, gave a great cry, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!",,,,,,,
6978,"And Joab came into the house to the king and said, Today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives and all your women safe from death;",,,,,,,
6979,"For your haters, it seems, are dear to you, and your friends are hated. For you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you: and now I see that if Absalom was living and we had all been dead today, it would have been right in your ey",s.,,,,,,
6980,"So get up now, and go out and say some kind words to your servants; for, by the Lord, I give you my oath, that if you do not go out, not one of them will keep with you tonight; and that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from",your earlies,ye,r,.,,,
6981,Then the king got up and took his seat near the town-door. And word was given to all the people that the king was in the public place: and all the people came before the king. Now all the men of Israel had gone back in flight to their tents.,,,,,,,
6982,"And through all the tribes of Israel the people were having arguments, saying, The king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of the Philistines; and now he has gone in flight from the land, because of A",salom.,,,,,,
6983,"And Absalom, whom we made a ruler over us, is dead in the fight. So now why do you say nothing about getting the king back? And word of what all Israel was saying came to the king.",,,,,,,
6984,"And King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, Say to the responsible men of Judah, Why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house?",,,,,,,
6985,"You are my brothers, my bone and my flesh; why are you the last to get the king back again?",,,,,,,
6986,"And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God's punishment be on me, if I do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of Joab!",,,,,,,
6987,"And the hearts of the men of Judah were moved like one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, Come back, with all your servants.",,,,,,,
6988,"So the king came back, and came as far as Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, meeting the king there, to take him back with them over Jordan.",,,,,,,
6989,"And Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, got up quickly and went down with the men of Judah for the purpose of meeting King David;",,,,,,,
6990,"And with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of Saul, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, came rushing to Jordan before the king,",,,,,,,
6991,"And kept going across the river to take the people of the king's house over, and to do whatever was desired by the king. And Shimei, the son of Gera, went down on his face in the dust before the king, when he was about to go over Jordan,",,,,,,,
6992,"And said to him, Let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes, O my lord, and do not keep in mind the wrong I did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, or take it to heart.",,,,,,,
6993,"For your servant is conscious of his sin: and so, as you see, I have come today, the first of all the sons of Joseph, for the purpose of meeting my lord the king.",,,,,,,
6994,"But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, Is not death the right fate for Shimei, because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil?",,,,,,,
6995,"And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you put yourselves against me today? is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today? for I am certain today that I am king in Israel.",,,,,,,
6996,"So the king said to Shimei, You will not be put to death. And the king gave him his oath.",,,,,,,
6997,"And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son, came down for the purpose of meeting the king; his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came back in peace.",,,,,,,
6998,"Now when he had come from Jerusalem to see the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?",,,,,,,
6999,"And he said in answer, Because of the deceit of my servant, my lord king: for I, your servant, said to him, You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king, for your servant has not the use of his feet.",,,,,,,
7000,He has given you a false account of me: but my lord the king is like the angel of God: do then whatever seems good to you.,,,,,,,
7001,For all my father's family were only dead men before my lord the king: and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the king's table. What right then have I to say anything more to the king?,,,,,,,
7002,"And the king said, Say nothing more about these things. I say, Let there be a division of the land between Ziba and you.",,,,,,,
7003,"And Mephibosheth said, Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace!",,,,,,,
7004,And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went on as far as Jordan with the king to take him across Jordan.,,,,,,,
7005,"Now Barzillai was a very old man, as much as eighty years old: and he had given the king everything he had need of, while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.",,,,,,,
7006,"And the king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will take care of you in Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
7007,"And Barzillai said to the king, How much of my life is still before me, for me to go up to Jerusalem with the king?",,,,,,,
7008,I am now eighty years old: good and bad are the same to me; have meat and drink any taste for me now? am I able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song? why then am I to be a trouble to my lord the king?,,,,,,,
7009,Your servant's desire was only to take the king over Jordan; why is the king to give me such a reward?,,,,,,,
7010,"Let your servant now go back again, so that when death comes to me, it may be in my town and by the resting-place of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham: let him go with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.",,,,,,,
7011,"And the king said in answer, Let Chimham go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you: and whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.",,,,,,,
7012,"Then all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king gave Barzillai a kiss, with his blessing; and he went back to his place.",,,,,,,
7013,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way.",,,,,,,
7014,"Then the men of Israel came to the king and said, Why have our countrymen of Judah taken you away in secret and come over Jordan with the king and all his family, because all his people are David's men?",,,,,,,
7015,"And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel, Because the king is our near relation: why then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or has he given us any offering?",,,,,,,
7016,"And in answer to the men of Judah, the men of Israel said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are the first in order of birth: why did you make nothing of us? and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back? And the words of th",men of Juda,we,e,mor,vio,ent,than
7017,"So all the men of Israel, turning away from David, went after Sheba, the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah were true to their king, going with him from Jordan as far as Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
7018,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house, and had them shut up, and gave them the necessaries of life, but did not go near them. So they were shut up till the day of their death,",living as wi,ows,,,,,
7019,"Then the king said to Amasa, Get all the men of Judah together, and in three days be here yourself.",,,,,,,
7020,"So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah together, but he took longer than the time David had given him.",,,,,,,
7021,"And David said to Abishai, Sheba, the son of Bichri, will do us more damage than Absalom did; so take some of your lord's servants and go after him, before he makes himself safe in the walled towns, and gets away before our eyes.",,,,,,,
7022,"So there went after Abishai, Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the fighting- men; they went out of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba, the son of Bichri.",,,,,,,
7023,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came face to face with them. Now Joab had on his war-dress, and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover; and while he was walking, it came out, falling to the earth.",,,,,,,
7024,"And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well, my brother? And with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss.",,,,,,,
7025,"But Amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in Joab's left hand, and Joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth, and he did not give him another blow. So Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba, the",son of Bichr,.,,,,,
7026,"And one of Joab's young men, taking his place at Amasa's side, said, Whoever is for Joab and for David, let him go after Joab!",,,,,,,
7027,"And Amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people were stopping, he took Amasa out of the highway and put him in a field, with a cloth over him, when he saw that everyone who went by cam",to a stop.,,,,,,
7028,"When he had been taken off the road, all the people went on after Joab in search of Sheba, the son of Bichri.",,,,,,,
7029,"And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all the Bichrites came together and went in after him.",,,,,,,
7030,"And Joab and his men got him shut up in Abel of Beth-maacah, and put up an earthwork against the town: and all Joab's men did their best to get the wall broken down.",,,,,,,
7031,"Then a wise woman got up on the wall, and crying out from the town, said, Give ear, give ear; say now to Joab, Come near, so that I may have talk with you.",,,,,,,
7032,"And he came near, and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he said in answer, I am. Then she said, Give ear to your servant's words. And he said, I am giving ear.",,,,,,,
7033,"Then she said, In the old days, there was a saying, Let them put the question in Abel and in Dan, saying, Has what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end?",,,,,,,
7034,Your purpose is the destruction of a mother-town in Israel: why would you put an end to the heritage of the Lord?,,,,,,,
7035,"And Joab, answering her, said, Far, far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction;",,,,,,,
7036,"Not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba, son of Bichri, by name, has taken up arms against the king, against David: give up this man only, and I will go away from the town. And the woman said to Joab, His head will be dropped over the wal",to you.,,,,,,
7037,"Then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town. And they had Sheba's head cut off and sent out to Joab. And he had the horn sounded, and sent them all away from the town, every man to his tent. And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king.",,,,,,,
7038,"Now Joab was over all the army; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;",,,,,,,
7039,"And Adoram was overseer of the forced work; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;",,,,,,,

7041,"And in addition, Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.In the days of David they were short of food for three years, year after year; and David went before the Lord for directions. And the Lord said, On Saul and on his family there is blood, because he p",t the Gibeon,tes,t,de,th.,,
7042,"Then the king sent for the Gibeonites; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but were the last of the Amorites, to whom the children of Israel had given an oath; but Saul, in his passion for the children of Israel and Judah, had made an",attempt on t,eir,l,ves,),,

7044,"And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not a question of silver and gold between us and Saul or his family; and it is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel. And he said, Say, then, what am I to do for you?",,,,,,,
7045,"And they said to the king, As for the man by whom we were wasted, and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of Israel,",,,,,,,
7046,"Let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the Lord in Gibeon, on the hill of the Lord. And the king said, I will give them.",,,,,,,

7048,"But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth; and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whose father was Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:",,,,,,,
7049,"And he gave them up to the Gibeonites, and they put them to death, hanging them on the mountain before the Lord; all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain-cutting, at the start of the cutting of the barley.",,,,,,,
7050,"And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took haircloth, placing it on the rock as a bed for herself, from the start of the grain-cutting till rain came down on them from heaven; and she did not let the birds of the air come near them by day, or the beasts of t",e field by n,ght,,,,,

7057,"But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to his help, and, turning on the Philistine, gave him his death-blow. Then David's men took an oath, and said, Never again are you to go out with us to the fight, so that you may not put out the light of Israel.",,,,,,,
7058,"Now after this there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Saph, one of the offspring of the Rephaim.",,,,,,,
7059,"And again there was war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan, the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite, put to death Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a cloth- worker's rod.",,,,,,,

7185,"So now, let me make a suggestion, so that you may keep your life safe and the life of your son Solomon.",,,,,,,
7186,"Come now, go to King David and say to him, Did you not, O my lord, take an oath to me, your servant, saying, Truly Solomon your son will be king after me, seated on the seat of my kingdom? why then is Adonijah acting as king?",,,,,,,
7187,"And while you are still talking there with the king, see, I will come in after you and say that your story is true.",,,,,,,
7188,"Then Bath-sheba went into the king's room; now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was waiting on him.",,,,,,,
7189,"And Bath-sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour. And he said, What is your desire?",,,,,,,
7190,"And she said to him, My lord, you took an oath by the Lord your God and gave your word to your servant, saying, Truly, Solomon your son will be king after me, seated on the seat of my kingdom.",,,,,,,
7191,"And now, see, Adonijah has made himself king without my lord's knowledge;",,,,,,,
7192,"And has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers, and has sent for all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the captain of the army; but he has not sent for Solomon your servant.",,,,,,,
7193,"And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, waiting for you to say who is to take the place of my lord the king after him.",,,,,,,
7194,"For as things are, it will come about, when my lord the king is sleeping with his fathers, that I and Solomon my son will be made outlaws.",,,,,,,
7195,"And while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.",,,,,,,
7196,"And they said to the king, Here is Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he went down on his face on the earth.",,,,,,,
7197,"And Nathan said, O my lord king, have you said, Adonijah is to be king after me, seated on the seat of my kingdom?",,,,,,,
7198,"Because today he has gone down and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers, and has sent for all the king's sons to come to him, with the captains of the army and Abiathar the priest; and they are feasting before him and crying, L",ng life to K,ng,d,nij,h!,,
7199,"But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he has not sent for.",,,,,,,
7200,"Has this thing been done by my lord the king, without giving word to your servants who was to be placed on my lord the king's seat after him?",,,,,,,
7201,"Then King David in answer said, Send for Bath-sheba to come to me. And she came in and took her place before the king.",,,,,,,
7202,"And the king took an oath, and said, By the living Lord, who has been my saviour from all my troubles,",,,,,,,
7203,"As I took an oath to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, Certainly Solomon your son will become king after me, seated on my seat in my place; so will I do this day.",,,,,,,
7204,"Then Bath-sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour, and said, May my lord King David go on living for ever.",,,,,,,
7205,"And King David said, Send for Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.",,,,,,,
7206,"And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and put Solomon my son on my beast, yes, mine, and take him down to Gihon;",,,,,,,
7207,"And there let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him to make him king over Israel; and sounding the horn say, Long life to King Solomon!",,,,,,,
7208,"Then come up after him and he will come in and take his place on the seat of my kingdom; for he is to be king in my place, and I have given orders that he is to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.",,,,,,,
7209,"And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answering the king, said, So be it: and may the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say so.",,,,,,,
7210,"As the Lord has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon and make the seat of his authority greater than that of my lord King David.",,,,,,,
7211,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and put Solomon on King David's beast and took him to Gihon.",,,,,,,
7212,"And Zadok the priest took the vessel of oil out of the Tent, and put the holy oil on Solomon. And when the horn was sounded, all the people said, Long life to King Solomon!",,,,,,,
7213,"And all the people came up after him, piping with pipes, and they were glad with great joy, so that the earth was shaking with the sound.",,,,,,,
7214,"And it came to the ears of Adonijah and all the guests who were with him, when their meal was ended. And Joab, hearing the sound of the horn, said, What is the reason of this noise as if the town was worked up?",,,,,,,
7215,"And while the words were on his lips, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, came; and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a man of good faith and the news which you have for us will be good.",,,,,,,
7216,"And Jonathan, answering, said to Adonijah, Not so, but our lord King David has made Solomon king:",,,,,,,
7217,"And he sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they put him on the king's beast:",,,,,,,
7218,"And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him and made him king in Gihon; and they came back from there with joy, and the town was all worked up. This is the noise which has come to your ears.",,,,,,,
7219,And now Solomon is seated on the seat of the kingdom.,,,,,,,
7220,"And the king's servants came to our lord King David, blessing him and saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and the seat of his authority greater than your seat; and the king was bent low in worship on his bed.",,,,,,,
7221,"Then the king said, May the God of Israel be praised, who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it.",,,,,,,
7222,"And all the guests of Adonijah got up in fear and went away, every man to his place.",,,,,,,
7223,"And Adonijah himself was full of fear because of Solomon; and he got up and went to the altar, and put his hands on its horns.",,,,,,,
7224,"And they gave Solomon word of it, saying, See, Adonijah goes in such fear of King Solomon, that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.",,,,,,,
7225,"And Solomon said, If he is seen to be a man of good faith, not a hair of him will be touched; but if any wrongdoing is seen in him, he is to be put to death.",,,,,,,
7226,"So King Solomon sent, and they took him down from the altar. And he came and gave honour to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.Now the time of David's death came near; and he gave orders to Solomon his son, saying,",,,,,,,
7227,I am going the way of all the earth: so be strong and be a man;,,,,,,,
7228,"And keep the orders of the Lord your God, walking in his ways, keeping his laws and his orders and his rules and his words, as they are recorded in the law of Moses; so that you may do well in all you do and wherever you go,",,,,,,,
7229,"So that the Lord may give effect to what he said of me, If your children give attention to their ways, living uprightly before me with all their heart and their soul, you will never be without a man to be king in Israel.",,,,,,,
7230,"Now you have knowledge of what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me, and to the two captains of the army of Israel, Abner, the son of Ner, and Amasa, the son of Jether, whom he put to death, taking payment for the blood of war in time of peace, and making",the band of,y c,o,hin,and,the,shoes
7231,"So be guided by your wisdom, and let not his white head go down to the underworld in peace.",,,,,,,
7232,"But be good to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be guests at your table; for so they came to me when I went in flight from Absalom your brother.",,,,,,,
7233,"Now you have with you Shimei, the son of Gera the Benjamite of Bahurim, who put a bitter curse on me on the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to see me at Jordan, and I gave him my oath by the Lord, saying, I will not put you to death by the",word.,,,,,,
7234,"But do not let him be free from punishment, for you are a wise man; and it will be clear to you what you have to do with him; see that his white head goes down to the underworld in blood.",,,,,,,
7235,"Then David went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David.",,,,,,,
7236,David was king over Israel for forty years: for seven years he was king in Hebron and for thirty-three years in Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
7237,"And Solomon took his place on the seat of David his father, and his kingdom was made safe and strong.",,,,,,,
7238,"Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bath-sheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you in peace? And he said, Yes, in peace.",,,,,,,
7239,"Then he said, I have something to say to you. And she said, Say on.",,,,,,,
7240,"And he said, You saw how the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had the idea that I would be their king; but now the kingdom is turned about, and has become my brother's, for it was given to him by the Lord.",,,,,,,
7241,"Now I have one request to make to you, and do not say, No, to me. And she said to him, Say on.",,,,,,,
7242,"Then he said, Will you go to Solomon the king (for he will not say, No, to you) and put before him my request that he will give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife?",,,,,,,
7243,"And Bath-sheba said, Good! I will make your request to the king.",,,,,,,
7244,"So Bath- sheba went to King Solomon to have talk with him on Adonijah's account. And the king got up to come to her, and went down low to the earth before her; then he took his place on the king's seat and had a seat made ready for the king's mother and",he took her,lac,,t h,s ri,ht,and.
7245,"Then she said, I have one small request to make to you; do not say, No, to me. And the king said, Say on, my mother, for I will not say, No, to you.",,,,,,,
7246,"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife.",,,,,,,
7247,"Then King Solomon made answer and said to his mother, Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah? Take the kingdom for him in addition, for he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, are on his",side.,,,,,,
7248,"Then King Solomon took an oath by the Lord, saying, May God's punishment be on me if Adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life.",,,,,,,
7249,"Now by the living Lord, who has given me my place on the seat of David my father, and made me one of a line of kings, as he gave me his word, truly Adonijah will be put to death this day.",,,,,,,
7250,"And King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and he made an attack on him and put him to death.",,,,,,,
7251,"And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your fields; for death would be your right reward; but I will not put you to death now, because you took up the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and you were with him in all his trou",les.,,,,,,
7252,"So Solomon let Abiathar be priest no longer, so that he might make the word of the Lord come true which he said about the sons of Eli in Shiloh.",,,,,,,
7253,"And news of this came to Joab; for Joab had been one of Adonijah's supporters, though he had not been on Absalom's side. Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of the Lord, and put his hands on the horns of the altar.",,,,,,,
7254,"And they said to King Solomon, Joab has gone in flight to the Tent of the Lord and is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, make an attack on him.",,,,,,,
7255,"And Benaiah came to the Tent of the Lord and said to him, The king says, Come out. And he said, No; but let death come to me here. And Benaiah went back to the king and gave him word of the answer which Joab had given.",,,,,,,
7256,"And the king said, Do as he has said and make an attack on him there, and put his body into the earth; so that you may take away from me and from my family the blood of one put to death by Joab without cause.",,,,,,,
7257,"And the Lord will send back his blood on his head, because of the attack he made on two men more upright and better than himself, putting them to the sword without my father's knowledge; even Abner, the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amas",", the son of",Jet,e,", c",ptai,of,the a
7258,"So their blood will be on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed for ever; but for David and his seed and his family and the seat of his kingdom, there will be peace for ever from the Lord.",,,,,,,
7259,"So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up, and falling on him, put him to death; and his body was put to rest in his house in the waste land.",,,,,,,
7260,"And the king put Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the army; and Zadok the priest he put in the place of Abiathar.",,,,,,,
7261,"Then the king sent for Shimei, and said to him, Make a house for yourself in Jerusalem and keep there and go to no other place.",,,,,,,
7262,"For be certain that on the day when you go out and go over the stream Kidron, death will overtake you: and your blood will be on your head.",,,,,,,
7263,"And Shimei said to the king, Very well! as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And for a long time Shimei went on living in Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
7264,"But after three years, two of the servants of Shimei went in flight to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And word was given to Shimei that his servants had gone to Gath.",,,,,,,
7265,"Then Shimei got up, and making ready his ass, he went to Gath, to Achish, in search of his servants; and he sent and got them from Gath.",,,,,,,
7266,And news was given to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back again.,,,,,,,
7267,"Then the king sent for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you take an oath by the Lord, protesting to you and saying, Be certain that on the day when you go out from here, wherever you go, death will overtake you? and you said to me, Very well!",,,,,,,
7268,Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the order which I gave you?,,,,,,,
7269,"And the king said to Shimei, You have knowledge of all the evil which you did to David my father; and now the Lord has sent back your evil on yourself.",,,,,,,
7270,"But a blessing will be on King Solomon, and the kingdom of David will keep its place before the Lord for ever.",,,,,,,
7271,"So the king gave orders to Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and, falling on him, put him to death. And Solomon's authority over the kingdom was complete.Solomon became the son-in-law of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter as","is wife, kee",ing,h,r i,the,tow,of D
7272,"But all this time the people were making their offerings in the high places, because no house had been put up to the name of the Lord till those days.",,,,,,,
7273,"And Solomon, in his love for the Lord, kept the laws of David his father; but he made offerings and let them go up in smoke on the high places.",,,,,,,
7274,"And the king went to Gibeon to make an offering there, because that was the chief high place: it was Solomon's way to make a thousand burned offerings on that altar.",,,,,,,
7275,"In Gibeon, Solomon had a vision of the Lord in a dream by night; and God said to him, Say what I am to give you.",,,,,,,
7276,"And Solomon said, Great was your mercy to David my father, as his life before you was true and upright and his heart was true to you; and you have kept for him this greatest mercy, a son to take his place this day.",,,,,,,
7277,"And now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in the place of David my father; and I am only a young boy, with no knowledge of how to go out or come in.",,,,,,,
7278,"And your servant has round him the people of your selection, a people so great that they may not be numbered, and no account of them may be given.",,,,,,,
7279,"Give your servant, then, a wise heart for judging your people, able to see what is good and what evil; for who is able to be the judge of this great people?",,,,,,,
7280,Now these words and Solomon's request were pleasing to the Lord.,,,,,,,
7281,"And God said to him, Because your request is for this thing, and not for long life for yourself or for wealth or for the destruction of your haters, but for wisdom to be a judge of causes;",,,,,,,
7282,"I have done as you said: I have given you a wise and far-seeing heart, so that there has never been your equal in the past, and never will there be any like you in the future.",,,,,,,
7283,"And with this I have given you what you made no request for: wealth and honour, so that no king was ever your equal.",,,,,,,
7284,"And if you go on in my ways, keeping my laws and my orders as your father David did, I will give you a long life.",,,,,,,
7285,"And Solomon, awakening, saw that it was a dream; then he came to Jerusalem, where he went before the ark of the agreement of the Lord, offering burned offerings and peace-offerings; and he made a feast for all his servants.",,,,,,,
7286,Then two loose women of the town came and took their places before the king;,,,,,,,
7287,"And one of them said, O my lord, I and this woman are living in the same house; and I gave birth to a child by her side in the house.",,,,,,,
7288,"And three days after the birth of my child, this woman had a child: we were together, no other-person was with us in the house but we two only.",,,,,,,
7289,"In the night, this woman, sleeping on her child, was the cause of its death.",,,,,,,
7290,And she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was sleeping; and she took it in her arms and put her dead child in my arms.,,,,,,,
7291,"And when I got up to give my child the breast, I saw that it was dead; but in the morning, looking at it with care, I saw that it was not my son.",,,,,,,
7292,"And the other woman said, No; but the living child is my son and the dead one yours. But the first said, No; the dead child is your son and the living one mine. So they kept on talking before the king.",,,,,,,
7293,"Then the king said, One says, The living child is my son, and yours is the dead: and the other says, Not so; but your son is the dead one and mine is the living.",,,,,,,
7294,"Then he said, Get me a sword. So they went and put a sword before the king.",,,,,,,
7295,"And the king said, Let the living child be cut in two and one half given to one woman and one to the other.",,,,,,,
7296,"Then the mother of the living child came forward, for her heart went out to her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the child; do not on any account put it to death. But the other woman said, It will not be mine or yours; let it be cut in two.",,,,,,,
7297,"Then the king made answer and said, Give her the child, and do not put it to death; she is the mother of it.",,,,,,,
7298,"And news of this decision which the king had made went through all Israel; and they had fear of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to give decisions.Now Solomon was king over all Israel.",,,,,,,
7299,"And these were his chief men: Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the priest;",,,,,,,
7300,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were scribes; Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;",,,,,,,
7301,"Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was head of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;",,,,,,,
7302,"Azariah, the son of Nathan, was over those in authority in the different divisions of the country; Zabud, the son of Nathan, was priest and the king's friend;",,,,,,,
7303,"Ahishar was controller of the king's house; Adoniram, the son of Abda, was overseer of the forced work.",,,,,,,
7304,"And Solomon put twelve overseers over all Israel, to be responsible for the stores needed for the king and those of his house; every man was responsible for one month in the year.",,,,,,,
7305,And these are their names: ... the son of Hur in the hill country of Ephraim;,,,,,,,
7306,... the son of Deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan;,,,,,,,
7307,... the son of Hesed in Arubboth; Socoh and all the land of Hepher were under his control;,,,,,,,
7308,"... the son of Abinadab in all Naphath-dor; his wife was Taphath, the daughter of Solomon.",,,,,,,
7309,"Baana, the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is by the side of Zarethan, under Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the far side of Jokmeam;",,,,,,,
7310,"... the son of Geber in Ramoth-gilead; he had the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and the country of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great towns with walls and locks of brass.",,,,,,,
7311,"Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;",,,,,,,
7312,"Ahimaaz in Naphtali; he took Basemath, the daughter of Solomon, as his wife;",,,,,,,
7313,"Baana, the son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth;",,,,,,,
7314,"Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, in Issachar;",,,,,,,
7315,"Shimei, the son of Ela, in Benjamin;",,,,,,,
7316,"Geber, the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan; and one overseer had authority over all the overseers who were in the land.",,,,,,,
7317,"Judah and Israel were as great in number as the sand by the seaside, and they took their food and drink with joy in their hearts.",,,,,,,
7318,"And Solomon was ruler over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the edge of Egypt; men gave him offerings and were his servants all the days of his life.",,,,,,,
7319,And the amount of Solomon's food for one day was thirty measures of crushed grain and sixty measures of meal;,,,,,,,
7320,"Ten fat oxen and twenty oxen from the fields, and a hundred sheep, in addition to harts and gazelles and roes and fat fowls.",,,,,,,
7321,"For he had authority over all the country on this side of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings on this side of the River; and he had peace round him on every side.",,,,,,,
7322,"So Judah and Israel were living safely, every man under his vine and his fig-tree, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.",,,,,,,
7323,"And Solomon had four thousand boxed-off spaces for horses for his carriages, and twelve thousand horsemen.",,,,,,,
7324,"And those overseers, every man in his month, saw that food was produced for Solomon and all his guests, they took care that nothing was overlooked.",,,,,,,
7325,"And they took grain and dry grass for the horses and the carriage-horses, to the right place, every man as he was ordered.",,,,,,,
7326,"And God gave Solomon a great store of wisdom and good sense, and a mind of wide range, as wide as the sand by the seaside.",,,,,,,
7327,And Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.,,,,,,,
7328,"For he was wiser than all men, even than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman and Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and he had a great name among all the nations round about.",,,,,,,
7329,"He was the maker of three thousand wise sayings, and of songs to the number of a thousand and five.",,,,,,,
7330,"He made sayings about all plants, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop hanging on the wall; and about all beasts and birds and fishes and the small things of the earth.",,,,,,,
7331,"People came from every nation to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had word of his wisdom.Now Hiram, king of Tyre, hearing that Solomon had been made king in place of his father, sent his servants to him; for Hiram ha",ever been a,fri,n,to,Davi,.,
7332,"And Solomon sent back word to Hiram, saying,",,,,,,,
7333,"You have knowledge that David my father was not able to make a house for the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars which were round him on every side, till the Lord put all those who were against him under his feet.",,,,,,,
7334,"But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; no one is making trouble, and no evil is taking place.",,,,,,,
7335,"And so it is my purpose to make a house for the name of the Lord my God, as he said to David my father, Your son, whom I will make king in your place, will be the builder of a house for my name.",,,,,,,
7336,"So now, will you have cedar-trees from Lebanon cut down for me, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you payment for your servants at whatever rate you say; for it is common knowledge that we have no such wood-cutters among us as t",e men of Zid,n.,,,,,
7337,"And these words of Solomon made Hiram glad, and he said, Now may the Lord be praised who has given to David a wise son to be king over this great people.",,,,,,,
7338,"Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying; The words you sent have been given to me: I will do all your desire in the question of cedar-wood and cypress-wood.",,,,,,,
7339,"My men will take them down from Lebanon to the sea, where I will have them corded together to go by sea to whatever place you say, and I will have them cut up there so that you may take them away; as for payment, it will be enough if you give me food for",my people.,,,,,,
7340,So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar-wood and cypress- wood he had need of;,,,,,,,
7341,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of grain, as food for his people, and twenty measures of clear oil; this he did every year.",,,,,,,
7342,"Now the Lord had given Solomon wisdom, as he had said to him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made an agreement together.",,,,,,,
7343,"Then King Solomon got together men for the forced work through all Israel, thirty thousand men in number;",,,,,,,
7344,"And sent them to Lebanon in bands of ten thousand every month: for a month they were working in Lebanon and for two months in their country, and Adoniram was in control of them.",,,,,,,
7345,"Then he had seventy thousand for the work of transport, and eighty thousand stone-cutters in the mountains;",,,,,,,
7346,"In addition to the chiefs of the responsible menputbySolomontooverseethework, threethousandandthreehundredinauthority over the workmen.",,,,,,,
7347,"By the king's orders great stones, stones of high price, were cut out, so that the base of the house might be made of squared stone.",,,,,,,
7348,"Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did the work of cutting them, and put edges on them, and got the wood and the stone ready for the building of the house.In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Eg","pt, in the f",urt,,ear,that,Sol,mon w
7349,"The house which Solomon made for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.",,,,,,,
7350,"The covered way before the Temple of the house was twenty cubits long, as wide as the house, and ten cubits wide in front of the house.",,,,,,,
7351,"And for the house he made windows, with network across.",,,,,,,
7352,"And against the walls all round, and against the walls of the Temple and of the inmost room, he put up wings, with side rooms all round:",,,,,,,
7353,"The lowest line of them being five cubits wide, the middle six cubits wide and the third seven cubits; for there was a space all round the outside walls of the house so that the boards supporting the rooms did not have to be fixed in the walls of the hou",e.,,,,,,
7354,(And the stones used in the building of the house were squared at the place where they were cut out; there was no sound of hammer or axe or any iron instrument while they were building the house.),,,,,,,
7355,"The door to the lowest side rooms was in the right side of the house; and they went up by twisting steps into the middle rooms, and from the middle into the third.",,,,,,,
7356,"So he put up the house and made it complete, roofing it with boards of cedar- wood.",,,,,,,
7357,"And he put up the line of side rooms against the walls of the house, fifteen cubits high, resting against the house on boards of cedar-wood.",,,,,,,
7358,"(And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,",,,,,,,
7359,"About this house which you are building: if you will keep my laws and give effect to my decisions and be guided by my rules, I will give effect to my word which I gave to David your father.",,,,,,,
7360,"And I will be ever among the children of Israel, and will not go away from my people.",,,,,,,
7361,So Solomon made the building of the house complete.),,,,,,,
7362,The walls of the house were covered inside with cedar-wood boards; from the floor to the roof of the house they were covered inside with wood; and the floor was covered with boards of cypress-wood.,,,,,,,
7363,"And at the back of the house a further space of twenty cubits was shut in with boards of cedar-wood, for the inmost room.",,,,,,,
7364,"And the house, that is, the Temple, in front of the holy place was forty cubits long.",,,,,,,
7365,"(All the inside of the house was cedar-wood, ornamented with designs of buds and flowers; no stonework was to be seen inside.)",,,,,,,
7366,"And he made ready an inmost room in the middle of the house, in which to put the ark of the agreement of the Lord.",,,,,,,
7367,"And the inmost room was twenty cubits square and twenty cubits high, plated over with clear gold, and he made an altar of cedar-wood, plating it with gold.",,,,,,,
7368,"Solomon had all the inside of the house covered with gold, and he put chains of gold across in front of the inmost room, which itself was covered with gold.",,,,,,,
7369,Plates of gold were put all through the house till it was covered completely (and the altar in the inmost room was all covered with gold).,,,,,,,
7370,"In the inmost room he made two winged beings of olive-wood, ten cubits high;",,,,,,,
7371,With outstretched wings five cubits wide; the distance from the edge of one wing to the edge of the other was ten cubits.,,,,,,,
7372,"The two winged ones were ten cubits high, of the same size and form.",,,,,,,
7373,The two of them were ten cubits high.,,,,,,,
7374,"These were placed inside the inner house, their outstretched wings touching the walls of the house, one touching one wall and one the other, while their other wings were touching in the middle.",,,,,,,
7375,These winged ones were plated over with gold.,,,,,,,
7376,And all the walls of the house inside and out were ornamented with forms of winged ones and palm-trees and open flowers.,,,,,,,
7377,"And the floor of the house was covered with gold, inside and out.",,,,,,,
7378,"For the way into the inmost room he made doors of olive-wood, the arch and the door supports forming a five-sided opening.",,,,,,,
7379,"On the olive-wood doors were cut designs of winged ones and palm-trees and open flowers, all of them, with the doors, plated with gold.",,,,,,,
7380,Then he made pillars of olive-wood for the way into the Temple; the pillars were square:,,,,,,,
7381,"And two folding doors of cypress-wood, with two leaves.",,,,,,,
7382,"These were ornamented with designs of winged ones and palm-trees and open flowers, plated over with gold.",,,,,,,
7383,And the inner space was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedar-wood boards.,,,,,,,
7384,"In the fourth year the base of the house was put in its place, in the month Ziv.",,,,,,,
7385,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the building of the house was complete in every detail, as it had been designed. So he was seven years building it.Solomon was thirteen years building a house for himself till it was",omplete.,,,,,,
7386,"And he made the house of the Woods of Lebanon, which was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high, resting on four lines of cedar-wood pillars with cedar- woodsupportsonthepillars.",,,,,,,
7387,"Anditwascoveredwithcedarovertheforty-fivesupports which were on the pillars, fifteen in a line.",,,,,,,
7388,"There were three lines of window-frames, window facing window in every line.",,,,,,,
7389,"And all the doors and windows had square frames, with the windows facing one another in three lines.",,,,,,,
7390,"And he made a covered room of pillars, fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, and ... with steps before it.",,,,,,,
7391,Then he made a covered room for his high seat when he gave decisions; this was the covered room of judging; it was covered with cedar-wood from floor to roof.,,,,,,,
7392,"And the house for his living-place, the other open square in the covered room, was made in the same way. And then he made a house like it for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken as his wife.",,,,,,,
7393,"All these buildings were made, inside and out, from base to crowning stone, and outside to the great walled square, of highly priced stone, cut to different sizes with cutting-instruments.",,,,,,,
7394,"And the base was of great masses of highly priced stone, some ten cubits and some eight cubits square.",,,,,,,
7395,"Overhead were highly priced stones cut to measure, and cedar-wood.",,,,,,,
7396,"The great outer square all round was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedar-wood boards, round about the open square inside the house of the Lord and the covered room of the king's house.",,,,,,,
7397,Then King Solomon sent and got Hiram from Tyre.,,,,,,,
7398,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; he was full of wisdom and knowledge and an expert worker in brass. He came to King Solomon and did all his work for him.",,,,,,,
7399,"He it was who made the two brass pillars; the first pillar was eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits went round it; and the second was the same.",,,,,,,
7400,"And he made the two crowns to be put on the tops of the pillars, of brass made soft in the fire; the crowns were five cubits high.",,,,,,,
7401,"There were nets of open-work for the crowns on the tops of the pillars, a net of open-work for one and a net of open-work for the other.",,,,,,,
7402,"And he made ornaments of apples; and two lines of apples all round over the network, covering the crowns of the pillars, the two crowns in the same way.",,,,,,,
7403,"The crowns on the tops of the pillars were ornamented with a design of flowers, and were four cubits across.",,,,,,,
7404,"And there were crowns on the two pillars near the round part by the network, and there were two hundred apples in lines round every crown.",,,,,,,
7405,"He put up the pillars at the doorway of the Temple, naming the one on the right Jachin, and that on the left Boaz.",,,,,,,
7406,The tops of the pillars had a design of flowers; and the work of making the pillars was complete.,,,,,,,
7407,"And he made a great metal water-vessel ten cubits across from edge to edge, five cubits high and thirty cubits round.",,,,,,,
7408,"And under the edge of it, circling it all round for ten cubits, were two lines of flower buds, made together with it from liquid metal.",,,,,,,
7409,"It was supported on twelve oxen, with their back parts turned to the middle of it, three of them facing to the north, three to the west, three to the south, and three to the east; the vessel was resting on top of them.",,,,,,,
7410,"It was as thick as a man's open hand, and was curved like the edge of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it would take two thousand baths.",,,,,,,
7411,"And he made ten wheeled bases of brass; every one four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.",,,,,,,
7412,"And the bases were made in this way; their sides were square, fixed in a framework;",,,,,,,
7413,"And on the square sides between the frames were lions, oxen, and winged ones; and the same on the frame; and over and under the lions and the oxen and the winged ones were steps.",,,,,,,
7414,"Every base had four wheels of brass, turning on brass rods, and their four angles had angle-plates under them; the angle-plates under the base were of metal, and there were ornaments at the side of every one.",,,,,,,
7415,"The mouth of it inside the angle-plate was one cubit across; it was round like a pillar, a cubit and a half across; it had designs cut on it; the sides were square, not round.",,,,,,,
7416,"The four wheels were under the frames, and the rods on which the wheels were fixed were in the base; the wheels were a cubit and a half high.",,,,,,,
7417,"The wheels were made like carriage-wheels, the rods on which they were fixed, the parts forming their edges, their rods and the middle points of them, were all formed out of liquid metal.",,,,,,,
7418,"And there were four angle-plates at the four angles of every base, forming part of the structure of the base.",,,,,,,
7419,"And at the top of the base there was a round vessel, half a cubit high;",,,,,,,
7420,"In the spaces of the flat sides and on the frames of them, he made designs of winged ones, lions, and palm-trees, with ornamented edges all round.",,,,,,,
7421,"All the ten bases were made in this way, after the same design, of the same size and form.",,,,,,,
7422,"And he made ten brass washing-vessels, everyone taking forty baths, and measuring four cubits; one vessel was placed on every one of the ten bases.",,,,,,,
7423,"And he put the bases by the house, five on the right side and five on the left; and he put the great water-vessel on the right side of the house, to the east, facing south.",,,,,,,
7424,And Hiram made the pots and spades and the basins. So Hiram came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of the Lord:,,,,,,,
7425,"The two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars; and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars,",,,,,,,
7426,"And the four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for every network, covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars;",,,,,,,
7427,"And the ten bases, with the ten washing-vessels on them;",,,,,,,
7428,"And the great water-vessel, with the twelve oxen under it;",,,,,,,
7429,"And the pots and the spades and the basins; all the vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass.",,,,,,,
7430,"He made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, at the way across the river, at Adama, between Succoth and Zarethan.",,,,,,,
7431,"The weight of all these vessels was not measured, because there was such a number of them; it was not possible to get the weight of the brass.",,,,,,,
7432,And Solomon had all the vessels made for use in the house of the Lord: the altar of gold and the gold table on which the holy bread was placed;,,,,,,,
7433,"And the supports for the lights, five on the right side and five on the left before the inmost room, of clear gold; and the flowers and the lights and all the instruments of gold;",,,,,,,
7434,"And the cups and the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, all of gold; and the pins on which the doors were turned, the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, all of gold.",,,,,,,
7435,"So all the work King Solomon had done in the house of the Lord was complete. Then Solomon took the holy things which David his father had given, the silver and the gold and all the vessels, and put them in the store-houses of the house of the Lord.Then S",lomon sent f,r a,l,the,resp,nsi,le me
7436,"And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, the seventh month.",,,,,,,
7437,"And all the responsible men of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.",,,,,,,
7438,"They took up the ark of the Lord, and the Tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent; all these the priests and the Levites took up.",,,,,,,
7439,"And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there, were with him before the ark, making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered.",,,,,,,
7440,"And the priests took the ark of the agreement of the Lord and put it in its place in the inner room of the house, in the most holy place, under the wings of the winged ones.",,,,,,,
7441,"For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was, covering the ark and its rods.",,,,,,,
7442,"The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place, in front of the inmost room; but they were not seen from outside: and there they are to this day.",,,,,,,
7443,"There was nothing in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
7444,"Now when the priests had come out of the holy place, the house of the Lord was full of the cloud,",,,,,,,
7445,"So that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud, for the house of the Lord was full of the glory of the Lord.",,,,,,,
7446,"Then Solomon said, O Lord, to the sun you have given the heaven for a living-place, but your living-place was not seen by men;",,,,,,,
7447,"So I have made for you a living-place, a house in which you may be for ever present.",,,,,,,
7448,"Then, turning his face about, the king gave a blessing to all the men of Israel; and they were all on their feet together.",,,,,,,
7449,"And he said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who himself gave his word to David my father, and with his strong hand has made his word come true, saying,",,,,,,,
7450,"From the day when I took my people Israel out of Egypt, no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting-place of my name; but I made selection of David to be king over my people Israel.",,,,,,,
7451,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to put up a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
7452,"But the Lord said to David my father, You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name;",,,,,,,
7453,"But you yourself will not be the builder of my house; but your son, the offspring of your body, he it is who will put up a house for my name.",,,,,,,
7454,"And the Lord has made his word come true; for I have taken my father David's place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel, as the Lord gave his word; and I have made a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
7455,"In it I have made a place for the ark, in which is the agreement which the Lord made with our fathers, when he took them out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
7456,"Then Solomon took his place before the altar of the Lord, all the men of Israel being present, and stretching out his hands to heaven,",,,,,,,
7457,"Said, O Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on the earth; keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants, while they go in your ways with all their hearts.",,,,,,,
7458,"And you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David, my father; with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day.",,,,,,,
7459,"So now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let your word to your servant David, my father, come true, when you said, You will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel before me, if only your children give attention to their w","ys, walking",efo,e,me,s yo,ha,e don
7460,"So now, O God of Israel, it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant David, my father.",,,,,,,
7461,"But is it truly possible that God may be housed on earth? see, heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting-place; how much less this house which I have made!",,,,,,,
7462,"Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant, O Lord God, and to his prayer for grace; give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day;",,,,,,,
7463,"That your eyes may be open to this house night and day, to this place of which you have said, My name will be there; hearing the prayer which your servant may make, turning to this place.",,,,,,,
7464,"Give ear to the prayers of your servant, and the prayers of your people Israel, when they make their prayers, turning to this place; give ear in heaven your living-place, and hearing, have mercy.",,,,,,,
7465,"If a man does wrong to his neighbour, and has to take an oath, and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house:",,,,,,,
7466,"Then let your ear be open in heaven, and be the judge of your servants, giving your decision against the wrongdoer, so that punishment for his sins may come on his head; and, by your decision, keeping from evil him who has done no wrong.",,,,,,,
7467,"When your people Israel are overcome in war, because of their sin against you; if they are turned to you again, honouring your name, making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house:",,,,,,,
7468,"Then give ear in heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers.",,,,,,,
7469,"When heaven is shut up and there is no rain, because of their sin against you; if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place, honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them:",,,,,,,
7470,"Then give ear in heaven, so that the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, may have forgiveness, when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go; and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritag",.,,,,,,
7471,"If there is no food in the land, or if there is disease, or if the fruits of the earth are damaged through heat or water, locust or worm; if their towns are shut in by their attackers; whatever trouble, whatever disease there may be:",,,,,,,
7472,"Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, whatever his trouble may be, whose hands are stretched out to this house:",,,,,,,
7473,"Give ear in heaven your living-place, acting in mercy; and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you, the reward of all his ways; for you, and you only, have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men:",,,,,,,
7474,So that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers.,,,,,,,
7475,"And as for the man from a strange land, who is not of your people Israel; when he comes from a far country because of the glory of your name:",,,,,,,
7476,"(For they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out-stretched arm;) when he comes to make his prayer, turning to this house:",,,,,,,
7477,"Give ear in heaven your living-place, and give him his desire, whatever it may be; so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name, worshipping you as do your people Israel, and that they may see that this house which I have put up i",truly named,by,o,r n,me.,,
7478,"If your people go out to war against their attackers, by whatever way you may send them, if they make their prayer to the Lord, turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have made for your name:",,,,,,,
7479,"Give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace, and see right done to them.",,,,,,,
7480,"If they do wrong against you, (for no man is without sin,) and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them, so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land, far off or near;",,,,,,,
7481,"And if they take thought, in the land where they are prisoners, and are turned again to you, crying out in prayer to you in that land, and saying, We are sinners, we have done wrong, we have done evil;",,,,,,,
7482,"And with all their heart and soul are turned again to you, in the land of those who took them prisoners, and make their prayer to you, turning their eyes to this land which you gave to their fathers, and to the town which you took for yourself, and the h",use which I,ade,f,r y,ur n,me:,

7484,"Answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you, and overlooking the evil which they have done against you; let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them, and have pity on them;",,,,,,,
7485,"For they are your people and your heritage, which you took out of Egypt, out of the iron fireplace;",,,,,,,
7486,"Let your eyes be open to your servant's prayer for grace and to the prayer of your people Israel, hearing them when their cry comes to you.",,,,,,,
7487,"For you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth, to be your heritage, as you said by Moses your servant, when you took our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.",,,,,,,
7488,"Then Solomon, after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the Lord, got up from his knees before the altar of the Lord, where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven;",,,,,,,
7489,"And, getting on his feet, he gave a blessing to all the men of Israel, saying with a loud voice,",,,,,,,
7490,"Praise be to the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel, as he gave them his word to do; every word of all his oath, which he gave by the hand of Moses his servant, has come true.",,,,,,,
7491,Now may the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers; let him never go away from us or give us up;,,,,,,,
7492,"Turning our hearts to himself, guiding us to go in all his ways, to keep his orders and his laws and his decisions, which he gave to our fathers.",,,,,,,
7493,"And may these my words, the words of my prayer to the Lord, be before the Lord our God day and night, so that he may see right done to his servant and to his people Israel, day by day as we have need.",,,,,,,
7494,"So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the Lord is God, and there is no other.",,,,,,,
7495,"Then let your hearts be without sin before the Lord our God, walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day.",,,,,,,
7496,"Now the king, and all Israel with him, were making offerings before the Lord.",,,,,,,
7497,"And Solomon gave to the Lord for peace-offerings, twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel kept the feast of the opening of the Lord's house.",,,,,,,
7498,"The same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord, offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace-offerings; for there was not room on the brass altar of the Lord for the bu",ned offering,an,,he,eal,ffe,ings
7499,"So Solomon and all Israel with him, a very great meeting, (for the people had come together from the way into Hamath to the river of Egypt,) kept the feast at that time before the Lord our God, for two weeks, even fourteen days.",,,,,,,
7500,"And on the eighth day he sent the people away, and, blessing the king, they went to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts, because of all the good which the Lord had done to David his servant and to Israel his people.Now when Solomon came to t",e end of bui,din,,he,ouse,of,he Lo
7501,"The Lord came to him again in a vision, as he had done at Gibeon;",,,,,,,
7502,"And the Lord said to him, Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears: I have made holy this house which you have made, and I have put my name there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there at all times.",,,,,,,
7503,"As for you, if you will go on your way before me, as David your father did, uprightly and with a true heart, doing what I have given you orders to do, keeping my laws and my decisions;",,,,,,,
7504,"Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be king in Israel.",,,,,,,
7505,"But if you are turned from my ways, you or your children, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship:",,,,,,,
7506,"Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for myself, I will put away from before my eyes; and Israel will be a public example, and a word of shame among all peoples.",,,,,,,
7507,"And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds; and they will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house?",,,,,,,
7508,"And their answer will be, Because they were turned away from the Lord their God, who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt; they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants: that is why the Lord has sent all this",vil on them.,,,,,,
7509,"Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king's house,",,,,,,,
7510,"(Hiram, king of Tyre, had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold, as much as he had need of,) King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee.",,,,,,,
7511,"But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.",,,,,,,
7512,"And he said, What sort of towns are these which you have given me, my brother? So they were named the land of Cabul, to this day.",,,,,,,
7513,And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.,,,,,,,
7514,"Now, this was the way of Solomon's system of forced work for the building of the Lord's house and of the king's house, and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer. ...",,,,,,,
7515,"Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came and took Gezer, burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town, and he gave it for a bride-offering to his daughter, Solomon's wife. ...",,,,,,,
7516,"... and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Beth-horon the lower,",,,,,,,
7517,"And Baalath and Tamar in the waste land, in that land;",,,,,,,
7518,"And all the store-towns and the towns which Solomon had for his war-carriages and for his horsemen, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule.",,,,,,,
7519,"As for the rest of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not children of Israel;",,,,,,,
7520,"Their children who were still in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction, them did Solomon put to forced work, to this day.",,,,,,,
7521,"But Solomon did not put the children of Israel to forced work; they were the men of war, his servants, his captains, and his chiefs, captains of his war-carriages and of his horsemen.",,,,,,,
7522,"These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, in authority over the people who did the work.",,,,,,,
7523,At that time Solomon made Pharaoh's daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her: then he made the Millo.,,,,,,,
7524,"Three times in the year it was Solomon's way to give burned offerings and peace-offerings on the altar he had made to the Lord, causing his fire-offering to go up on the altar before the Lord.",,,,,,,
7525,"And King Solomon made a sea-force of ships in Ezion-geber, by Eloth, on the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.",,,,,,,
7526,"Hiram sent his servants, who were experienced seamen, in the sea-force with Solomon's men.",,,,,,,
7527,"And they came to Ophir, where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and took it back to King Solomon.Now the queen of Sheba, hearing great things of Solomon, came to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions.",,,,,,,
7528,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels weighted down with spices, and stores of gold and jewels: and when she came to Solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind.",,,,,,,
7529,And Solomon gave her answers to all her questions; there was no secret which the king did not make clear to her.,,,,,,,
7530,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had made,",,,,,,,
7531,"And the food at his table, and all his servants seated there, and those who were waiting on him in their places, and their robes, and his wine-servants, and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.",,,,,,,
7532,"And she said to the king, The account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true.",,,,,,,
7533,"But I had no faith in what was said about you, till I came and saw for myself; and now I see that it was not half the story; your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said.",,,,,,,
7534,"Happy are your wives, happy are these your servants whose place is ever before you, hearing your words of wisdom.",,,,,,,
7535,"May the Lord your God be praised, whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of the kingdom of Israel; because the Lord's love for Israel is eternal, he has made you king, to be their judge in righteousness.",,,,,,,
7536,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a great store of spices and jewels: never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.",,,,,,,
7537,"And the sea-force of Hiram, in addition to gold from Ophir, came back with much sandal-wood and jewels.",,,,,,,
7538,"And from the sandal-wood the king made pillars for the house of the Lord, and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody: never has such sandal-wood been seen to this day.",,,,,,,
7539,"And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart. So she went back to her country, she and her servants.",,,,,,,
7540,Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents;,,,,,,,
7541,"In addition to what came to him from the business of the traders, and from all the kings of the Arabians, and from the rulers of the country.",,,,,,,
7542,"And Solomon made two hundred body- covers of hammered gold, every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it.",,,,,,,
7543,"And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, with three pounds of gold in every cover: and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon.",,,,,,,
7544,"Then the king made a great ivory seat, plated with the best gold.",,,,,,,
7545,"There were six steps going up to it, and the top of it was round at the back, there were arms on the two sides of the seat, and two lions by the side of the arms;",,,,,,,
7546,And twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom.,,,,,,,
7547,"And all King Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold; not one was of silver, for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of King Solomon.",,,,,,,
7548,For the king had Tarshish-ships at sea with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the Tarshish-ships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks.,,,,,,,
7549,And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.,,,,,,,
7550,"And from all over the earth they came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.",,,,,,,
7551,"And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses, and beasts of transport, regularly year by year.",,,,,,,
7552,"And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he kept, some in the carriage- towns and some with the king at Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
7553,And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number.,,,,,,,
7554,And Solomon's horses came from Egypt and from Kue; the king's traders got them at a price from Kue.,,,,,,,
7555,"A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.Now a number of strange women were loved by Solomon, wom",n of the Moa,ite,",",Amm,nite,", E",omite
7556,"The nations of which the Lord had said to the children of Israel, You are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you; or they will certainly make you go after their gods: to these Solomon was united in love.",,,,,,,
7557,"He had seven hundred wives, daughters of kings, and three hundred other wives; and through his wives his heart was turned away.",,,,,,,
7558,"For it came about that when Solomon was old, his heart was turned away to other gods by his wives; and his heart was no longer true to the Lord his God as the heart of his father David had been.",,,,,,,
7559,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Milcom, the disgusting god of the Ammonites.",,,,,,,
7560,"And Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not walking in the Lord's ways with all his heart as David his father did.",,,,,,,
7561,"Then Solomon put up a high place for Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, in the mountain before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the disgusting god worshipped by the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,
7562,"And so he did for all his strange wives, who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods.",,,,,,,
7563,"And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had twice come to him in a vision;",,,,,,,
7564,"And had given him orders about this very thing, that he was not to go after other gods; but he did not keep the orders of the Lord.",,,,,,,
7565,"So the Lord said to Solomon, Because you have done this, and have not kept my agreement and my laws, which I gave you, I will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant.",,,,,,,
7566,"I will not do it in your life-time, because of your father David, but I will take it from your son.",,,,,,,
7567,"Still I will not take all the kingdom from him; but I will give one tribe to your son, because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem, the town of my selection.",,,,,,,
7568,So the Lord sent Hadad the Edomite to make trouble for Solomon: he was of the king's seed in Edom.,,,,,,,
7569,"And when David had sent destruction on Edom, and Joab, the captain of the army, had gone to put the dead into the earth, and had put to death every male in Edom;",,,,,,,
7570,(For Joab and all Israel were there six months till every male in Edom had been cut off;),,,,,,,
7571,"Hadad, being still a young boy, went in flight to Egypt, with certain Edomites, servants of his father;",,,,,,,
7572,"And they went on from Midian and came to Paran; and, taking men from Paran with them, they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who gave him a house and gave orders for his food and gave him land.",,,,,,,
7573,"Now Hadad was very pleasing to Pharaoh, so that he gave him the sister of his wife, Tahpenes the queen, for his wife.",,,,,,,
7574,"And the sister of Tahpenes had a son by him, Genubath, whom Tahpenes took care of in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was living in Pharaoh's house among Pharaoh's sons.",,,,,,,
7575,"Now when Hadad had news in Egypt that David had been put to rest with his fathers, and that Joab, the captain of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, Send me back to my country.",,,,,,,
7576,"But Pharaoh said to him, What have you been short of while you have been with me, that you are desiring to go back to your country? And he said, Nothing; but even so, send me back.",,,,,,,
7577,"And God sent another trouble-maker, Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had gone in flight from his lord, Hadadezer, king of Zobah:",,,,,,,
7578,He got some men together and made himself captain of a band of outlaws; and went to Damascus and became king there.,,,,,,,
7579,He was a trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon. And this is the damage Hadad did: he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom.,,,,,,,
7580,"And there was Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow; and his hand was lifted up against the king.",,,,,,,
7581,The way in which his hand came to be lifted up against the king was this: Solomon was building the Millo and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David;,,,,,,,
7582,And Jeroboam was an able and responsible man; and Solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of Joseph.,,,,,,,
7583,"Now at that time, when Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite came across him on the road; now Ahijah had put on a new robe; and the two of them were by themselves in the open country.",,,,,,,
7584,"And Ahijah took his new robe in his hands, parting it violently into twelve.",,,,,,,
7585,"And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten of the parts, for this is what the Lord has said: See, I will take the kingdom away from Solomon by force, and will give ten tribes to you;",,,,,,,
7586,"(But one tribe will be his, because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem, the town which, out of all the tribes of Israel, I have made mine,)",,,,,,,
7587,"Because they are turned away from me to the worship of Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Chemosh, the god of Moab, and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites; they have not been walking in my ways or doing what is right in my eyes or keeping my laws",and my decis,ons,a,hi,fat,er,avid
7588,"But I will not take the kingdom from him; I will let him be king all the days of his life, because of David my servant, in whom I took delight because he kept my orders and my laws.",,,,,,,
7589,"But I will take the kingdom from his son, and give it to you.",,,,,,,
7590,"And one tribe I will give to his son, so that David my servant may have a light for ever burning before me in Jerusalem, the town which I have made mine to put my name there.",,,,,,,
7591,"And you I will take, and you will be king over Israel, ruling over whatever is the desire of your soul.",,,,,,,
7592,"And if you give attention to the orders I give you, walking in my ways and doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my laws and my orders as David my servant did; then I will be with you, building up for you a safe house, as I did for David, and I will",give Israel,o y,u,,,,
7593,"(So that I may send trouble for this on the seed of David, but not for ever.)",,,,,,,
7594,"And Solomon was looking for a chance to put Jeroboam to death; but he went in flight to Egypt, to Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.",,,,,,,
7595,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all he did, and his wisdom, are they not recorded in the book of the acts of Solomon?",,,,,,,
7596,And the time Solomon was king in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.,,,,,,,
7597,"And Solomon went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David his father: and Solomon went to rest with his fathers and Rehoboam his son became king in his place.And Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had come togethe",to make him,kin,",",,,,
7598,"And, hearing of it, Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was still in Egypt, where he had gone in flight from Solomon, and was living there, came back to his town Zeredah, in the hill-country of Ephraim;",,,,,,,
7599,"And all the men of Israel came to Rehoboam and said,",,,,,,,
7600,"Your father put a hard yoke on us: if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel, and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard, then we will be your servants.",,,,,,,
7601,"And he said to them, Go away for three days and then come back to me again. So the people went away.",,,,,,,
7602,"Then King Rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with Solomon his father when he was living, and said, In your opinion, what answer am I to give to this people?",,,,,,,
7603,"And they said to him, If you will be a servant to this people today, caring for them and giving them a gentle answer, then they will be your servants for ever.",,,,,,,
7604,"But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men, and went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him:",,,,,,,
7605,"And said to them, What is your opinion? What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me, Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us?",,,,,,,
7606,"And the young men of his generation said to him, This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying, Your father put a hard yoke on us; will you make it less? say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's body;",,,,,,,
7607,"If my father put a hard yoke on you, I will make it harder: my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give you blows with snakes.",,,,,,,
7608,"So all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had given orders, saying, Come back to me the third day.",,,,,,,
7609,"And the king gave them a rough answer, giving no attention to the suggestion of the old men;",,,,,,,
7610,"But giving them the answer put forward by the young men, saying, My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder; my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.",,,,,,,
7611,"So the king did not give ear to the people; and this came about by the purpose of the Lord, so that what he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat, might be effected.",,,,,,,
7612,"And when all Israel saw that the king would give no attention to them, the people in answer said to the king, What part have we in David? what is our heritage in the son of Jesse? to your tents, O Israel; now see to your people, David. So Israel went awa",to their te,ts.,,,,,
7613,(But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.),,,,,,,
7614,"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, the overseer of the forced work; and he was stoned to death by all Israel. And King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
7615,So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day.,,,,,,,
7616,"Now when all Israel had news that Jeroboam had come back, they sent for him to come before the meeting of the people, and made him king over Israel: not one of them was joined to the family of David but only the tribe of Judah.",,,,,,,
7617,"When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he got together all the men of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting-men, to make war against Israel and get the kingdom back for Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.",,,,,,,
7618,"But the word of God came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,",,,,,,,
7619,"Say to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the men of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people:",,,,,,,
7620,"The Lord has said, You are not to go to war against your brothers, the children of Israel; go back, every man to his house, because this thing is my purpose. So they gave ear to the word of the Lord, and went back, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
7621,"Then Jeroboam made the town of Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim a strong place, and was living there; and from there he went out and did the same to Penuel.",,,,,,,
7622,"And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will go back to the family of David:",,,,,,,
7623,"If the people go up to make offerings in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, their heart will be turned again to their lord, to Rehoboam, king of Judah; and they will put me to death and go back to Rehoboam, king of Judah.",,,,,,,
7624,"So after taking thought the king made two oxen of gold; and he said to the people, You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough; see! these are your gods, O Israel, who took you out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
7625,And he put one in Beth-el and the other in Dan.,,,,,,,
7626,"And this became a sin in Israel; for the people went to give worship to the one at Beth-el, and to the other at Dan.",,,,,,,
7627,"And he made places for worship at the high places, and made priests, who were not Levites, from among all the people.",,,,,,,
7628,"And Jeroboam gave orders for a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is kept in Judah, and he went up to the altar. And in the same way, in Beth-el, he gave offerings to the oxen which he had made, placing in",eth-el the p,ies,s,of,he h,gh,laces
7629,"He went up to the altar he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month fixed by him at his pleasure; and he gave orders for a feast for the people of Israel, and went up to the altar, and there he made the smoke of his offerin",s go up.Then,a m,n,of,od c,me,rom J
7630,"And by the order of the Lord he made an outcry against the altar, saying, O altar, altar, the Lord has said, From the seed of David will come a child, named Josiah, and on you he will put to death the priests of the high places, who are burning offerings","on you, and",en',,one,wil,be,burne
7631,"The same day he gave them a sign, saying, This is the sign which the Lord has given: See, the altar will be broken and the burned waste on it overturned.",,,,,,,
7632,"Then the king, hearing the man of God crying out against the altar at Beth-el, put out his hand from the altar, saying, Take him prisoner. And his hand, stretched out against him, became dead, and he had no power of pulling it back.",,,,,,,
7633,And the altar was broken and the burned waste on it overturned; this was the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.,,,,,,,
7634,"Then the king made answer and said to the man of God, Make a prayer now for the grace of the Lord your God, and for me, that my hand may be made well. And in answer to the prayer of the man of God, the king's hand was made well again, as it was before.",,,,,,,
7635,"And the king said to the man of God, Come with me to my house for food and rest, and I will give you a reward.",,,,,,,
7636,"But the man of God said to the king, Even if you gave me half of all you have, I would not go in with you, and I would not take food or a drink of water in this place;",,,,,,,
7637,"For so I was ordered by the word of the Lord, who said, You are not to take food or a drink of water, and you are not to go back the way you came.",,,,,,,
7638,"So he went another way, and not by the way he came to Beth-el.",,,,,,,
7639,"Now there was an old prophet living in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and gave him word of all the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and they gave their father an account of the words he had said to the king.",,,,,,,
7640,"Then their father said to them, Which way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God who came from Judah had gone.",,,,,,,
7641,"So the prophet said to his sons, Make ready an ass for me. So they made an ass ready, and he got on it,",,,,,,,
7642,"And went after the man of God, and came up with him while he was seated under an oak-tree. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.",,,,,,,
7643,"Then he said to him, Come back to the house with me and have a meal.",,,,,,,
7644,"But he said, I may not go back with you or go into your house; and I will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place;",,,,,,,
7645,"For the Lord said to me, You are not to take food or water there, or go back again by the way you came.",,,,,,,
7646,"Then he said to him, I am a prophet like you; and an angel said to me by the word of the Lord, Take him back with you and give him food and water. But he said false words to him.",,,,,,,
7647,"So he went back with him, and had a meal in his house and a drink of water.",,,,,,,
7648,"But while they were seated at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had taken him back;",,,,,,,
7649,"And crying out to the man of God who came from Judah, he said, The Lord says, Because you have gone against the voice of the Lord, and have not done as you were ordered by the Lord,",,,,,,,
7650,"But have come back, and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water; your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers.",,,,,,,
7651,"Now after the meal he made ready the ass for him, for the prophet whom he had taken back.",,,,,,,
7652,"And he went on his way; but on the road a lion came rushing at him and put him to death; and his dead body was stretched in the road with the ass by its side, and the lion was there by the body.",,,,,,,
7653,"And some men, going by, saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side; and they came and gave news of it in the town where the old prophet was living.",,,,,,,
7654,"Then the prophet who had made him come back, hearing it, said, It is the man of God, who went against the word of the Lord; that is why the Lord has given him to the lion to be wounded to death, as the Lord said.",,,,,,,
7655,"And he said to his sons, Make ready the ass for me. And they did so.",,,,,,,
7656,And he went and saw the dead body stretched out in the road with the ass and the lion by its side: the lion had not taken the body for its food or done any damage to the ass.,,,,,,,
7657,Then the prophet took up the body of the man of God and put it on the ass and took it back; and he came to the town to put the body to rest with weeping.,,,,,,,
7658,"And he put the body in the resting-place made ready for himself, weeping and sorrowing over it, saying, O my brother!",,,,,,,
7659,"And when he had put it to rest, he said to his sons, When I am dead, then you are to put my body into the earth with the body of this man of God, and put me by his bones so that my bones may be kept safe with his bones.",,,,,,,
7660,"For the outcry he made by the word of the Lord against the altar in Beth-el and against all the houses of the high places in the towns of Samaria, will certainly come about.",,,,,,,
7661,"After this Jeroboam, not turning back from his evil ways, still made priests for his altars from among all the people; he made a priest of anyone desiring it, so that there might be priests of the high places.",,,,,,,
7662,"And this became a sin in the family of Jeroboam, causing it to be cut off and sent to destruction from the face of the earth.At that time Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, became ill.",,,,,,,
7663,"And Jeroboam said to his wife, Now come, put on different clothing so that you may not seem to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; see, Ahijah is there, the prophet who said I would be king over this people.",,,,,,,
7664,"And take with you ten cakes of bread and dry cakes and a pot of honey, and go to him: he will give you word of what is to become of the child.",,,,,,,
7665,"So Jeroboam's wife did so, and got up and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was unable to see, because he was very old.",,,,,,,
7666,"And the Lord had said to Ahijah, The wife of Jeroboam is coming to get news from you about her son, who is ill; give her such and such an answer; for she will make herself seem to be another woman.",,,,,,,
7667,"Then Ahijah, hearing the sound of her footsteps coming in at the door, said, Come in, O wife of Jeroboam; why do you make yourself seem like another? for I am sent to you with bitter news.",,,,,,,
7668,"Go, say to Jeroboam, These are the words of the Lord, the God of Israel: Though I took you from among the people, lifting you up to be a ruler over my people Israel,",,,,,,,
7669,"And took the kingdom away by force from the seed of David and gave it to you, you have not been like my servant David, who kept my orders, and was true to me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.",,,,,,,
7670,"But you have done evil more than any before you, and have made for yourself other gods, and images of metal, moving me to wrath, and turning your back on me.",,,,,,,
7671,"So I will send evil on the line of Jeroboam, cutting off from his family every male child, those who are shut up and those who go free in Israel; the family of Jeroboam will be brushed away like a man brushing away waste till it is all gone.",,,,,,,
7672,"Those of the family of Jeroboam who come to death in the town, will become food for the dogs; and those on whom death comes in the open country, will be food for the birds of the air; for the Lord has said it.",,,,,,,
7673,"Up, then! go back to your house; and in the hour when your feet go into the town, the death of the child will take place.",,,,,,,
7674,"And all Israel will put his body to rest, weeping over him, because he only of the family of Jeroboam will be put into his resting-place in the earth; for of all the family of Jeroboam, in him only has the Lord, the God of Israel, seen some good.",,,,,,,
7675,And the Lord will put up a king over Israel who will send destruction on the family of Jeroboam in that day;,,,,,,,
7676,"And even now the hand of the Lord has come down on Israel, shaking it like a river-grass in the water; and, uprooting Israel from this good land, which he gave to their fathers, he will send them this way and that on the other side of the River; because",hey have mad,fo,,hem,elve,im,"ges,"
7677,And he will give Israel up because of the sins which Jeroboam has done and made Israel do.,,,,,,,
7678,"Then Jeroboam's wife got up and went away and came to Tirzah; and when she came to the doorway of the house, death came to the child.",,,,,,,
7679,"And all Israel put his body to rest, weeping over him, as the Lord had said by his servant Ahijah the prophet.",,,,,,,
7680,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he became king, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.",,,,,,,
7681,"And Jeroboam was king for twenty-two years, and was put to rest with his fathers, and Nadab his son became king in his place.",,,,,,,
7682,"And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was king in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was king for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; his",other's name,was,N,ama,", an",Amm,nite
7683,"And Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and made him more angry than their fathers had done by their sins.",,,,,,,
7684,For they made high places and upright stones and wood pillars on every high hill and under every green tree;,,,,,,,
7685,"And more than this, there were those in the land who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods, doing the same disgusting crimes as the nations which the Lord had sent out before the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
7686,"Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem;",,,,,,,
7687,"And took away all the stored wealth from the house of the Lord, and from the king's house, and all the gold body-covers which Solomon had made.",,,,,,,
7688,"So in their place King Rehoboam had other body-covers made of brass, and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the king's house.",,,,,,,
7689,"And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room.",,,,,,,
7690,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?",,,,,,,
7691,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.,,,,,,,
7692,"And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. And Abijam his son became king in his place.Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, the so","of Nebat, A",ija,,eca,e ki,g o,er Ju

7694,"And he did the same sins which his father had done before him: his heart was not completely true to the Lord his God, like the heart of David his father.",,,,,,,
7695,"But because of David, the Lord gave him a light in Jerusalem, making his sons king after him, so that Jerusalem might be safe;",,,,,,,
7696,"Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, and never in all his life went against his orders, but only in the question of Uriah the Hittite.",,,,,,,
7697,...,,,,,,,
7698,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.",,,,,,,
7699,"Then Abijam went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David: and Asa his son became king in his place.",,,,,,,
7700,"In the twentieth year that Jeroboam was king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.",,,,,,,
7701,"And he was king for forty-one years in Jerusalem; his mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.",,,,,,,
7702,"Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as David his father did.",,,,,,,
7703,"Those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods he sent out of the country, and he took away all the images which his fathers had made.",,,,,,,
7704,"And he would not let Maacah his mother be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had the image cut down and burned by the stream Kidron.",,,,,,,
7705,"The high places, however, were not taken away: but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life.",,,,,,,
7706,"He took into the house of the Lord all the things which his father had made holy, and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels.",,,,,,,
7707,"Now there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.",,,,,,,
7708,"And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah, so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah.",,,,,,,
7709,"Then Asa took all the silver and gold which was still stored in the Lord's house, and in the king's house, and sent them, in the care of his servants, to Ben- hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Rezon, king of Aram, at Damascus, saying,",,,,,,,
7710,"Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father: see, I have sent you an offering of silver and gold; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may give up attacking me.",,,,,,,
7711,"So Ben-hadad did as King Asa said, and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel, attacking Ijon and Dan and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth as far as all the land of Naphtali.",,,,,,,
7712,"And Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and was living in Tirzah.",,,,,,,
7713,"Then King Asa got all Judah together, making every man come; and they took away the stones and the wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and King Asa made use of them for building Geba in the land of Benjamin, and Mizpah.",,,,,,,
7714,"Now the rest of the acts of Asa, and his power, and all he did, and the towns of which he was the builder, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? But when he was old he had a disease of the feet.",,,,,,,
7715,So Asa went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place.,,,,,,,
7716,"Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year that Asa was king of Judah; and he was king of Israel for two years.",,,,,,,
7717,"He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the evil ways of his father, and the sin which he did and made Israel do.",,,,,,,
7718,"And Baasha, the son of Ahijah, of the family of Issachar, made a secret design against him, attacking him at Gibbethon, a town of the Philistines; for Nadab and the armies of Israel were making war on Gibbethon.",,,,,,,
7719,"In the third year of the rule of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha put him to death, and became king in his place.",,,,,,,
7720,"And straight away when he became king, he sent destruction on all the offspring of Jeroboam; there was not one living person of all the family of Jeroboam whom he did not put to death, so the word of the Lord, which he said by his servant Ahijah the Shil","nite, came a",out,,,,,
7721,"Because of the sins which Jeroboam did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath.",,,,,,,
7722,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?",,,,,,,
7723,"And there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.",,,,,,,
7724,"In the third year of the rule of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and was king for twenty-four years.",,,,,,,
7725,"He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the evil ways of Jeroboam and the sin which he made Israel do.And the word of the Lord came to Jehu, son of Hanani, protesting against Baasha and saying,",,,,,,,
7726,"Because I took you up out of the dust, and made you ruler over my people Israel; and you have gone in the ways of Jeroboam, and made my people Israel do evil, moving me to wrath by their sins;",,,,,,,
7727,"Truly, I will see that Baasha and all his family are completely brushed away; I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.",,,,,,,
7728,"Anyone of the family of Baasha who comes to death in the town, will become food for the dogs; and he to whom death comes in the open country, will be food for the birds of the air.",,,,,,,
7729,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?",,,,,,,
7730,"And Baasha went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth at Tirzah; and Elah his son became king in his place.",,,,,,,
7731,"And the Lord sent his word against Baasha and his family by the mouth of the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, because of all the evil he did in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath by the work of his hands, because he was like the family of Jeroboam",and because,he,u,it,to d,ath,
7732,"In the twenty-sixth year that Asa was king of Judah, Elah, the son of Baasha, became king of Israel in Tirzah, and he was king for two years.",,,,,,,
7733,"And his servant Zimri, captain of half his war-carriages, made secret designs against him: now he was in Tirzah, drinking hard in the house of Arza, controller of the king's house in Tirzah.",,,,,,,
7734,"And Zimri went in and made an attack on him and put him to death, in the twenty-seventh year that Asa was king of Judah, and made himself king in his place.",,,,,,,
7735,"And straight away when he became king and took his place on the seat of the kingdom, he put to death all the family of Baasha: not one male child of his relations or his friends kept his life.",,,,,,,
7736,"So Zimri put to death all the family of Baasha, so that the word which the Lord said against him by the mouth of Jehu the prophet came about;",,,,,,,
7737,"Because of all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath by their foolish acts.",,,,,,,
7738,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?",,,,,,,
7739,"In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, Zimri was king for seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were attacking Gibbethon in the land of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
7740,"And news came to the people in the tents that Zimri had made a secret design and had put the king to death: so all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king that day in the tents.",,,,,,,
7741,"Then Omri went up from Gibbethon, with all the army of Israel, and they made an attack on Tirzah, shutting in the town on every side.",,,,,,,
7742,"And when Zimri saw that the town was taken, he went into the inner room of the king's house, and burning the house over his head, came to his end,",,,,,,,
7743,"Because of his sin in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, in going in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel do.",,,,,,,
7744,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the secret design he made, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?",,,,,,,
7745,"Then there was a division among the people of Israel; half the people were for making Tibni, son of Ginath, king, and half were supporting Omri.",,,,,,,
7746,"But the supporters of Omri overcame those who were on the side of Tibni, the son of Ginath; and death came to Tibni and to his brother Joram at that time: and Omri became king in the place of Tibni.",,,,,,,
7747,"In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and he was king for twelve years; for six years he was ruling in Tirzah.",,,,,,,
7748,"He got the hill Samaria from Shemer for the price of two talents of silver, and he made a town there, building it on the hill and naming it Samaria, after Shemer the owner of the hill.",,,,,,,
7749,"And Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all those before him,",,,,,,,
7750,"Copying all the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and all the sins he did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath by their foolish ways.",,,,,,,
7751,"Now the rest of the acts which Omri did, and his great power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?",,,,,,,
7752,"So Omri went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his place.",,,,,,,
7753,"In the thirty-eighth year that Asa was king of Judah, Ahab, the son of Omri, became king over Israel; and Ahab was king in Samaria for twenty-two years.",,,,,,,
7754,"And Ahab, the son of Omri, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all who went before him.",,,,,,,
7755,"And as if copying the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, was a small thing for him, he took as his wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Zidon, and became a servant and worshipper of Baal.",,,,,,,
7756,And he put up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he had made in Samaria.,,,,,,,
7757,"And Ahab made an image of Asherah and did more than all the kings of Israel before him to make the Lord, the God of Israel, angry.",,,,,,,
7758,"In his days Hiel made Jericho; he put its base in position at the price of Abiram, his oldest son, and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub; even as the Lord had said by Joshua, the son of Nun.And Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishb","in Gilead,",aid,t,Ah,"b, B",th,livi
7759,"Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying,",,,,,,,
7760,"Go from here in the direction of the east, and keep yourself in a secret place by the stream Cherith, east of Jordan.",,,,,,,
7761,"The water of the stream will be your drink, and by my orders the ravens will give you food there.",,,,,,,
7762,"So he went and did as the Lord said, living by the stream Cherith, east of Jordan.",,,,,,,
7763,And the ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening; and the water of the stream was his drink.,,,,,,,
7764,"Now after a time the stream became dry, because there was no rain in the land.",,,,,,,
7765,"Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying,",,,,,,,
7766,"Up! go now to Zarephath, in Zidon, and make your living-place there; I have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food.",,,,,,,
7767,"So he got up and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the door of the town, he saw a widow woman getting sticks together; and crying out to her he said, Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink?",,,,,,,
7768,"And when she was going to get it, he said to her, And get me with it a small bit of bread.",,,,,,,
7769,"Then she said, By the life of the Lord your God, I have nothing but a little meal in my store, and a drop of oil in the bottle; and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son, so that we may have a meal b",fore our dea,h.,,,,,
7770,"And Elijah said to her, Have no fear; go and do as you have said, but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.",,,,,,,
7771,"For this is the word of the Lord, the God of Israel: The store of meal will not come to an end, and the bottle will never be without oil, till the day when the Lord sends rain on the earth.",,,,,,,
7772,So she went and did as Elijah said; and she and he and her family had food for a long time.,,,,,,,
7773,"The store of meal did not come to an end, and the bottle was never without oil, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah.",,,,,,,
7774,"Now after this, the son of the woman of the house became ill, so ill that there was no breath in him.",,,,,,,
7775,"And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O man of God? have you come to put God in mind of my sin, and to put my son to death?",,,,,,,
7776,"And he said to her, Give your son to me. And lifting him out of her arms, he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed.",,,,,,,
7777,"And crying to the Lord he said, O Lord my God, have you sent evil even on the widow whose guest I am, by causing her son's death?",,,,,,,
7778,"And stretching herself out on the child three times, he made his prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord my God, be pleased to let this child's life come back to him again.",,,,,,,
7779,"And the Lord gave ear to the voice of Elijah, and the child's spirit came into him again, and he came back to life.",,,,,,,
7780,"And Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother and said to her, See, your son is living.",,,,,,,
7781,"Then the woman said to Elijah, Now I am certain that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is true.Now after a long time, the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go and let Ahab see you, so that I may s",nd rain on t,e e,r,h.,,,
7782,So Elijah went to let Ahab see him. Now there was no food to be had in Samaria.,,,,,,,
7783,"And Ahab sent for Obadiah, the controller of the king's house. (Now Obadiah had the fear of the Lord before him greatly;",,,,,,,
7784,"For when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred of them, and kept them secretly in a hole in the rock, fifty at a time, and gave them bread and water.)",,,,,,,
7785,"And Ahab said to Obadiah, Come, let us go through all the country, to all the fountains of water and all the rivers, and see if there is any grass to be had for the horses and the transport beasts, so that we may be able to keep some of the beasts from d",struction.,,,,,,
7786,"So they went through all the country, covering it between them; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another by himself.",,,,,,,
7787,"And while Obadiah was on his way, he came face to face with Elijah; and seeing who it was, he went down on his face and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah?",,,,,,,
7788,"And Elijah in answer said, It is I; now go and say to your lord, Elijah is here.",,,,,,,
7789,"And he said, What sin have I done, that you would give up your servant into the hand of Ahab, and be the cause of my death?",,,,,,,
7790,"By the life of the Lord your God, there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent in search of you; and when they said, He is not here; he made them take an oath that they had not seen you.",,,,,,,
7791,"And now you say, Go, say to your lord, Elijah is here.",,,,,,,
7792,"And straight away, when I have gone from you, the spirit of the Lord will take you away, I have no idea where, so that when I come and give word to Ahab, and he sees you not, he will put me to death: though I, your servant, have been a worshipper of the",ord from my,arl,e,t y,ars.,,
7793,"Has my lord not had word of what I did when Jezebel was putting the Lord's prophets to death? how I kept a hundred of them in a secret hole in the rock, fifty at a time, and gave them bread and water?",,,,,,,
7794,"And now you say, Go and say to your Lord, Elijah is here; and he will put me to death.",,,,,,,
7795,"And Elijah said, By the life of the Lord of armies, whose servant I am, I will certainly let him see me today.",,,,,,,
7796,So Obadiah went to Ahab and gave him the news; and Ahab went to see Elijah.,,,,,,,
7797,"And when he saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?",,,,,,,
7798,"Then he said in answer, I have not been troubling Israel, but you and your family; because, turning away from the orders of the Lord, you have gone after the Baals.",,,,,,,
7799,"Now send, and get Israel together before me at Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal who get their food at Jezebel's table.",,,,,,,
7800,"So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and got the prophets together at Mount Carmel.",,,,,,,
7801,"And Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go on balancing between two opinions? if the Lord is God, then give worship to him; but if Baal, give worship to him. And the people said not a word in answer.",,,,,,,
7802,"Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I, am the only living prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.",,,,,,,
7803,"Now, let them give us two oxen; and let them take one for themselves, and have it cut up, and put it on the wood, but put no fire under it; I will get the other ox ready, and put it on the wood, and put no fire under it.",,,,,,,
7804,"And do you make prayers to your god, and I will make a prayer to the Lord: and it will be clear that the one who gives an answer by fire is God. And all the people in answer said, It is well said.",,,,,,,
7805,"Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Take one ox for yourselves and get it ready first, for there are more of you; and make your prayers to your god, but put no fire under.",,,,,,,
7806,"So they took the ox which was given them, and made it ready, crying out to Baal from morning till the middle of the day, and saying, O Baal, give ear to us. But there was no voice and no answer. And they were jumping up and down before the altar they had",made.,,,,,,
7807,"And in the middle of the day, Elijah made sport of them, saying, Give louder cries, for he is a god; he may be deep in thought, or he may have gone away for some purpose, or he may be on a journey, or by chance he is sleeping and has to be made awake.",,,,,,,
7808,"So they gave loud cries, cutting themselves with knives and swords, as was their way, till the blood came streaming out all over them.",,,,,,,
7809,"And from the middle of the day they went on with their prayers till the time of the offering; but there was no voice, or any answer, or any who gave attention to them.",,,,,,,
7810,"Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all the people came near. And he put up again the altar of the Lord which had been broken down.",,,,,,,
7811,"And Elijah took twelve stones, the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the Lord had said, Israel will be your name:",,,,,,,
7812,"And with the stones he made an altar to the name of the Lord; and he made a deep drain all round the altar, great enough to take two measures of seed.",,,,,,,
7813,"And he put the wood in order, and, cutting up the ox, put it on the wood. Then he said, Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood. And he said, Do it a second time, and they did it a second time;",,,,,,,
7814,"And he said, Do it a third time, and they did it a third time.",,,,,,,
7815,"And the water went all round the altar, till the drain was full.",,,,,,,
7816,"Then at the time of the offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be seen this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things by your or",er.,,,,,,
7817,"Give me an answer, O Lord, give me an answer, so that this people may see that you are God, and that you have made their hearts come back again.",,,,,,,
7818,"Then the fire of the Lord came down, burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and drinking up the water in the drain.",,,,,,,
7819,"And when the people saw it, they all went down on their faces, and said, The Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God.",,,,,,,
7820,"And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal, let not one of them get away. So they took them, and Elijah made them go down to the stream Kishon, and put them to death there.",,,,,,,
7821,"Then Elijah said to Ahab, Up! take food and drink, for there is a sound of much rain.",,,,,,,
7822,"So Ahab went up to have food and drink, while Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he went down on the earth, putting his face between his knees.",,,,,,,
7823,"And he said to his servant, Go now, and take a look in the direction of the sea. And he went up, and after looking said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times; and he went seven times.",,,,,,,
7824,"And the seventh time he said, I see a cloud coming up out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. Then he said, Go up and say to Ahab, Get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back.",,,,,,,
7825,"And after a very little time, the heaven became black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab went in his carriage to Jezreel.",,,,,,,
7826,"And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he made himself strong, and went running before Ahab till they came to Jezreel.Ahab gave Jezebel news of all Elijah had done, and how he had put all the prophets to death with the sword.",,,,,,,
7827,"Then Jezebel sent a servant to Elijah, saying, May the gods' punishment be on me if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.",,,,,,,
7828,"And he got up, fearing for his life, and went in flight, and came to Beer- sheba in Judah, parting there from his servant;",,,,,,,
7829,"While he himself went a day's journey into the waste land, and took a seat under a broom-plant, desiring for himself only death; for he said, It is enough: now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.",,,,,,,
7830,"And stretching himself on the earth, he went to sleep under the broom-plant; but an angel, touching him, said to him, Get up and have some food.",,,,,,,
7831,"And looking up, he saw by his head a cake cooked on the stones and a bottle of water. So he took food and drink and went to sleep again.",,,,,,,
7832,"And the angel of the Lord came again a second time, and touching him said, Get up and have some food, or the journey will be overmuch for your strength.",,,,,,,
7833,"So he got up and took food and drink, and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights, to Horeb, the mountain of God.",,,,,,,
7834,"And there he went into a hole in the rock for the night; then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, What are you doing here, Elijah?",,,,,,,
7835,"And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have made destruction of your altars, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the",only one liv,ng;,a,d n,w th,y a,e att
7836,"Then he said, Go out and take your place on the mountain before the Lord. Then the Lord went by, and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind, and rocks were broken before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind there was",an earth-sho,"k,",u,th,Lor,wa,not
7837,"And after the earth-shock a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, the sound of a soft breath.",,,,,,,
7838,"And Elijah, hearing it, went out, covering his face with his robe, and took his place in the opening of the hole. And there a voice came to him saying, What are you doing here, Elijah?",,,,,,,
7839,"And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have had your altars broken down, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the onl",one living;,and,n,w t,ey a,e a,tempt
7840,"And the Lord said to him, Go back on your way through the waste land to Damascus; and when you come there, put the holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram;",,,,,,,
7841,"And on Jehu, son of Nimshi, making him king over Israel; and on Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel- meholah, to be prophet in your place.",,,,,,,
7842,"And it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will put to death; and whoever gets away safe from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will put to death.",,,,,,,
7843,"But I will keep safe seven thousand in Israel, all those whose knees have not been bent to Baal, and whose mouths have given him no kisses.",,,,,,,
7844,"So he went away from there and came across Elisha, the son of Shaphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, he himself walking with the twelfth; and Elijah went up to him and put his robe on him.",,,,,,,
7845,"And letting the oxen be where they were, he came running after Elijah, and said, Only let me give a kiss to my father and mother, and then I will come after you. But he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you?",,,,,,,
7846,"And he went back, and took the oxen and put them to death, and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, he gave the people a feast. Then he got up and went after Elijah and became his servant.Now Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got all his army together,",and thirty-t,o k,n,s w,th h,"m,",nd ho
7847,"And he sent representatives into the town to Ahab, king of Israel;",,,,,,,
7848,"And they said to him, Ben-hadadsays, Your silverand your gold are mine; and your wivesand childrenare mine.",,,,,,,
7849,"And the king of Israel sent him an answer saying, As you say, my lord king, I am yours with all I have.",,,,,,,
7850,"Then the representatives came back again, and said, These are the words of Ben-hadad: I sent to you saying, Give up to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children;",,,,,,,
7851,"But I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, to make a search through your house and the houses of your people, and everything which is pleasing in your eyes they will take away in their hands.",,,,,,,
7852,"Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land, and said, Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man: he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, and I did not keep them back.",,,,,,,
7853,"And all the responsible men and the people said to him, Do not give attention to him or do what he says.",,,,,,,
7854,"So he said to the representatives of Ben-hadad, Say to my lord the king, All the orders you sent the first time I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the representatives went back with this answer.",,,,,,,
7855,"Then Ben-hadad sent to him, saying, May the gods' punishment be on me if there is enough of the dust of Samaria for all the people at my feet to take some in their hands.",,,,,,,
7856,"And the king of Israel said in answer, Say to him, The time for loud talk is not when a man is putting on his arms, but when he is taking them off.",,,,,,,
7857,"Now when this answer was given to Ben-hadad, he was drinking with the kings in the tents, and he said to his men, Take up your positions. So they put themselves in position for attacking the town.",,,,,,,
7858,"Then a prophet came up to Ahab, king of Israel, and said, The Lord says, Have you seen all this great army? See, I will give it into your hands today, and you will see that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
7859,"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, The Lord says, By the servants of the chiefs who are over the divisions of the land. Then he said, By whom is the fighting to be started? And he made answer, By you.",,,,,,,
7860,"Then he got together the servants of all the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land, two hundred and thirty-two of them; and after them, he got together all the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand.",,,,,,,
7861,And in the middle of the day they went out. But Ben-hadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty-two kings who were helping him.,,,,,,,
7862,"And the servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first; and when Ben-hadad sent out, they gave him the news, saying, Men have come out from Samaria.",,,,,,,
7863,"And he said, If they have come out for peace, take them living, and if they have come out for war, take them living.",,,,,,,
7864,"So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town, with the army coming after them.",,,,,,,
7865,"And every one of them put his man to death, and the Aramaeans went in flight with Israel after them; and Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got away safely on a horse with his horsemen.",,,,,,,
7866,"And the king of Israel went out and took the horses and the war-carriages, and made great destruction among the Aramaeans.",,,,,,,
7867,"Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel, and said to him, Now make yourself strong, and take care what you do, or a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again.",,,,,,,
7868,"Then the king of Aram's servants said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; that is why they were stronger than we: but if we make an attack on them in the lowlands, we will certainly be stronger than they.",,,,,,,
7869,"This is what you have to do: take away the kings from their positions, and put captains in their places;",,,,,,,
7870,"And get together another army like the one which came to destruction, horse for horse, and carriage for carriage; and let us make war on them in the lowlands, and certainly we will be stronger than they. And he gave ear to what they said, and did so.",,,,,,,
7871,"So, a year later, Ben-hadad got the Aramaeans together and went up to Aphek to make war on Israel.",,,,,,,
7872,"And the children of Israel got themselves together, and food was made ready and they went against them; the tents of the children of Israel were like two little flocks of goats before them, but all the country was full of the Aramaeans.",,,,,,,
7873,"And a man of God came up and said to the king of Israel, The Lord says, Because the Aramaeans have said, The Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys; I will give all this great army into your hands, and you will see that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
7874,Now the two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days. And on the seventh day the fight was started; and the children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day.,,,,,,,
7875,"But the rest went in flight to Aphek, into the town, where a wall came down on the twenty-seven thousand who were still living. And Ben-hadad went in flight into the town, into an inner room.",,,,,,,
7876,"Then his servants said to him, It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy: let us then put on haircloth, and cords on our heads, and go to the king of Israel; it may be that he will give you your life.",,,,,,,
7877,"So they put on haircloth, and cords on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, Let me now keep my life. And he said, Is he still living? he is my brother.",,,,,,,
7878,"Now the men took it as a sign, and quickly took up his words; and they said, Ben-hadad is your brother. Then he said, Go and get him. So Ben-hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage.",,,,,,,
7879,"And Ben-hadad said to him, The towns my father took from your father I will give back; and you may make streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria. And as for me, at the price of this agreement you will let me go. So he made an agreemen",with him an,le,,im,o.,,
7880,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the Lord, Give me a wound. But the man would not.",,,,,,,
7881,"Then he said to him, Because you have not given ear to the voice of the Lord, straight away when you have gone from me a lion will put you to death. And when he had gone, straight away a lion came rushing at him and put him to death.",,,,,,,
7882,"Then he came across another man, and said, Give me a wound. And the man gave him a blow wounding him.",,,,,,,
7883,"So the prophet went away, and pulling his head-band over his eyes to keep his face covered, took his place by the road waiting for the king.",,,,,,,
7884,"And when the king went by, crying out to him he said, Your servant went out into the fight; and a man came out to me with another man and said, Keep this man: if by any chance he gets away, your life will be the price of his life, or you will have to giv",a talent of,sil,e,in,paym,nt.,
7885,"But while your servant was turning this way and that, he was gone. Then the king of Israel said to him, You are responsible; you have given the decision against yourself.",,,,,,,
7886,Then he quickly took the head-band from his eyes; and the king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets.,,,,,,,
7887,"And he said to him, These are the words of the Lord: Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse, your life will be taken for his life, and your people for his people.",,,,,,,
7888,"Then the king of Israel went back to his house, bitter and angry, and came to Samaria.Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vine-garden in Jezreel, near the house of Ahab, king of Samaria.",,,,,,,
7889,"And Ahab said to Naboth, Give me your vine-garden so that I may have it for a garden of sweet plants, for it is near my house; and let me give you a better vine- garden in exchange, or, if it seems good to you, let me give you its value in money.",,,,,,,
7890,"But Naboth said to Ahab, By the Lord, far be it from me to give you the heritage of my fathers.",,,,,,,
7891,"So Ahab came into his house bitter and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, I will not give you the heritage of my fathers. And stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away, he would take no food.",,,,,,,
7892,"But Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said, Why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food?",,,,,,,
7893,"And he said to her, Because I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite, and I said to him, Let me have your vine-garden for a price, or, if it is pleasing to you, I will give you another vine-garden for it: and he said, I will not give you my vine-garden.",,,,,,,
7894,"Then Jezebel, his wife, said, Are you now the ruler of Israel? Get up, take food, and let your heart be glad; I will give you the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite.",,,,,,,
7895,"So she sent a letter in Ahab's name, stamped with his stamp, to the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority with Naboth.",,,,,,,
7896,"And in the letter she said, Let a time of public sorrow be fixed, and put Naboth at the head of the people;",,,,,,,
7897,And get two good-for-nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing God and the king. Then take him out and have him stoned to death.,,,,,,,
7898,"So the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority in his town, did as Jezebel had said in the letter she sent them.",,,,,,,
7899,"They gave orders for a day of public sorrow, and put Naboth at the head of the people.",,,,,,,
7900,"And the two good- for-nothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against Naboth, in front of the people, saying, Naboth has been cursing God and the king. Then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death.",,,,,,,
7901,"And they sent word to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.",,,,,,,
7902,"Then Jezebel, hearing that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, said to Ahab, Get up and take as your heritage the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he would not give you for money, for Naboth is no longer living but is dead.",,,,,,,
7903,"So Ahab, hearing that Naboth was dead, went down to the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite to take it as his heritage.",,,,,,,
7904,"And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,",,,,,,,
7905,"Go down to Ahab, king of Israel, in Samaria; see, he is in the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite, where he has gone to take it as his heritage.",,,,,,,
7906,"Say to him, The Lord says, Have you put a man to death and taken his heritage? Then say to him, The Lord says, In the place where dogs have been drinking the blood of Naboth, there will your blood become the drink of dogs.",,,,,,,
7907,"And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you come face to face with me, O my hater? And he said, I have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.",,,,,,,
7908,"See, I will send evil on you and put an end to you completely, cutting off from Ahab every male child, him who is shut up and him who goes free in Israel;",,,,,,,
7909,"And I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the family of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, because you have made me angry, and have made Israel do evil.",,,,,,,
7910,"And of Jezebel the Lord said, Jezebel will become food for dogs in the heritage of Jezreel.",,,,,,,
7911,Any man of the family of Ahab who comes to his death in the town will become food for the dogs; and he who comes to his death in the open country will be food for the birds of the air.,,,,,,,
7912,"(There was no one like Ahab, who gave himself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, moved to it by Jezebel his wife.",,,,,,,
7913,"He did a very disgusting thing in going after false gods, doing all the things the Amorites did, whom the Lord sent out before the children of Israel.)",,,,,,,
7914,"Hearing these words, Ahab, in great grief, put haircloth on his flesh and went without food, sleeping in haircloth, and going about quietly.",,,,,,,
7915,"Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,",,,,,,,
7916,"Do you see how Ahab has made himself low before me? because he has made himself low before me, I will not send the evil in his life-time, but in his son's time I will send the evil on his family.Now for three years there was no war between Aram and Israe",.,,,,,,
7917,"And it came about in the third year, that Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came down to the king of Israel.",,,,,,,
7918,"And the king of Israel said to his servants, Do you not see that Ramoth-gilead is ours? and we are doing nothing to get it back from the hands of the king of Aram.",,,,,,,
7919,"And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead to make war? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are: my people as your people, my horses as your horses.",,,,,,,
7920,"Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord.",,,,,,,
7921,"So the king of Israel got all the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And they said, Go up: for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.",,,,,,,
7922,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions?",,,,,,,
7923,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord, Micaiah, son of Imlah; but I have no love for him, for he is a prophet of evil to me and not of good. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king s",y so.,,,,,,
7924,"Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imlah.",,,,,,,
7925,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.",,,,,,,
7926,"And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely.",,,,,,,
7927,"And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.",,,,,,,
7928,"Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs and say good things.",,,,,,,
7929,"And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say.",,,,,,,
7930,"When he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And in answer he said, Go up, and it will go well for you; and the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.",,,,,,,
7931,"Then the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord?",,,,,,,
7932,"Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace.",,,,,,,
7933,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good but of evil?",,,,,,,
7934,"And he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, with all the army of heaven in their places round him at his right hand and at his left.",,,,,,,
7935,"And the Lord said, How may Ahab be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another.",,,,,,,
7936,"Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick.",,,,,,,
7937,"And the Lord said, How? And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so.",,,,,,,
7938,"And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the Lord has said evil against you.",,,,,,,
7939,"Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of the face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you?",,,,,,,
7940,"And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe.",,,,,,,
7941,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son;",,,,,,,
7942,"And say, It is the king's order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come again in peace.",,,,,,,
7943,"And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me.",,,,,,,
7944,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead.",,,,,,,
7945,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress and went into the fight.",,,,,,,
7946,"Now the king of Aram had given orders to the thirty-two captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.",,,,,,,
7947,"So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Truly, this is the king of Israel; and turning against him, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry.",,,,,,,
7948,"And when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him.",,,,,,,
7949,"And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the","rmy, for I a",ba,l,wo,nded,,
7950,"But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans, and the floor of the carriage was covered with the blood from his wound, and by evening he was dead.",,,,,,,
7951,"And about sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army, saying, Let every man go back to his town and his country, for the king is dead.",,,,,,,
7952,"And they came to Samaria, and put the king's body to rest in Samaria.",,,,,,,
7953,"And the war-carriage was washed by the pool of Samaria, which was the bathing-place of the loose women, and the dogs were drinking his blood there, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
7954,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all he did, and his ivory house, and all the towns of which he was the builder, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?",,,,,,,
7955,So Ahab was put to rest with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.,,,,,,,
7956,"And Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa, became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab's rule over Israel.",,,,,,,
7957,"Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he was king for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.",,,,,,,
7958,"He did as Asa his father had done, not turning away from it, but doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord; but the high places were not taken away: the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places.",,,,,,,
7959,And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.,,,,,,,
7960,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his great power, and how he went to war, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?",,,,,,,
7961,"He put an end to the rest of those who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods, all those who were still in the land in the time of his father Asa.",,,,,,,
7962,At that time there was no king in Edom;,,,,,,,
7963,"And the representative of King Jehoshaphat made a Tarshish-ship to go to Ophir for gold, but it did not go, because it was broken at Ezion-geber.",,,,,,,
7964,"Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, Let my men go with yours in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not let them.",,,,,,,
7965,"Then Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David his father; and Jehoram his son became king in his place.",,,,,,,
7966,"Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and he was king over Israel for two years.",,,,,,,
7967,"He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, going in the ways of his father and his mother, and in the ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel do evil.",,,,,,,
7968,"He was a servant and worshipper of Baal, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath, as his father had done.After the death of Ahab, Moab made itself free from the authority of Israel.",,,,,,,
7969,"Now Ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in Samaria, and was ill. And he sent men, and said to them, Put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, about the outcome of my disease, to see if I will get well or not.",,,,,,,
7970,"But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Go now, and, meeting the men sent by the king of Samaria, say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you are going to get directions from Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?",,,,,,,
7971,"Give ear then to the words of the Lord: You will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you. Then Elijah went away.",,,,,,,
7972,"And the men he had sent came back to the king; and he said to them, Why have you come back?",,,,,,,
7973,"And they said to him, On our way we had a meeting with a man who said, Go back to the king who sent you and say to him, The Lord says, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? For this reaso",", you will n",t c,m,do,n fr,m t,e bed
7974,"And he said to them, What sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you?",,,,,,,
7975,"And they said in answer, He was a man clothed in a coat of hair, with a leather band about his body. Then he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.",,,,,,,
7976,"Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill, and said to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down.",,,,,,,
7977,"And Elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men, and put an end to you. Then fire came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men.",,,,,,,
7978,"Then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he said to Elijah, O man of God, the king says, Come down quickly.",,,,,,,
7979,"And Elijah in answer said, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men, and put an end to you. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and put an end to him and his fifty men.",,,,,,,
7980,"Then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men; and the third captain of fifty went up, and falling on his knees before Elijah, requesting mercy of him, said, O man of God, let my life and the life of these your fifty servants be of value to yo",.,,,,,,
7981,For fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; but now let my life be of value in your eyes.,,,,,,,
7982,"Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, Go down with him; have no fear of him. So he got up and went down with him to the king.",,,,,,,
7983,"And he said to him, This is the word of the Lord: Because you sent men to put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you.",,,,,,,
7984,"So death came to him, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah. And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; because he had no son.",,,,,,,
7985,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?Now when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a great wind, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.",,,,,,,
7986,"And Elijah said to Elisha, Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Beth-el. But Elisha said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went down to Beth-el.",,,,,,,
7987,"And at Beth-el the sons of the prophets came out to Elisha and said, Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yes, I have knowledge of it: say no more.",,,,,,,
7988,"Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on to Jericho.",,,,,,,
7989,"And at Jericho the sons of the prophets came up to Elisha and said to him, Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today? And he said in answer, Yes, I have knowledge of it: say no more.",,,,,,,
7990,"Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on together.",,,,,,,
7991,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off, while the two of them were by the edge of Jordan.",,,,,,,
7992,"Then Elijah took off his robe, and, rolling it up, gave the water a blow with it, and the waters were parted, flowing back this way and that, so that they went over on dry land.",,,,,,,
7993,"And when they had come to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, Say what you would have me do for you before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, Be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me.",,,,,,,
7994,"And he said, You have made a hard request: still, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will get your desire; but if not, it will not be so.",,,,,,,
7995,"And while they went on their way, going on talking together, suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and Elijah went up to heaven in a great wind.",,,,,,,
7996,"And when Elisha saw it he gave a cry, My father, my father, the carriages of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no longer; and he was full of grief.",,,,,,,
7997,"Then he took up Elijah's robe, which had been dropped from him, and went back till he came to the edge of Jordan.",,,,,,,
7998,"And he took Elijah's robe, which had been dropped from him, and giving the water a blow with it, said, Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah? and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that; and Elisha went over.",,,,,,,
7999,"And when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. And they came out to him, and went down on the earth before him.",,,,,,,
8000,"And they said, Your servants have with us here fifty strong men; be pleased to let them go in search of Elijah; for it may be that the spirit of the Lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley. But he said, Do not send them.",,,,,,,
8001,"But when they kept on requesting him, he was shamed and said, Send, then. So they sent fifty men; but after searching for three days, they came back without having seen him.",,,,,,,
8002,"And they came back to him, while he was still at Jericho; and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?",,,,,,,
8003,"Now the men of the town said to Elisha, You see that the position of this town is good; but the water is bad, causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead.",,,,,,,
8004,"So he said, Get me a new vessel, and put salt in it; and they took it to him.",,,,,,,
8005,"Then he went out to the spring from which the water came, and put salt in it, and said, The Lord says, Now I have made this water sweet; no longer will it be death-giving or unfertile.",,,,,,,
8006,"And the water was made sweet again to this day, as Elisha said.",,,,,,,
8007,"Then from there he went up to Beth-el; and on his way, some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him, crying, Go up, old no-hair! go up, old no-hair!",,,,,,,
8008,"And turning back, he saw them, and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the wood and put forty-two of the children to death.",,,,,,,
8009,"From there he went to Mount Carmel, and came back from there to Samaria.And Jehoram, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; and he was king for twelve years.",,,,,,,
8010,"He did evil in the eyes of the Lord; but not like his father and his mother, for he put away the stone pillar of Baal which his father had made.",,,,,,,
8011,"But still he did the same sins which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do; he went on in them.",,,,,,,
8012,"Now Mesha, king of Moab, was a sheep-farmer; and he gave regularly to the king of Israel the wool from a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand sheep.",,,,,,,
8013,"But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab got free from the authority of the king of Israel.",,,,,,,
8014,"At that time, King Jehoram went out from Samaria and got all Israel together in fighting order.",,,,,,,
8015,"And he sent to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has got free from my authority: will you go with me to make war on Moab? And he said, I will go with you: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.",,,,,,,
8016,"And he said, Which way are we to go? And he said in answer, By the waste land of Edom.",,,,,,,
8017,So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom by a roundabout way for seven days: and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them.,,,,,,,
8018,"And the king of Israel said, Here is trouble: for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of Moab.",,,,,,,
8019,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may get directions from the Lord? And one of the king of Israel's men said in answer, Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who was servant to Elijah.",,,,,,,
8020,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.",,,,,,,
8021,"But Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? go to the prophets of your father and your mother. And the king of Israel said, No; for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of Moab.",,,,,,,
8022,"Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you.",,,,,,,
8023,"But now, get me a player of music, and it will come about that while the man is playing, the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord: and they got a player of music, and while the man was playing, the hand of the Lord wa",on him.,,,,,,
8024,"And he said, The Lord says, I will make this valley full of water-holes.",,,,,,,
8025,"For the Lord says, Though you see no wind or rain, the valley will be full of water, and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink.",,,,,,,
8026,And this will be only a small thing to the Lord: in addition he will give the Moabites into your hands.,,,,,,,
8027,"And you are to put every walled town to destruction, cutting down every good tree, and stopping up every water-spring, and making all the good land rough with stones.",,,,,,,
8028,"Now in the morning, about the time when the offering was made, they saw water flowing from the direction of Edom till the country was full of water.",,,,,,,
8029,"Now all Moab, hearing that the kings had come to make war against them, got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country.",,,,,,,
8030,"And early in the morning they got up, when the sun was shining on the water, and they saw the water facing them as red as blood.",,,,,,,
8031,"Then they said, This is blood: it is clear that destruction has come on the kings; they have been fighting one another: now come, Moab, let us take their goods.",,,,,,,
8032,"But when they came to the tents of Israel, the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites, so that they went in flight before them; and they went forward still attacking them;",,,,,,,
8033,"Pulling down the towns, covering every good field with stones, stopping up all the water-springs, and cutting down all the good trees; they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kir-hareseth were there any Moabites; and the fighting-men went roun",the town ra,nin,,ton,s on,it.,
8034,"And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him, he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords, with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram, but they were not able to do so.",,,,,,,
8035,"Then he took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, offering him as a burned offering on the wall. So there was great wrath against Israel; and they went away from him, back to their country.Now a certain woman, the wife of one of the sons o",the prophet,", c",m,cr,ing,o E,isha
8036,"Then Elisha said to her, What am I to do for you? say now, what have you in the house? And she said, Your servant has nothing in the house but a pot of oil.",,,,,,,
8037,"Then he said, Go out to all your neighbours and get vessels, a very great number of them.",,,,,,,
8038,"Then go in, and, shutting the door on yourself and your sons, put oil into all these vessels, putting on one side the full ones.",,,,,,,
8039,"So she went away, and when the door was shut on her and her sons, they took the vessels to her and she put oil into them.",,,,,,,
8040,"And when all the vessels were full, she said to her son, Get me another vessel. And he said, There are no more. And the flow of oil was stopped.",,,,,,,
8041,"So she came to the man of God and gave him word of what she had done. And he said, Go and get money for the oil and make payment of your debt, and let the rest be for the needs of yourself and your sons.",,,,,,,
8042,"Now there came a day when Elisha went to Shunem, and there was a woman of high position living there, who made him come in and have a meal with her. And after that, every time he went by, he went into her house for a meal.",,,,,,,
8043,"And she said to her husband, Now I see that this is a holy man of God, who comes by day after day.",,,,,,,
8044,"So let us make a little room on the wall; and put a bed there for him, and a table and a seat and a light; so that when he comes to us, he will be able to go in there.",,,,,,,
8045,"Now one day, when he had gone there, he went into the little room and took his rest there.",,,,,,,
8046,"And he said to Gehazi, his servant, Send for this Shunammite. So in answer to his voice she came before him.",,,,,,,
8047,"And he said to him, Now say to her, See, you have taken all this trouble for us; what is to be done for you? will you have any request made for you to the king or the captain of the army? But she said, I am living among my people.",,,,,,,
8048,"So he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi made answer, Still there is this, she has no son and her husband is old.",,,,,,,
8049,"Then he said, Send for her. And in answer to his voice she took her place at the door.",,,,,,,
8050,"And Elisha said, At this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not say what is false to your servant.",,,,,,,
8051,"Then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named, in the year after, as Elisha had said to her.",,,,,,,
8052,"Now one day, when the child was older, he went out to his father to where the grain was being cut.",,,,,,,
8053,"And he said to his father, My head, my head! And the father said to a servant, Take him in to his mother.",,,,,,,
8054,"And he took him in to his mother, and she took him on her knees and kept him there till the middle of the day, when his life went from him.",,,,,,,
8055,"Then she went up and put him on the bed of the man of God, shutting the door on him, and went out.",,,,,,,
8056,"And she said to her husband, Send me one of the servants and one of the asses so that I may go quickly to the man of God and come back again.",,,,,,,
8057,"And he said, Why are you going to him today? it is not a new moon or a Sabbath. But she said, It is well.",,,,,,,
8058,"Then she made the ass ready and said to her servant, Keep driving on; do not make a stop without orders from me.",,,,,,,
8059,"So she went, and came to Mount Carmel, to the man of God. And when the man of God saw her coming in his direction, he said to Gehazi, his servant, See, there is the Shunammite;",,,,,,,
8060,"Go quickly to her, and on meeting her say to her, Are you well? and your husband and the child, are they well? And she said in answer, All is well.",,,,,,,
8061,"And when she came to where the man of God was on the hill, she put her hands round his feet; and Gehazi came near with the purpose of pushing her away; but the man of God said, Let her be, for her soul is bitter in her; and the Lord has kept it secret fr","m me, and ha",no,,ive,me,ord,of it
8062,"Then she said, Did I make a request to my lord for a son? did I not say, Do not give me false words?",,,,,,,
8063,"Then he said to Gehazi, Make yourself ready, and take my stick in your hand, and go: if you come across anyone on the way, give him no blessing, and if anyone gives you a blessing, give him no answer. And put my stick on the child's face.",,,,,,,
8064,"But the mother of the child said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not go back without you. So he got up and went with her.",,,,,,,
8065,"And Gehazi went on before them and put the stick on the child's face; but there was no voice, and no one gave attention. So he went back, and meeting him gave him the news, saying, The child is not awake.",,,,,,,
8066,"And when Elisha came into the house he saw the child dead, stretched on his bed.",,,,,,,
8067,"So he went in, and shutting the door on the two of them, made prayer to the Lord.",,,,,,,
8068,"Then he got up on the bed, stretching himself out on the child, and put his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands; and the child's body became warm.",,,,,,,
8069,"Then he came back, and after walking once through the house and back, he went up, stretching himself out on the child seven times; and the child's eyes became open.",,,,,,,
8070,"And he gave orders to Gehazi, and said, Send for the Shunammite. And she came in answer to his voice. And he said, Take up your son.",,,,,,,
8071,"And she came in, and went down on her face to the earth at his feet; then she took her son in her arms and went out.",,,,,,,
8072,"And Elisha went back to Gilgal, now there was very little food in the land; and the sons of the prophets were seated before him. And he said to his servant, Put the great pot on the fire, and make soup for the sons of the prophets.",,,,,,,
8073,"And one went out into the field to get green plants and saw a vine of the field, and pulling off the fruit of it till the fold of his robe was full, he came back and put the fruit, cut up small, into the pot of soup, having no idea what it was.",,,,,,,
8074,"Then they gave the men soup from the pot. And while they were drinking the soup, they gave a cry, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot; and they were not able to take any more food.",,,,,,,
8075,"But he said, Get some meal. And he put it into the pot, and said, Now give it to the people so that they may have food. And there was nothing bad in the pot.",,,,,,,
8076,"Now a man came from Baal-shalishah with an offering of first-fruits for the man of God, twenty barley cakes and garden fruit in his bag. And he said, Give these to the people for food.",,,,,,,
8077,"But his servant said, How am I to put this before a hundred men? But he said, Give it to the people for food; for the Lord says, There will be food for them and some over.",,,,,,,
8078,"So he put it before them, and they had a meal and there was more than enough, as the Lord had said.Now Naaman, chief of the army of the king of Aram, was a man of high position with his master, and greatly respected, because by him the Lord had given sal",ation to Ara,; b,t,he,as a,lep,r.
8079,"Now the Aramaeans had gone out in bands, and taken prisoner from Israel a little girl, who became servant to Naaman's wife.",,,,,,,
8080,"And she said to her master's wife, If only my lord would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would make him well.",,,,,,,
8081,"And someone went and said to his lord, This is what the girl from the land of Israel says.",,,,,,,
8082,"So the king of Aram said, Go then; and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, taking with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.",,,,,,,
8083,"And he took the letter to the king of Israel, in which the king of Aram had said, See, I have sent my servant Naaman to you to be made well, for he is a leper.",,,,,,,
8084,"But the king of Israel, after reading the letter, was greatly troubled and said, Am I God, to give death and life? why does this man send a leper to me to be made well? is it not clear that he is looking for a cause of war?",,,,,,,
8085,"Now Elisha, the man of God, hearing that the king of Israel had done this, sent to the king, saying, Why are you troubled? send the man to me, so that he may see that there is a prophet in Israel.",,,,,,,
8086,"So Naaman, with all his horses and his carriages, came to the door of Elisha's house.",,,,,,,
8087,"And Elisha sent a servant to him, saying, Go to Jordan, and after washing seven times in its waters your flesh will be well again and you will be clean.",,,,,,,
8088,"But Naaman was angry and went away and said, I had the idea that he would come out to see such an important person as I am, and make prayer to the Lord his God, and with a wave of his hand over the place make the leper well.",,,,,,,
8089,"Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not be washed in them and become clean? So turning, he went away in wrath.",,,,,,,
8090,"Then his servants came to him and said, If the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much more then, when he says to you, Be washed and become clean?",,,,,,,
8091,"Then he went down seven times into the waters of Jordan, as the man of God had said; and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again, and he was clean.",,,,,,,
8092,"Then he went back to the man of God, with all his train, and, taking his place before him, said, Now I am certain that there is no God in all the earth, but only in Israel: now then, take an offering from me.",,,,,,,
8093,"But he said, By the life of the Lord whose servant I am, I will take nothing from you. And he did his best to make him take it but he would not.",,,,,,,
8094,"Then Naaman said, If you will not, then let there be given to your servant as much earth as two beasts are able to take on their backs; because from now on, your servant will make no offering or burned offering to other gods, but only to the Lord.",,,,,,,
8095,"But may your servant have the Lord's forgiveness for this one thing: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon for worship there, supported on my arm, and my head is bent in the house of Rimmon; when his head is bent in the house of Rimmon, may your s",rvant have t,e L,r,'s,orgi,ene,s for
8096,"And he said to him, Go in peace. And he went from him some distance.",,,,,,,
8097,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, Now my master has taken nothing from Naaman, this Aramaean, of what he would have given him: by the living Lord, I will go after him and get something from him.",,,,,,,
8098,"So Gehazi went after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said, Is all well?",,,,,,,
8099,"And he said, All is well: but my master has sent me, saying, Even now, two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim; will you give me a talent of silver and two changes of clothing for them?",,,,,,,
8100,"And Naaman said, Be good enough to take two talents. And forcing him to take them, he put two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to his two servants to take before him.",,,,,,,
8101,"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hands, and put them away in the house; and he sent the men away, and they went.",,,,,,,
8102,"Then he came in and took his place before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where have you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went nowhere.",,,,,,,
8103,"And he said to him, Did not my heart go with you, when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you? Is this a time for getting money, and clothing, and olive-gardens and vine-gardens, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants?",,,,,,,
8104,"Because of what you have done, the disease of Naaman the leper will take you in its grip, and your seed after you, for ever. And he went out from before him a leper as white as snow.Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, There is not room enough fo",us in the p,ace,w,ere,we a,e l,ving
8105,"So let us go to Jordan, and let everyone get to work cutting boards, and we will make a living-place for ourselves there. And he said to them, Go, then.",,,,,,,
8106,"And one of them said, Be pleased to go with your servants. And he said, I will go.",,,,,,,
8107,"So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they got to work cutting down trees.",,,,,,,
8108,"But one of them, while cutting a board, let the head of his axe go into the water; and he gave a cry, and said, This is a bad business, my master, for it is another's.",,,,,,,
8109,"And the man of God said, Where did it go in? and when he saw the place where it had gone into the water, cutting a stick, he put it into the water, and the iron came up to the top of the water.",,,,,,,
8110,"Then he said, Take it up. So he put out his hand and took it.",,,,,,,
8111,"At that time the king of Aram was making war against Israel; and he had a meeting with the chiefs of his army and said, I will be waiting in secret in some named place.",,,,,,,
8112,"And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take care to keep away from that place, for the Aramaeans are waiting there in secret.",,,,,,,
8113,"So the king of Israel sent to the place where the man of God had said there was danger, and kept clear of it more than once.",,,,,,,
8114,"And at this, the mind of the king of Aram was greatly troubled, and he sent for his servants and said to them, Will you not make clear to me which of us is helping the king of Israel?",,,,,,,
8115,"And one of them said, Not one of us, my lord king; but Elisha, the prophet in Israel, gives the king of Israel news of the words you say even in your bedroom.",,,,,,,
8116,"Then he said, Go and see where he is, so that I may send and get him. And news came to him that he was in Dothan.",,,,,,,
8117,"So he sent there horses and carriages and a great army; and they came by night, circling the town.",,,,,,,
8118,"Now the servant of the man of God, having got up early and gone out, saw an army with horses and carriages of war all round the town. And the servant said to him, O my master, what are we to do?",,,,,,,
8119,"And he said in answer, Have no fear; those who are with us are more than those who are with them.",,,,,,,
8120,"Then Elisha made a prayer to the Lord, saying, Lord, let his eyes be open so that he may see. And the Lord made the young man's eyes open; and he saw that all the mountain was full of horses and carriages of fire round Elisha.",,,,,,,
8121,"Now when the Aramaeans came down to Elisha, he made a prayer to the Lord saying, Lord, make this people blind. And he made them blind at Elisha's request.",,,,,,,
8122,"And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, and this is not the town: come after me so that I may take you to the man you are searching for. And he took them to Samaria.",,,,,,,
8123,"And when they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, Lord, let the eyes of these men be open so that they may see. And the Lord made their eyes open, and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria.",,,,,,,
8124,"And the king of Israel, when he saw them, said to Elisha, My father, am I to put them to the sword?",,,,,,,
8125,"But he said in answer, You are not to put them to death; have you any right to put to death those whom you have not taken prisoner with your sword and your bow? put bread and water before them, so that they may have food and drink and go to their master.",,,,,,,
8126,"So he made ready a great feast for them, and when they had had food and drink, he sent them away and they went back to their master. And no more bands of Aramaeans came into the land of Israel.",,,,,,,
8127,"Now after this, Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got together all his army and went up to make an attack on Samaria, shutting the town in on all sides with his forces.",,,,,,,
8128,"And they became very short of food in Samaria; for they kept it shut in till the price of an ass's head was eighty shekels of silver, and a small measure of doves' droppings was five shekels of silver.",,,,,,,
8129,"And when the king of Israel was going by on the wall, a woman came crying out to him, and said, Help! my lord king.",,,,,,,
8130,"And he said, If the Lord does not give you help, where am I to get help for you? from the grain-floor or the grape-crusher?",,,,,,,
8131,"And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she said in answer, This woman said to me, Give your son to be our food today, and we will have my son tomorrow.",,,,,,,
8132,"So, boiling my son, we had a meal of him; and on the day after I said to her, Now give your son for our food; but she has put her son in a secret place.",,,,,,,
8133,"Then the king, hearing what the woman said, took his robes in his hands, violently parting them; and, while he was walking on the wall, the people, looking, saw that under his robe he had haircloth on his flesh.",,,,,,,
8134,"Then he said, May God's punishment come on me if Elisha, the son of Shaphat, keeps his head on his body after this day.",,,,,,,
8135,"But Elisha was in his house, and the responsible men were seated there with him; and before the king got there, Elisha said to those who were with him, Do you see how this cruel and violent man has sent to take away my life?",,,,,,,
8136,"While he was still talking to them, the king came down and said, This evil is from the Lord; why am I to go on waiting any longer for the Lord?Then Elisha said, Give ear to the word of the Lord: the Lord says, Tomorrow, about this time, a measure of good",meal will be,off,r,d f,r th,pr,ce of
8137,"Thenthecaptainwhose arm was supporting the king said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food.",,,,,,,
8138,"Now there were four lepers seated at the doorway into the town: and they said to one another, Why are we waiting here for death?",,,,,,,
8139,"If we say, We will go into the town, there is no food in the town, and we will come to our end there; and if we go on waiting here, death will come to us. Come then, let us give ourselves up to the army of Aram: if they let us go on living, then life wil",be ours; an,if,t,ey,ut u,to,death
8140,"So in the half light they got up to go to the tents of Aram; but when they came to the outer line of tents, there was no one there.",,,,,,,
8141,"For the Lord had made the sound of carriages and horses, and the noise of a great army, come to the ears of the Aramaeans, so that they said to one another, Truly, the king of Israel has got the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians for a price to m",ke an attack,on,s,,,,
8142,"So they got up and went in flight, in the half light, without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods; they went in flight, fearing for their lives.",,,,,,,
8143,"And when those lepers came to the outer line of tents, they went into one tent, and had food and drink, and took from it silver and gold and clothing, which they put in a secret place; then they came back and went into another tent from which they took m","re goods, wh",ch,h,y p,t aw,y i,a se
8144,"Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we say nothing: if we go on waiting here till the morning, punishment will come to us. So let us go and give the news to those of the king's house.",,,,,,,
8145,"So they came in, and, crying out to the door-keepers of the town, they gave them the news, saying, We came to the tents of the Aramaeans, and there was no one there and no voice of man, only the horses and the asses in their places, and the tents as they",were.,,,,,,
8146,"Then the door-keepers, crying out, gave the news to those inside the king's house.",,,,,,,
8147,"Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants, This is my idea of what the Aramaeans have done to us. They have knowledge that we are without food; and so they have gone out of their tents, and are waiting secretly in the open country, sayin",", When they",ome,o,t o,the,tow,", we"
8148,"And one of his servants said in answer, Send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town; if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of Israel who are still living here; if they come to their death they will be t",e same as al,th,s,of,Isra,l w,o hav
8149,"So they took two horsemen; and the king sent them after the army of the Aramaeans, saying, Go and see.",,,,,,,
8150,And they went after them as far as Jordan; and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the Aramaeans in their flight. So those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king.,,,,,,,
8151,"Then the people went out and took the goods from the tents of the Aramaeans. So a measure of good meal was to be had for the price of a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, as the Lord had said.",,,,,,,
8152,"And the king gave authority to that captain, on whose arm he was supported, to have control over the doorway into the town; but he was crushed to death there under the feet of the people, as the man of God had said when the king went down to him.",,,,,,,
8153,"So the words of the man of God came true, which he said to the king: Two measures of barley will be offered for the price of a shekel and a measure of good meal for a shekel, tomorrow about this time in the market-place of Samaria.",,,,,,,
8154,"And that captain said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said to him, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food.",,,,,,,
8155,"And such was his fate; for he was crushed to death under the feet of the people, in the doorway into the town.Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life, Go now, with all the people of your house, and get a living-place for your",elves wherev,r y,u,are,able,fo,by t
8156,So the woman got up and did as the man of God said; and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the Philistines for seven years.,,,,,,,
8157,"And when the seven years were ended, the woman came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land.",,,,,,,
8158,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Now, give me an account of all the great things Elisha has done.",,,,,,,
8159,"And while he was giving the king the story of how Elisha had given life to the dead, the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, My lord king, this is the woman and this is her so",", whose life",Eli,h,ga,e ba,k t,him.
8160,"And in answer to the king's questions, the woman gave him all the story. So the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants, saying, Give her back all her property, and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up ti",l now.,,,,,,
8161,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad, king of Aram, was ill; and they said to him, The man of God has come.",,,,,,,
8162,"Then the king said to Hazael, Take an offering with you, and go to see the man of God and get directions from the Lord by him, saying, Am I going to get better from my disease?",,,,,,,
8163,"So Hazael went to see him, taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from Damascus; and when he came before him, he said, Your son Ben-hadad, king of Aram, has sent me to you, saying, Will I get better from th",s disease?,,,,,,
8164,"And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You will certainly get better; but the Lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him.",,,,,,,
8165,"And he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed, and the man of God was overcome with weeping.",,,,,,,
8166,"And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping? Then he said in answer, Because I see the evil which you will do to the children of Israel: burning down their strong towns, putting their young men to death with the sword, smashing their little ones against the","tones, and c",tti,g,ope,the,wom,n who
8167,"And Hazael said, How is it possible that your servant, who is only a dog, will do this great thing? And Elisha said, The Lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over Aram.",,,,,,,
8168,"Then he went away from Elisha and came in to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And his answer was, He said that you would certainly get well.",,,,,,,
8169,"Now on the day after, Hazael took the bed-cover, and making it wet with water, put it over Ben- hadad's face, causing his death: and Hazael became king in his place.",,,,,,,
8170,"In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became king.",,,,,,,
8171,He was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.,,,,,,,
8172,"He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the family of Ahab did: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.",,,,,,,
8173,"But it was not the Lord's purpose to send destruction on Judah, because of David his servant, to whom he had given his word that he would have a light for ever.",,,,,,,
8174,"In his time, Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves.",,,,,,,
8175,"Then Joram went over to Zair, with all his war-carriages; ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him, ... the captains of the war-carriages; and the people went in flight to their tents.",,,,,,,
8176,"So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah to this day. And at the same time, Libnah made itself free.",,,,,,,
8177,"Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?",,,,,,,
8178,And Joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David: and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.,,,,,,,
8179,"In the twelfth year that Joram, the son of Ahab, was king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, became king;",,,,,,,
8180,"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.",,,,,,,
8181,"He went in the ways of the family of Ahab, and did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the family of Ahab did, for he was a son-in- law of the family of Ahab.",,,,,,,
8182,"He went with Joram, the son of Ahab, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the Aramaeans.",,,,,,,

8442,"So these nations, worshipping the Lord, still were servants to the images they had made; their children and their children's children did the same; as their fathers did, so do they, to this day.Now in the third year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel","Hezekiah, t",e s,n,of,"haz,",bec,me ki

8452,"And the king of Assyria took Israel away as prisoners into Assyria, placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan, and in the towns of the Medes;",,,,,,,
8453,"Because they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord their God, but went against his agreement, even against everything ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, and they did not give ear to it or do it.",,,,,,,

8565,"They did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them, for they made use of it with good faith.",,,,,,,
8566,"Then Hilkiah, the chief priest, said to Shaphan the scribe, I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord. So Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan;",,,,,,,
8567,"Then, after reading it, Shaphan the scribe went in to the king and gave him an account of what had been done, saying, Your servants have given out the money which was in the house, and have given it to the overseers of the work of the house of the Lord.",,,,,,,
8568,"Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book; and he was reading it before the king.",,,,,,,

9077,"And the people of Jebus said to David, You will not come in here. But still, David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David.",,,,,,,
9078,"And David said, The first to overcome the Jebusites will be chief and captain. And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first, and became chief.",,,,,,,
9079,"And David took the strong tower for his living-place, so it was named the town of David.",,,,,,,
9080,"And he took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo; and Joab put the rest of the town in order.",,,,,,,
9081,"And David became greater and greater in power, because the Lord of armies was with him.",,,,,,,

9083,"This is the list of David's men of war: Ishbaal, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the three: he put to death three hundred at one time with his spear.",,,,,,,
9084,"And after him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo the Ahohite, who was one of the three great fighters.",,,,,,,
9085,"He was with David at Pas-dammim, where the Philistines had come together for the fight, near a bit of land full of barley; and the people went in flight before the Philistines.",,,,,,,
9086,"And he took up his position in the middle of the bit of land, and kept back their attack, and overcame the Philistines; and the Lord gave a great salvation.",,,,,,,
9087,"And three of the thirty went down to David, to the rock, into the strong place of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines had taken up their position in the valley of Rephaim.",,,,,,,
9088,"At that time David had taken cover in the strong place, and an armed force of the Philistines was in Beth-lehem.",,,,,,,
9089,"And David, moved by a strong desire, said, If only someone would give me a drink of the water from the water-hole of Beth-lehem by the doorway into the town!",,,,,,,
9090,"So the three, forcing a way through the Philistine army, got water from the water-hole of Beth- lehem, by the doorway into the town, and took it back to David; but David would not take it, but made an offering of it, draining it out to the Lord,",,,,,,,
9091,"Saying, By my God, far be it from me to do this! How may I take as drink the life-blood of these men who have put their lives in danger? so he did not take it. These things did the three great men of war.",,,,,,,
9092,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty, for he put to death three hundred with his spear, but he had not a name among the three.",,,,,,,

9096,"These were the acts of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who had a great name among the thirty men of war.",,,,,,,

9166,"And when they came to the grain-floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to keep the ark in its place, for the oxen were slipping.",,,,,,,
9167,"And the wrath of the Lord, burning against Uzza, sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark, and death came to him there before God.",,,,,,,
9168,"And David was angry because of the Lord's outburst of wrath against Uzza, and he gave that place the name Perez-uzza, to this day.",,,,,,,
9169,"And so great was David's fear of God that day, that he said, How may I let the ark of God come to me?",,,,,,,
9170,"So David did not let the ark come back to him to the town of David, but had it turned away and put into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.",,,,,,,
9171,"And the ark of God was in the house of Obed-edom for three months; and the Lord sent a blessing on the house of Obed-edom and on all he had.And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David with cedar-trees, and stoneworkers and woodworkers for the building of",is house.,,,,,,
9172,"And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, lifting up his kingdom on high because of his people Israel.",,,,,,,

9180,"And David, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? and will you give them into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up; for I will give them into your hands.",,,,,,,
9181,"So they went up to Baal-perazim, and David overcame them there, and David said, God has let the forces fighting against me be broken by my hand, as a wall is broken down by rushing water; so they gave that place the name of Baal-perazim.",,,,,,,
9182,And the Philistines did not take their images with them in their flight; and at David's orders they were burned with fire.,,,,,,,
9183,Then the Philistines again went out in every direction in the valley.,,,,,,,
9184,"And David went for directions to God; and God said to him, You are not to go up after them; but, turning away from them, come face to face with them opposite the spice-trees.",,,,,,,
9185,"And at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go out to the fight, for God has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines.",,,,,,,
9186,"And David did as the Lord had said; and they overcame the army of the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon as far as Gezer.",,,,,,,
9187,"And David's name was honoured in all lands; and the Lord put the fear of him on all nations.And David made houses for himself in the town of David; and he got ready a place for the ark of God, and put up a tent for it.",,,,,,,
9188,"Then David said, The ark of God may not be moved by any but the Levites, for they have been marked out by God to take the ark of God, and to do his work for ever.",,,,,,,
9189,"And David made all Israel come together at Jerusalem, to take the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had got ready for it.",,,,,,,

9196,"Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and twelve.",,,,,,,
9197,"And David sent for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, Uriel, Asaiah and Joel, Shemaiah and Eliel and Amminadab,",,,,,,,
9198,"And said to them, You are the heads of the families of the Levites: make yourselves holy, you and your brothers, so that you may take the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place which I have made ready for it.",,,,,,,
9199,"For because you did not take it at the first, the Lord our God sent punishment on us, because we did not get directions from him in the right way.",,,,,,,
9200,"So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy to take up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
9201,"And the sons of the Levites took up the ark of God, lifting it by its rods, as the Lord had said to Moses.",,,,,,,
9202,"And David gave orders to the chief of the Levites to put their brothers the music-makers in position, with instruments of music, corded instruments and brass, with glad voices making sounds of joy.",,,,,,,
9203,"So Heman, the son of Joel, and, of his brothers, Asaph, the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan, the son of Kushaiah, were put in position by the Levites;",,,,,,,
9204,"And with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Bani and Jaaziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni, Eliab and Benaiah and Maaseiah and Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah, and Obed- edom and Jeiel, the door-keepers.",,,,,,,
9205,"So those who made melody, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were put in position, with brass instruments, sounding loudly;",,,,,,,
9206,"And Zechariah and Aziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel, Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and Benaiah, with corded instruments put to Alamoth.",,,,,,,

9208,"And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was master of the music: he gave directions about the song, because he was expert.",,,,,,,
9209,And Berechiah and Elkanah were door-keepers for the ark.,,,,,,,
9210,"And Shebaniah and Joshaphat and Nethanel and Amasai and Zechariah and Benaiah and Eliezer, the priests, made music on the horns before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were door-keepers for the ark.",,,,,,,
9211,"So David, and the responsible men of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went with joy to get the ark of the agreement of the Lord out of the house of Obed-edom.",,,,,,,
9212,"And when God gave help to the Levites who were lifting up the ark of the agreement of the Lord, they made an offering of seven oxen and seven sheep.",,,,,,,
9213,"And David was clothed with a robe of fair linen, as were all the Levites who took up the ark, and those who made melody, and Chenaniah the master of those who made melody; and David had on a linen ephod;",,,,,,,
9214,"So all Israel took up the ark of the agreement of the Lord, with loud cries and with horns and brass and corded instruments sounding loudly.",,,,,,,
9215,"And when the ark of the agreement of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and playing; and to her mind he seemed foolish.Then they took in the ark of God and put it inside t",e tent which,Dav,d,had,put,p f,r it;
9216,"And when David had come to an end of making the burned offerings and peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord.",,,,,,,
9217,"And he gave to everyone, every man and woman of Israel, a cake of bread, some meat, and a cake of dry grapes.",,,,,,,
9218,"And he put some of the Levites before the ark of the Lord as servants, to keep the acts of the Lord in memory, and to give worship and praise to the Lord, the God of Israel:",,,,,,,
9219,"Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Uzziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel, with corded instruments of music; and Asaph, with brass instruments sounding loudly;",,,,,,,
9220,"And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests, blowing horns all the time before the ark of the agreement of God.",,,,,,,
9221,Then on that day David first made the giving of praise to the Lord the work of Asaph and his brothers.,,,,,,,
9222,"O give praise to the Lord; give honour to his name, talking of his doings among the peoples.",,,,,,,
9223,Let your voice be sounded in songs and melody; let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works.,,,,,,,

9229,"He has kept his agreement in mind for ever, the word which he gave for a thousand generations;",,,,,,,
9230,"The agreement which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac;",,,,,,,
9231,"And he gave it to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an eternal agreement;",,,,,,,
9232,"Saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan, the measured line of your heritage:",,,,,,,
9233,"When you were still small in number, and strange in the land;",,,,,,,
9234,"When they went about from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people;",,,,,,,
9235,"He would not let anyone do them wrong; he even kept back kings because of them,",,,,,,,
9236,"Saying, Put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil, and do my prophets no wrong.",,,,,,,
9237,"Make songs to the Lord, all the earth; give the good news of his salvation day by day.",,,,,,,
9238,"Make clear his glory to the nations, and his wonders to all the peoples.",,,,,,,
9239,"For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; and he is more to be feared than all other gods.",,,,,,,
9240,For all the gods of the nations are false gods; but the Lord made the heavens.,,,,,,,
9241,Honour and glory are before him: strength and joy are in his holy place.,,,,,,,
9242,"Give to the Lord, O you families of the peoples, give to the Lord glory and strength.",,,,,,,
9243,Give to the Lord the glory of his name; take with you an offering and come before him; give worship to the Lord in holy robes.,,,,,,,

9247,"Then let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy before the Lord, for he is come to be the judge of the earth.",,,,,,,
9248,"O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.",,,,,,,
9249,"And say, Be our saviour, O God of our salvation, and let us come back, and give us salvation from the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise.",,,,,,,
9250,"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, for ever and for ever. And all the people said, So be it; and gave praise to the Lord.",,,,,,,
9251,"So he made Asaph and his brothers keep their places there before the ark of the agreement of the Lord, to do whatever had to be done before the ark at all times day by day:",,,,,,,
9252,"And Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, with their brothers, sixty-eight of them, to be door-keepers:",,,,,,,
9253,"And Zadok the priest, with his brothers the priests, before the House of the Lord in the high place at Gibeon;",,,,,,,
9254,"To give burned offerings to the Lord on the altar of burned offerings morning and evening, every day, as it is ordered in the law of the Lord which he gave to Israel;",,,,,,,
9255,"And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were marked out by name to give praise to the Lord, for his mercy is unchanging for ever;",,,,,,,
9256,"And Heman and Jeduthun had horns and brass instruments sounding loudly, and instruments of music for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun were to be at the door.",,,,,,,
9257,"And all the people went away, every man to his house; and David went back to give a blessing to his family.Now when David was living in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, See, I am living in a house of cedar-wood, but the ark of the Lord's agreeme",t is under t,e c,r,ain,of,te,t.
9258,"And Nathan said to David, Do whatever is in your heart, for God is with you.",,,,,,,
9259,"But that same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,",,,,,,,
9260,"Go and say to David my servant, The Lord says, You are not to make me a house for my living-place:",,,,,,,
9261,"For from the day when I took Israel up, till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from tent to tent, and from living-place to living-place.",,,,,,,
9262,"In all the places where I have gone with all Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, whom I made the keepers of my people, Why have you not made for me a house of cedar?",,,,,,,
9263,"So now, say to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people Israel;",,,,,,,
9264,"And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make your name like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.",,,,,,,
9265,"And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel, planting them there, so that they may be in the place which is theirs and never again be moved; and never again will they be made waste by evil men, as they were at first,",,,,,,,
9266,From the time when I put judges over my people Israel; and I will overcome all those who are against you; and I will make you great and the head of a line of kings.,,,,,,,
9267,"And when the time comes for you to go to your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong.",,,,,,,
9268,"He will be the builder of my house, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.",,,,,,,
9269,I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son; and I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him who was before you;,,,,,,,
9270,But I will make his place in my house and in my kingdom certain for ever; and the seat of his authority will never be overturned.,,,,,,,
9271,So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision.,,,,,,,
9272,"Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?",,,,,,,
9273,"And this was only a small thing to you, O God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your servant's family, looking on me as on one of high position, O Lord God.",,,,,,,
9274,What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant.,,,,,,,
9275,"O Lord, because of your servant, and from your heart, you have done all these great things and let them be seen.",,,,,,,
9276,"O Lord, there is no one like you, and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.",,,,,,,
9277,"And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, making his name great and to be feared, driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of Egypt?",,,,,,,
9278,"For your people Israel you made yours for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.",,,,,,,
9279,"And now, Lord, let your words about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever, and do as you have said.",,,,,,,
9280,"So let your words be made certain and your name be made great, when men say, The Lord of armies is the God of Israel; and when the family of David your servant is made strong before you.",,,,,,,
9281,"For you, O my God, have let your servant see that you will make him head of a line of kings; and so it has come into your servant's heart to make his prayer to you.",,,,,,,
9282,"And now, O Lord, you are God, and you have said you will give this good thing to your servant:",,,,,,,
9283,"And now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you; you, O Lord, have given your blessing, and a blessing will be on it for ever.And it came about after this that David made an atta",k on the Phi,ist,n,s a,d ov,rca,e the
9284,"And he overcame Moab, and the Moabites became his servants and gave him offerings.",,,,,,,
9285,"Then David overcame Hadadezer, king of Zobah, near Hamath, when he was going to make his power seen by the river Euphrates.",,,,,,,
9286,"And David took from him a thousand war-carriages and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen: and he had the leg-muscles of all the horses cut, keeping only enough of them for a hundred war-carriages.",,,,,,,
9287,"And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand Aramaeans.",,,,,,,
9288,"Then David put armed forces in Damascus, and the Aramaeans became his servants and gave him offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.",,,,,,,
9289,"And the gold body-covers of the servants of Hadadezer, David took to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
9290,"And from Tibhath and from Cun, towns of Hadadezer, David took a great store of brass, of which Solomon made the great brass water-vessel and the brass pillars and vessels.",,,,,,,
9291,"Now when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah,",,,,,,,
9292,"He sent his son Hadoram to King David, to give him words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou; and he gave him all sorts of vessels of gold and silver and brass.",,,,,,,
9293,"These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold he had taken from all nations; from Edom and Moab and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from Amalek.",,,,,,,
9294,"And when he came back from putting to the sword eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt,",,,,,,,
9295,David put armed forces in all the towns of Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. The Lord made David overcome wherever he went.,,,,,,,
9296,"So David was king over all Israel, judging and giving right decisions for all his people.",,,,,,,
9297,"And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the army; and Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was keeper of the records.",,,,,,,
9298,"And Zadok, the son of Ahitub; and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was the scribe;",,,,,,,
9299,"And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief of those whose places were at the king's side.Now it came about after this that death came to Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, and h",s son became,kin,,n h,s pl,ce.,
9300,"And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, because his father was a friend to me. So David sent men to him, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And the servants of David came to Hanun, to the land of the children o","Ammon, offe",ing,h,m c,mfor,.,
9301,"But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father, by sending comforters to you? is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so tha",they may ov,rco,e,it?,,,
9302,"So Hanun took David's servants, and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle, sent them away.",,,,,,,
9303,"Then certain men went and gave David word of what had been done to them. And he sent out with the purpose of meeting them; for the men were greatly shamed. And the king said, Keep where you are at Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.",,,,,,,
9304,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war-carriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.",,,,,,,
9305,"So with this money they got thirty-two thousand war-carriages, and the help of the king of Maacah and his people, who came and took up their position in front of Medeba. And the children of Ammon came together from their towns for the fight.",,,,,,,
9306,"And David, hearing of it, sent Joab with all the army of fighting-men.",,,,,,,
9307,So the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town; and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field.,,,,,,,
9308,"Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took all the best men of Israel, and put them in line against the Aramaeans;",,,,,,,
9309,"And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon with Abishai, his brother, at their head.",,,,,,,
9310,"And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then come to my help; and if the childrenof Ammon getthe better of you, I will come to yourhelp.",,,,,,,
9311,"Takeheart, andlet us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God; and may the Lord do what seems good to him.",,,,,,,
9312,"So Joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.",,,,,,,
9313,"And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, his brother, and came into the town. Then Joab came back to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
9314,"And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they sent men to get the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River, with Shophach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.",,,,,,,
9315,"And word of this was given to David; and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them. And when David's forces were in position against the Aramaeans, the fight was started.",,,,,,,
9316,"And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven thousand Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and put to death Shophach, the captain of the army.",,,,,,,
9317,"And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants: and the Aramaeans would give no more help to the children of Ammon.Now in the spring, at the time when kings go out to war, Joab",went out at,he,e,d o,the,arm,d for
9318,"And David took the crown of Milcom from off his head; its weight was a talent of gold and it had stones of great price in it; and it was put on David's head, and he took a great store of goods from the town.",,,,,,,
9319,"And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood-cutting instruments, and iron grain-crushers, and axes. And this he did to all the towns of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people went back to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
9320,"Now after this there was war with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Sippai, one of the offspring of the Rephaim; and they were overcome.",,,,,,,
9321,"And again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan, the son of Jair, put to death Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a cloth-worker's rod.",,,,,,,
9322,"And again there was war at Gath, where there was a very tall man, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet; he was one of the offspring of the Rephaim.",,,,,,,
9323,"And when he put shame on Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimea, David's brother, put him to death.",,,,,,,
9324,"These were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath; they came to their death by the hands of David and his servants.Now Satan, designing evil against Israel, put into David's mind the impulse to take the number of Israel.",,,,,,,
9325,"And David said to Joab and the captains of the people, Now let all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, be numbered; and give me word so that I may be certain of their number.",,,,,,,
9326,"And Joab said, May the Lord make his people a hundred times more in number than they are; but, my lord king, are they not all my lord's servants? why would my lord have this done? why will he become a cause of sin to Israel?",,,,,,,
9327,But the king's word was stronger than Joab's. So Joab went out and went through all Israel and came to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
9328,"And Joab gave David the number of all the people; all the men of Israel, able to take up arms, were one million, one hundred thousand men; and those of Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men, able to take up arms.",,,,,,,
9329,"But Levi and Benjamin were not numbered among them, for Joab was disgusted with the king's order.",,,,,,,
9330,And God was not pleased with this thing; so he sent punishment on Israel.,,,,,,,
9331,"Then David said to God, Great has been my sin in doing this; but now, be pleased to take away the sin of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.",,,,,,,
9332,"Then the word of the Lord came to Gad, David's seer, saying,",,,,,,,
9333,"Go and say to David, The Lord says, Three things are offered to you: say which of them you will have, so that I may do it to you.",,,,,,,
9334,"So Gad came to David and said to him, The Lord says, Take whichever you will:",,,,,,,
9335,"Three years when there will not be enough food; or three months of war, when you will go in flight before your haters, being in great danger of the sword; or three days of the sword of the Lord, disease in the land, and the angel of the Lord taking destr",ction throug,al,,he,and,f I,rael.
9336,"And David said to Gad, This is a hard decision for me to make: let me come into the hands of the Lord, for great are his mercies: let me not come into the hands of men.",,,,,,,
9337,"So the Lord sent disease on Israel, causing the death of seventy thousand men.",,,,,,,
9338,"And God sent an angel to Jerusalem for its destruction: and when he was about to do so, the Lord saw, and had regret for the evil, and said to the angel of destruction, It is enough; do no more. Now the angel of the Lord was by the grain-floor of Ornan t",e Jebusite.,,,,,,
9339,"And David, lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord there between earth and heaven, with an uncovered sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the responsible men, clothed in haircloth, went down on their faces.",,,,,,,
9340,"And David said to God, Was it not I who gave the order for the people to be numbered? It is I who have done the sin and the great wrong; but these are only sheep; what have they done? let your hand, O Lord God, be lifted up against me and against my fami","y, but not a",ain,t,you,peo,le,o sen
9341,Then the angel of the Lord gave orders to Gad to say to David that he was to go and put up an altar to the Lord on the grain-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.,,,,,,,
9342,"And David went up, as Gad had said in the name of the Lord.",,,,,,,
9343,"And Ornan, turning back, saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him went to a secret place. Now Ornan was crushing his grain.",,,,,,,
9344,"And when David came, Ornan, looking, saw him, and came out from the grain-floor and went down on his face to the earth before him.",,,,,,,
9345,"Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place where this grain-floor is, so that I may put up an altar here to the Lord: let me have it for its full price; so that this disease may be stopped among the people.",,,,,,,
9346,"And Ornan said to David, Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems right to him. See, I give you the oxen for burned offerings and the grain-cleaning instruments for fire-wood, and the grain for the meal offering; I give it all.",,,,,,,
9347,"And King David said to Ornan, No; I will certainly give you the full price for it, because I will not take for the Lord what is yours, or give a burned offering without payment.",,,,,,,
9348,So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.,,,,,,,
9349,"And David put up an altar there to the Lord, offering burned offerings and peace-offerings with prayers to the Lord; and he gave him an answer from heaven, sending fire on the altar of burned offering.",,,,,,,
9350,"Then the Lord gave orders to the angel, and he put back his sword into its cover.",,,,,,,
9351,"At that time, when David saw that the Lord had given him an answer on the grain-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made an offering there.",,,,,,,
9352,"For the House of the Lord, which Moses had made in the waste land, and the altar of burned offerings, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.",,,,,,,
9353,"But David was not able to go before it to get directions from the Lord, so great was his fear of the sword of the angel of the Lord.Then David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar for Israel's burned offerings.",,,,,,,
9354,"And David gave orders to get together all the men from strange lands who were in the land of Israel; and he put stone-cutters to work, cutting stones for building the house of God.",,,,,,,
9355,"And he got together a great store of iron, for the nails for the doors and for the joins; and brass, more in weight than might be measured;",,,,,,,
9356,"And cedar- trees without number, for the Zidonians and the men of Tyre came with a great amount of cedar-trees for David.",,,,,,,
9357,"And David said, Solomon my son is young and untested, and the house which is to be put up for the Lord is to be very great, a thing of wonder and glory through all countries; so I will make ready what is needed for it. So David got ready a great store of",material bef,re,i,de,th.,,
9358,"Then he sent for his son Solomon, and gave him orders for the building of a house for the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
9359,"And David said to Solomon, My son, it was my desire to put up a house for the name of the Lord my God.",,,,,,,
9360,"But the word of the Lord came to me saying, You have taken lives without number and made great wars; I will not let you be the builder of a house for my name, because of the lives you have taken on the earth before my eyes.",,,,,,,
9361,"But you will have a son who will be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from wars on every side. His name will be Solomon, and in his time I will give Israel peace and quiet;",,,,,,,
9362,"He will be the builder of a house for my name; he will be to me a son, and I will be to him a father; and I will make the seat of his rule over Israel certain for ever.",,,,,,,
9363,"Now, my son, may the Lord be with you; and may you do well, and put up the house of the Lord your God, as he has said of you.",,,,,,,
9364,"Only may the Lord give you wisdom, and knowledge of his orders for Israel, so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God.",,,,,,,
9365,"And all will go well for you, if you take care to keep the laws and the rules which the Lord gave to Moses for Israel: be strong and take heart; have no fear and do not be troubled.",,,,,,,
9366,"Now see, poor though I am, I have got ready for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver; and a weight of brass and iron greater than may be measured; and wood and stone have I made ready, and you may put m",re to it.,,,,,,
9367,"And you have a great number of workmen, cutters and workers of stone and wood, and experts in every sort of work,",,,,,,,
9368,"In gold and silver and brass and iron more than may be numbered. Up! then, and to work; and may the Lord be with you.",,,,,,,
9369,"Then David gave orders to all the chiefs of Israel to give their help to Solomon his son, saying,",,,,,,,
9370,"Is not the Lord your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for the Lord has given the people of the land into my hands, and the land is overcome before the Lord and before his people.",,,,,,,
9371,"Now give your heart and soul to the worship of the Lord your God; and get to work on the building of the holy place of the Lord God, so that you may put the ark of the Lord's agreement and the holy vessels of God in the house which is to be made for the",ame of the L,rd.,o,Da,id w,s o,d and
9372,"And he got together all the chiefs of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.",,,,,,,
9373,"And the Levites, all those of thirty years old and over, were numbered; and the number of them, by heads, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.",,,,,,,
9374,"Of these, twenty-four thousand were to be overseers of the work of the house of the Lord, and six thousand were judges and men of authority;",,,,,,,
9375,"Four thousand were door-keepers; and four thousand gave praise to the Lord with the instruments which I made, said David, for giving praise.",,,,,,,
9376,"And David put them into divisions under the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.",,,,,,,
9377,Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.,,,,,,,
9378,"The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham and Joel, three.",,,,,,,
9379,"The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three; these were the heads of the families of Ladan.",,,,,,,
9380,"And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zizah and Jeush and Beriah; these four were the sons of Shimei.",,,,,,,
9381,"Jahath was the chief and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah had only a small number of sons, so they were grouped together as one family.",,,,,,,
9382,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.",,,,,,,
9383,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was made separate and holy, he and his sons for ever, for the care of the most holy things and the burning of offerings before the Lord, to do his work and give blessings in his name for ever.",,,,,,,
9384,"And the sons of Moses, the man of God, were put into the list of the tribe of Levi.",,,,,,,
9385,The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.,,,,,,,
9386,The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the first.,,,,,,,
9387,"And the sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the first; and Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had a great number.",,,,,,,
9388,The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the first.,,,,,,,

9391,The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.,,,,,,,

9393,"The sons of Mushi: Mahli and Eder and Jeremoth, three.",,,,,,,
9394,"These were the sons of Levi, grouped by families, the heads of the families of those who were numbered by name, by heads, all those of twenty years old and over who did the work of the house of the Lord.",,,,,,,
9395,"For David said, The Lord, the God of Israel, has given his people rest, and he has made his resting-place in Jerusalem for ever;",,,,,,,
9396,"And from now, there will be no need for the House of the Lord, and the vessels used in it, to be moved about by the Levites.",,,,,,,
9397,"So among the last acts of David was the numbering of the sons of Levi, from twenty years old and over.",,,,,,,
9398,"Their place was by the side of the sons of Aaron in all the work of the house of the Lord, in the open spaces and in the rooms, in the making clean of all the holy things, in doing all the work of the house of the Lord,",,,,,,,
9399,"The holy bread was in their care, and the crushed grain for the meal offering, of unleavened cakes or meal cooked over the fire or in water; they had control of all sorts of weights and measures;",,,,,,,

9402,"And they had the care of the Tent of meeting and the holy place, under the direction of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the work of the house of the Lord.Now the divisions into which the sons of Aaron were grouped were these: the sons of Aaron, Nad","b and Abihu,",Ele,z,r a,d It,ama,.

9405,"And there were more chiefs among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar; and this is how they were grouped: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, all heads of families; and of the sons of Ithamar, heads of families, there were eight.",,,,,,,
9406,"So they were put into groups, by the Lord's decision, one with another; for there were rulers of the holy place and rulers of the house of God among the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.",,,,,,,
9407,"And Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was a Levite, put down their names in writing, the king being present with the rulers, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites; o",e family bei,g t,k,n f,r El,aza,and

9629,"And he made ten washing-vessels, putting five on the right side and five on the left; such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them; but the great water-vessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves.",,,,,,,
9630,"And he made the ten gold supports for the lights, as directions had been given for them, and he put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left.",,,,,,,
9631,"He made ten tables, and put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made a hundred gold basins.",,,,,,,
9632,"Then he made the open space for the priests, and the great open space and its doors, plating the doors with brass.",,,,,,,
9633,"He put the great water-vessel on the right side of the house to the east, facing south.",,,,,,,
9634,And Huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins. So he came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of God:,,,,,,,
9635,"The two pillars, and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars, and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars;",,,,,,,
9636,"And the four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars.",,,,,,,
9637,And he made the ten bases and the ten washing- vessels which were on the bases;,,,,,,,
9638,The great water-vessel with the twelve oxen under it.,,,,,,,
9639,"All the pots and the spades and the meat-hooks and their vessels, which Huram, who was as his father, made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass.",,,,,,,
9640,"The king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, in the soft earth between Succoth and Zeredah.",,,,,,,
9641,"So Solomon made all these vessels, a very great store of them, and the weight of the brass used was not measured.",,,,,,,
9642,"And Solomon made all the vessels used in the house of God, the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed,",,,,,,,
9643,"And the supports for the lights with their lights, to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room, of the best gold;",,,,,,,
9644,"The flowers and the vessels for the lights and the instruments used for them, were all of gold; it was the best gold.",,,,,,,
9645,"The scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, of the best gold; and the inner doors of the house, opening into the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, were all of gold.So all the work which Solomon did for the house of the Lord",was complete,An,,olo,on t,ok,he ho
9646,"Then Solomon sent for all the responsible men of Israel, all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of Israel, to come to Jerusalem and take the ark of the Lord's agreement up out of the town of David, which is Zion.",,,,,,,
9647,And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month.,,,,,,,
9648,"All the responsible men of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.",,,,,,,
9649,"They took up the ark and the Tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent; all these the priests, the Levites, took up.",,,,,,,
9650,"And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there with him, were before the ark, making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered.",,,,,,,
9651,"And the priests took the ark of the Lord's agreement and put it in its place, in the inner room of the house, in the most holy place, under the wings of the winged ones.",,,,,,,
9652,"For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was, covering the ark and its rods.",,,,,,,
9653,The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place before the inmost room; but they were not seen from outside; and there they are to this day.,,,,,,,
9654,"Nothing was in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt.",,,,,,,

9656,"And the Levites who made the music, all of them, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and brothers, robed in fair linen, were in their places with their brass and corded instruments at the east side of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty prie",ts blowing h,rns,),,,,

9661,"And he said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who himself gave his word to my father David, and with his strong hand has made his word come true, saying,",,,,,,,
9662,"From the day when I took my people out of the land of Egypt, no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting-place of my name; and I took no man to be a ruler over my people Israel;",,,,,,,
9663,"But now I have made selection of Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and of David, to be over my people Israel.",,,,,,,
9664,"Now it was in the heart of my father David to put up a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
9665,"But the Lord said to David my father, You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name:",,,,,,,

9667,"And the Lord has kept his word; for I have taken my father David's place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel, as the Lord gave his word; and I have made the house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel.",,,,,,,

9736,Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth by the sea in the land of Edom.,,,,,,,
9737,"And Huram sent him, by his servants, ships and experienced seamen, who went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and came back with four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they took to King Solomon.Now the queen of Sheba, hearing great things of S","lomon, came",o J,r,sal,m to,put,his w

9747,"And with the sandal-wood the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody; never before had such been seen in the land of Judah.",,,,,,,
9748,"And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what she had taken to the king. So she went back to her country with her servants.",,,,,,,
9749,Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents;,,,,,,,
9750,"And in addition to what he got from traders of different sorts, all the kings of Arabia and the rulers of the country gave gold and silver to Solomon.",,,,,,,

9756,"All King Solomon's drinking- vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold: no one gave a thought to silver in the days of Solomon.",,,,,,,

9765,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not recorded in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh, and in the visions of Iddo the seer about Jeroboam, the son of Nebat?",,,,,,,

9771,"And he said to them, Come to me again after three days. So the people went away.",,,,,,,
9772,"Then King Rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with Solomon his father when he was living, and said, In your opinion, what answer am I to give to this people?",,,,,,,
9773,"And they said to him, If you are kind to this people, pleasing them and saying good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.",,,,,,,
9774,"But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men, but went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him.",,,,,,,
9775,"And he said to them, What is your opinion? What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me, Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us?",,,,,,,
9776,"And the young men of his generation said to him, This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying, Your father put a hard yoke on us, but will you make it less; say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's body;",,,,,,,
9777,"If my father put a hard yoke on you, I will make it harder: my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give you blows with snakes.",,,,,,,
9778,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had given orders, saying, Come to me again on the third day.",,,,,,,
9779,"And the king gave them a rough answer. So King Rehoboam gave no attention to the suggestion of the old men,",,,,,,,
9780,"But gave them the answer put forward by the young men, saying, My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder; my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.",,,,,,,
9781,"So the king did not give ear to the people; for this came about by the purpose of God, so that the Lord might give effect to his word which he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.",,,,,,,
9782,"And when all Israel saw that the king would give no attention to them, the people in answer said to the king, What part have we in David? what is our heritage in the son of Jesse? every man to your tents, O Israel; now see to your house, David. So all Is",ael went to,hei,,ent,.,,
9783,But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.,,,,,,,

9796,"And in every town he put stores of body-covers and spears, and made them very strong. And Judah and Benjamin were his.",,,,,,,
9797,And the priests and Levites who were in all Israel came together to him from every part of their country.,,,,,,,
9798,"For the Levites gave up their living-places and their property, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons had sent them away, not letting them be priests to the Lord;",,,,,,,
9799,"And he himself made priests for the high places, and for the images of he-goats and oxen which he had made.",,,,,,,
9800,"And after them, from all the tribes of Israel, all those whose hearts were fixed and true to the Lord, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to make offerings to the Lord, the God of their fathers.",,,,,,,
9801,"So they went on increasing the power of the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, strong for three years; and for three years they went in the ways of David and Solomon.",,,,,,,
9802,"And Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David and of Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, the son of Jesse;",,,,,,,
9803,"And she had sons by him, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.",,,,,,,
9804,"And after her he took Maacah, the daughter of Absalom; and she had Abijah and Attai and Ziza and Shelomith by him.",,,,,,,
9805,"Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, was dearer to Rehoboam than all his wives and his servant-wives: (for he had eighteen wives and sixty servant-wives, and was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)",,,,,,,
9806,"Rehoboam made Abijah, the son of Maacah, chief and ruler among his brothers, for it was his purpose to make him king.",,,,,,,
9807,"And in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of Judah and Benjamin; and he gave them a great store of food, and took wives for them.Now when Rehoboam's position as king had been made certain, and he was strong, h",gave up the,law,o,th,Lor,", a",d all
9808,"Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because of their sin against the Lord,",,,,,,,
9809,With twelve hundred war-carriages and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people who came with him out of Egypt were more than might be numbered: Lubim and Sukkiim and Ethiopians.,,,,,,,
9810,"And he took the walled towns of Judah, and came as far as Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
9811,"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the chiefs of Judah, who had come together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, The Lord has said, Because you have given me up, I have given you up into the hands of Shishak.",,,,,,,
9812,"Then the chiefs of Israel and the king made themselves low and said, The Lord is upright.",,,,,,,
9813,"And the Lord, seeing that they had made themselves low, said to Shemaiah, They have made themselves low: I will not send destruction on them, but in a short time I will give them salvation, and will not let loose my wrath on Jerusalem by the hand of Shis",ak.,,,,,,
9814,"But still they will become his servants, so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands.",,,,,,,
9815,"So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the Lord and the king's house: he took everything away, and with the rest the gold body-covers which Solomon had made.",,,,,,,
9816,And in their place King Rehoboam had other body-covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the king's house.,,,,,,,
9817,"And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room.",,,,,,,
9818,"And when he made himself low, the wrath of the Lord was turned back from him, and complete destruction did not come on him, for there was still some good in Judah.",,,,,,,
9819,"So King Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem and was ruling there. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was ruling for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put",his name the,e;,n,hi,mot,er',name
9820,And he did evil because his heart was not true to the Lord.,,,,,,,
9821,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not recorded in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.",,,,,,,
9822,"And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David; and Abijah his son became king in his place.In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.",,,,,,,
9823,"He was king in Jerusalem for three years; his mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.",,,,,,,
9824,"And Abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war, four hundred thousand of his best men; and Jeroboam put his forces in line against him, eight hundred thousand of his best men of war.",,,,,,,
9825,"And Abijah took up his position on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Give ear to me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:",,,,,,,
9826,"Is it not clear to you that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the rule over Israel to David and to his sons for ever, by an agreement made with salt?",,,,,,,
9827,"But Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon, the son of David, took up arms against his lord.",,,,,,,
9828,"And certain foolish and good-for-nothing men were joined with him, and made themselves strong against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and untested and not able to keep them back.",,,,,,,
9829,"And now it is your purpose to put yourselves against the authority which the Lord has put into the hands of the sons of David, and you are a very great number, and you have with you the gold oxen which Jeroboam made to be your gods.",,,,,,,
9830,"And after driving out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, have you not made priests for yourselves as the people of other lands do? so that anyone who comes to make himself priest by offering an ox or seven sheep, may be a priest",f those who,re,o,god,.,,
9831,"But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not been turned away from him; we have priests who do the work of the Lord, even the sons of Aaron and the Levites in their places;",,,,,,,
9832,By whom burned offerings and perfumes are sent up in smoke before the Lord every morning and every evening; and they put out the holy bread on its table and the gold support for the lights with its lights burning every evening; for we keep the orders giv,n to us by t,e L,r,ou,God,bu,you
9833,"And now God is with us at our head, and his priests with their loud horns sounding against you. O children of Israel, do not make war on the Lord, the God of your fathers, for it will not go well for you.",,,,,,,
9834,"But Jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back, so some were facing Judah and others were stationed secretly at their back.",,,,,,,
9835,"And Judah, turning their faces, saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back; and they gave a cry for help to the Lord, while the priests were sounding their horns.",,,,,,,
9836,"And the men of Judah gave a loud cry; and at their cry, God put fear into Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.",,,,,,,
9837,"And the children of Israel went in flight before Judah, and God gave them up into their hands.",,,,,,,
9838,And Abijah and his people put them to death with great destruction: five hundred thousand of the best of Israel were put to the sword.,,,,,,,
9839,"So at that time the children of Israel were overcome, and the children of Judah got the better of them, because they put their faith in the Lord, the God of their fathers.",,,,,,,
9840,"And Abijah went after Jeroboam and took some of his towns, Beth-el with its small towns and Jeshanah with its small towns and Ephron with its small towns.",,,,,,,
9841,And Jeroboam did not get back his power again in the life-time of Abijah; and the Lord sent death on him.,,,,,,,
9842,"But Abijah became great, and had fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.",,,,,,,
9843,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his sayings, are recorded in the account of the prophet Iddo.So Abijah went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David, and Asa his son became king in his place; in",is time the,and,w,s q,iet,or,en ye
9844,And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God;,,,,,,,
9845,"For he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places, and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down;",,,,,,,
9846,"And he made Judah go after the Lord, the God of their fathers, and keep his laws and his orders.",,,,,,,
9847,And he took away the high places and the sun-images from all the towns of Judah; and the kingdom was quiet under his rule.,,,,,,,
9848,"He made walled towns in Judah, for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years, because the Lord had given him rest.",,,,,,,
9849,"He said to Judah, Let us make these towns, building walls round them with towers and doors and locks. The land is still ours, because we have been true to the Lord our God; we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side. So they went on",uilding and,ll,e,t w,ll f,r t,em.
9850,"And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of Judah armed with body-covers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand of Benjamin armed with body-covers and bows; all these were men of war.",,,,,,,
9851,"And Zerah the Ethiopian, with an army of a million, and three hundred war-carriages, came out against them to Mareshah.",,,,,,,
9852,"And Asa went out against him, and they put their forces in position in the valley north of Mareshah.",,,,,,,
9853,"And Asa made prayer to the Lord his God and said, Lord, you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength; come to our help, O Lord our God, for our hope is in you, and in your name we have come out against this great army. O L","rd, you are",ur,o,; l,t no,ma,'s po
9854,So the Lord sent fear on the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah; and the Ethiopians went in flight.,,,,,,,
9855,"And Asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as Gerar; and so great was the destruction among the Ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again, for they were broken before the Lord and before his army; and they t",ok away a gr,at,m,unt,of t,eir,goods
9856,"And they overcame all the towns round Gerar, because the Lord sent fear on them; and they took away their goods from the towns, for there were stores of wealth in them.",,,,,,,
9857,"And they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle, and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and wentback to Jerusalem.And the spirit of God came on Azariah, the son of Oded;",,,,,,,
9858,"And he came face to face with Asa and said to him, Give ear to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin: the Lord is with you while you are with him; if your heart's desire is for him, he will be near you, but if you give him up, he will give you up.",,,,,,,
9859,"Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without the law;",,,,,,,
9860,"But when in their trouble they were turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, searching after him, he let their search be rewarded.",,,,,,,
9861,"In those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in, but great trouble was on all the people of the lands.",,,,,,,
9862,"And they were broken by divisions, nation against nation and town against town, because God sent all sorts of trouble on them.",,,,,,,
9863,"But be you strong and let not your hands be feeble, for your work will be rewarded.",,,,,,,
9864,"And Asa, hearing these words of Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet, took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the towns which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he made new a",ain the alta,of,t,e L,rd i,fr,nt of
9865,And he got together all Judah and Benjamin and those of Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon who were living with them; for numbers of them came to him out of Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.,,,,,,,
9866,"So they came together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the rule of Asa.",,,,,,,
9867,"And that day they made offerings to the Lord of the things they had taken in war, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.",,,,,,,
9868,"And they made an agreement to be true to the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and all their soul;",,,,,,,
9869,"And that anyone, small or great, man or woman, who was not true to the Lord, the God of Israel, would be put to death.",,,,,,,
9870,"And they made an oath to the Lord, with a loud voice, sounding wind-instruments and horns.",,,,,,,
9871,"And all Judah was glad because of the oath, for they had taken it with all their heart, turning to the Lord with all their desire; and he was with them and gave them rest on every side.",,,,,,,
9872,"And Asa would not let Maacah, his mother, be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream Kidron.",,,,,,,
9873,But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life.,,,,,,,
9874,"He took into the house of God all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels.",,,,,,,
9875,"And there was no more war till the thirty-fifth year of the rule of Asa.In the thirty-sixth year of the rule of Asa, Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah.",,,,,,,
9876,"Then Asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the Lord's house and of the king's store-house, and sent to Ben-hadad, king of Aram, at Damascus, saying,",,,,,,,
9877,"Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father: see, I have sent you silver and gold; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may give up attacking me.",,,,,,,
9878,"And Ben-hadad did as King Asa said, and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel, attacking Ijon and Dan and Abel-maim, and all the store-towns of Naphtali.",,,,,,,
9879,"Then Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and let his work come to an end.",,,,,,,
9880,"Then King Asa, with all Judah, took away the stones and wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and he made use of them for building Geba and Mizpah.",,,,,,,
9881,"At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa, king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have put your faith in the king of Aram and not in the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has got away out of your hands.",,,,,,,
9882,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a very great army, with war-carriages and horsemen more than might be numbered? but because your faith was in the Lord, he gave them up into your hands.",,,,,,,
9883,"For the eyes of the Lord go this way and that, through all the earth, letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him. In this you have done foolishly, for from now you will have wars.",,,,,,,
9884,"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, burning with wrath against him because of this thing. And at the same time Asa was cruel to some of the people.",,,,,,,
9885,"Now the acts of Asa, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.",,,,,,,
9886,"In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, Asa had a very bad disease of the feet; but he did not go to the Lord for help in his disease, but to medical men.",,,,,,,
9887,"So Asa went to rest with his fathers, and death came to him in the forty-first year of his rule.",,,,,,,
9888,"And they put him into the resting-place which he had made for himself in the town of David, in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices, made by the perfumer's art, and they made a great burning for him.And Jehoshaphat his son became king in h","s place, and",mad,,ims,lf s,ron,agai
9889,"He put forces in all the walled towns of Judah, and responsible chiefs in the land of Judah and in the towns of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.",,,,,,,
9890,"And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he went in the early ways of his father, not turning to the Baals,",,,,,,,
9891,"But turning to the God of his father and keeping his laws, and not doing as Israel did.",,,,,,,
9892,"So the Lord made his kingdom strong; and all Judah gave offerings to Jehoshaphat, and he had great wealth and honour.",,,,,,,
9893,His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord; and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of Judah.,,,,,,,
9894,"In the third year of his rule he sent Benhail and Obadiah and Zechariah and Nethanel and Micaiah, his captains, as teachers into the towns of Judah;",,,,,,,
9895,"And with them, Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah and Tobijah and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and Elishama and Jehoram the priests.",,,,,,,
9896,And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them; they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people.,,,,,,,
9897,"And the fear of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round Judah, so that they made no wars against Jehoshaphat.",,,,,,,
9898,"And some of the Philistines took offerings to Jehoshaphat, and made him payments of silver; and the Arabians gave him flocks, seven thousand, seven hundred sheep, and seven thousand, seven hundred he-goats.",,,,,,,
9899,"Jehoshaphat became greater and greater, and made strong towers and store-towns in Judah.",,,,,,,
9900,"He had much property in the towns of Judah; he had forces of armed men, great and strong, in Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
9901,"This is the number of them, listed by their families, the captains of thousands of Judah: Adnah, the captain, and with him three hundred thousand men of war;",,,,,,,
9902,"Second to him Jehohanan, the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;",,,,,,,
9903,"After him Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who freely gave himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand men of war;",,,,,,,
9904,"And the captains of Benjamin: Eliada, a great man of war, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and body- covers;",,,,,,,
9905,"And after him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand trained for war.",,,,,,,
9906,"These were the men who were waiting on the king, in addition to those placed by the king in the walled towns through all Judah.Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour, and his son was married to Ahab's daughter.",,,,,,,
9907,"And after some years he went down to Samaria to see Ahab. And Ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him, putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen; and he got Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramoth-gilead.",,,,,,,
9908,"For Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he said, I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.",,,,,,,
9909,"Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord.",,,,,,,
9910,"So the king of Israel got together all the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And they said, Go up: for God will give it into the hands of the king.",,,,,,,
9911,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions?",,,,,,,
9912,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord, but I have no love for him, because he has never been a prophet of good to me, but only of evil: he is Micaiah, the son of Imla. And Jehoshaph","t said, Let",ot,h,ki,g sa,so,
9913,"Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imla.",,,,,,,
9914,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.",,,,,,,
9915,"And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely.",,,,,,,
9916,"And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king.",,,,,,,
9917,"Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs, and say good things.",,,,,,,
9918,"And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say.",,,,,,,
9919,"When he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And he said, Go up, and it will go well for you; and they will be given up into your hands.",,,,,,,
9920,"And the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord?",,,,,,,
9921,"Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace.",,,,,,,
9922,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me, but of evil?",,,,,,,
9923,"Then he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, and all the army of heaven in their places, at his right hand and at his left.",,,,,,,
9924,"And the Lord said, How may Ahab, king of Israel, be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another.",,,,,,,
9925,"Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick. And the Lord said to him, How?",,,,,,,
9926,"And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so.",,,,,,,
9927,"And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; and the Lord has said evil against you.",,,,,,,
9928,"Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of his face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you?",,,,,,,
9929,"And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe.",,,,,,,
9930,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son;",,,,,,,
9931,"And say, By the king's order this man is to be put in prison, and given prison food till I come back in peace.",,,,,,,
9932,"And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me.",,,,,,,
9933,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead.",,,,,,,
9934,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress, and they went to the fight.",,,,,,,
9935,"Now the king of Aram had given orders to the captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.",,,,,,,
9936,"So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is the king of Israel. And turning about, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry, and the Lord came to his help, and God sent them away from him.",,,,,,,
9937,"Now when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him.",,,,,,,
9938,"And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the","rmy, for I a",ba,l,wo,nded,,
9939,"But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king of Israel was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans till the evening; and by sundown he was dead.And Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went back to his house in Jerusalem in pea",e.,,,,,,
9940,"And Jehu, the son of Hanani the seer, went to King Jehoshaphat and said to him, Is it right for you to go to the help of evil-doers, loving the haters of the Lord? because of this, the wrath of the Lord has come on you.",,,,,,,
9941,"But still there is some good in you, for you have put away the wood pillars out of the land, and have given your heart to the worship of God.",,,,,,,
9942,"And Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people, from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, guiding them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers.",,,,,,,
9943,"And he put judges through all the land, in every walled town of Judah,",,,,,,,
9944,"And said to the judges, Take care what you do, for you are judging not for man but for the Lord, and he is with you in the decisions you give.",,,,,,,
9945,"So now let the fear of the Lord be in you; do your work with care; for in the Lord our God there is no evil, or respect for high position, or taking of payment to do wrong.",,,,,,,
9946,"Then in Jerusalem he gave authority to certain of the Levites and the priests and the heads of families of Israel to give decisions for the Lord, and in the causes of those living in Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
9947,"And he gave them their orders, saying, You are to do your work in the fear of the Lord, in good faith and with a true heart.",,,,,,,
9948,"And if any cause comes before you from your brothers living in their towns, where the death punishment is in question, or where there are questions of law or order, or rules or decisions, make them take care that they are not in the wrong before the Lord",so that wra,h m,y,not,come,on,ou an

9950,"And they came to Jehoshaphat with the news, saying, A great army is moving against you from Edom across the sea; and now they are in Hazazon-tamar (which is En-gedi).",,,,,,,
9951,"Then Jehoshaphat, in his fear, went to the Lord for directions, and gave orders all through Judah for the people to go without food.",,,,,,,
9952,And Judah came together to make prayer for help from the Lord; from every town of Judah they came to give worship to the Lord.,,,,,,,
9953,"And Jehoshaphat took his place in the meeting of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord in front of the new open space,",,,,,,,
9954,"And said, O Lord, the God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? are you not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hands are power and strength so that no one is able to keep his place against you.",,,,,,,
9955,"Did you not, O Lord our God, after driving out the people of this land before your people Israel, give it to the seed of Abraham, your friend, for ever?",,,,,,,
9956,"And they made it their living-place, building there a holy house for your name, and saying,",,,,,,,
9957,"If evil comes on us, the sword, or punishment, or disease, or need of food, we will come to this house and to you, (for your name is in this house,) crying to you in our trouble, and you will give us salvation in answer to our cry.",,,,,,,
9958,"And now, see, the children of Ammon and Moab and the people of Mount Seir, whom you kept Israel from attacking when they came out of Egypt, so that turning to one side they did not send destruction on them:",,,,,,,

9972,"And Judah came to the watchtower of the waste land, and looking in the direction of the army, they saw only dead bodies stretched on the earth; no living man was to be seen.",,,,,,,
9973,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their goods from them, they saw beasts in great numbers, and wealth and clothing and things of value, more than they were able to take away; all this they took for themselves, and they were three days gett","ng it away,",her,,as,o mu,h.,

9976,So they came to Jerusalem with corded instruments and wind-instruments into the house of the Lord.,,,,,,,
9977,"And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the lands, when they had news of how the Lord made war on those who came against Israel.",,,,,,,
9978,"So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for the Lord gave him rest on every side.",,,,,,,
9979,"And Jehoshaphat was king over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling for twenty-five years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.",,,,,,,

10020,But let no one come into the house of the Lord but only the priests and those of the Levites who have work to do there; they may go in for they are holy; but the rest of the people are to keep the orders of the Lord.,,,,,,,
10021,"And the Levites are to make a circle round the king, every man being armed; and any man who comes into the house is to be put to death; you are to keep with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.",,,,,,,

10023,Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's and which were kept in the house of God.,,,,,,,

10026,"Now Athaliah, hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king, came to the people in the house of the Lord:",,,,,,,

10031,"Then all the people went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down, and its altars and images broken up; and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they put to death before the altars.",,,,,,,
10032,"And Jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the Lord into the hands of the priests and the Levites, who had been grouped in divisions by David to make burned offerings to the Lord, as it is recorded in the law of Moses, with joy and song as Da",id had said.,,,,,,
10033,"And he put door-keepers at the doors of the Lord's house, to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in.",,,,,,,
10034,"Then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the higher doorway into the king's house, and put the king on the seat o",the kingdom,,,,,,
10035,"So all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.",,,,,,,
10036,And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Jehoiada the priest was living.,,,,,,,

10038,Now after this Joash had a desire to put the house of the Lord into good order again;,,,,,,,
10039,"And getting together the priests and Levites, he said to them, Go out into the towns of Judah year by year, and get from all Israel money to keep the house of your God in good condition; and see that this is done without loss of time. The Levites, howeve",", were slow",n d,i,g s,.,,

10042,So at the king's order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the Lord.,,,,,,,
10043,"And an order was sent out through all Judah and Jerusalem that payment was to be made to the Lord of the tax which Moses, the servant of God, had put on Israel in the waste land.",,,,,,,
10044,"And all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest, till they had all given.",,,,,,,
10045,"So when the chest was taken to the king's servants by the Levites, and they saw that there was much money in it, the king's scribe and the chief priest's servant took the money out, and put the chest back in its place. They did this day by day, and got t",gether a gre,t a,o,nt,f mo,ey.,
10046,"Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the Lord's house, and with it they got wall-builders and woodworkers and metal-workers to put the house of the Lord in good order again.",,,,,,,
10047,"So the workmen did their work, making good what was damaged and building up the house of God till it was strong and beautiful again.",,,,,,,
10048,"And when the work was done, they took the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the Lord, all the vessels needed for the offerings, the spoons and the vessels of gold and silver. And as long a",Jehoiada wa,li,i,"g,",he r,gul,r bur

10051,"Now after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and went down on their faces before the king. Then the king gave ear to them.",,,,,,,
10052,"And they gave up the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images; and because of this sin of theirs, wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
10053,"And the Lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him; and they gave witness against them, but they would not give ear.",,,,,,,
10054,"Then the spirit of God came on Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, and, getting up before the people, he said to them, God has said, Why do you go against the orders of the Lord, so that everything goes badly for you? because you have given up the","Lord, he has",giv,n,you,up.,,
10055,"But when they had made a secret design against him, he was stoned with stones, by the king's order, in the outer square of the Lord's house.",,,,,,,
10056,"So King Joash did not keep in mind how good Jehoiada his father had been to him, but put his son to death. And in the hour of his death he said, May the Lord see it and take payment!",,,,,,,
10057,"Now in the spring, the army of the Aramaeans came up against him; they came against Judah and Jerusalem, putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of Damascus.",,,,,,,
10058,"For though the army of Aram was only a small one, the Lord gave a very great army into their hands, because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers. So they put into effect the punishment of Joash.",,,,,,,
10059,"And when they had gone away from him, (for he was broken with disease,) his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they put him to death on his bed; and they put his body into the earth in th",town of Dav,"d,",u,no,in,he,estin

10064,"But he did not put their children to death, for he kept the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses, saying, The fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers, but a man is to be put to death",or the sin w,ich,h,hi,self,has,done.

10068,"But go yourself, and be strong in war; God will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you; for God has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers.",,,,,,,
10069,"Then Amaziah said to the man of God, But what is to be done about the hundred talents which I have given for the armed band of Israel? And the man of God in answer said, God is able to give you much more than this.",,,,,,,
10070,"So Amaziah, separating the armed band which had come to him from Ephraim, sent them back again; which made them very angry with Judah, and they went back burning with wrath.",,,,,,,
10071,"Then Amaziah took heart, and went out at the head of his people and came to the Valley of Salt, where he put to death ten thousand of the children of Seir;",,,,,,,
10072,"And ten thousand more the children of Israel took living, and made them go up to the top of the rock, pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall.",,,,,,,
10073,"But the men of the band which Amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight, made attacks on the towns of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods.",,,,,,,
10074,"Now when Amaziah came back from the destruction of the Edomites, he took the gods of the children of Seir and made them his gods, worshipping them and burning offerings before them.",,,,,,,
10075,"And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, Why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands?",,,,,,,
10076,"But while he was talking to him the king said to him, Have we made you one of the king's government? say no more, or it will be the cause of your death.

10086,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, are they not recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?",,,,,,,
10087,"Now from the time when Amaziah gave up worshipping the Lord, they made secret designs against him in Jerusalem; and he went in flight to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him and put him to death there.",,,,,,,

10091,"He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done.",,,,,,,
10092,"He gave himself to searching after God in the days of Zechariah, who made men wise in the fear of God; and as long as he was true to the Lord, God made things go well for him.",,,,,,,

10097,"And he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water, for he had much cattle, in the low hills and in the table land; and he had farmers and vine-keepers in the mountains and in the fertile land, for he was a lover of farming.",,,,,,,
10098,"In addition, Uzziah had an army of fighting-men who went out to war in bands, as they had been listed by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.",,,,,,,
10099,"The heads of families, the strong men of war, were two thousand, six hundred.",,,,,,,

10101,And Uzziah had all these forces armed with body-covers and spears and head-covers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands.,,,,,,,
10102,"And in Jerusalem he made machines, the invention of expert men, to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones. And his name was honoured far and wide; for he was greatly helped till he was strong.",,,,,,,
10103,"But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up in pride, causing his destruction; and he did evil against the Lord his God; for he went into the Temple of the Lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes.",,,,,,,
10104,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty of the Lord's priests, who were strong men;",,,,,,,
10105,"And they made protests to Uzziah the king, and said to him, The burning of perfumes, Uzziah, is not your business but that of the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been made holy for this work: go out of the holy place, for you have done wrong, and it",will not be,o y,u,ho,our,efo,e God

10107,"And Azariah, the chief priest, and all the priests, looking at him, saw the mark of the leper on his brow, and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away, for the Lord's punishment had come on him.",,,,,,,
10108,"So King Uzziah was a leper till the day of his death, living separately in his private house; for he was cut off from the house of God; and Jotham his son was ruling over his house, judging the people of the land.",,,,,,,
10109,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were recorded by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.",,,,,,,
10110,"So Uzziah went to rest with his fathers; and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting-place of the kings, for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son became king in his place.Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became",ing; and he,as,u,ing,in J,rus,lem f

10112,"He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord, and did much building on the wall of the Ophel.",,,,,,,
10113,"In addition, he made towns in the hill-country of Judah, and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands.",,,,,,,
10114,"He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them. That year, the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley. And the children of Ammon gave him the",same amount,he,e,ond,year,and,the t

10117,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years.",,,,,,,
10118,"And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in the town of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; he did not do",hat was righ,in,t,e e,es o,th,Lord
10119,But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel and made images of metal for the Baals.,,,,,,,
10120,"More than this, he had offerings burned in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and made his children go through fire, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
10121,And he made offerings and had perfumes burned in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.,,,,,,,
10122,"So the Lord his God gave him up into the hands of the king of Aram; and they overcame him, and took away a great number of his people as prisoners to Damascus. Then he was given into the hands of the king of Israel, who sent great destruction on him.",,,,,,,
10123,"For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, in one day put to death a hundred and twenty thousand men of Judah, all of them good fighting-men; because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers.",,,,,,,
10124,"And Zichri, a great fighting-man of Ephraim, put to death Maaseiah, the king's son, and Azrikam, the controller of his house, and Elkanah, who was second in authority to the king.",,,,,,,
10125,"And the children of Israel took away as prisoners from their brothers, two hundred thousand, women and sons and daughters, and a great store of their goods, and took them to Samaria.",,,,,,,
10126,"But a prophet of the Lord was there, named Oded; and he went out in front of the army which was coming into Samaria and said to them, Truly, because the Lord, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them up into your hands, and you have pu",them to dea,h i,,n o,tbur,t o,wrat
10127,And now your purpose is to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as men- servants and women-servants under your yoke: but are there no sins against the Lord your God to be seen among yourselves?,,,,,,,
10128,"And now give ear to me, and send back the prisoners whom you have taken from your brothers: for the wrath of the Lord is burning against you.",,,,,,,
10129,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, put themselves against those who had come from the war,",,,,,,,
10130,"And said to them, You are not to let these prisoners come here; for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the Lord to us, making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing, which now are great enough, and his wrath is burning against I",rael.,,,,,,
10131,So the armed men gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken to the heads and the meeting of the people.,,,,,,,
10132,"And those men who have been named went up and took the prisoners, clothing those among them who were uncovered, with things from the goods which had been taken in the war, and putting robes on them and shoes on their feet; and they gave them food and dri",k and oil fo,th,i,bo,"ies,",and,seati
10133,At that time King Ahaz sent for help to the king of Assyria.,,,,,,,

10135,"And the Philistines, forcing their way into the towns of the lowlands and the south of Judah, had taken Beth-shemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth and Soco, with their daughter-towns, as well as Timnah and Gimzo and their daughter-towns, and were living there",,,,,,,
10136,"For the Lord made Judah low, because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had given up all self-control in Judah, sinning greatly against the Lord.",,,,,,,
10137,"Then Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, came to him, but was a cause of trouble and not of strength to him.",,,,,,,
10138,"For Ahaz took a part of the wealth from the house of the Lord, and from the house of the king and of the great men, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it was no help to him.",,,,,,,
10139,"And in the time of his trouble, this same King Ahaz did even more evil against the Lord.",,,,,,,
10140,"For he made offerings to the gods of Damascus, who were attacking him, and said, Because the gods of the kings of Aram are giving them help, I will make offerings to them so that they may give me help. But they were the cause of his downfall, and of that",of all Israe,.,,,,,
10141,"And Ahaz got together the vessels of the house of God, cutting up all the vessels of the house of God, and shutting the doors of the Lord's house; and he made altars in every part of Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
10142,"And in every town of Judah he made high places where perfumes were burned to other gods, awaking the wrath of the Lord, the God of his fathers.",,,,,,,
10143,"Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.",,,,,,,
10144,"And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in Jerusalem; but they did not put him in the resting-place of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son became king in his place.Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five ye",rs old; and,e w,s,kin,in,eru,alem

10147,"And he sent for the priests and the Levites, and got them together in the wide place on the east side,",,,,,,,
10148,"And said to them, Give ear to me, O Levites: now make yourselves holy, and make holy the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away everything unclean from the holy place.",,,,,,,
10149,"For our fathers have done evil, sinning in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have given him up, turning away their faces from the house of the Lord, and turning their backs on him.",,,,,,,
10150,The doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out; no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the God of Israel in his holy place.,,,,,,,
10151,"And so the wrath of the Lord has come on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame, as your eyes have seen.",,,,,,,
10152,"For see, our fathers have been put to death with the sword, and our sons and daughters and wives have been taken away prisoners because of this.",,,,,,,
10153,"Now it is my purpose to make an agreement with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from us.",,,,,,,
10154,"My sons, take care now: for you have been marked out by the Lord to come before him and to be his servants, burning offerings to him.",,,,,,,
10155,"Then the Levites took their places; Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel, the son of Azariah, among the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish, the son of Abdi, and Azariah, the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah, the son of Zimmah, and","den, the son",of,o,h;,,,

10159,"And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to make it clean, and everything unclean which was to be seen in the Temple of the Lord they took out into the outer square of the Lord's house, and the Levites got it together and took it",away to the,tre,m,Kid,on.,,
10160,"On the first day of the first month the work of making the house holy was started, and on the eighth day they came to the covered way of the Lord; in eight days they made the Lord's house holy, and on the sixteenth day of the first month the work was don",.,,,,,,

10162,"And all the vessels which were turned out by King Ahaz in his sin while he was king, we have put in order and made holy, and now they are in their places before the altar of the Lord.",,,,,,,

10176,And the holy things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.,,,,,,,
10177,There were not enough priests for the work of cutting up all the burned offerings; so their brothers the Levites gave them help till the work was done and the priests had made themselves holy: for the Levites were more upright in heart to make themselves,holy than th,pr,e,ts.,,,
10178,"And there was a great amount of burned offerings, with the fat of the peace-offerings and the drink offerings for every burned offering. So the work of the Lord's house was put in order.",,,,,,,

10184,"So runners went with letters from the king and his chiefs through all Israel and Judah, by the order of the king, saying, O children of Israel, come back again to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may come again to that small ba",d of you whi,h h,s,bee,kep,sa,e out

10188,So the runners went from town to town through all the country of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun: but they were laughed at and made sport of.,,,,,,,
10189,"However, some of Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun put away their pride and came to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
10190,"And in Judah the power of God gave them one heart to do the orders of the king and the captains, which were taken as the word of the Lord.",,,,,,,
10191,So a very great number of people came together at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month.,,,,,,,
10192,"And they got to work and took away all the altars in Jerusalem, and they put all the vessels for burning perfumes into the stream Kidron.",,,,,,,
10193,"Then on the fourteenth day of the second month they put the Passover lambs to death: and the priests and the Levites were shamed, and made themselves holy and took burned offerings into the house of the Lord.",,,,,,,
10194,"And they took their places in their right order, as it was ordered in the law of Moses, the man of God: the priests draining out on the altar the blood given them by the Levites.",,,,,,,
10195,"For there were still a number of the people there who had not made themselves holy: so the Levites had to put Passover lambs to death for those who were not clean, to make them holy to the Lord.",,,,,,,
10196,"For a great number of the people from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not made themselves clean, but they took the Passover meal, though not in the right way. For Hezekiah had made prayer for them, saying, May the good Lord have mercy on",veryone,,,,,,

10199,"So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy: and the Levites and the priests gave praise to the Lord day by day, making melody to the Lord with loud instruments.",,,,,,,
10200,"And Hezekiah said kind words to the Levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the Lord: so they kept the feast for seven days, offering peace-offerings and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers.",,,,,,,
10201,"And by the desire of all the people, the feast went on for another seven days, and they kept the seven days with joy.",,,,,,,
10202,"For Hezekiah, king of Judah, gave to the people for offerings, a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep; and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests made themselves holy.",,,,,,,

10205,"Then the priests and the Levites gave the people a blessing: and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of God in heaven.Now when all this was over, all the men of Israel who were present went out into the towns of Judah, causing the stone p",llars to be,rok,n,up,nd t,e w,od pi

10207,"And he gave the king's part of his private property for the burned offerings, that is, for the morning and evening offerings, and the offerings for the Sabbath and the new moons and the regular feasts, as it is recorded in the law of the Lord.",,,,,,,
10208,"In addition, he gave orders to the people of Jerusalem to give to the priests and Levites that part which was theirs by right, so that they might be strong in keeping the law of the Lord.",,,,,,,
10209,"And when the order was made public, straight away the children of Israel gave, in great amounts, the first-fruits of their grain and wine and oil and honey, and of the produce of their fields; and they took in a tenth part of everything, a great store.",,,,,,,
10210,"And the children of Israel and Judah, who were living in the towns of Judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep, and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the Lord their God, and put them in great masses.",,,,,,,
10211,"The first store of things was put down in the third month, and in the seventh month the masses were complete.",,,,,,,
10212,"And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw all the store of goods, they gave praise to the Lord and to his people Israel.",,,,,,,
10213,Then Hezekiah put questions to the priests and Levites about the store of goods.,,,,,,,
10214,"And Azariah, the chief priest, of the family of Zadok, said in answer, From the time when the people first came with their offerings into the house of the Lord, we have had food enough, and more than enough: for the blessing of the Lord is on his people;",and there is,thi,,rea,sto,e w,ich h

10218,"And Kore, the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east door, had control of the offerings freely given to God, and the distribution of the offerings of the Lord and the most holy things.",,,,,,,
10219,"And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah and Amariah and Shecaniah, in the towns of the priests, who were made responsible for giving it to all their brothers, by divisions, to small and great:",,,,,,,

10222,"And in the lists were all their little ones and their wives and their sons and daughters, through all the people: they made themselves holy in the positions which they were given.",,,,,,,
10223,"And as for the sons of Aaron, the priests, living in the country on the outskirts of their towns, every different town there were men, marked out by name, to give their part of the goods to all the males among the priests, and to all who were listed amon",the Levites,,,,,,
10224,This Hezekiah did through all Judah; he did what was good and right and true before the Lord his God.,,,,,,,
10225,"And for everything he undertook, in connection with the work of the house of God and his law and orders, he got directions from God and did it with serious purpose; and things went well for him.Now after these things and this true-hearted work, Sennacher","b, king of A",syr,a,ca,e in,o J,"dah,"

10227,He took up with his rulers and men of war the question of stopping up the water-springs outside the town; and they gave him their support.,,,,,,,
10228,"So they got together a great number of people, and had all the water-springs and the stream flowing through the land stopped up, saying, Why let the kings of Assyria come and have much water?",,,,,,,
10229,"Then he took heart, building up the wall where it was broken down, and making its towers higher, and building another wall outside; and he made strong the Millo in the town of David, and got together a great store of all sorts of instruments of war.",,,,,,,

10232,"With him is an arm of flesh; but we have the Lord our God, helping us and fighting for us. And the people put their faith in what Hezekiah, king of Judah, said.",,,,,,,
10233,"After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (at that time he was stationed with all his army in front of Lachish), to say to Hezekiah and all the men of Judah in Jerusalem,",,,,,,,
10234,"Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says, In what are you placing your hope, waiting here in the walled town of Jerusalem?",,,,,,,

10236,"Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, Give worship before one altar only, burning offerings on it?",,,,,,,
10237,Have you no knowledge of what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of every land? were the gods of the nations of those lands able to keep their land from falling into my hands?,,,,,,,
10238,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations, which my fathers put to destruction, who was able to keep his people safe from my hands? and is it possible that your God will keep you safe from my hands?",,,,,,,
10239,"So do not be tricked by Hezekiah or let him get you to do this, and do not put any faith in what he says: for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to keep his people safe from my hands, or the hands of my fathers: how much less will your God kee",you safe fr,m m,,and,!,,

10248,"In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death; and he made prayer to the Lord, and the Lord in answer gave him a sign.",,,,,,,
10249,But Hezekiah did not do as had been done to him; for his heart was lifted up in pride; and so wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
10250,"But then, Hezekiah, in sorrow for what he had done, put away his pride; and he and all Jerusalem made themselves low, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come on them in Hezekiah's life-time.",,,,,,,
10251,"And Hezekiah had very great wealth and honour; and he made himself store-houses for his gold and silver and jewels and spices, and for body-covers and all sorts of beautiful vessels.",,,,,,,

11003,"And I saw that the Levites had not been given what was needed for their support; so that the Levites and the music-makers, who did the work, had gone away, everyone to his field.",,,,,,,
11004,"Then I made protests to the chiefs, and said, Why has the house of God been given up? And I got them together and put them in their places.",,,,,,,
11005,Then all Judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the store-houses.,,,,,,,
11006,"And I made controllers over the store-houses, Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and with them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah: they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution",f these thin,s t,,hei,bro,her,.

11011,"Did not your fathers do the same, and did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town? but you are causing more wrath to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy.",,,,,,,
11012,"And so, when the streets of Jerusalem were getting dark before the Sabbath, I gave orders for the doors to be shut and not to be open again till after the Sabbath: and I put some of my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath",day.,,,,,,
11013,So the traders in all sorts of goods took their night's rest outside Jerusalem once or twice.,,,,,,,
11014,"Then I gave witness against them and said, Why are you waiting all night by the wall? if you do so again I will have you taken prisoners. From that time they did not come again on the Sabbath.",,,,,,,
11015,"And I gave the Levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the Sabbath holy. Keep this in mind to my credit, O my God, and have mercy on me, for great is your mercy.",,,,,,,
11016,And in those days I saw the Jews who were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab:,,,,,,,
11017,"And their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod; they had no knowledge of the Jews' language, but made use of the language of the two peoples.",,,,,,,
11018,"And I took up the cause against them, cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair; and I made them take an oath by God, saying, You are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for you",selves.,,,,,,
11019,"Was it not in these things that Solomon, king of Israel, did wrong? among a number of nations there was no king like him, and he was dear to his God, and God made him king over all Israel: but even he was made to do evil by strange women.",,,,,,,

11022,"Keep them in mind, O my God, because they have put shame on the priests' name and on the agreement of the priests and the Levites.",,,,,,,
11023,"So I made them clean from all strange people, and had regular watches fixed for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;",,,,,,,
11024,"And for the wood offering, at fixed times, and for the first fruits. Keep me in mind, O my God, for good.Now it came about in the days of Ahasuerus, (that Ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom, from India as far a",Ethiopia:),,,,,,
11025,"That in those days, when King Ahasuerus was ruling in Shushan, his strong town,",,,,,,,
11026,"In the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants; and the captains of the army of Persia and Media, the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom, were present before him;",,,,,,,
11027,"And for a long time, even a hundred and eighty days, he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honour which were his.",,,,,,,
11028,"And at the end of that time, the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan, the king's town, small as well as great, for seven days, in the outer square of the garden of the king's house.",,,,,,,
11029,"There were fair hangings of white and green and blue, fixed with cords of purple and the best linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone: the seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone.",,,,,,,
11030,"And they gave them drink in gold vessels, every vessel being different, and wine of the kingdom, freely given by the king.",,,,,,,
11031,And the drinking was in keeping with the law; no one was forced: for the king had given orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man.,,,,,,,
11032,And Vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of King Ahasuerus.,,,,,,,
11033,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was glad with wine, he gave orders to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven unsexed servants who were waiting before Ahasuerus the king,",,,,,,,
11034,"That Vashti the queen was to come before him, crowned with her crown, and let the people and the captains see her: for she was very beautiful.",,,,,,,
11035,"But when the servants gave her the king's order, Vashti the queen said she would not come: then the king was very angry, and his heart was burning with wrath.",,,,,,,
11036,"And the king said to the wise men, who had knowledge of the times, (for this was the king's way with all who were expert in law and in the giving of decisions:",,,,,,,
11037,"And second only to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media, who were friends of the king, and had the first places in the kingdom:)",,,,,,,
11038,"What is to be done by law to Vashti the queen, because she has not done what King Ahasuerus, by his servants, gave her orders to do?",,,,,,,
11039,"And before the king and the captains, Memucan gave his answer: Vashti the queen has done wrong, not only to the king, but to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus;",,,,,,,
11040,"For news of what the queen has done will come to the ears of all women, and they will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them, King Ahasuerus gave orders for Vashti the queen to come before him and she came not.",,,,,,,
11041,"And the wives of the captains of Persia and Media, hearing what the queen has done, will say the same to all the king's captains. So there will be much shame and wrath.",,,,,,,
11042,"If it is pleasing to the king, let an order go out from him, and let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it may never be changed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her place t",another who,is,e,ter,than,she,
11043,"And when this order, given by the king, is made public through all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give honour to their husbands, great as well as small.",,,,,,,
11044,And this suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains; and the king did as Memucan said;,,,,,,,
11045,"And sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs, saying that every man was to be the ruler in his house, and that this order was to be given",ut in the la,gua,e,of,is p,opl,.Afte

11048,And let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of Vashti. And the king was pleased with this suggestion; and he did so.,,,,,,,

11052,"So when the order made by the king was publicly given out, and a number of girls had been placed in the care of Hegai in the king's house in Shushan, Esther was taken into the king's house and put in the care of Hegai, the keeper of the women.",,,,,,,
11053,"And he was pleased with the girl and was kind to her; and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her clean, and the things which were hers by right, and seven servant-girls who were to be hers from the king's house: and he had her and her servant",girls moved,o t,e,bes,pla,e i,the

11055,"And every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the women's house, to see how Esther was and what would be done to her.",,,,,,,
11056,"Now every girl, when her turn came, had to go in to King Ahasuerus, after undergoing, for a space of twelve months, what was ordered by the law for the women (for this was the time necessary for making them clean, that is, six months with oil of myrrh an",six months,ith,s,eet,perf,mes,and s

11061,"And Esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women, and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins: so he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.",,,,,,,
11062,"Then the king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work, and gave wealth from his store.",,,,,,,
11063,"And when the virgins came together in the second house of the women, Mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the king's house.",,,,,,,
11064,"Esther had still said nothing of her family or her people, as Mordecai had given her orders; for Esther did what Mordecai said, as when she was living with him.",,,,,,,
11065,"In those days, while Mordecai was seated at the king's doorway, two of the king's servants, Bigthan and Teresh, keepers of the door, being angry, were looking for a chance to make an attack on King Ahasuerus.",,,,,,,
11066,"And Mordecai, having knowledge of their purpose, sent word of it to Esther the queen; and Esther gave the news to the king in Mordecai's name.",,,,,,,
11067,"And when the thing had been looked into, it was seen to be true, and the two of them were put to death by hanging on a tree: and it was put down in the records before the king.After these things, by the order of the king, Haman, the son of Hammedatha the","Agagite, was",lif,e,up,and,ive,a po

11081,"The runners went out quickly by the king's order, and a public statement was made in Shushan: and the king and Haman took wine together: but the town of Shushan was troubled.Now when Mordecai saw what was done, pulling off his robe, he put on haircloth,",ith dust on,is,e,"d,",nd w,nt,ut in
11082,And he came even before the king's doorway; for no one might come inside the king's door clothed in haircloth.,,,,,,,
11083,"And in every part of the kingdom, wherever the king's word and his order came, there was great sorrow among the Jews, and weeping and crying and going without food; and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth.",,,,,,,
11084,"And Esther's women and her servants came and gave her word of it. Then great was the grief of the queen: and she sent robes for Mordecai, so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off; but he would not have them.",,,,,,,
11085,"Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king's unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her, and she gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it was.",,,,,,,
11086,So Hathach went out and saw Mordecai in the open square of the town before the king's doorway.,,,,,,,
11087,"And Mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place, and of the amount of money which Haman had said he would put into the king's store for the destruction of the Jews.",,,,,,,
11088,"And he gave him the copy of the order which had been given out in Shushan for their destruction, ordering him to let Esther see it, and to make it clear to her; and to say to her that she was to go in to the king, requesting his mercy, and making prayer",or her peopl,.,,,,,
11089,And Hathach came back and gave Esther an account of what Mordecai had said.,,,,,,,
11090,Then Esther sent Hathach to say to Mordecai:,,,,,,,
11091,"It is common knowledge among all the king's servants and the people of every part of the kingdom, that if anyone, man or woman, comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for, there is only one law for him, that he is to be put to death; only",those to who,th,,ing,s ro,of,gold
11092,And they said these words to Mordecai.,,,,,,,
11093,Then Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther: Do not have the idea that you in the king's house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews.,,,,,,,
11094,"If at this time you say nothing, then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place, but you and your father's family will come to destruction: and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this?",,,,,,,
11095,Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer:,,,,,,,
11096,"Go, get together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and go without food for me, taking no food or drink night or day for three days: and I and my women will do the same; and so I will go in to the king, which is against the law: and if death is to","e my fate, t",en,e,it,come,,
11097,"So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had said.Now on the third day, Esther put on her queen's robes, and took her place in the inner room of the king's house, facing the king's house: and the king was seated on his high seat in the king's h","use, facing",he,o,rwa,of,he,ouse.
11098,"And when the king saw Esther the queen waiting in the inner room, looking kindly on her he put out the rod of gold in his hand to her. So Esther came near and put her fingers on the top of the rod.",,,,,,,
11099,"Then the king said, What is your desire, Queen Esther, and what is your request? I will give it to you, even to the half of my kingdom.",,,,,,,
11100,"And Esther in answer said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the feast which I have made ready for him.",,,,,,,
11101,"Then the king said, Let Haman come quickly, so that what Esther has said may be done. So the king and Haman came to the feast which Esther had made ready.",,,,,,,
11102,"And while they were drinking wine the king said to Esther, What is your prayer? for it will be given to you and what is your request? for it will be done, even to the half of my kingdom.",,,,,,,
11103,"Then Esther said in answer, My prayer and my request is this:",,,,,,,
11104,"If I have the king's approval, and if it is the king's pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast which I will make ready for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.",,,,,,,
11105,"Then on that day Haman went out full of joy and glad in heart; but when he saw Mordecai in the king's doorway, and he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him, Haman was full of wrath against Mordecai.",,,,,,,
11106,"But controlling himself, he went to his house; and he sent for his friends and Zeresh, his wife.",,,,,,,
11107,"And he gave them an account of the glories of his wealth, and the number of children he had, and the ways in which he had been honoured by the king, and how he had put him over the captains and servants of the king.",,,,,,,
11108,"And Haman said further, Truly, Esther the queen let no man but myself come in to the feast which she had made ready for the king; and tomorrow again I am to be her guest with the king.",,,,,,,
11109,But all this is nothing to me while I see Mordecai the Jew seated by the king's doorway.,,,,,,,
11110,"Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, Let a pillar, fifty cubits high, be made ready for hanging him, and in the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of Mordecai: then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with",glad heart.,And,H,man,was,lea,ed wi
11111,"It came out that it was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's servants, keepers of the door, by whom an attack on the king had been designed.",,,,,,,
11112,"And the king said, What honour and reward have been given to Mordecai for this? Then the servants who were waiting on the king said, Nothing has been done for him.",,,,,,,
11113,"Then the king said, Who is in the outer room? Now Haman had come into the outer room to get the king's authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for him.",,,,,,,
11114,"And the king's servants said to him, See, Haman is waiting in the outer room. And the king said, Let him come in.",,,,,,,
11115,"So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring? Then the thought came into Haman's mind, Whom, more than myself, would the king have pleasure in honouring?",,,,,,,
11116,"And Haman, answering the king, said, For the man whom the king has delight in honouring,",,,,,,,
11117,"Let them take the robes which the king generally puts on, and the horse on which the king goes, and the crown which is on his head:",,,,,,,
11118,"And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the king's most noble captains, so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honouring, andlethimgoonhorsebackthroughthestreetsofthetown, withmencrying out before him, So let it be d",ne to the ma,wh,m,the,king,has,delig

11120,"Then Haman took the robes and the horse, and dressing Mordecai in the robes, he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town, crying out before him, So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring.",,,,,,,
11121,"And Mordecai came back to the king's doorway. But Haman went quickly back to his house, sad and with his head covered.",,,,,,,
11122,"And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what had taken place. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, who is starting to get the better of you, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not be able to do anythi",g against hi,", b",t,you,will,cer,ainly
11123,"While they were still talking, the king's servants came to take Haman to the feast which Esther had made ready.So the king and Haman came to take wine with Esther the queen.",,,,,,,
11124,"And the king said to Esther again on the second day, while they were drinking, What is your prayer, Queen Esther? for it will be given to you; and what is your request? for it will be done, even to the half of my kingdom.",,,,,,,
11125,"Then Esther the queen, answering, said, If I have your approval, O king, and if it is the king's pleasure, let my life be given to me in answer to my prayer, and my people at my request:",,,,,,,
11126,"For we are given up, I and my people, to destruction and death and to be cut off. If we had been taken as men-servants and women-servants for a price, I would have said nothing, for our trouble is little in comparison with the king's loss.",,,,,,,
11127,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart?",,,,,,,
11128,"And Esther said, Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman. Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen.",,,,,,,
11129,And the king in his wrath got up from the feast and went into the garden: and Haman got to his feet to make a prayer for his life to Esther the queen: for he saw that the king's purpose was evil against him.,,,,,,,
11130,"Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking; and Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was. Then the king said, Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house? And while the words were on the","ing's lips,",hey,p,t a,clot,ov,r Ham
11131,"Then Harbonah, one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king, said, See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in its place in Haman's house. Then the king said, Put him to death by",hanging him,n i,.,,,,
11132,"So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath became less.That day the king gave all the family of Haman, the hater of the Jews, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther h",d made clear,wha,,e w,s to,her,
11133,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai over the family of Haman.",,,,,,,
11134,"Then Esther again came before the king, falling down at his feet, and made request to him with weeping, that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of Haman the Agagite and the designs which he had made against the Jews.",,,,,,,
11135,"Then the king put out the rod of gold to Esther, and she got up before the king.",,,,,,,
11136,"And she said, If it is the king's pleasure and if I have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing to him, then let letters be sent giving orders against those which Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, sent out for the d",struction of,the,J,ws,n al,di,ision
11137,For how is it possible for me to see the evil which is to overtake my nation? how may I see the destruction of my people?,,,,,,,
11138,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See now, I have given Esther the family of Haman, and he has come to his death by hanging, because he made an attack on the Jews.",,,,,,,
11139,"So now send a letter about the Jews, writing whatever seems good to you, in the king's name, and stamping it with the king's ring: for a writing signed in the king's name and stamped with the king's ring may not be changed.",,,,,,,
11140,"Then at that time, on the twenty-third day of the third month, which is the month Sivan, the king's scribes were sent for; and everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all th",divisions o,th,,ing,om f,om,ndia

11144,"A copy of the writing, to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom, was given out to all the peoples, so that the Jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their haters.",,,,,,,
11145,"So the men went out on the quick-running horses used on the king's business, wasting no time and forced on by the king's order; and the order was given out in Shushan, the king's town.",,,,,,,
11146,"And Mordecai went out from before the king, dressed in king-like robes of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen: and all the town of Shushan gave loud cries of joy.",,,,,,,
11147,And the Jews had light and joy and honour.,,,,,,,
11148,"And in every part of the kingdom and in every town, wherever the king's letter and his order came, the Jews were glad with great joy, and had a feast and a good day. And a great number of the people of the land became Jews: for the fear of the Jews had c",me on them.N,w o,,he,hirt,ent,day
11149,"On that day, the Jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them: and everyone had to give way before them, for the fear of them had com",on all the,eop,e,.,,,
11150,And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the king's business gave support to the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai had come on them.,,,,,,,
11151,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom: for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.",,,,,,,
11152,"So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction, and did to their haters whatever they had a desire to do.",,,,,,,
11153,And in Shushan the Jews put to death five hundred men.,,,,,,,
11154,"They put to death Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,",,,,,,,
11155,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,",,,,,,,
11156,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,",,,,,,,
11157,"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the hater of the Jews; but they put not a hand on any of their goods.",,,,,,,
11158,On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king.,,,,,,,
11159,"And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan, as well as the ten sons of Haman: what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom! Now what is your prayer? for it will be given to you; what other request",have you? an,it,w,ll,e do,e.,
11160,"Then Esther said, If it is the king's pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons.",,,,,,,
11161,"And the king said that this was to be done, and the order was given out in Shushan, and the hanging of Haman's ten sons was effected.",,,,,,,
11162,For the Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan; but they put not a hand on their goods.,,,,,,,
11163,"And the other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together, fighting for their lives, and got salvation from their haters and put seventy-five thousand of them to death; but they did not put a hand on their goods.",,,,,,,
11164,"This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.",,,,,,,
11165,"But the Jews in Shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month; and on the fifteenth day they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.",,,,,,,
11166,"So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day, a day for sending offerings one to another.",,,,,,,
11167,"And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, near and far,",,,,,,,
11168,"Ordering them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month, every year,",,,,,,,
11169,"As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters, and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy, and from weeping to a good day: and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy, of sending offerings to one another and good th",ngs to the p,or.,,,,,
11170,And the Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing;,,,,,,,
11171,"Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of all the Jews, had made designs for their destruction, attempting to get a decision by Pur (that is, chance) with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off;",,,,,,,
11172,"But when the business was put before the king, he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made against the Jews was to be turned against himself; and that he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging.",,,,,,,
11173,"So these days were named Purim, after the name of Pur. And so, because of the words of this letter, and of what they had seen in connection with this business, and what had come to them,",,,,,,,
11174,"The Jews made a rule and gave an undertaking, causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to do the same, so that it might be in force for ever, that they would keep those two days, as ordered in the letter, at the fixed time every year;",,,,,,,
11175,"And that those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family, in every division of the kingdom and every town, that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews, or when the memory of th",m would go f,om,h,mi,ds o,th,ir se
11176,"Then Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim.",,,,,,,

11178,"Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times, as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen, and in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their seed, in connection with their time of going with",ut food and,hei,,ry,or h,lp.,
11179,The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim; and it was recorded in the book.And King Ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea.,,,,,,,
11180,"And all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place which the king gave Mordecai, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Media and Persia?",,,,,,,
11181,"For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and respected by the body of his countrymen; working for the good of his people, and saying words of peace to all his seed.There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was J",b.

11184,"His sons regularly went to one another's houses, and every one on his day gave a feast: and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them.",,,,,,,
11185,"And at the end of their days of feasting, Job sent and made them clean, getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all. For, Job said, It may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of God in their hearts. And Job did th",s whenever t,e f,a,ts,ame,oun,.

11193,"And there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother,",,,,,,,

11239,"I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me.And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11240,"If one says a word, will it be a weariness to you? but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind?",,,,,,,
11241,"Truly, you have been a helper to others, and you have made feeble hands strong;",,,,,,,
11242,"He who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words, and you have given strength to bent knees.",,,,,,,
11243,But now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you; you are touched by it and your mind is troubled.,,,,,,,
11244,"Is not your fear of God your support, and your upright way of life your hope?",,,,,,,
11245,Have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man? or when were the god-fearing ever cut off?,,,,,,,
11246,"What I have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed, and evil planted, get the same for themselves.",,,,,,,
11247,"By the breath of God destruction takes them, and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off.",,,,,,,
11248,"Though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice, may be loud, the teeth of the young lions are broken.",,,,,,,
11249,"The old lion comes to his end for need of food, and the young of the she- lion go wandering in all directions.",,,,,,,
11250,"A word was given to me secretly, and the low sound of it came to my ears.",,,,,,,
11251,"In troubled thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep comes on men,",,,,,,,
11252,"Fear came on me and shaking, and my bones were full of trouble;",,,,,,,
11253,And a breath was moving over my face; the hair of my flesh became stiff:,,,,,,,
11254,"Something was present before me, but I was not able to see it clearly; there was a form before my eyes: a quiet voice came to my ears, saying:",,,,,,,
11255,May a man be upright before God? or a man be clean before his Maker?,,,,,,,
11256,"Truly, he puts no faith in his servants, and he sees error in his angels;",,,,,,,
11257,"How much more those living in houses of earth, whose bases are in the dust! They are crushed more quickly than an insect;",,,,,,,
11258,"Between morning and evening they are completely broken; they come to an end for ever, and no one takes note.",,,,,,,
11259,"If their tent-cord is pulled up, do they not come to an end, and without wisdom?Give now a cry for help; is there anyone who will give you an answer? and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer?",,,,,,,
11260,"For wrath is the cause of death to the foolish, and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion.",,,,,,,
11261,"I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly the curse came on his house.",,,,,,,
11262,"Now his children have no safe place, and they are crushed before the judges, for no one takes up their cause.",,,,,,,
11263,"Their produce is taken by him who has no food, and their grain goes to the poor, and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring.",,,,,,,
11264,"For evil does not come out of the dust, or trouble out of the earth;",,,,,,,
11265,"But trouble is man's fate from birth, as the flames go up from the fire.",,,,,,,
11266,"But as for me, I would make my prayer to God, and I would put my cause before him:",,,,,,,
11267,"Who does great things outside our knowledge, wonders without number:",,,,,,,
11268,"Who gives rain on the earth, and sends water on the fields:",,,,,,,
11269,"Lifting up those who are low, and putting the sad in a safe place;",,,,,,,
11270,"Who makes the designs of the wise go wrong, so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes.",,,,,,,
11271,"He takes the wise in their secret designs, and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly.",,,,,,,
11272,"In the daytime it becomes dark for them, and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night.",,,,,,,
11273,"But he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father, and the poor from the power of the strong.",,,,,,,
11274,"So the poor man has hope, and the mouth of the evil-doer is stopped.",,,,,,,
11275,"Truly, that man is happy who has training from the hand of God: so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the Ruler of all.",,,,,,,
11276,"For after his punishment he gives comfort, and after wounding, his hands make you well.",,,,,,,
11277,"He will keep you safe from six troubles, and in seven no evil will come near you.",,,,,,,
11278,"When there is need of food he will keep you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.",,,,,,,
11279,He will keep you safe from the evil tongue; and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes.,,,,,,,
11280,"You will make sport of destruction and need, and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth.",,,,,,,
11281,"For you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth, and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.",,,,,,,
11282,"And you will be certain that your tent is at peace, and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone.",,,,,,,
11283,"You will be certain that your seed will be great, and your offspring like the plants of the earth.",,,,,,,
11284,"You will come to your last resting-place in full strength, as the grain is taken up to the crushing-floor in its time.",,,,,,,
11285,"See, we have made search with care, and it is so; it has come to our ears; see that you take note of it for yourself.And Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11286,"If only my passion might be measured, and put into the scales against my trouble!",,,,,,,
11287,For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas: because of this my words have been uncontrolled.,,,,,,,
11288,"For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me, and their poison goes deep into my spirit: his army of fears is put in order against me.",,,,,,,
11289,Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass? or does the ox make sounds over his food?,,,,,,,
11290,Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain?,,,,,,,
11291,"My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food.",,,,,,,
11292,"If only I might have an answer to my prayer, and God would give me my desire!",,,,,,,
11293,"If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off!",,,,,,,
11294,"So I would still have comfort, and I would have joy in the pains of death, for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One.",,,,,,,
11295,"Have I strength to go on waiting, or have I any end to be looking forward to?",,,,,,,
11296,"Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh brass?",,,,,,,
11297,"I have no help in myself, and wisdom is completely gone from me.",,,,,,,
11298,He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all.,,,,,,,
11299,"My friends have been false like a stream, like streams in the valleys which come to an end:",,,,,,,
11300,"Which are dark because of the ice, and the snow falling into them;",,,,,,,
11301,"Under the burning sun they are cut off, and come to nothing because of the heat.",,,,,,,
11302,The camel-trains go out of their way; they go up into the waste and come to destruction.,,,,,,,
11303,"The camel-trains of Tema were searching with care, the bands of Sheba were waiting for them:",,,,,,,
11304,They were put to shame because of their hope; they came and their hope was gone.,,,,,,,
11305,So have you now become to me; you see my sad condition and are in fear.,,,,,,,
11306,"Did I say, Give me something? or, Make a payment for me out of your wealth?",,,,,,,
11307,"Or, Get me out of the power of my hater? or, Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones?",,,,,,,
11308,Give me teaching and I will be quiet; and make me see my error.,,,,,,,
11309,How pleasing are upright words! but what force is there in your arguments?,,,,,,,
11310,"My words may seem wrong to you, but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind.",,,,,,,
11311,"Truly, you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors, and would make a profit out of your friend.",,,,,,,
11312,"Now then, let your eyes be turned to me, for truly I will not say what is false to your face.",,,,,,,
11313,"Let your minds be changed, and do not have an evil opinion of me; yes, be changed, for my righteousness is still in me.",,,,,,,
11314,Is there evil in my tongue? is not the cause of my trouble clear to me?Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth? and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment?,,,,,,,
11315,"As a servant desiring the shades of evening, and a workman looking for his payment:",,,,,,,
11316,"So I have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose, and nights of weariness are given to me.",,,,,,,
11317,"When I go to my bed, I say, When will it be time to get up? but the night is long, and I am turning from side to side till morning light.",,,,,,,
11318,My flesh is covered with worms and dust; my skin gets hard and then is cracked again.,,,,,,,
11319,"My days go quicker than the cloth-worker's thread, and come to an end without hope.",,,,,,,
11320,"O, keep in mind that my life is wind: my eye will never again see good.",,,,,,,
11321,"The eye of him who sees me will see me no longer: your eyes will be looking for me, but I will be gone.",,,,,,,
11322,A cloud comes to an end and is gone; so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again.,,,,,,,
11323,"He will not come back to his house, and his place will have no more knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
11324,"So I will not keep my mouth shut; I will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit, my soul will make a bitter outcry.",,,,,,,
11325,"Am I a sea, or a sea-beast, that you put a watch over me?",,,,,,,
11326,"When I say, In my bed I will have comfort, there I will get rest from my disease;",,,,,,,
11327,"Then you send dreams to me, and visions of fear;",,,,,,,
11328,So that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains.,,,,,,,
11329,"I have no desire for life, I would not be living for ever! Keep away from me, for my days are as a breath.",,,,,,,
11330,"What is man, that you have made him great, and that your attention is fixed on him,",,,,,,,
11331,"And that your hand is on him every morning, and that you are testing him every minute?",,,,,,,
11332,"How long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me, so that I may have a minute's breathing-space?",,,,,,,
11333,"If I have done wrong, what have I done to you, O keeper of men? why have you made me a mark for your blows, so that I am a weariness to myself?",,,,,,,
11334,"And why do you not take away my sin, and let my wrongdoing be ended? for now I go down to the dust, and you will be searching for me with care, but I will be gone.Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11335,"How long will you say these things, and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?",,,,,,,
11336,Does God give wrong decisions? or is the Ruler of all not upright in his judging?,,,,,,,
11337,"If your children have done evil against him, then their punishment is from his hand.",,,,,,,
11338,"If you will make search for God with care, and put your request before the Ruler of all;",,,,,,,
11339,"If you are clean and upright; then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause, and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again.",,,,,,,
11340,"And though your start was small, your end will be very great.",,,,,,,
11341,"Put the question now to the past generations, and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers:",,,,,,,
11342,"(For we are but of yesterday, and have no knowledge, because our days on earth are gone like a shade:)",,,,,,,
11343,"Will they not give you teaching, and say words of wisdom to you?",,,,,,,
11344,Will the river-plant come up in its pride without wet earth? will the grass get tall without water?,,,,,,,
11345,"When it is still green, without being cut down, it becomes dry and dead before any other plant.",,,,,,,
11346,So is the end of all who do not keep God in mind; and the hope of the evil-doer comes to nothing:,,,,,,,
11347,"Whose support is cut off, and whose hope is no stronger than a spider's thread.",,,,,,,
11348,"He is looking to his family for support, but it is not there; he puts his hope in it, but it comes to nothing.",,,,,,,
11349,"He is full of strength before the sun, and his branches go out over his garden.",,,,,,,
11350,"His roots are twisted round the stones, forcing their way in between them.",,,,,,,
11351,"If he is taken away from his place, then it will say, I have not seen you.",,,,,,,
11352,"Such is the joy of his way, and out of the dust another comes up to take his place.",,,,,,,
11353,"Truly, God will not give up him who is without sin, and will not take evil-doers by the hand.",,,,,,,
11354,"The time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing, and cries of joy will come from your lips.",,,,,,,
11355,"Your haters will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again.And Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11356,"Truly, I see that it is so: and how is it possible for a man to get his right before God?",,,,,,,
11357,"If a man was desiring to go to law with him, he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions.",,,,,,,
11358,"He is wise in heart and great in strength: who ever made his face hard against him, and any good came of it?",,,,,,,
11359,"It is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his wrath:",,,,,,,
11360,"Who is moving the earth out of its place, so that its pillars are shaking:",,,,,,,
11361,"Who gives orders to the sun, and it does not give its light; and who keeps the stars from shining.",,,,,,,
11362,"By whose hand the heavens were stretched out, and who is walking on the waves of the sea:",,,,,,,
11363,"Who made the Bear and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the store-houses of the south:",,,,,,,
11364,"Who does great things not to be searched out; yes, wonders without number.",,,,,,,
11365,"See, he goes past me and I see him not: he goes on before, but I have no knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
11366,"If he puts out his hand to take, by whom may it be turned back? who may say to him, What are you doing?",,,,,,,
11367,God's wrath may not be turned back; the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him.,,,,,,,
11368,"How much less may I give an answer to him, using the right words in argument with him?",,,,,,,
11369,"Even if my cause was good, I would not be able to give an answer; I would make request for grace from him who was against me.",,,,,,,
11370,"If I had sent for him to be present, and he had come, I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice.",,,,,,,
11371,"For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause.",,,,,,,
11372,"He would not let me take my breath, but I would be full of bitter grief.",,,,,,,
11373,"If it is a question of strength, he says, Here I am! and if it is a question of a cause at law, he says, Who will give me a fixed day?",,,,,,,
11374,"Though I was in the right, he would say that I was in the wrong; I have done no evil; but he says that I am a sinner.",,,,,,,
11375,I have done no wrong; I give no thought to what becomes of me; I have no desire for life.,,,,,,,
11376,"It is all the same to me; so I say, He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together.",,,,,,,
11377,"If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong.",,,,,,,
11378,"The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it?",,,,,,,
11379,"My days go quicker than a post-runner: they go in flight, they see no good.",,,,,,,
11380,"They go rushing on like reed-boats, like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food.",,,,,,,
11381,"If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright;",,,,,,,
11382,I go in fear of all my pains; I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes.,,,,,,,
11383,You will not let me be clear of sin! why then do I take trouble for nothing?,,,,,,,
11384,"If I am washed with snow water, and make my hands clean with soap;",,,,,,,
11385,"Then you will have me pushed into the dust, so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing.",,,,,,,
11386,"For he is not a man as I am, that I might give him an answer, that we might come together before a judge.",,,,,,,
11387,"There is no one to give a decision between us, who might have control over us.",,,,,,,
11388,Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me:,,,,,,,
11389,Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him; for there is no cause of fear in myself.My soul is tired of life; I will let my sad thoughts go free in words; my soul will make a bitter outcry.,,,,,,,
11390,"I will say to God, Do not put me down as a sinner; make clear to me what you have against me.",,,,,,,
11391,"What profit is it to you to be cruel, to give up the work of your hands, looking kindly on the design of evil-doers?",,,,,,,
11392,"Have you eyes of flesh, or do you see as man sees?",,,,,,,
11393,"Are your days as the days of man, or your years like his,",,,,,,,
11394,"That you take note of my sin, searching after my wrongdoing,",,,,,,,
11395,Though you see that I am not an evil-doer; and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands?,,,,,,,
11396,"Your hands made me, and I was formed by you, but then, changing your purpose, you gave me up to destruction.",,,,,,,
11397,O keep in mind that you made me out of earth; and will you send me back again to dust?,,,,,,,
11398,"Was I not drained out like milk, becoming hard like cheese?",,,,,,,
11399,"By you I was clothed with skin and flesh, and joined together with bones and muscles.",,,,,,,
11400,"You have been kind to me, and your grace has been with me, and your care has kept my spirit safe.",,,,,,,
11401,But you kept these things in the secret of your heart; I am certain this was in your thoughts:,,,,,,,
11402,"That, if I did wrong, you would take note of it, and would not make me clear from sin:",,,,,,,
11403,"That, if I was an evil-doer, the curse would come on me; and if I was upright, my head would not be lifted up, being full of shame and overcome with trouble.",,,,,,,
11404,"And that if there was cause for pride, you would go after me like a lion; and again put out your wonders against me:",,,,,,,
11405,"That you would send new witnesses against me, increasing your wrath against me, and letting loose new armies on me.",,,,,,,
11406,"Why then did you make me come out of my mother's body? It would have been better for me to have taken my last breath, and for no eye to have seen me,",,,,,,,
11407,And for me to have been as if I had not been; to have been taken from my mother's body straight to my last resting-place.,,,,,,,
11408,"Are not the days of my life small in number? Let your eyes be turned away from me, so that I may have a little pleasure,",,,,,,,
11409,"Before I go to the place from which I will not come back, to the land where all is dark and black,",,,,,,,
11410,"A land of thick dark, without order, where the very light is dark.Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11411,Are all these words to go unanswered? and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk?,,,,,,,
11412,"Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet? and are you to make sport, with no one to put you to shame?",,,,,,,
11413,"You may say, My way is clean, and I am free from sin in your eyes.",,,,,,,
11414,"But if only God would take up the word, opening his lips in argument with you;",,,,,,,
11415,"And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom, and the wonders of his purpose!",,,,,,,
11416,"Are you able to take God's measure, to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all?",,,,,,,
11417,"They are higher than heaven; what is there for you to do? deeper than the underworld, and outside your knowledge;",,,,,,,
11418,"Longer in measure than the earth, and wider than the sea.",,,,,,,
11419,"If he goes on his way, shutting a man up and putting him to death, who may make him go back from his purpose?",,,,,,,
11420,For in his eyes men are as nothing; he sees evil and takes note of it.,,,,,,,
11421,"And so a hollow-minded man will get wisdom, when a young ass of the field gets teaching.",,,,,,,
11422,"But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him;",,,,,,,
11423,"If you put far away the evil of your hands, and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent;",,,,,,,
11424,"Then truly your face will be lifted up, with no mark of sin, and you will be fixed in your place without fear:",,,,,,,
11425,"For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away:",,,,,,,
11426,"And your life will be brighter than day; though it is dark, it will become like the morning.",,,,,,,
11427,"And you will be safe because there is hope; after looking round, you will take your rest in quiet;",,,,,,,
11428,Sleeping with no fear of danger; and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes;,,,,,,,
11429,"But the eyes of the evil-doers will be wasting away; their way of flight is gone, and their only hope is the taking of their last breath.And Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11430,"No doubt you have knowledge, and wisdom will come to an end with you.",,,,,,,
11431,"But I have a mind as well as you; I am equal to you: yes, who has not knowledge of such things as these?",,,,,,,
11432,"It seems that I am to be as one who is a cause of laughing to his neighbour, one who makes his prayer to God and is answered! the upright man who has done no wrong is to be made sport of!",,,,,,,
11433,In the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble; such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping.,,,,,,,
11434,"There is wealth in the tents of those who make destruction, and those by whom God is moved to wrath are safe; even those whose god is their strength.",,,,,,,
11435,"But put now a question to the beasts, and get teaching from them; or to the birds of the heaven, and they will make it clear to you;",,,,,,,
11436,"Or to the things which go flat on the earth, and they will give you wisdom; and the fishes of the sea will give you news of it.",,,,,,,
11437,Who does not see by all these that the hand of the Lord has done this?,,,,,,,
11438,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all flesh of man.",,,,,,,
11439,"Are not words tested by the ear, even as food is tasted by the mouth?",,,,,,,
11440,"Old men have wisdom, and a long life gives knowledge.",,,,,,,
11441,With him there is wisdom and strength; power and knowledge are his.,,,,,,,
11442,"Truly, there is no building up of what is pulled down by him; when a man is shut up by him, no one may let him loose.",,,,,,,
11443,"Truly, he keeps back the waters and they are dry; he sends them out and the earth is overturned.",,,,,,,
11444,"With him are strength and wise designs; he who is guided into error, together with his guide, are in his hands;",,,,,,,
11445,"He takes away the wisdom of the wise guides, and makes judges foolish;",,,,,,,
11446,"He undoes the chains of kings, and puts his band on them;",,,,,,,
11447,"He makes priests prisoners, overturning those in safe positions;",,,,,,,
11448,"He makes the words of responsible persons without effect, and takes away the good sense of the old;",,,,,,,
11449,"He puts shame on chiefs, and takes away the power of the strong;",,,,,,,
11450,"Uncovering deep things out of the dark, and making the deep shade bright;",,,,,,,
11451,"Increasing nations, and sending destruction on them; making wide the lands of peoples, and then giving them up.",,,,,,,
11452,"He takes away the wisdom of the rulers of the earth, and sends them wandering in a waste where there is no way.",,,,,,,
11453,"They go feeling about in the dark without light, wandering without help like those overcome with wine.Truly, my eye has seen all this, word of it has come to my ear, and I have knowledge of it.",,,,,,,
11454,The same things are in my mind as in yours; I am equal to you.,,,,,,,
11455,"But I would have talk with the Ruler of all, and my desire is to have an argument with God.",,,,,,,
11456,But you put a false face on things; all your attempts to put things right are of no value.,,,,,,,
11457,"If only you would keep quiet, it would be a sign of wisdom!",,,,,,,
11458,"Give ear to the argument of my mouth, and take note of the words of my lips.",,,,,,,
11459,"Will you say in God's name what is not right, and put false words into his mouth?",,,,,,,
11460,"Will you have respect for God's person in this cause, and put yourselves forward as his supporters?",,,,,,,
11461,"Will it be good for you to be searched out by him, or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man?",,,,,,,
11462,"He will certainly put you right, if you have respect for persons in secret.",,,,,,,
11463,"Will not his glory put you in fear, so that your hearts will be overcome before him?",,,,,,,
11464,"Your wise sayings are only dust, and your strong places are only earth.",,,,,,,
11465,"Keep quiet, and let me say what is in my mind, whatever may come to me.",,,,,,,
11466,"I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand.",,,,,,,
11467,"Truly, he will put an end to me; I have no hope; but I will not give way in argument before him;",,,,,,,
11468,"And that will be my salvation, for an evil-doer would not come before him,",,,,,,,
11469,"Give ear with care to my words, and keep what I say in your minds.",,,,,,,
11470,"See now, I have put my cause in order, and I am certain that I will be seen to be right.",,,,,,,
11471,"Is any one able to take up the argument against me? If so, I would keep quiet and give up my breath.",,,,,,,
11472,"Only two things do not do to me, then I will come before your face:",,,,,,,
11473,Take your hand far away from me; and let me not be overcome by fear of you.,,,,,,,
11474,Then at the sound of your voice I will give answer; or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer.,,,,,,,
11475,What is the number of my evil-doings and my sins? give me knowledge of them.,,,,,,,
11476,"Why is your face veiled from me, as if I was numbered among your haters?",,,,,,,
11477,Will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind? will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way?,,,,,,,
11478,"For you put bitter things on record against me, and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years;",,,,,,,
11479,"And you put chains on my feet, watching all my ways, and making a limit for my steps;",,,,,,,
11480,"Though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood, or like a robe which has become food for the worm.As for man, the son of woman, his days are short and full of trouble.",,,,,,,
11481,"He comes out like a flower, and is cut down: he goes in flight like a shade, and is never seen again.",,,,,,,
11482,"Is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed, with the purpose of judging him?",,,,,,,
11483,If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean! But it is not possible.,,,,,,,
11484,"If his days are ordered, and you have knowledge of the number of his months, having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go;",,,,,,,
11485,"Let your eyes be turned away from him, and take your hand from him, so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day, like a servant working for payment.",,,,,,,
11486,"For there is hope of a tree; if it is cut down, it will come to life again, and its branches will not come to an end.",,,,,,,
11487,"Though its root may be old in the earth, and its cut-off end may be dead in the dust;",,,,,,,
11488,"Still, at the smell of water, it will make buds, and put out branches like a young plant.",,,,,,,
11489,"But man comes to his death and is gone: he gives up his spirit, and where is he?",,,,,,,
11490,"The waters go from a pool, and a river becomes waste and dry;",,,,,,,
11491,"So man goes down to his last resting-place and comes not again: till the heavens come to an end, they will not be awake or come out of their sleep.",,,,,,,
11492,"If only you would keep me safe in the underworld, putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past, giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again!",,,,,,,
11493,"If death takes a man, will he come to life again? All the days of my trouble I would be waiting, till the time came for me to be free.",,,,,,,
11494,"At the sound of your voice I would give an answer, and you would have a desire for the work of your hands.",,,,,,,
11495,"For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked.",,,,,,,
11496,"My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag, and my sin is shut up safe.",,,,,,,
11497,"But truly a mountain falling comes to dust, and a rock is moved from its place;",,,,,,,
11498,The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters; the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing: and so you put an end to the hope of man.,,,,,,,
11499,"You overcome him for ever, and he is gone; his face is changed in death, and you send him away.",,,,,,,
11500,"His sons come to honour, and he has no knowledge of it; they are made low, but he is not conscious of it.",,,,,,,
11501,"Only his flesh still has pain, and his soul is sad.And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11502,"Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind?",,,,,,,
11503,"Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value?",,,,,,,
11504,"Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry.",,,,,,,
11505,"For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself.",,,,,,,
11506,"It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you.",,,,,,,
11507,Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills?,,,,,,,
11508,Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself?,,,,,,,
11509,What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours?,,,,,,,
11510,"With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father.",,,,,,,
11511,"Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you?",,,,,,,
11512,"Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up;",,,,,,,
11513,"So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth?",,,,,,,
11514,"What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright?",,,,,,,
11515,"Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes;",,,,,,,
11516,"How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water!",,,,,,,
11517,Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen:,,,,,,,
11518,"(The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us;",,,,,,,
11519,"For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:)",,,,,,,
11520,"The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small.",,,,,,,
11521,A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:,,,,,,,
11522,"He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword;",,,,,,,
11523,"He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him:",,,,,,,
11524,"He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him:",,,,,,,
11525,"Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all,",,,,,,,
11526,"Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight,",,,,,,,
11527,"Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick;",,,,,,,
11528,"And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls.",,,,,,,
11529,"He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keepwhat he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth.",,,,,,,
11530,"He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud.",,,,,,,
11531,"Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.",,,,,,,
11532,"His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green.",,,,,,,
11533,"He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers.",,,,,,,
11534,"For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.",,,,,,,
11535,"Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.And Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11536,Such things have frequently come to my ears: you are comforters who only give trouble.,,,,,,,
11537,May words which are like the wind be stopped? or what is troubling you to make answer to them?,,,,,,,
11538,"It would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my soul's place; joining words together against you, and shaking my head at you:",,,,,,,
11539,"I might give you strength with my mouth, and not keep back the comfort of my lips.",,,,,,,
11540,"If I say what is in my mind, my pain becomes no less: and if I keep quiet, how much of it goes from me?",,,,,,,
11541,"But now he has overcome me with weariness and fear, and I am in the grip of all my trouble.",,,,,,,
11542,"It has come up as a witness against me, and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face.",,,,,,,
11543,"I am broken by his wrath, and his hate has gone after me; he has made his teeth sharp against me: my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes;",,,,,,,
11544,Their mouths are open wide against me; the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face; all of them come together in a mass against me.,,,,,,,
11545,"God gives me over to the power of sinners, sending me violently into the hands of evil-doers.",,,,,,,
11546,"I was in comfort, but I have been broken up by his hands; he has taken me by the neck, shaking me to bits; he has put me up as a mark for his arrows.",,,,,,,
11547,His bowmen come round about me; their arrows go through my body without mercy; my life is drained out on the earth.,,,,,,,
11548,I am broken with wound after wound; he comes rushing on me like a man of war.,,,,,,,
11549,"I have made haircloth the clothing of my skin, and my horn is rolled in the dust.",,,,,,,
11550,"My face is red with weeping, and my eyes are becoming dark;",,,,,,,
11551,"Though my hands have done no violent acts, and my prayer is clean.",,,,,,,
11552,"O earth, let not my blood be covered, and let my cry have no resting-place!",,,,,,,
11553,"Even now my witness is in heaven, and the supporter of my cause is on high.",,,,,,,
11554,"My friends make sport of me; to God my eyes are weeping,",,,,,,,
11555,"So that he may give decision for a man in his cause with God, and between a son of man and his neighbour.",,,,,,,
11556,"For in a short time I will take the journey from which I will not come back.My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me.",,,,,,,
11557,"Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing.",,,,,,,
11558,"Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine.",,,,,,,
11559,You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour.,,,,,,,
11560,"As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children.",,,,,,,
11561,He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport.,,,,,,,
11562,"My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade.",,,,,,,
11563,"The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers.",,,,,,,
11564,"Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength.",,,,,,,
11565,"But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you.",,,,,,,
11566,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart.",,,,,,,
11567,"They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark.",,,,,,,
11568,"If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark;",,,,,,,
11569,"If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister;",,,,,,,
11570,Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire?,,,,,,,
11571,"Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust?Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11572,"How long will it be before you have done talking? Get wisdom, and then we will say what is in our minds.",,,,,,,
11573,"Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes, and as completely without knowledge?",,,,,,,
11574,"But come back, now, come: you who are wounding yourself in your passion, will the earth be given up because of you, or a rock be moved out of its place?",,,,,,,
11575,"For the light of the sinner is put out, and the flame of his fire is not shining.",,,,,,,
11576,"The light is dark in his tent, and the light shining over him is put out.",,,,,,,
11577,"The steps of his strength become short, and by his design destruction overtakes him.",,,,,,,
11578,"His feet take him into the net, and he goes walking into the cords.",,,,,,,
11579,His foot is taken in the net; he comes into its grip.,,,,,,,
11580,"The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him, and the cord is placed in his way.",,,,,,,
11581,"He is overcome by fears on every side, they go after him at every step.",,,,,,,
11582,"His strength is made feeble for need of food, and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep.",,,,,,,
11583,"His skin is wasted by disease, and his body is food for the worst of diseases.",,,,,,,
11584,"He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe, and he is taken away to the king of fears.",,,,,,,
11585,"In his tent will be seen that which is not his, burning stone is dropped on his house.",,,,,,,
11586,"Under the earth his roots are dry, and over it his branch is cut off.",,,,,,,
11587,"His memory is gone from the earth, and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name.",,,,,,,
11588,He is sent away from the light into the dark; he is forced out of the world.,,,,,,,
11589,"He has no offspring or family among his people, and in his living-place there is no one of his name.",,,,,,,
11590,"At his fate those of the west are shocked, and those of the east are overcome with fear.",,,,,,,
11591,"Truly, these are the houses of the sinner, and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God.And Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11592,"How long will you make my life bitter, crushing me with words?",,,,,,,
11593,Ten times now you have made sport of me; it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong.,,,,,,,
11594,"And, truly, if I have been in error, the effect of my error is only on myself.",,,,,,,
11595,"If you make yourselves great against me, using my punishment as an argument against me,",,,,,,,
11596,"Be certain that it is God who has done me wrong, and has taken me in his net.",,,,,,,
11597,"Truly, I make an outcry against the violent man, but there is no answer: I give a cry for help, but no one takes up my cause.",,,,,,,
11598,My way is walled up by him so that I may not go by: he has made my roads dark.,,,,,,,
11599,"He has put off my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head.",,,,,,,
11600,"I am broken down by him on every side, and I am gone; my hope is uprooted like a tree.",,,,,,,
11601,"His wrath is burning against me, and I am to him as one of his haters.",,,,,,,
11602,"His armies come on together, they make their road high against me, and put up their tents round mine.",,,,,,,
11603,He has taken my brothers far away from me; they have seen my fate and have become strange to me.,,,,,,,
11604,"My relations and my near friends have given me up, and those living in my house have put me out of their minds.",,,,,,,
11605,"I am strange to my women-servants, and seem to them as one from another country.",,,,,,,
11606,"At my cry my servant gives me no answer, and I have to make a prayer to him.",,,,,,,
11607,"My breath is strange to my wife, and I am disgusting to the offspring of my mother's body.",,,,,,,
11608,Even young children have no respect for me; when I get up their backs are turned on me.,,,,,,,
11609,All the men of my circle keep away from me; and those dear to me are turned against me.,,,,,,,
11610,"My bones are joined to my skin, and I have got away with my flesh in my teeth.",,,,,,,
11611,"Have pity on me, have pity on me, O my friends! for the hand of God is on me.",,,,,,,
11612,"Why are you cruel to me, like God, for ever saying evil against me?",,,,,,,
11613,If only my words might be recorded! if they might be put in writing in a book!,,,,,,,
11614,And with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever!,,,,,,,
11615,"But I am certain that he who will take up my cause is living, and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust;",,,,,,,
11616,And ... without my flesh I will see God;,,,,,,,
11617,"Whom I will see on my side, and not as one strange to me. My heart is broken with desire.",,,,,,,
11618,"If you say, How cruel we will be to him! because the root of sin is clearly in him:",,,,,,,
11619,"Be in fear of the sword, for the sword is the punishment for such things, so that you may be certain that there is a judge.Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11620,For this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on.,,,,,,,
11621,"I have to give ear to arguments which put me to shame, and your answers to me are wind without wisdom.",,,,,,,
11622,"Have you knowledge of this from early times, when man was placed on the earth,",,,,,,,
11623,"That the pride of the sinner is short, and the joy of the evil-doer but for a minute?",,,,,,,
11624,"Though he is lifted up to the heavens, and his head goes up to the clouds;",,,,,,,
11625,"Like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever: those who have seen him say, Where is he?",,,,,,,
11626,"He is gone like a dream, and is not seen again; he goes in flight like a vision of the night.",,,,,,,
11627,The eye which saw him sees him no longer; and his place has no more knowledge of him.,,,,,,,
11628,"His children are hoping that the poor will be kind to them, and his hands give back his wealth.",,,,,,,
11629,"His bones are full of young strength, but it will go down with him into the dust.",,,,,,,
11630,"Though evil-doing is sweet in his mouth, and he keeps it secretly under his tongue;",,,,,,,
11631,"Though he takes care of it, and does not let it go, but keeps it still in his mouth;",,,,,,,
11632,His food becomes bitter in his stomach; the poison of snakes is inside him.,,,,,,,
11633,"He takes down wealth as food, and sends it up again; it is forced out of his stomach by God.",,,,,,,
11634,"He takes the poison of snakes into his mouth, the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death.",,,,,,,
11635,"Let him not see the rivers of oil, the streams of honey and milk.",,,,,,,
11636,"He is forced to give back the fruit of his work, and may not take it for food; he has no joy in the profit of his trading.",,,,,,,
11637,"Because he has been cruel to the poor, turning away from them in their trouble; because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up;",,,,,,,
11638,"There is no peace for him in his wealth, and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight.",,,,,,,
11639,He had never enough for his desire; for this cause his well-being will quickly come to an end.,,,,,,,
11640,"Even when his wealth is great, he is full of care, for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him.",,,,,,,
11641,"God gives him his desire, and sends the heat of his wrath on him, making it come down on him like rain.",,,,,,,
11642,"He may go in flight from the iron spear, but the arrow from the bow of brass will go through him;",,,,,,,
11643,"He is pulling it out, and it comes out of his back; and its shining point comes out of his side; he is overcome by fears.",,,,,,,
11644,"All his wealth is stored up for the dark: a fire not made by man sends destruction on him, and on everything in his tent.",,,,,,,
11645,"The heavens make clear his sin, and the earth gives witness against him.",,,,,,,
11646,"The produce of his house is taken away into another country, like things given into the hands of others in the day of wrath.",,,,,,,
11647,"This is the reward of the evil man, and the heritage given to him by God.Then Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11648,Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort.,,,,,,,
11649,"Let me say what is in my mind, and after that, go on making sport of me.",,,,,,,
11650,"As for me, is my outcry against man? is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled?",,,,,,,
11651,"Take note of me and be full of wonder, put your hand on your mouth.",,,,,,,
11652,At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear.,,,,,,,
11653,Why is life given to the evil-doers? why do they become old and strong in power?,,,,,,,
11654,"Their children are ever with them, and their offspring before their eyes.",,,,,,,
11655,"Their houses are free from fear, and the rod of God does not come on them.",,,,,,,
11656,"Their ox is ready at all times to give seed; their cow gives birth, without dropping her young.",,,,,,,
11657,"They send out their young ones like a flock, and their children have pleasure in the dance,",,,,,,,
11658,"They make songs to the instruments of music, and are glad at the sound of the pipe.",,,,,,,
11659,"Their days come to an end without trouble, and suddenly they go down to the underworld.",,,,,,,
11660,"Though they said to God, Go away from us, for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways.",,,,,,,
11661,"What is the Ruler of all, that we may give him worship? and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him?",,,,,,,
11662,"Truly, is not their well- being in their power? (The purpose of the evil-doers is far from me.)",,,,,,,
11663,"How frequently is the light of the evil-doers put out, or does trouble come on them? how frequently does his wrath take them with cords?",,,,,,,
11664,"How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind?",,,,,,,
11665,"You say, God keeps punishment stored up for his children. Let him send it on the man himself, so that he may have the punishment of it!",,,,,,,
11666,"Let his eyes see his trouble, and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all!",,,,,,,
11667,"For what interest has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is ended?",,,,,,,
11668,Is anyone able to give teaching to God? for he is the judge of those who are on high.,,,,,,,
11669,"One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet:",,,,,,,
11670,"His buckets are full of milk, and there is no loss of strength in his bones.",,,,,,,
11671,"And another comes to his end with a bitter soul, without ever tasting good.",,,,,,,
11672,"Together they go down to the dust, and are covered by the worm.",,,,,,,
11673,"See, I am conscious of your thoughts, and of your violent purposes against me;",,,,,,,
11674,"For you say, Where is the house of the ruler, and where is the tent of the evil-doer?",,,,,,,
11675,"Have you not put the question to the travellers, and do you not take note of their experience?",,,,,,,
11676,"How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble, and has salvation in the day of wrath?",,,,,,,
11677,"Who will make his way clear to his face? and if he has done a thing, who gives him punishment for it?",,,,,,,
11678,"He is taken to his last resting-place, and keeps watch over it.",,,,,,,
11679,"The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him, and all men come after him, as there were unnumbered before him.",,,,,,,
11680,"Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit, when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit?Then Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11681,"Is it possible for a man to be of profit to God? No, for a man's wisdom is only of profit to himself.",,,,,,,
11682,Is it of any interest to the Ruler of all that you are upright? or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin?,,,,,,,
11683,Is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you?,,,,,,,
11684,Is not your evil-doing great? and there is no end to your sins.,,,,,,,
11685,"For you have taken your brother's goods when he was not in your debt, and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it.",,,,,,,
11686,"You do not give water to the tired traveller, and from him who has no food you keep back bread.",,,,,,,
11687,"For it was the man with power who had the land, and the man with an honoured name who was living in it.",,,,,,,
11688,"You have sent widows away without hearing their cause, and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father.",,,,,,,
11689,"For this cause nets are round your feet, and you are overcome with sudden fear.",,,,,,,
11690,"Your light is made dark so that you are unable to see, and you are covered by a mass of waters.",,,,,,,
11691,"Is not God as high as heaven? and see the stars, how high they are!",,,,,,,
11692,"And you say, What knowledge has God? is he able to give decisions through the deep dark?",,,,,,,
11693,"Thick clouds are covering him, so that he is unable to see; and he is walking on the arch of heaven.",,,,,,,
11694,Will you keep the old way by which evil men went?,,,,,,,
11695,"Who were violently taken away before their time, who were overcome by the rush of waters:",,,,,,,
11696,"Who said to God, Go away from us; and, What is the Ruler of all able to do to us?",,,,,,,
11697,Though he made their houses full of good things: but the purpose of the evil-doers is far from me!,,,,,,,
11698,"The upright saw it and were glad: and those who had done no wrong made sport of them,",,,,,,,
11699,"Saying, Truly, their substance is cut off, and their wealth is food for the fire.",,,,,,,
11700,Put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace: so will you do well in your undertakings.,,,,,,,
11701,"Be pleased to take teaching from his mouth, and let his words be stored up in your heart.",,,,,,,
11702,"If you come back to the Ruler of all, making yourself low before him; if you put evil far away from your tents;",,,,,,,
11703,"And put your gold in the dust, even your gold of Ophir among the rocks of the valleys;",,,,,,,
11704,"Then the Ruler of all will be your gold, and his teaching will be your silver;",,,,,,,
11705,"For then you will have delight in the Ruler of all, and your face will be lifted up to God.",,,,,,,
11706,"You will make your prayer to him, and be answered; and you will give effect to your oaths.",,,,,,,
11707,"Your purposes will come about, and light will be shining on your ways.",,,,,,,
11708,"For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up, but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit.",,,,,,,
11709,"He makes safe the man who is free from sin, and if your hands are clean, salvation will be yours.And Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11710,Even today my outcry is bitter; his hand is hard on my sorrow.,,,,,,,
11711,"If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen, so that I might come even to his seat!",,,,,,,
11712,"I would put my cause in order before him, and my mouth would be full of arguments.",,,,,,,
11713,"I would see what his answers would be, and have knowledge of what he would say to me.",,,,,,,
11714,"Would he make use of his great power to overcome me? No, but he would give attention to me.",,,,,,,
11715,There an upright man might put his cause before him; and I would be free for ever from my judge.,,,,,,,
11716,"See, I go forward, but he is not there; and back, but I do not see him;",,,,,,,
11717,"I am looking for him on the left hand, but there is no sign of him; and turning to the right, I am not able to see him.",,,,,,,
11718,For he has knowledge of the way I take; after I have been tested I will come out like gold.,,,,,,,
11719,"My feet have gone in his steps; I have kept in his way, without turning to one side or to the other.",,,,,,,
11720,I have never gone against the orders of his lips; the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart.,,,,,,,
11721,But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it; and he gives effect to the desire of his soul.,,,,,,,
11722,For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end: and his mind is full of such designs.,,,,,,,
11723,"For this cause I am in fear before him, my thoughts of him overcome me.",,,,,,,
11724,"For God has made my heart feeble, and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all.",,,,,,,
11725,"For I am overcome by the dark, and by the black night which is covering my face.Why are times not stored up by the Ruler of all, and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days?",,,,,,,
11726,"The landmarks are changed by evil men, they violently take away flocks, together with their keepers.",,,,,,,
11727,"They send away the ass of him who has no father, they take the widow's ox for debt.",,,,,,,
11728,The crushed are turned out of the way; all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together.,,,,,,,
11729,"Like asses in the waste land they go out to their work, looking for food with care; from the waste land they get bread for their children.",,,,,,,
11730,"They get mixed grain from the field, and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth.",,,,,,,
11731,"They take their rest at night without clothing, and have no cover in the cold.",,,,,,,
11732,"They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and get into the cracks of the rock for cover.",,,,,,,
11733,"The child without a father is forced from its mother's breast, and they take the young children of the poor for debt.",,,,,,,
11734,"Others go about without clothing, and though they have no food, they get in the grain from the fields.",,,,,,,
11735,"Between the lines of olive-trees they make oil; though they have no drink, they are crushing out the grapes.",,,,,,,
11736,"From the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death, and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help; but God does not take note of their prayer.",,,,,,,
11737,"Then there are those who are haters of the light, who have no knowledge of its ways, and do not go in them.",,,,,,,
11738,"He who is purposing death gets up before day, so that he may put to death the poor and those in need.",,,,,,,
11739,"And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening, saying, No eye will see me; and he puts a cover on his face. And in the night the thief goes about;",,,,,,,
11740,"In the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses: in the daytime they are shutting themselves up, they have no knowledge of the light.",,,,,,,
11741,"For the middle of the night is as morning to them, they are not troubled by the fear of the dark.",,,,,,,
11742,They go quickly on the face of the waters; their heritage is cursed in the earth; the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine-garden.,,,,,,,
11743,Snow waters become dry with the heat: so do sinners go down into the underworld.,,,,,,,
11744,"The public place of his town has no more knowledge of him, and his name has gone from the memory of men: he is rooted up like a dead tree.",,,,,,,
11745,"He is not kind to the widow, and he has no pity for her child.",,,,,,,
11746,"But God by his power gives long life to the strong; he gets up again, though he has no hope of life.",,,,,,,
11747,He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support; and his eyes are on his ways.,,,,,,,
11748,"For a short time they are lifted up; then they are gone; they are made low, they are pulled off like fruit, and like the heads of grain they are cut off.",,,,,,,
11749,"And if it is not so, now, who will make it clear that my words are false, and that what I say is of no value?Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11750,Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places.,,,,,,,
11751,Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining?,,,,,,,
11752,How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman?,,,,,,,
11753,"See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes:",,,,,,,
11754,"How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!Then Job made answer and said,",,,,,,,
11755,How have you given help to him who has no power! how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength!,,,,,,,
11756,"How have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom, and fully made clear true knowledge!",,,,,,,
11757,To whom have your words been said? and whose spirit came out from you?,,,,,,,
11758,The shades in the underworld are shaking; the waters and those living in them.,,,,,,,
11759,"The underworld is uncovered before him, and Destruction has no veil.",,,,,,,
11760,"By his hand the north is stretched out in space, and the earth is hanging on nothing.",,,,,,,
11761,"By him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds, and the cloud does not give way under them.",,,,,,,
11762,"By him the face of his high seat is veiled, and his cloud stretched out over it.",,,,,,,
11763,"By him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters, to the limits of the light and the dark.",,,,,,,
11764,"The pillars of heaven are shaking, and are overcome by his sharp words.",,,,,,,
11765,By his power the sea was made quiet; and by his wisdom Rahab was wounded.,,,,,,,
11766,By his wind the heavens become bright: by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through.,,,,,,,
11767,"See, these are only the outskirts of his ways; and how small is that which comes to our ears about him! But the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge.And Job again took up the word and said,",,,,,,,
11768,"By the life of God, who has taken away my right; and of the Ruler of all, who has made my soul bitter;",,,,,,,
11769,"(For all my breath is still in me, and the spirit of God is my life;)",,,,,,,
11770,"Truly, there is no deceit in my lips, and my tongue does not say what is false.",,,,,,,
11771,Let it be far from me! I will certainly not say that you are right! I will come to death before I give up my righteousness.,,,,,,,
11772,"I will keep it safe, and will not let it go: my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life.",,,,,,,
11773,"Let my hater be like the evil man, and let him who comes against me be as the sinner.",,,,,,,
11774,"For what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off, when God takes back his soul?",,,,,,,
11775,Will his cry come to the ears of God when he is in trouble?,,,,,,,
11776,"Will he take delight in the Ruler of all, and make his prayer to God at all times?",,,,,,,
11777,I will give you teaching about the hand of God; I will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the Ruler of all.,,,,,,,
11778,"Truly, you have all seen it yourselves; why then have you become completely foolish?",,,,,,,
11779,"This is the punishment of the evil-doer from God, and the heritage given to the cruel by the Ruler of all.",,,,,,,
11780,"If his children are increased, it is for the sword; and his offspring have not enough bread.",,,,,,,
11781,"When those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease, they are not put into the earth, and their widows are not weeping for them.",,,,,,,
11782,"Though he may get silver together like dust, and make ready great stores of clothing;",,,,,,,
11783,"He may get them ready, but the upright will put them on, and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage.",,,,,,,
11784,"His house has no more strength than a spider's thread, or a watchman's tent.",,,,,,,
11785,"He goes to rest full of wealth, but does so for the last time: on opening his eyes, he sees it there no longer.",,,,,,,
11786,Fears overtake him like rushing waters; in the night the storm-wind takes him away.,,,,,,,
11787,The east wind takes him up and he is gone; he is forced violently out of his place.,,,,,,,
11788,God sends his arrows against him without mercy; he goes in flight before his hand.,,,,,,,
11789,"Men make signs of joy because of him, driving him from his place with sounds of hissing.Truly there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is washed out.",,,,,,,
11790,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone is changed into brass by the fire.",,,,,,,
11791,"Man puts an end to the dark, searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark.",,,,,,,
11792,"He makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day; when they go about on the earth, they have no knowledge of those who are under them, who are hanging far from men, twisting from side to side on a cord.",,,,,,,
11793,"As for the earth, bread comes out of it; but under its face it is turned up as if by fire.",,,,,,,
11794,"Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold.",,,,,,,
11795,"No bird has knowledge of it, and the hawk's eye has never seen it.",,,,,,,
11796,"The great beasts have not gone over it, and the cruel lion has not taken that way.",,,,,,,
11797,"Man puts out his hand on the hard rock, overturning mountains by the roots.",,,,,,,
11798,"He makes deep ways, cut through the rock, and his eye sees everything of value.",,,,,,,
11799,"He keeps back the streams from flowing, and makes the secret things come out into the light.",,,,,,,
11800,But where may wisdom be seen? and where is the resting-place of knowledge?,,,,,,,
11801,"Man has not seen the way to it, and it is not in the land of the living.",,,,,,,
11802,"The deep waters say, It is not in me: and the sea says, It is not with me.",,,,,,,
11803,"Gold may not be given for it, or a weight of silver in payment for it.",,,,,,,
11804,"It may not be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the onyx of great price, or the sapphire.",,,,,,,
11805,"Gold and glass are not equal to it in price, and it may not be exchanged for jewels of the best gold.",,,,,,,
11806,There is no need to say anything about coral or crystal; and the value of wisdom is greater than that of pearls.,,,,,,,
11807,"The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it, and it may not be valued with the best gold.",,,,,,,
11808,"From where then does wisdom come, and where is the resting-place of knowledge?",,,,,,,
11809,"For it is kept secret from the eyes of all living, unseen by the birds of the air.",,,,,,,
11810,"Destruction and Death say, We have only had word of it with our ears.",,,,,,,
11811,"God has knowledge of the way to it, and of its resting-place;",,,,,,,
11812,"For his eyes go to the ends of the earth, and he sees everything under heaven.",,,,,,,
11813,"When he made a weight for the wind, measuring out the waters;",,,,,,,
11814,"When he made a law for the rain, and a way for the thunder-flames;",,,,,,,
11815,"Then he saw it, and put it on record; he gave it its fixed form, searching it out completely.",,,,,,,
11816,"And he said to man, Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge.And Job again took up the word and said,",,,,,,,
11817,"If only I might again be as I was in the months which are past, in the days when God was watching over me!",,,,,,,
11818,"When his light was shining over my head, and when I went through the dark by his light.",,,,,,,
11819,"As I was in my flowering years, when my tent was covered by the hand of God;",,,,,,,
11820,"While the Ruler of all was still with me, and my children were round me;",,,,,,,
11821,"When my steps were washed with milk, and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me.",,,,,,,
11822,"When I went out of my door to go up to the town, and took my seat in the public place,",,,,,,,
11823,"The young men saw me, and went away, and the old men got up from their seats;",,,,,,,
11824,"The rulers kept quiet, and put their hands on their mouths;",,,,,,,
11825,"The chiefs kept back their words, and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths.",,,,,,,
11826,"For when it came to their ears, men said that I was truly happy; and when their eyes saw, they gave witness to me;",,,,,,,
11827,"For I was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help, to the child with no father, and to him who had no supporter.",,,,,,,
11828,"The blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me, and I put a song of joy into the widow's heart.",,,,,,,
11829,"I put on righteousness as my clothing, and was full of it; right decisions were to me a robe and a head-dress.",,,,,,,
11830,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet to him who had no power of walking.",,,,,,,
11831,"I was a father to the poor, searching out the cause of him who was strange to me.",,,,,,,
11832,"By me the great teeth of the evil-doer were broken, and I made him give up what he had violently taken away.",,,,,,,
11833,"Then I said, I will come to my end with my children round me, my days will be as the sand in number;",,,,,,,
11834,"My root will be open to the waters, and the night mist will be on my branches,",,,,,,,
11835,"My glory will be ever new, and my bow will be readily bent in my hand.",,,,,,,
11836,"Men gave ear to me, waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions.",,,,,,,
11837,"After I had said what was in my mind, they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts;",,,,,,,
11838,"They were waiting for me as for the rain, opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains.",,,,,,,
11839,"I was laughing at them when they had no hope, and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear.",,,,,,,
11840,"I took my place as a chief, guiding them on their way, and I was as a king among his army. ...But now those who are younger than I make sport of me; those whose fathers I would not have put with the dogs of my flocks.",,,,,,,
11841,Of what use is the strength of their hands to me? all force is gone from them.,,,,,,,
11842,"They are wasted for need of food, biting the dry earth; their only hope of life is in the waste land.",,,,,,,
11843,"They are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood, and making a meal of roots.",,,,,,,
11844,"They are sent out from among their townsmen, men are crying after them as thieves",,,,,,,
11845,"They have to get a resting-place in the hollows of the valleys, in holes of the earth and rocks.",,,,,,,
11846,They make noises like asses among the brushwood; they get together under the thorns.,,,,,,,
11847,"They are sons of shame, and of men without a name, who have been forced out of the land.",,,,,,,
11848,"And now I have become their song, and I am a word of shame to them.",,,,,,,
11849,"I am disgusting to them; they keep away from me, and put marks of shame on me.",,,,,,,
11850,"For he has made loose the cord of my bow, and put me to shame; he has sent down my flag to the earth before me.",,,,,,,
11851,"The lines of his men of war put themselves in order, and make high their ways of destruction against me:",,,,,,,
11852,"They have made waste my roads, with a view to my destruction; his bowmen come round about me;",,,,,,,
11853,"As through a wide broken place in the wall they come on, I am overturned by the shock of their attack.",,,,,,,
11854,"Fears have come on me; my hope is gone like the wind, and my well-being like a cloud.",,,,,,,
11855,"But now my soul is turned to water in me, days of trouble overtake me:",,,,,,,
11856,"The flesh is gone from my bones, and they give me no rest; there is no end to my pains.",,,,,,,
11857,"With great force he takes a grip of my clothing, pulling me by the neck of my coat.",,,,,,,
11858,"Truly God has made me low, even to the earth, and I have become like dust.",,,,,,,
11859,"You give no answer to my cry, and take no note of my prayer.",,,,,,,
11860,You have become cruel to me; the strength of your hand is hard on me.,,,,,,,
11861,"Lifting me up, you make me go on the wings of the wind; I am broken up by the storm.",,,,,,,
11862,"For I am certain that you will send me back to death, and to the meeting-place ordered for all living.",,,,,,,
11863,Has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor? have I not been a saviour to him in his trouble?,,,,,,,
11864,Have I not been weeping for the crushed? and was not my soul sad for him who was in need?,,,,,,,
11865,"For I was looking for good, and evil came; I was waiting for light, and it became dark.",,,,,,,
11866,"My feelings are strongly moved, and give me no rest; days of trouble have overtaken me.",,,,,,,
11867,"I go about in dark clothing, uncomforted; I get up in the public place, crying out for help.",,,,,,,
11868,"I have become a brother to the jackals, and go about in the company of ostriches.",,,,,,,
11869,My skin is black and dropping off me; and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease.,,,,,,,
11870,"And my music has been turned to sorrow, and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping.I made an agreement with my eyes; how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin?",,,,,,,
11871,"For what is God's reward from on high, or the heritage given by the Ruler of all from heaven?",,,,,,,
11872,"Is it not trouble for the sinner, and destruction for the evil-doers?",,,,,,,
11873,"Does he not see my ways, and are not my steps all numbered?",,,,,,,
11874,"If I have gone in false ways, or my foot has been quick in working deceit;",,,,,,,
11875,"(Let me be measured in upright scales, and let God see my righteousness:)",,,,,,,
11876,"If my steps have been turned out of the way, or if my heart went after my eyes, or if the property of another is in my hands;",,,,,,,
11877,"Let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it, and let my produce be uprooted.",,,,,,,
11878,"If my heart went after another man's wife, or if I was waiting secretly at my neighbour's door;",,,,,,,
11879,Then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body.,,,,,,,
11880,For that would be a crime; it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges:,,,,,,,
11881,"It would be a fire burning even to destruction, and taking away all my produce.",,,,,,,
11882,"If I did wrong in the cause of my man-servant, or my woman-servant, when they went to law with me;",,,,,,,
11883,What then will I do when God comes as my judge? and what answer may I give to his questions?,,,,,,,
11884,Did not God make him as well as me? did he not give us life in our mothers' bodies?,,,,,,,
11885,If I kept back the desire of the poor; if the widow's eye was looking for help to no purpose;,,,,,,,
11886,"If I kept my food for myself, and did not give some of it to the child with no father;",,,,,,,
11887,(For I was cared for by God as by a father from my earliest days; he was my guide from the body of my mother;),,,,,,,
11888,"If I saw one near to death for need of clothing, and that the poor had nothing covering him;",,,,,,,
11889,"If his back did not give me a blessing, and the wool of my sheep did not make him warm;",,,,,,,
11890,"If my hand had been lifted up against him who had done no wrong, when I saw that I was supported by the judges;",,,,,,,
11891,"May my arm be pulled from my body, and be broken from its base.",,,,,,,
11892,"For the fear of God kept me back, and because of his power I might not do such things.",,,,,,,
11893,"If I made gold my hope, or if I ever said to the best gold, I have put my faith in you;",,,,,,,
11894,"If I was glad because my wealth was great, and because my hand had got together a great store;",,,,,,,
11895,"If, when I saw the sun shining, and the moon moving on its bright way,",,,,,,,
11896,"A secret feeling of worship came into my heart, and my hand gave kisses from my mouth;",,,,,,,
11897,That would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges; for I would have been false to God on high.,,,,,,,
11898,"If I was glad at the trouble of my hater, and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him;",,,,,,,
11899,"(For I did not let my mouth give way to sin, in putting a curse on his life;)",,,,,,,
11900,"If the men of my tent did not say, Who has not had full measure of his meat?",,,,,,,
11901,"The traveller did not take his night's rest in the street, and my doors were open to anyone on a journey;",,,,,,,
11902,"If I kept my evil doings covered, and my sin in the secret of my breast,",,,,,,,
11903,"For fear of the great body of people, or for fear that families might make sport of me, so that I kept quiet, and did not go out of my door;",,,,,,,
11904,"If only God would give ear to me, and the Ruler of all would give me an answer! or if what he has against me had been put in writing!",,,,,,,
11905,Truly I would take up the book in my hands; it would be to me as a crown;,,,,,,,
11906,"I would make clear the number of my steps, I would put it before him like a prince! The words of Job are ended.",,,,,,,
11907,"If my land has made an outcry against me, or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow;",,,,,,,
11908,"If I have taken its produce without payment, causing the death of its owners;",,,,,,,
11909,"Then in place of grain let thorns come up, and in place of barley evil-smelling plants.So these three men gave no more answers to Job, because he seemed to himself to be right.",,,,,,,
11910,"And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was angry, burning with wrath against Job, because he seemed to himself more right than God;",,,,,,,
11911,"And he was angry with his three friends, because they had been unable to give him an answer, and had not made Job's sin clear.",,,,,,,
11912,"Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking, because they were older than he;",,,,,,,
11913,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he was very angry.",,,,,,,
11914,"And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, made answer and said, I am young, and you are very old, so I was in fear, and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you.",,,,,,,
11915,"I said to myself, It is right for the old to say what is in their minds, and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom.",,,,,,,
11916,"But truly it is the spirit in man, even the breath of the Ruler of all, which gives them knowledge.",,,,,,,
11917,"It is not the old who are wise, and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right.",,,,,,,
11918,"So I say, Give ear to me, and I will put forward my knowledge.",,,,,,,
11919,"I was waiting for your words, I was giving ear to your wise sayings; while you were searching out what to say,",,,,,,,
11920,"I was taking note; and truly not one of you was able to make clear Job's error, or to give an answer to his words.",,,,,,,
11921,"Take care that you do not say, Wisdom is here; God may overcome him, but not man.",,,,,,,
11922,"I will not put forward words like these, or make use of your sayings in answer to him.",,,,,,,
11923,"Fear has overcome them, they have no more answers to give; they have come to an end of words.",,,,,,,
11924,And am I to go on waiting while they have nothing to say? while they keep quiet and give no more answers?,,,,,,,
11925,I will give my answer; I will put forward my knowledge:,,,,,,,
11926,"For I am full of words, I am unable to keep in my breath any longer:",,,,,,,
11927,"My stomach is like wine which is unable to get out; like skins full of new wine, it is almost burst.",,,,,,,
11928,"Let me say what is in my mind, so that I may get comfort; let me give answer with open mouth.",,,,,,,
11929,"Let me not give respect to any man, or give names of honour to any living.",,,,,,,
11930,"For I am not able to give names of honour to any man; and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away.And now, O Job, give ear to my words, and take note of all I say.",,,,,,,
11931,"See, now my mouth is open, my tongue gives out words.",,,,,,,
11932,"My heart is overflowing with knowledge, my lips say what is true.",,,,,,,
11933,"The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Ruler of all gives me life.",,,,,,,
11934,"If you are able, give me an answer; put your cause in order, and come forward.",,,,,,,
11935,"See, I am the same as you are in the eyes of God; I was cut off from the same bit of wet earth.",,,,,,,
11936,"Fear of me will not overcome you, and my hand will not be hard on you.",,,,,,,
11937,"But you said in my hearing, and your voice came to my ears:",,,,,,,
11938,"I am clean, without sin; I am washed, and there is no evil in me:",,,,,,,
11939,"See, he is looking for something against me; in his eyes I am as one of his haters;",,,,,,,
11940,He puts chains on my feet; he is watching all my ways.,,,,,,,
11941,"Truly, in saying this you are wrong; for God is greater than man.",,,,,,,
11942,"Why do you put forward your cause against him, saying, He gives no answer to any of my words?",,,,,,,
11943,"For God gives his word in one way, even in two, and man is not conscious of it:",,,,,,,
11944,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep comes on men, while they take their rest on their beds;",,,,,,,
11945,"Then he makes his secrets clear to men, so that they are full of fear at what they see;",,,,,,,
11946,"In order that man may be turned from his evil works, and that pride may be taken away from him;",,,,,,,
11947,"To keep back his soul from the underworld, and his life from destruction.",,,,,,,
11948,"Pain is sent on him as a punishment, while he is on his bed; there is no end to the trouble in his bones;",,,,,,,
11949,"He has no desire for food, and his soul is turned away from delicate meat;",,,,,,,
11950,"His flesh is so wasted away, that it may not be seen, and his bones. ...",,,,,,,
11951,"And his soul comes near to the underworld, and his life to the angels of death.",,,,,,,
11952,"If now there may be an angel sent to him, one of the thousands which there are to be between him and God, and to make clear to man what is right for him;",,,,,,,
11953,"And if he has mercy on him, and says, Let him not go down to the underworld, I have given the price for his life:",,,,,,,
11954,"Then his flesh becomes young again, and he comes back to the days of his early strength;",,,,,,,
11955,"He makes his prayer to God, and he has mercy on him; he sees God's face with cries of joy; he gives news of his righteousness to men;",,,,,,,
11956,"He makes a song, saying, I did wrong, turning from the straight way, but he did not give me the reward of my sin.",,,,,,,
11957,"He kept my soul from the underworld, and my life sees the light in full measure.",,,,,,,
11958,"Truly, God does all these things to man, twice and three times,",,,,,,,

12340,"As a loving hind and a gentle doe, let her breasts ever give you rapture; let your passion at all times be moved by her love.",,,,,,,
12341,"Why let yourself, my son, go out of the way with a strange woman, and take another woman in your arms?",,,,,,,
12342,"For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he puts all his goings in the scales.",,,,,,,
12343,"The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin.",,,,,,,
12344,"He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way.My son, if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour, or given your word for another,",,,,,,,
12345,"You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth, the sayings of your lips have overcome you.",,,,,,,
12346,"Do this, my son, and make yourself free, because you have come into the power of your neighbour; go without waiting, and make a strong request to your neighbour.",,,,,,,
12347,"Give no sleep to your eyes, or rest to them;",,,,,,,
12348,"Make yourself free, like the roe from the hand of the archer, and the bird from him who puts a net for her.",,,,,,,
12349,"Go to the ant, you hater of work; give thought to her ways and be wise:",,,,,,,
12350,"Having no chief, overseer, or ruler,",,,,,,,
12351,"She gets her meat in the summer, storing up food at the time of the grain-cutting.",,,,,,,
12352,"How long will you be sleeping, O hater of work? when will you get up from your sleep?",,,,,,,
12353,"A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep:",,,,,,,
12354,"Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man",,,,,,,
12355,A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words;,,,,,,,
12356,"Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers;",,,,,,,
12357,His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts.,,,,,,,
12358,"For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him.",,,,,,,
12359,Six things are hated by the Lord; seven things are disgusting to him:,,,,,,,
12360,"Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause;",,,,,,,
12361,"A heart full of evil designs, feet which are quick in running after sin;",,,,,,,
12362,"A false witness, breathing out untrue words, and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers.",,,,,,,
12363,"My son, keep the rule of your father, and have in memory the teaching of your mother:",,,,,,,
12364,"Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck.",,,,,,,
12365,"In your walking, it will be your guide; when you are sleeping, it will keep watch over you; when you are awake, it will have talk with you.",,,,,,,
12366,"For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life.",,,,,,,
12367,"They will keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the strange woman.",,,,,,,
12368,Let not your heart's desire go after her fair body; let not her eyes take you prisoner.,,,,,,,
12369,"For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread, but another man's wife goes after one's very life.",,,,,,,
12370,May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing?,,,,,,,
12371,"Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned?",,,,,,,
12372,So it is with him who goes in to his neighbour's wife; he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment.,,,,,,,
12373,Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it:,,,,,,,
12374,"But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house.",,,,,,,
12375,He who takes another man's wife is without all sense: he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul.,,,,,,,
12376,"Wounds will be his and loss of honour, and his shame may not be washed away.",,,,,,,
12377,For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband; in the day of punishment he will have no mercy.,,,,,,,
12378,"He will not take any payment; and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased.My son, keep my sayings, and let my rules be stored up with you.",,,,,,,
12379,Keep my rules and you will have life; let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes;,,,,,,,
12380,"Let them be fixed to your fingers, and recorded in your heart.",,,,,,,
12381,"Say to wisdom, You are my sister; let knowledge be named your special friend:",,,,,,,
12382,"So that they may keep you from the strange woman, even from her whose words are smooth.",,,,,,,
12383,"Looking out from my house, and watching through the window,",,,,,,,
12384,"I saw among the young men one without sense,",,,,,,,
12385,"Walking in the street near the turn of her road, going on the way to her house,",,,,,,,
12386,"At nightfall, in the evening of the day, in the black dark of the night.",,,,,,,
12387,"And the woman came out to him, in the dress of a loose woman, with a designing heart;",,,,,,,
12388,She is full of noise and uncontrolled; her feet keep not in her house.,,,,,,,
12389,"Now she is in the street, now in the open spaces, waiting at every turning of the road.",,,,,,,
12390,"So she took him by his hand, kissing him, and without a sign of shame she said to him:",,,,,,,
12391,"I have a feast of peace-offerings, for today my oaths have been effected.",,,,,,,
12392,"So I came out in the hope of meeting you, looking for you with care, and now I have you.",,,,,,,
12393,"My bed is covered with cushions of needlework, with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt;",,,,,,,
12394,I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices.,,,,,,,
12395,"Come, let us take our pleasure in love till the morning, having joy in love's delights.",,,,,,,
12396,For the master of the house is away on a long journey:,,,,,,,
12397,He has taken a bag of money with him; he is coming back at the full moon.,,,,,,,
12398,"With her fair words she overcame him, forcing him with her smooth lips.",,,,,,,
12399,"The simple man goes after her, like an ox going to its death, like a roe pulled by a cord;",,,,,,,
12400,"Like a bird falling into a net; with no thought that his life is in danger, till an arrow goes into his side.",,,,,,,
12401,"So now, my sons, give ear to me; give attention to the sayings of my mouth;",,,,,,,
12402,"Let not your heart be turned to her ways, do not go wandering in her footsteps.",,,,,,,
12403,For those wounded and made low by her are great in number; and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army.,,,,,,,
12404,"Her house is the way to the underworld, going down to the rooms of death.Is not wisdom crying out, and the voice of knowledge sounding?",,,,,,,
12405,"At the top of the highways, at the meeting of the roads, she takes her place;",,,,,,,
12406,"Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out, at the doorways her voice is loud:",,,,,,,
12407,"I am crying out to you, O men; my voice comes to the sons of men.",,,,,,,
12408,"Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart.",,,,,,,
12409,"Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright.",,,,,,,
12410,"For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me.",,,,,,,
12411,All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them.,,,,,,,
12412,"They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge.",,,,,,,
12413,"Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold.",,,,,,,
12414,"For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her.",,,,,,,
12415,"I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes.",,,,,,,
12416,"The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me.",,,,,,,
12417,Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine.,,,,,,,
12418,"Through me kings have their power, and rulers give right decisions.",,,,,,,
12419,"Through me chiefs have authority, and the noble ones are judging in righteousness.",,,,,,,
12420,"Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me.",,,,,,,
12421,"Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness.",,,,,,,
12422,"My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver.",,,,,,,
12423,"I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging:",,,,,,,
12424,"So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store- houses full.",,,,,,,
12425,"The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past.",,,,,,,
12426,"From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was.",,,,,,,
12427,"When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water.",,,,,,,

12430,When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep:,,,,,,,
12431,When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed:,,,,,,,
12432,"When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth:",,,,,,,
12433,"Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times;",,,,,,,
12434,Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.,,,,,,,

12444,"Give up the simple ones and have life, and go in the way of knowledge.",,,,,,,
12445,He who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself; he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name.,,,,,,,
12446,"Do not say sharp words to a man of pride, or he will have hate for you; make them clear to a wise man, and you will be dear to him.",,,,,,,

13128,And who is to say if that man will be wise or foolish? But he will have power over all my work which I have done and in which I have been wise under the sun. This again is to no purpose.,,,,,,,
13129,So my mind was turned to grief for all the trouble I had taken and all my wisdom under the sun.,,,,,,,

13142,A time for love and a time for hate; a time for war and a time for peace.,,,,,,,
13143,What profit has the worker in the work which he does?,,,,,,,
13144,I saw the work which God has put on the sons of man.,,,,,,,
13145,"He has made everything right in its time; but he has made their hearts without knowledge, so that man is unable to see the works of God, from the first to the last.",,,,,,,
13146,"I am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to be glad, and to do good while life is in him.",,,,,,,
13147,"And for every man to take food and drink, and have joy in all his work, is a reward from God.",,,,,,,
13148,"I am certain that whatever God does will be for ever. No addition may be made to it, nothing may be taken from it; and God has done it so that man may be in fear before him.",,,,,,,
13149,"Whatever is has been before, and what is to be is now; because God makes search for the things which are past.",,,,,,,
13150,"And again, I saw under the sun, in the place of the judges, that evil was there; and in the place of righteousness, that evil was there.",,,,,,,
13151,"I said in my heart, God will be judge of the good and of the bad; because a time for every purpose and for every work has been fixed by him.",,,,,,,
13152,"I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, so that God may put them to the test and that they may see themselves as beasts.",,,,,,,
13153,"Because the fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same. As is the death of one so is the death of the other, and all have one spirit. Man is not higher than the beasts; because all is to no purpose.",,,,,,,
13154,"All go to one place, all are of the dust, and all will be turned to dust again.",,,,,,,
13155,"Who is certain that the spirit of the sons of men goes up to heaven, or that the spirit of the beasts goes down to the earth?",,,,,,,
13156,So I saw that there is nothing better than for a man to have joy in his work — because that is his reward. Who will make him see what will come after him?And again I saw all the cruel things which are done under the sun; there was the weeping of those wh,have evil d,ne,o,the,", an",th,y had

13158,"Yes, happier than the dead or the living seemed he who has not ever been, who has not seen the evil which is done under the sun.",,,,,,,
13159,And I saw that the cause of all the work and of everything which is done well was man's envy of his neighbour. This again is to no purpose and a desire for wind.,,,,,,,
13160,"The foolish man, folding his hands, takes the flesh of his body for food.",,,,,,,
13161,One hand full of rest is better than two hands full of trouble and desire for wind.,,,,,,,

13163,"It is one who is by himself, without a second, and without son or brother; but there is no end to all his work, and he has never enough of wealth. For whom, then, am I working and keeping myself from pleasure? This again is to no purpose, and a bitter wo",k.,,,,,,
13164,"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their work.",,,,,,,
13165,"And if one has a fall, the other will give him a hand; but unhappy is the man who is by himself, because he has no helper.",,,,,,,
13166,"So again, if two are sleeping together they are warm, but how may one be warm by himself?",,,,,,,
13167,"And two attacked by one would be safe, and three cords twisted together are not quickly broken.",,,,,,,
13168,A young man who is poor and wise is better than a king who is old and foolish and will not be guided by the wisdom of others.,,,,,,,
13169,"Because out of a prison the young man comes to be king, though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom.",,,,,,,
13170,I saw all the living under the sun round the young man who was to be ruler in place of the king.,,,,,,,
13171,"There was no end of all the people, of all those whose head he was, but they who come later will have no delight in him. This again is to no purpose and desire for wind.Put your feet down with care when you go to the house of God, for it is better to giv",ear than to,mak,,he,urne,of,ering
13172,"Be not unwise with your mouth, and let not your heart be quick to say anything before God, because God is in heaven and you are on the earth — so let not the number of your words be great.",,,,,,,
13173,"As a dream comes from much business, so the voice of a foolish man comes with words in great number.",,,,,,,
13174,"When you take an oath before God, put it quickly into effect, because he has no pleasure in the foolish; keep the oath you have taken.",,,,,,,
13175,It is better not to take an oath than to take an oath and not keep it.,,,,,,,
13176,"Let not your mouth make your flesh do evil. And say not before the angel, It was an error. So that God may not be angry with your words and put an end to the work of your hands.",,,,,,,
13177,Because much talk comes from dreams and things of no purpose. But let the fear of God be in you.,,,,,,,
13178,"If you see the poor under a cruel yoke, and law and right being violently overturned in a country, be not surprised, because one authority is keeping watch on another and there are higher than they.",,,,,,,
13179,It is good generally for a country where the land is worked to have a king.,,,,,,,
13180,"He who has a love for silver never has enough silver, or he who has love for wealth, enough profit. This again is to no purpose.",,,,,,,
13181,"When goods are increased, the number of those who take of them is increased; and what profit has the owner but to see them?",,,,,,,
13182,"The sleep of a working man is sweet, if he has little food or much; but to him who is full, sleep will not come.",,,,,,,
13183,There is a great evil which I have seen under the sun — wealth kept by the owner to be his downfall.,,,,,,,
13184,And I saw the destruction of his wealth by an evil chance; and when he became the father of a son he had nothing in his hand.,,,,,,,
13185,"As he came from his mother at birth, so does he go again; he gets from his work no reward which he may take away in his hand.",,,,,,,
13186,"And this again is a great evil, that in all points as he came so will he go; and what profit has he in working for the wind?",,,,,,,
13187,"All his days are in the dark, and he has much sorrow, pain, disease, and trouble.",,,,,,,
13188,"This is what I have seen: it is good and fair for a man to take meat and drink and to have joy in all his work under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; that is his reward.",,,,,,,
13189,Every man to whom God has given money and wealth and the power to have pleasure in it and to do his part and have joy in his work: this is given by God.,,,,,,,
13190,"He will not give much thought to the days of his life; because God lets him be taken up with the joy of his heart.There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is hard on men;",,,,,,,
13191,"A man to whom God gives money, wealth, and honour so that he has all his desires but God does not give him the power to have joy of it, and a strange man takes it. This is to no purpose and an evil disease.",,,,,,,
13192,"If a man has a hundred children, and his life is long so that the days of his years are great in number, but his soul takes no pleasure in good, and he is not honoured at his death; I say that a birth before its time is better than he.",,,,,,,
13193,"In wind it came and to the dark it will go, and with the dark will its name be covered.",,,,,,,
13194,"Yes, it saw not the sun, and it had no knowledge; it is better with this than with the other.",,,,,,,
13195,"And though he goes on living a thousand years twice over and does not see good, are not the two going to the same place?",,,,,,,
13196,"All the work of man is for his mouth, and still he has a desire for food.",,,,,,,
13197,What have the wise more than the foolish? and what has the poor man by walking wisely before the living?,,,,,,,
13198,What the eyes see is better than the wandering of desire. This is to no purpose and a desire for wind.,,,,,,,
13199,"That which is, has been named before, and of what man is there is knowledge. He has no power against one stronger than he.",,,,,,,
13200,"There are words without number for increasing what is to no purpose, but what is man profited by them?",,,,,,,
13201,"Who is able to say what is good for man in life all the days of his foolish life which he goes through like a shade? who will say what is to be after him under the sun?A good name is better than oil of great price, and the day of death than the day of bi",th.,,,,,,
13202,"It is better to go to the house of weeping, than to go to the house of feasting; because that is the end of every man, and the living will take it to their hearts.",,,,,,,
13203,Sorrow is better than joy; when the face is sad the mind gets better.,,,,,,,
13204,The hearts of the wise are in the house of weeping; but the hearts of the foolish are in the house of joy.,,,,,,,
13205,"It is better to take note of the protest of the wise, than for a man to give ear to the song of the foolish.",,,,,,,
13206,"Like the cracking of thorns under a pot, so is the laugh of a foolish man; and this again is to no purpose.",,,,,,,
13207,"The wise are troubled by the ways of the cruel, and the giving of money is the destruction of the heart.",,,,,,,
13208,"The end of a thing is better than its start, and a gentle spirit is better than pride.",,,,,,,
13209,Be not quick to let your spirit be angry; because wrath is in the heart of the foolish.,,,,,,,
13210,"Say not, Why were the days which have gone by better than these? Such a question comes not from wisdom.",,,,,,,
13211,"Wisdom together with a heritage is good, and a profit to those who see the sun.",,,,,,,
13212,Wisdom keeps a man from danger even as money does; but the value of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its owner.,,,,,,,
13213,Give thought to the work of God. Who will make straight what he has made bent?,,,,,,,
13214,"In the day of wealth have joy, but in the day of evil take thought: God has put the one against the other, so that man may not be certain what will be after him.",,,,,,,
13215,"These two have I seen in my life which is to no purpose: a good man coming to his end in his righteousness, and an evil man whose days are long in his evil-doing.",,,,,,,
13216,Be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not over-wise. Why let destruction come on you?,,,,,,,
13217,"Be not evil overmuch, and be not foolish. Why come to your end before your time?",,,,,,,
13218,It is good to take this in your hand and not to keep your hand from that; he who has the fear of God will be free of the two.,,,,,,,
13219,Wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a town.,,,,,,,
13220,There is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days.,,,,,,,
13221,"Do not give ear to all the words which men say, for fear of hearing the curses of your servant.",,,,,,,
13222,Your heart has knowledge how frequently others have been cursed by you.,,,,,,,
13223,"All this I have put to the test by wisdom; I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me.",,,,,,,
13224,"Far off is true existence, and very deep; who may have knowledge of it?",,,,,,,
13225,"I gave my mind to knowledge and to searching for wisdom and the reason of things, and to the discovery that sin is foolish, and that to be foolish is to be without one's senses.",,,,,,,
13226,"And I saw a thing more bitter than death, even the woman whose heart is full of tricks and nets, and whose hands are as bands. He with whom God is pleased will get free from her, but the sinner will be taken by her.",,,,,,,
13227,"Look! this I have seen, said the Preacher, taking one thing after another to get the true account,",,,,,,,
13228,"For which my soul is still searching, but I have it not; one man among a thousand have I seen; but a woman among all these I have not seen.",,,,,,,
13229,"This only have I seen, that God made men upright, but they have been searching out all sorts of inventions.Who is like the wise man? and to whom is the sense of anything clear? A man's wisdom makes his face shining, and his hard face will be changed.",,,,,,,
13230,"I say to you, Keep the king's law, from respect for the oath of God.",,,,,,,
13231,"Be not quick to go from before him. Be not fixed in an evil design, because he does whatever is pleasing to him.",,,,,,,
13232,"The word of a king has authority; and who may say to him, What is this you are doing?",,,,,,,
13233,Whoever keeps the law will come to no evil: and a wise man's heart has knowledge of time and of decision.,,,,,,,
13234,"For every purpose there is a time and a decision, because the sorrow of man is great in him.",,,,,,,
13235,"No one is certain what is to be, and who is able to say to him when it will be?",,,,,,,
13236,"No man has authority over the wind, to keep the wind; or is ruler over the day of his death. In war no man's time is free, and evil will not keep the sinner safe.",,,,,,,
13237,"All this have I seen, and have given my heart to all the work which is done under the sun: there is a time when man has power over man for his destruction.",,,,,,,
13238,"And then I saw evil men put to rest, taken even from the holy place; and they went about and were praised in the town because of what they had done. This again is to no purpose.",,,,,,,
13239,"Because punishment for an evil work comes not quickly, the minds of the sons of men are fully given to doing evil.",,,,,,,
13240,"Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his life is long, I am certain that it will be well for those who go in fear of God and are in fear before him.",,,,,,,
13241,"But it will not be well for the evil-doer; he will not make his days long like a shade, because he has no fear before God.",,,,,,,
13242,"There is a thing which is to no purpose done on the earth: that there are good men to whom is given the same punishment as those who are evil, and there are evil men who get the reward of the good. I say that this again is to no purpose.",,,,,,,
13243,"So I gave praise to joy, because there is nothing better for a man to do under the sun than to take meat and drink and be happy; for that will be with him in his work all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.",,,,,,,
13244,"When I gave my mind to the knowledge of wisdom and to seeing the business which is done on the earth (and there are those whose eyes see not sleep by day or by night),",,,,,,,
13245,"Then I saw all the work of God, and that man may not get knowledge of the work which is done under the sun; because, if a man gives hard work to the search he will not get knowledge, and even if the wise man seems to be coming to the end of his search, s",ill he will,e w,t,out,know,edg,.All
13246,"Because to all there is one event, to the upright man and to the evil, to the clean and to the unclean, to him who makes an offering and to him who makes no offering; as is the good so is the sinner; he who takes an oath is as he who has fear of it.",,,,,,,
13247,"This is evil in all things which are done under the sun: that there is one fate for all, and the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; while they have life their hearts are foolish, and after that — to the dead.",,,,,,,
13248,For him who is joined to all the living there is hope; a living dog is better than a dead lion.,,,,,,,
13249,"The living are conscious that death will come to them, but the dead are not conscious of anything, and they no longer have a reward, because there is no memory of them.",,,,,,,
13250,Their love and their hate and their envy are now ended; and they have no longer a part for ever in anything which is done under the sun.,,,,,,,
13251,"Come, take your bread with joy, and your wine with a glad heart. God has taken pleasure in your works.",,,,,,,
13252,"Let your clothing be white at all times, and let not your head be without oil.",,,,,,,
13253,Have joy with the woman of your love all the days of your foolish life which he gives you under the sun. Because that is your part in life and in your work which you do under the sun.,,,,,,,
13254,"Whatever comes to your hand to do with all your power, do it because there is no work, or thought, or knowledge, or wisdom in the place of the dead to which you are going.",,,,,,,
13255,"And again I saw under the sun that the reward goes not to him who is quick, or the fruits of war to the strong; and there is no bread for the wise, or wealth for men of learning, or respect for those who have knowledge; but time and chance come to all.",,,,,,,
13256,"Even man has no knowledge of his time; like fishes taken in an evil net, or like birds taken by deceit, are the sons of men taken in an evil time when it comes suddenly on them.",,,,,,,
13257,This again I have seen under the sun as wisdom and it seemed great to me.,,,,,,,
13258,"There was a little town and the number of its men was small, and there came a great king against it and made an attack on it, building works of war round about it.",,,,,,,
13259,"Now there was in the town a poor, wise man, and he, by his wisdom, kept the town safe. But no one had any memory of that same poor man.",,,,,,,
13260,"Then I said, Wisdom is better than strength, but the poor man's wisdom is not respected, and his words are not given a hearing.",,,,,,,
13261,The words of the wise which come quietly to the ear are noted more than the cry of a ruler among the foolish.,,,,,,,
13262,"Wisdom is better than instruments of war, but one sinner is the destruction of much good.Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give out an evil smell; more valued is a little wisdom than the great glory of the foolish.",,,,,,,
13263,The heart of the wise man goes in the right direction; but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong.,,,,,,,
13264,"And when the foolish man is walking in the way, he has no sense and lets everyone see that he is foolish.",,,,,,,
13265,"If the wrath of the ruler is against you, keep in your place; in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked.",,,,,,,
13266,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes by chance from a ruler:",,,,,,,
13267,"The foolish are placed in high positions, but men of wealth are kept low.",,,,,,,
13268,"I have seen servants on horses, and rulers walking on the earth as servants.",,,,,,,
13269,"He who makes a hole for others will himself go into it, and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment.",,,,,,,
13270,"He who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them, and in the cutting of wood there is danger.",,,,,,,
13271,"If the iron has no edge, and he does not make it sharp, then he has to put out more strength; but wisdom makes things go well.",,,,,,,
13272,"If a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said, then there is no longer any use in the word of power.",,,,,,,
13273,"The words of a wise man's mouth are sweet to all, but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction.",,,,,,,
13274,"The first words of his mouth are foolish, and the end of his talk is evil crime.",,,,,,,
13275,The foolish are full of words; man has no knowledge of what will be; and who is able to say what will be after him?,,,,,,,
13276,"The work of the foolish will be a weariness to him, because he has no knowledge of the way to the town.",,,,,,,
13277,"Unhappy is the land whose king is a boy, and whose rulers are feasting in the morning.",,,,,,,
13278,"Happy is the land whose ruler is of noble birth, and whose chiefs take food at the right time, for strength and not for feasting.",,,,,,,
13279,"When no work is done the roof goes in, and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house.",,,,,,,
13280,"A feast is for laughing, and wine makes glad the heart; but by the one and the other money is wasted.",,,,,,,
13281,"Say not a curse against the king, even in your thoughts; and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth; because a bird of the air will take the voice, and that which has wings will give news of it.Put out your bread on the face of the water",; for after,lo,g,tim,it,ill,come

13284,"He who is watching the wind will not get the seed planted, and he who is looking at the clouds will not get in the grain.",,,,,,,
13285,"As you have no knowledge of the way of the wind, or of the growth of the bones in the body of her who is with child, even so you have no knowledge of the works of God who has made all.",,,,,,,

13297,"All things are to no purpose, says the Preacher, all is to no purpose.",,,,,,,
13298,"And because the Preacher was wise he still gave the people knowledge; searching out, testing, and putting in order a great number of wise sayings.",,,,,,,
13299,"The Preacher made search for words which were pleasing, but his writing was in words upright and true.",,,,,,,
13300,"The words of the wise are pointed, and sayings grouped together are like nails fixed with a hammer; they are given by one guide.",,,,,,,

16098,"Make us come back to you, O Lord, and let us be turned; make our days new again as in the past.",,,,,,,
16099,"But you have quite given us up; you are full of wrath against us.Now it came about in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was by the river Chebar among those who had been made prisoners, that the heavens were m",de open and,sa,,isi,ns o,Go,.
16100,"On the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year after King Jehoiachin had been made a prisoner,",,,,,,,
16101,"The word of the Lord came to me, Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldaeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was on me there.",,,,,,,
16102,"And, looking, I saw a storm-wind coming out of the north, a great cloud with flames of fire coming after one another, and a bright light shining round about it and in the heart of it was something coloured like electrum.",,,,,,,
16103,And in the heart of it were the forms of four living beings. And this was what they were like; they had the form of a man.,,,,,,,
16104,"And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.",,,,,,,
16105,And their feet were straight feet; and the under sides of their feet were like the feet of oxen; and they were shining like polished brass.,,,,,,,
16106,And they had the hands of a man under their wings; the four of them had faces on their four sides.,,,,,,,
16107,"They went without turning, every one went straight forward.",,,,,,,
16108,"As for the form of their faces, they had the face of a man, and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side, and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four of them had the face of an eagle.",,,,,,,
16109,"And their wings were separate at the top; two of the wings of every one were joined one to another, and two were covering their bodies.",,,,,,,
16110,Every one of them went straight forward; wherever the spirit was to go they went; they went on without turning.,,,,,,,
16111,"And between the living beings it was like burning coals of fire, as if flames were going one after the other between the living beings; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went thunder-flames.",,,,,,,
16112,And the living beings went out and came back as quickly as a thunder-flame.,,,,,,,
16113,"Now while I was looking at the four living beings, I saw one wheel on the earth, by the side of the living beings, for the four of them.",,,,,,,
16114,"The form of the wheels and their work was like a beryl; the four of them had the same form and design, and they were like a wheel inside a wheel.",,,,,,,
16115,The four of them went straight forward without turning to one side.,,,,,,,
16116,"And I saw that they had edges, and their edges, even of the four, were full of eyes round about.",,,,,,,
16117,"And when the living beings went on, the wheels went by their side; and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.",,,,,,,
16118,Wherever the spirit was to go they went; and the wheels were lifted up by their side: for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.,,,,,,,
16119,"When these went on, the others went; and when these came to rest, the others came to rest; and when these were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up by their side: for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.",,,,,,,
16120,"And over the heads of the living beings there was the form of an arch, looking like ice, stretched out over their heads on high.",,,,,,,
16121,"Under the arch their wings were straight, one stretched out to another: every one had two wings covering their bodies on this side and two covering their bodies on that side.",,,,,,,
16122,"And when they went, the sound of their wings was like the sound of great waters to my ears, like the voice of the Ruler of all, a sound like the rushing of an army: when they came to rest they let down their wings.",,,,,,,
16123,And there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads: when they came to rest they let down their wings.,,,,,,,
16124,"And on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a king's seat, like a sapphire stone; and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high.",,,,,,,
16125,"And I saw it coloured like electrum, with the look of fire in it and round it, going up from what seemed to be the middle of his body; and going down from what seemed to be the middle of his body I saw what was like fire, and there was a bright light shi",ing round hi,.,,,,,
16126,"Like the bow in the cloud on a day of rain, so was the light shining round him. And this is what the glory of the Lord was like. And when I saw it I went down on my face, and the voice of one talking came to my ears.And he said to me, Son of man, get up","n your feet,",so,h,t I,may,ay,ords
16127,And at his words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and his voice came to my ears.,,,,,,,
16128,"And he said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to an uncontrolled nation which has gone against me: they and their fathers have been sinners against me even to this very day.",,,,,,,
16129,"And the children are hard and stiff-hearted; I am sending you to them: and you are to say to them, These are the words of the Lord.",,,,,,,
16130,"And they, if they give ear to you or if they do not give ear (for they are an uncontrolled people), will see that there has been a prophet among them.",,,,,,,
16131,"And you, son of man, have no fear of them or of their words, even if sharp thorns are round you and you are living among scorpions: have no fear of their words and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people.",,,,,,,
16132,"And you are to give them my words, if they give ear to you or if they do not: for they are uncontrolled.",,,,,,,
16133,"But you, son of man, give ear to what I say to you, and do not be uncontrolled like that uncontrolled people: let your mouth be open and take what I give you.",,,,,,,
16134,"And looking, I saw a hand stretched out to me, and I saw the roll of a book in it;",,,,,,,
16135,"And he put it open before me, and it had writing on the front and on the back; words of grief and sorrow and trouble were recorded in it.And he said to me, Son of man, take this roll for your food, and go and say my words to the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
16136,"And, on my opening my mouth, he made me take the roll as food.",,,,,,,
16137,"And he said to me, Son of man, let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which I am giving you. Then I took it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.",,,,,,,
16138,"And he said to me, Son of man, go now to the children of Israel, and say my words to them.",,,,,,,
16139,"For you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard, but to the children of Israel;",,,,,,,
16140,"Not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you. Truly, if I sent you to them they would give ear to you.",,,,,,,
16141,But the children of Israel will not give ear to you; for they have no mind to give ear to me: for all the children of Israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart.,,,,,,,
16142,"See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your brow hard against their brows.",,,,,,,
16143,"Like a diamond harder than rock I have made your brow: have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people.",,,,,,,
16144,"Then he said to me, Son of man, take into your heart all my words which I am about to say to you, and let your ears be open to them.",,,,,,,
16145,"And go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners, to the children of your people, and say to them, This is what the Lord has said; if they give ear or if they do not.",,,,,,,
16146,"Then I was lifted up by the wind, and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from his place.",,,,,,,
16147,"And there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels at their side, the sound of a great rushing.",,,,,,,
16148,"And the wind, lifting me up, took me away: and I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me.",,,,,,,
16149,"Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners, who were at Telabib by the river Chebar, and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days.",,,,,,,
16150,"And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16151,"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel: so give ear to the word of my mouth, and give them word from me of their danger.",,,,,,,
16152,"When I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly be your fate; and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his evil way, so that he may be safe; that same evil man will come to death in his evil-doing; but",I will make,ou,e,pon,ible,for,his b
16153,"But if you give the evil-doer word of his danger, and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing; but your life will be safe.",,,,,,,
16154,"Again, when an upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, and I put a cause of falling in his way, death will overtake him: because you have given him no word of his danger, death will overtake him in his evil-doing, and there will be n",memory of t,e u,r,ght,acts,whi,h he
16155,"But if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil, he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word; and your life will be safe.",,,,,,,
16156,"And the hand of the Lord was on me there; and he said, Get up and go out into the valley and there I will have talk with you.",,,,,,,
16157,Then I got up and went out into the valley; and I saw the glory of the Lord resting there as I had seen it by the river Chebar; and I went down on my face.,,,,,,,
16158,"Then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and he had talk with me and said to me, Go and keep yourself shut up inside your house.",,,,,,,
16159,"But see, O son of man, I will put bands on you, prisoning you in them, and you will not go out among them:",,,,,,,
16160,"And I will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth, so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them: for they are an uncontrolled people.",,,,,,,
16161,"But when I have talk with you I will make your mouth open, and you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Let the hearer give ear; and as for him who will not, let him keep his ears shut: for they are an uncontrolled people.And you, son of m","n, take a ba",k a,d,put,it b,for,you
16162,"And make an attack on it, shutting it in, building strong places against it, and making high an earthwork against it; and put up tents against it, placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls.",,,,,,,
16163,"And take a flat iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town: and let your face be turned to it, and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it. This will be a sign to the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
16164,"Then, stretching yourself out on your left side, take the sin of the children of Israel on yourself: for as long as you are stretched out, so long will the sin of the children of Israel be on you.",,,,,,,
16165,"For I have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
16166,"And when these days are ended, turning on your right side, you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of Judah: forty days, a day for a year, I have had it fixed for you.",,,,,,,
16167,"And let your face be turned to where Jerusalem is shut in, with your arm uncovered, and be a prophet against it.",,,,,,,
16168,"And see, I will put bands on you; and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended.",,,,,,,
16169,"And take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain, and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them; all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food.",,,,,,,
16170,"And you are to take your food by weight, twenty shekels a day: you are to take it at regular times.",,,,,,,
16171,"And you are to take water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: you are to take it at regular times.",,,,,,,
16172,"And let your food be barley cakes, cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man.",,,,,,,
16173,"And the Lord said, Even so the children of Israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where I am driving them.",,,,,,,
16174,"Then I said, Ah, Lord! see, my soul has never been unclean, and I have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts, from the time when I was young even till now; no disgusting flesh has ever come into my",mouth.,,,,,,
16175,"Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's waste in place of man's waste, and you will make your bread ready on it.",,,,,,,
16176,"And he said to me, Son of man, see, I will take away from Jerusalem her necessary bread: they will take their bread by weight and with care, measuring out their drinking-water with fear and wonder:",,,,,,,
16177,"So that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another, wasting away in their sin.And you, son of man, take a sharp sword, using it like a haircutter's blade, and making it go over your head and the hair of your chin: and take sca",es for separ,tin,,he,air,y w,ight.
16178,"You are to have a third part burned with fire inside the town, when the days of the attack are ended; and a third part you are to take and give blows with the sword round about it; and give a third part for the wind to take away, and let loose a sword af",er them.,,,,,,
16179,"And take from them a small number of hairs, folding them in your skirts.",,,,,,,
16180,"And again take some of these and put them in the fire, burning them up in the fire; and say to all the children of Israel,",,,,,,,
16181,"This is what the Lord has said: This is Jerusalem: I have put her among the nations, and countries are round her on every side;",,,,,,,
16182,"And she has gone against my orders by doing evil more than the nations, and against my rules more than the countries round her: for they have given up my orders, and as for my rules, they have not gone in the way of them.",,,,,,,
16183,"For this cause the Lord has said: Because you have been more uncontrolled than the nations round about you, and have not been guided by my rules or kept my orders, but have kept the orders of the nations round about you;",,,,,,,
16184,"For this cause the Lord has said: See, I, even I, am against you; and I will be judging among you before the eyes of the nations.",,,,,,,
16185,"And I will do in you what I have not done and will not do again, because of all your disgusting ways.",,,,,,,
16186,"For this cause fathers will take their sons for food among you, and sons will make a meal of their fathers; and I will be judge among you, and all the rest of you I will send away to every wind.",,,,,,,
16187,"For this cause, by my life, says the Lord, because you have made my holy place unclean with all your hated things and all your disgusting ways, you will become disgusting to me; my eye will have no mercy and I will have no pity.",,,,,,,
16188,"A third of you will come to death from disease, wasting away among you through need of food; a third will be put to the sword round about you; and a third I will send away to every wind, letting loose a sword after them.",,,,,,,
16189,"So my wrath will be complete and my passion will come to rest on them; and they will be certain that I the Lord have given the word of decision, when my wrath against them is complete.",,,,,,,
16190,"And I will make you a waste and a name of shame among the nations round about you, in the eyes of everyone who goes by.",,,,,,,
16191,"And you will be a name of shame and a cause of bitter words, an example and a wonder to the nations round about you, when I give effect to my judging among you in wrath and in passion and in burning protests: I the Lord have said it:",,,,,,,
16192,"When I send on you the evil arrows of disease, causing destruction, which I will send to put an end to you; and, further, I will take away your necessary food.",,,,,,,
16193,"And I will send on you need of food and evil beasts, and they will be a cause of loss to you; and disease and violent death will go through you; and I will send the sword on you: I the Lord have said it.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16194,"Son of man, let your face be turned to the mountains of Israel, and be a prophet to them, and say,",,,,,,,
16195,"You mountains of Israel, give ear to the words of the Lord: this is what the Lord has said to the mountains and the hills, to the waterways and the valleys: See, I, even I, am sending on you a sword for the destruction of your high places.",,,,,,,
16196,"And your altars will be made waste, and your sun-images will be broken: and I will have your dead men placed before your images.",,,,,,,
16197,"And I will put the dead bodies of the children of Israel in front of their images, sending your bones in all directions about your altars.",,,,,,,
16198,"In all your living-places the towns will become broken walls, and the high places made waste; so that your altars may be broken down and made waste, and your images broken and ended, and so that your sun-images may be cut down and your works rubbed out.",,,,,,,
16199,"And the dead will be falling down among you, and you will be certain that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
16200,"But still, I will keep a small band safe from the sword among the nations, when you are sent wandering among the countries.",,,,,,,
16201,"And those of you who are kept safe will have me in mind among the nations where they have been taken away as prisoners, how I sent punishment on their hearts which were untrue to me, and on their eyes which were turned to their false gods: and they will",e full of ha,e f,r,the,selv,s b,cause

16207,"And you, son of man, say, This is what the Lord has said to the land of Israel: An end has come, the end has come on the four quarters of the land.",,,,,,,
16208,"Now the end has come on you, and I will send my wrath on you, judging you for your ways, I will send punishment on you for all your disgusting acts.",,,,,,,
16209,"My eye will not have mercy on you, and I will have no pity: but I will send the punishment of your ways on you, and your disgusting works will be among you: and you will be certain that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,

16258,"And as for me, my eye will not have mercy, and I will have no pity, but I will send the punishment of their ways on their heads.",,,,,,,
16259,"Then the man clothed in linen, who had the inkpot at his side, came back and said, I have done what you gave me orders to do.Then looking, I saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapph","re stone, ha",ing,t,e f,rm o,a,ing's
16260,"And he said to the man clothed in linen, Go in between the wheels, under the winged ones, and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town. And he went in before my eyes.",,,,,,,
16261,Now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the inner square was full of the cloud.,,,,,,,
16262,And the glory of the Lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house; and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the Lord's glory.,,,,,,,
16263,"And the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square, like the voice of the Ruler of all.",,,,,,,
16264,"And when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the winged ones, then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel.",,,,,,,
16265,"And stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones, he took some of it and went out.",,,,,,,
16266,And I saw the form of a man's hands among the winged ones under their wings.,,,,,,,
16267,"And looking, I saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones, one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another: and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye.",,,,,,,
16268,"In form the four of them were all the same, they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel.",,,,,,,
16269,"When they were moving, they went on their four sides without turning; they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking; they went without turning.",,,,,,,
16270,And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about.,,,,,,,
16271,"As for the wheels, they were named in my hearing, the circling wheels.",,,,,,,
16272,"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a winged one, and the second was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.",,,,,,,
16273,And the winged ones went up on high: this is the living being which I saw by the river Chebar.,,,,,,,
16274,"And when the winged ones went, the wheels went by their side: and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth, the wheels were not turned from their side.",,,,,,,
16275,"When they were at rest in their place, these were at rest; when they were lifted up, these went up with them: for the spirit of life was in them.",,,,,,,
16276,"Then the glory of the Lord went out from the doorstep of the house, and came to rest over the winged ones.",,,,,,,
16277,"And the winged ones, lifting up their wings, went up from the earth before my eyes, with the wheels by their side: and they came to rest at the east doorway of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.",,,,,,,
16278,This is the living being which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones.,,,,,,,
16279,Every one had four faces and every one had four wings; and hands like a man's hands were under their wings.,,,,,,,
16280,"As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose form I saw by the river Chebar; when they went, every one of them went straight forward.And the wind, lifting me up, took me to the east doorway of the Lord's house, looking to the east: and at th",door I saw,wen,y,fiv,men,an,amon
16281,"Then he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who are designing evil, who are teaching evil ways in this town:",,,,,,,
16282,"Who say, This is not the time for building houses: this town is the cooking-pot and we are the flesh.",,,,,,,
16283,"For this cause be a prophet against them, be a prophet, O son of man.",,,,,,,
16284,"And the spirit of the Lord came on me, and he said to me, Say, These are the words of the Lord: This is what you have said, O children of Israel; what comes into your mind is clear to me.",,,,,,,
16285,"You have made great the number of your dead in this town, you have made its streets full of dead men.",,,,,,,
16286,"For this reason the Lord has said: Your dead whom you have put down in its streets, they are the flesh, and this town is the cooking-pot: but I will make you come out from inside it.",,,,,,,
16287,"You have been fearing the sword, and I will send the sword on you, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16288,"I will make you come out from inside the town and will give you up into the hands of men from other lands, and will be judge among you.",,,,,,,
16289,You will come to your death by the sword; and I will be your judge in the land of Israel; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.,,,,,,,
16290,"This town will not be your cooking- pot, and you will not be the flesh inside it; I will be your judge at the limit of the land of Israel;",,,,,,,
16291,"And you will be certain that I am the Lord: for you have not been guided by my rules or given effect to my orders, but you have been living by the orders of the nations round about you.",,,,,,,
16292,"Now while I was saying these things, death came to Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah. Then falling down on my face and crying out with a loud voice, I said, Ah, Lord! will you put an end to all the rest of Israel?",,,,,,,
16293,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16294,"Son of man, your countrymen, your relations, and all the children of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the people of Jerusalem have said, Go far from the Lord; this land is given to us for a heritage:",,,,,,,
16295,"For this reason say, This is what the Lord has said: Though I have had them moved far off among the nations, and though I have sent them wandering among the countries, still I have been a safe place for them for a little time in the countries where they",ave come.,,,,,,
16296,"Then say, This is what the Lord has said: I will get you together from the peoples, and make you come out of the countries where you have been sent in flight, and I will give you the land of Israel.",,,,,,,
16297,"And they will come there, and take away all the hated and disgusting things from it.",,,,,,,
16298,"And I will give them a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in them; and I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh:",,,,,,,
16299,"So that they may be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them: and they will be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.",,,,,,,
16300,"But as for those whose heart goes after their hated and disgusting things, I will send on their heads the punishment of their ways, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16301,"Then the wings of the winged ones were lifted up, and the wheels were by their side; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them on high.",,,,,,,
16302,"And the glory of the Lord went up from inside the town, and came to rest on the mountain on the east side of the town.",,,,,,,
16303,"And the wind, lifting me up, took me in the visions of God into Chaldaea, to those who had been taken away as prisoners. So the vision which I had seen went away from me.",,,,,,,
16304,"Then I gave an account to those who had been taken prisoners of all the things which the Lord had made me see.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16305,"Son of man, you are living among an uncontrolled people, who have eyes to see but see not, and ears for hearing but they do not give ear; for they are an uncontrolled people.",,,,,,,
16306,"And you, O son of man, by day, before their eyes, get ready the vessels of one who is taken away, and go away from your place to another place before their eyes: it may be that they will see, though they are an uncontrolled people.",,,,,,,
16307,"By day, before their eyes, take out your vessels like those of one who is taken away: and go out in the evening before their eyes, like those who are taken away as prisoners.",,,,,,,
16308,"Make a hole in the wall, before their eyes, and go out through it.",,,,,,,
16309,"And before their eyes, take your goods on your back and go out in the dark; go with your face covered: for I have made you a sign to the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
16310,"And I did as I was ordered: I took out my vessels by day, like those of one who is taken away, and in the evening I made a hole through the wall with a tent-pin; and in the dark I went out, taking my things on my back before their eyes.",,,,,,,
16311,"And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16312,"Son of man, has not Israel, the uncontrolled people, said to you, What are you doing?",,,,,,,
16313,"You are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: This word has to do with the ruler in Jerusalem and all the children of Israel in it.",,,,,,,
16314,"Say, I am your sign: as I have done, so will it be done to them: they will go away as prisoners.",,,,,,,
16315,And the ruler who is among them will take his goods on his back in the dark and go out: he will make a hole in the wall through which to go out: he will have his face covered so that he may not be seen.,,,,,,,
16316,"And my net will be stretched out on him, and he will be taken in my cords: and I will take him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldaeans; but he will not see it, and there death will come to him.",,,,,,,
16317,And all his helpers round about him and all his armies I will send in flight to every wind; and I will let loose a sword after them.,,,,,,,
16318,"And they will be certain that I am the Lord, when I send them in flight among the nations, driving them out through the countries.",,,,,,,
16319,"But a small number of them I will keep from the sword, from the need of food, and from disease, so that they may make clear all their disgusting ways among the nations where they come; and they will be certain that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
16320,"Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16321,"Son of man, take your food with shaking fear, and your water with trouble and care;",,,,,,,
16322,"And say to the people of the land, This is what the Lord has said about the people of Jerusalem and the land of Israel: They will take their food with care and their drink with wonder, so that all the wealth of their land may be taken from it because of",he violent w,ys,f,the,peop,e l,ving
16323,"And the peopled towns will be made waste, and the land will become a wonder; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
16324,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16325,"Son of man, what is this saying which you have about the land of Israel, The time is long and every vision comes to nothing?",,,,,,,
16326,"For this cause say to them, This is what the Lord has said: I have made this saying come to an end, and it will no longer be used as a common saying in Israel; but say to them, The days are near, and the effect of every vision.",,,,,,,
16327,For there will be no more false visions or smooth use of secret arts in Israel.,,,,,,,
16328,"For I am the Lord; I will say the word and what I say I will do; it will not be put off: for in your days, O uncontrolled people, I will say the word and do it, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16329,"Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16330,"Son of man, see, the children of Israel say, The vision which he sees is for the days which are a long way off, and his words are of times still far away.",,,,,,,
16331,"Say to them then, This is what the Lord has said: Not one of my words will be put off any longer, but what I say I will do, says the Lord.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16332,"Son of man, be a prophet against the prophets of Israel, and say to those prophets whose words are the invention of their hearts, Give ear to the word of the Lord;",,,,,,,
16333,This is what the Lord has said: A curse on the foolish prophets who go after the spirit which is in them and have seen nothing!,,,,,,,
16334,"O Israel, your prophets have been like jackals in the waste places.",,,,,,,
16335,You have not gone up into the broken places or made up the wall for the children of Israel to take your place in the fight in the day of the Lord.,,,,,,,
16336,"They have seen visions without substance and made use of secret arts, who say, The Lord has said; and the Lord has not sent them: hoping that the word would have effect.",,,,,,,
16337,"Have you not seen a vision without substance and have you not falsely made use of secret arts, when you say, The Lord has said; though I have said nothing?",,,,,,,
16338,"So this is what the Lord has said: Because your words are without substance and your visions are false, see, I am against you, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16339,"And my hand will be against the prophets who see visions without substance and who make false use of secret arts: they will not be in the secret of my people, and they will not be recorded in the list of the children of Israel, and they will not come int",the land of,Isr,e,; a,d it,wil,be c
16340,"Because, even because they have been guiding my people into error, saying, Peace; when there is no peace; and in the building of a division wall they put whitewash on it:",,,,,,,
16341,"Say to those who put whitewash on it, There will be an overflowing shower; and you, O ice-drops, will come raining down; and it will be broken in two by the storm-wind.",,,,,,,
16342,"And when the wall has come down, will they not say to you, Where is the whitewash which you put on it?",,,,,,,
16343,"For this reason, the Lord has said: I will have it broken in two by a storm-wind in my passion; and there will be an overflowing shower in my wrath, and you, O ice-drops, will come raining angrily down.",,,,,,,
16344,"So I will let the wall, which you were covering with whitewash, be broken down; I will have it levelled to the earth so that its base is uncovered: it will come down, and destruction will come on you with it; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lor",.,,,,,,
16345,"So I will let loose my passion on the wall in full measure, and on those who put whitewash on it; and I will say to you, Where is the wall, and where are those who put whitewash on it?",,,,,,,
16346,"Even the prophets of Israel who say words to Jerusalem, who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16347,"And you, son of man, let your face be turned against the daughters of your people, who are acting the part of prophets at their pleasure; be a prophet against them, and say,",,,,,,,
16348,"This is what the Lord has said: A curse is on the women who are stitching bands on all arms and putting veils on the heads of those of every size, so that they may go after souls! Will you go after the souls of my people and keep yourselves safe from dea",h?,,,,,,
16349,"And you have put me to shame among my people for a little barley and some bits of bread, sending death on souls for whom there is no cause of death, and keeping those souls living who have no right to life, by the false words you say to my people who giv",ear to what,is,a,se.,,,
16350,"For this cause the Lord has said: See, I am against your bands with which you go after souls, and I will violently take them off their arms; and I will let loose the souls, even the souls whom you go after freely.",,,,,,,
16351,"And I will have your veils violently parted in two, and will make my people free from your hands, and they will no longer be in your power for you to go after them; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
16352,Because with your false words you have given pain to the heart of the upright man when I had not made him sad; in order to make strong the hands of the evil-doer so that he may not be turned from his evil way and get life:,,,,,,,
16353,For this cause you will see no more foolish visions or make false use of secret arts: and I will make my people free from your power; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.Then certain of the responsible men of Israel came to me and took their seats,before me.,,,,,,
16354,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16355,"Son of man, these men have taken their false gods into their hearts and put before their faces the sin which is the cause of their fall: am I to give ear when they come to me for directions?",,,,,,,
16356,"For this cause say to them, These are the words of the Lord: Every man of Israel who has taken his false god into his heart, and put before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall, and comes to the prophet; I the Lord will give him an answer by m",self in agre,men,,ith,the,umb,r of

16358,"For this cause say to the children of Israel, These are the words of the Lord: Come back and give up your false gods and let your faces be turned from your disgusting things.",,,,,,,
16359,"When any one of the men of Israel, or of those from other lands who are living in Israel, who has become strange to me, and takes his false gods into his heart, and puts before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall, comes to the prophet to get",irections fr,m m,;,I t,e Lo,d w,ll gi

16361,"And if the prophet, tricked by deceit, says anything, it is I the Lord by whom he has been tricked, and I will put out my hand against him, and he will be cut off from among my people Israel.",,,,,,,
16362,And the punishment of their sin will be on them: the sin of the prophet will be the same as the sin of him who goes to him for directions;,,,,,,,
16363,"So that the children of Israel may no longer go wandering away from me, or make themselves unclean with all their wrongdoing; but they will be my people, and I will be their God, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16364,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16365,"Son of man, when a land, sinning against me, does wrong, and my hand is stretched out against it, and the support of its bread is broken, and I make it short of food, cutting off man and beast from it:",,,,,,,
16366,"Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, only themselves would they keep safe by their righteousness, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16367,"Or if I send evil beasts through the land causing destruction and making it waste, so that no man may go through because of the beasts:",,,,,,,
16368,"Even if these three men were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep safe their sons or daughters, but only themselves, and the land would be made waste.",,,,,,,
16369,"Or if I send a sword against that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, cutting off from it man and beast:",,,,,,,
16370,"Even if these three men were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep safe their sons or daughters, but only themselves.",,,,,,,
16371,"Or if I send disease into that land, letting loose my wrath on it in blood, cutting off from it man and beast:",,,,,,,
16372,"Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep son or daughter safe; only themselves would they keep safe through their righteousness.",,,,,,,
16373,"For this is what the Lord has said: How much more when I send my four bitter punishments on Jerusalem, the sword and need of food and evil beasts and disease, cutting off from it man and beast?",,,,,,,
16374,"But truly, there will still be a small band who will be safe, even sons and daughters: and they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings: and you will be comforted about the evil which I have sent on Jerusalem, even about everyt",ing I have s,nt,n,it.,,,
16375,"They will give you comfort when you see their ways and their doings: and you will be certain that not for nothing have I done all the things I have done in it, says the Lord.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16376,"Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods?",,,,,,,
16377,Will its wood be used for any work? do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on?,,,,,,,
16378,"See, it is put into the fire for burning: the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned; is it good for any work?",,,,,,,
16379,"Truly, before it was cut down, it was not used for any purpose: how much less, when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned, will it be made into anything?",,,,,,,
16380,"For this cause the Lord has said: Like the vine-tree among the trees of the woods which I have given to the fire for burning, so will I give the people of Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
16381,And my face will be turned against them; and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord when my face is turned against them.,,,,,,,
16382,"And I will make the land a waste because they have done evil, says the Lord.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16383,"Son of man, make clear to Jerusalem her disgusting ways,",,,,,,,
16384,"And say, This is what the Lord has said to Jerusalem: Your start and your birth was from the land of the Canaanite; an Amorite was your father and your mother was a Hittite.",,,,,,,
16385,"As for your birth, on the day of your birth your cord was not cut and you were not washed in water to make you clean; you were not salted or folded in linen bands.",,,,,,,
16386,"No eye had pity on you to do any of these things to you or to be kind to you; but you were put out into the open country, because your life was hated at the time of your birth.",,,,,,,
16387,"And when I went past you and saw you stretched out in your blood, I said to you, Though you are stretched out in your blood, have life;",,,,,,,
16388,"And be increased in number like the buds of the field; and you were increased and became great, and you came to the time of love: your breasts were formed and your hair was long; but you were uncovered and without clothing.",,,,,,,
16389,"Now when I went past you, looking at you, I saw that your time was the time of love; and I put my skirts over you, covering your unclothed body: and I gave you my oath and made an agreement with you, says the Lord, and you became mine.",,,,,,,
16390,"Then I had you washed with water, washing away all your blood and rubbing you with oil.",,,,,,,
16391,"And I had you clothed with needlework, and put leather shoes on your feet, folding fair linen about you and covering you with silk.",,,,,,,
16392,And I made you fair with ornaments and put jewels on your hands and a chain on your neck.,,,,,,,
16393,And I put a ring in your nose and ear-rings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.,,,,,,,
16394,So you were made beautiful with gold and silver; and your clothing was of the best linen and silk and needlework; your food was the best meal and honey and oil: and you were very beautiful.,,,,,,,
16395,"You were so beautiful that the story of you went out into all nations; you were completely beautiful because of my glory which I had put on you, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16396,"But you put your faith in the fact that you were beautiful, acting like a loose woman because you were widely talked of, and offering your cheap love to everyone who went by, whoever it might be.",,,,,,,
16397,"And you took your robes and made high places for yourself ornamented with every colour, acting like a loose woman on them, without shame or fear.",,,,,,,
16398,"And you took the fair jewels, my silver and gold which I had given to you, and made for yourself male images, acting like a loose woman with them;",,,,,,,
16399,"And you took your robes of needlework for their clothing, and put my oil and my perfume before them.",,,,,,,
16400,"And my bread which I gave you, the best meal and oil and honey which I gave you for your food, you put it before them for a sweet smell, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16401,"And you took your sons and your daughters whom I had by you, offering even these to them to be their food. Was your loose behaviour so small a thing,",,,,,,,
16402,That you put my children to death and gave them up to go through the fire to them?,,,,,,,
16403,"And in all your disgusting and false behaviour you had no memory of your early days, when you were uncovered and without clothing, stretched out in your blood.",,,,,,,
16404,"And it came about, after all your evil-doing, says the Lord,",,,,,,,
16405,That you made for yourself an arched room in every open place.,,,,,,,
16406,"You put up your high places at the top of every street, and made the grace of your form a disgusting thing, opening your feet to everyone who went by, increasing your loose ways.",,,,,,,
16407,"And you went with the Egyptians, your neighbours, great of flesh; increasing your loose ways, moving me to wrath.",,,,,,,
16408,"Now, then, my hand is stretched out against you, cutting down your fixed amount, and I have given you up to the desire of your haters, the daughters of the Philistines who are shamed by your loose ways.",,,,,,,
16409,"And you went with the Assyrians, because of your desire which was without measure; you were acting like a loose woman with them, and still you had not enough.",,,,,,,
16410,"And you went on in your loose ways, even as far as the land of Chaldaea, and still you had not enough.",,,,,,,
16411,"How feeble is your heart, says the Lord, seeing that you do all these things, the work of a loose and overruling woman;",,,,,,,
16412,"For you have made your arched room at the top of every street, and your high place in every open place; though you were not like a loose woman in getting together your payment.",,,,,,,
16413,The untrue wife who takes strange lovers in place of her husband!,,,,,,,
16414,"They give payment to all loose women: but you give rewards to your lovers, offering them payment so that they may come to you on every side for your cheap love.",,,,,,,
16415,"And in your loose behaviour you are different from other women, for no one goes after you to make love to you: and because you give payment and no payment is given to you, in this you are different from them.",,,,,,,
16416,"For this cause, O loose woman, give ear to the voice of the Lord:",,,,,,,
16417,"This is what the Lord has said: Because your unclean behaviour was let loose and your body uncovered in your loose ways with your lovers and with your disgusting images, and for the blood of your children which you gave to them;",,,,,,,
16418,"For this cause I will get together all your lovers with whom you have taken your pleasure, and all those to whom you have given your love, with all those who were hated by you; I will even make them come together against you on every side, and I will hav",you uncover,d b,f,re,hem,o t,at th
16419,And you will be judged by me as women are judged who have been untrue to their husbands and have taken life; and I will let loose against you passion and bitter feeling.,,,,,,,
16420,"I will give you into their hands, and your arched room will be overturned and your high places broken down; they will take your clothing off you and take away your fair jewels: and when they have done, you will be uncovered and shamed.",,,,,,,
16421,"And they will get together a meeting against you, stoning you with stones and wounding you with their swords.",,,,,,,
16422,"And they will have you burned with fire, sending punishments on you before the eyes of great numbers of women; and I will put an end to your loose ways, and you will no longer give payment.",,,,,,,
16423,"And the heat of my wrath against you will have an end, and my bitter feeling will be turned away from you, and I will be quiet and will be angry no longer.",,,,,,,
16424,"Because you have not kept in mind the days when you were young, but have been troubling me with all these things; for this reason I will make the punishment of your ways come on your head, says the Lord, because you have done this evil thing in addition",o all your d,sgu,t,ng,cts.,,
16425,"See, in every common saying about you it will be said, As the mother is, so is her daughter.",,,,,,,
16426,You are the daughter of your mother whose soul is turned in disgust from her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters who were turned in disgust from their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite and your father an,morite.,,,,,,
16427,"Your older sister is Samaria, living at your left hand, she and her daughters: and your younger sister, living at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.",,,,,,,
16428,"Still you have not gone in their ways or done the disgusting things which they have done; but, as if that was only a little thing, you have gone deeper in evil than they in all your ways.",,,,,,,
16429,"By my life, says the Lord, Sodom your sister never did, she or her daughters, what you and your daughters have done.",,,,,,,
16430,"Truly, this was the sin of your sister Sodom: pride, a full measure of food, and the comforts of wealth in peace, were seen in her and her daughters, and she gave no help to the poor or to those in need.",,,,,,,
16431,They were full of pride and did what was disgusting to me: and so I took them away as you have seen.,,,,,,,
16432,"And Samaria has not done half your sins; but you have made the number of your disgusting acts greater than theirs, making your sisters seem more upright than you by all the disgusting things which you have done.",,,,,,,
16433,"And you yourself will be put to shame, in that you have given the decision for your sisters; through your sins, which are more disgusting than theirs, they are more upright than you: truly, you will be shamed and made low, for you have made your sisters",eem upright.,,,,,,
16434,"And I will let their fate be changed, the fate of Sodom and her daughters, and the fate of Samaria and her daughters, and your fate with theirs.",,,,,,,
16435,"So that you will be shamed and made low because of all you have done, when I have mercy on you.",,,,,,,
16436,"And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will go back to their first condition, and Samaria and her daughters will go back to their first condition, and you and your daughters will go back to your first condition.",,,,,,,
16437,"Was not your sister Sodom an oath in your mouth in the day of your pride,",,,,,,,
16438,"Before your shame was uncovered? Now you have become like her a word of shame to the daughters of Edom and all who are round about you, the daughters of the Philistines who put shame on you round about.",,,,,,,
16439,"The reward of your evil designs and your disgusting ways has come on you, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16440,"For this is what the Lord has said: I will do to you as you have done, you who, putting the oath on one side, have let the agreement be broken.",,,,,,,
16441,"But still I will keep in mind the agreement made with you in the days when you were young, and I will make with you an eternal agreement.",,,,,,,
16442,"Then at the memory of your ways you will be overcome with shame, when I take your sisters, the older and the younger, and give them to you for daughters, but not by your agreement.",,,,,,,
16443,And I will make my agreement with you; and you will be certain that I am the Lord:,,,,,,,
16444,"So that, at the memory of these things, you may be at a loss, never opening your mouth because of your shame; when you have my forgiveness for all you have done, says the Lord.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16445,"Son of man, give out a dark saying, and make a comparison for the children of Israel,",,,,,,,
16446,"And say, This is what the Lord has said: A great eagle with great wings, full of long feathers of different colours, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:",,,,,,,
16447,"Biting off the highest of its young branches, he took it to the land of Canaan, and put it in a town of traders.",,,,,,,
16448,"And he took some of the seed of the land, planting it in fertile earth, placing it by great waters; he put it in like a willow-tree.",,,,,,,
16449,"And its growth went on and it became a vine, low and widely stretching, whose branches were turned to him and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, putting out branches and young leaves.",,,,,,,
16450,"And there was another eagle with great wings and thick feathers: and now this vine, pushing out its roots to him, sent out its branches in his direction from the bed where it was planted, so that he might give it water.",,,,,,,
16451,He had it planted in a good field by great waters so that it might put out branches and have fruit and be a strong vine.,,,,,,,
16452,"Say, This is what the Lord has said: Will it do well? will he not have its roots pulled up and its branches cut off, so that all its young leaves may become dry and it may be pulled up by its roots?",,,,,,,
16453,"And if it is planted will it do well? will it not become quite dry at the touch of the east wind, drying up in the bed where it was planted?",,,,,,,
16454,"Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16455,"Say now to this uncontrolled people, Are these things not clear to you? Say to them, See, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to Babylon;",,,,,,,
16456,"And he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him; and he put him under an oath, and took away the great men of the land:",,,,,,,
16457,"So that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up, but might keep his agreement to be his servants.",,,,,,,
16458,But he went against his authority in sending representatives to Egypt to get from them horses and a great army. Will he do well? will he be safe who does such things? if the agreement is broken will he be safe?,,,,,,,
16459,"By my life, says the Lord, truly in the place of the king who made him king, whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken, even in Babylon he will come to his death.",,,,,,,
16460,"And Pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war, when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives:",,,,,,,
16461,"For he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken; and though he had given his hand to it, he did all these things; he will not get away safe.",,,,,,,
16462,"And so the Lord has said, By my life, truly, for my oath which he put on one side, and my agreement which has been broken, I will send punishment on his head.",,,,,,,
16463,"My net will be stretched out over him, and he will be taken in my cords, and I will send him to Babylon, and there I will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me.",,,,,,,
16464,"All his best fighting-men will be put to the sword, and the rest will be sent away to every wind: and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it.",,,,,,,
16465,"This is what the Lord has said: Further, I will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth; cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one, I will have it planted on a high and great mountain;",,,,,,,
16466,"It will be planted on the high mountain of Israel: it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar: under it all birds of every sort will make their living-place, resting in the shade of its branches.",,,,,,,
16467,"And it will be clear to all the trees of the field that I the Lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree, drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth; I the Lord have said it and have done it.The word of the Lord came","to me again,",say,n,",",,,
16468,"Why do you make use of this saying about the land of Israel, The fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the children's teeth are on edge?",,,,,,,
16469,"By my life, says the Lord, you will no longer have this saying in Israel.",,,,,,,
16470,"See, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so the soul of the son is mine: death will be the fate of the sinner's soul.",,,,,,,

16482,"Or done wrong to any, or taken anything from one in his debt, or taken goods by force, but has given food to him who was in need of it, and clothing to him who was without it;",,,,,,,
16483,"Who has kept his hand from evil-doing and has not taken interest or great profits, who has done my orders and been guided by my rules: he will certainly not be put to death for the evil-doing of his father; life will certainly be his.",,,,,,,
16484,"As for his father, because he was cruel, took goods by force, and did what is not good among his people, truly, death will overtake him in his evil-doing.",,,,,,,
16485,"But you say, Why does not the son undergo punishment for the evil-doing of the father? When the son has done what is ordered and right, and has kept my rules and done them, life will certainly be his.",,,,,,,
16486,"The soul which does sin will be put to death: the son will not be made responsible for the evil-doing of the father, or the father for the evil-doing of the son; the righteousness of the upright will be on himself, and the evil-doing of the evil-doer on",imself.,,,,,,
16487,"But if the evil-doer, turning away from all the sins which he has done, keeps my rules and does what is ordered and right, life will certainly be his; death will not be his fate.",,,,,,,
16488,Not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in memory against him: in the righteousness which he has done he will have life.,,,,,,,
16489,Have I any pleasure in the death of the evil-doer? says the Lord: am I not pleased if he is turned from his way so that he may have life?,,,,,,,
16490,"But when the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, like all the disgusting things which the evil man does, will he have life? Not one of his upright acts will be keptin memory: in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death wi",l overtake h,m.,,,,,

16502,"Now when she saw that her hope was made foolish and gone, she took another of her little ones and made him into a young lion.",,,,,,,
16503,"And he went up and down among the lions and became a young lion, learning to go after beasts for his food; and he took men for his meat.",,,,,,,
16504,And he sent destruction on their widows and made waste their towns; and the land and everything in it became waste because of the loud sound of his voice.,,,,,,,
16505,Then the nations came against him from the kingdoms round about: their net was stretched over him and he was taken in the hole they had made.,,,,,,,
16506,"They made him a prisoner with hooks, and took him to the king of Babylon; they put him in the strong place so that his voice might be sounding no longer on the mountains of Israel.",,,,,,,
16507,"Your mother was in comparison like a vine, planted by the waters: she was fertile and full of branches because of the great waters.",,,,,,,
16508,"And she had a strong rod for a rod of authority for the rulers, and it became tall among the clouds and it was seen lifted up among the number of its branches.",,,,,,,

16514,"Will you be their judge, O son of man, will you be their judge? make clear to them the disgusting ways of their fathers,",,,,,,,
16515,"And say to them, This is what the Lord has said: In the day when I took Israel for myself, when I made an oath to the seed of the family of Jacob, and I gave them knowledge of myself in the land of Egypt, saying to them with an oath, I am the Lord your G",d;,,,,,,
16516,"In that day I gave my oath to take them out of the land of Egypt into a land which I had been searching out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands:",,,,,,,
16517,"And I said to them, Let every man among you put away the disgusting things to which his eyes are turned, and do not make yourselves unclean with the images of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.",,,,,,,
16518,"But they would not be controlled by me, and did not give ear to me; they did not put away the disgusting things to which their eyes were turned, or give up the images of Egypt: then I said I would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wr",th against t,em,n,the,land,of,gypt.

16520,So I made them go out of the land of Egypt and took them into the waste land.,,,,,,,

16526,"Because they were turned away from my orders, and were not guided by my rules, and had no respect for my Sabbaths: for their hearts went after their images.",,,,,,,
16527,But still my eye had pity on them and I kept them from destruction and did not put an end to them completely in the waste land.,,,,,,,

16529,I am the Lord your God; be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them:,,,,,,,

16534,"Because they had not done my orders, but had been turned away from my rules, and had not given respect to my Sabbaths, and their eyes were turned to the images of their fathers.",,,,,,,
16535,"And further, I gave them rules which were not good and orders in which there was no life for them;",,,,,,,

16578,"Put a pillar at the top of the road for the sword to come to Rabbah in the land of the children of Ammon, and to Judah and to Jerusalem in the middle of her.",,,,,,,
16579,"For the king of Babylon took his place at the parting of the ways, at the top of the two roads, to make use of secret arts: shaking the arrows this way and that, he put questions to the images of his gods, he took note of the inner parts of dead beasts.",,,,,,,
16580,"At his right hand was the fate of Jerusalem, to give orders for destruction, to send up the war-cry, to put engines of war against the doors, lifting up earthworks, building walls.",,,,,,,
16581,And this answer given by secret arts will seem false to those who have given their oaths and have let them be broken: but he will keep the memory of evil-doing so that they may be taken.,,,,,,,

16591,"And you, son of man, will you be a judge, will you be a judge of the town of blood? then make clear to her all her disgusting ways.",,,,,,,
16592,"And you are to say, This is what the Lord has said: A town causing blood to be drained out in her streets so that her time may come, and making images in her to make her unclean!",,,,,,,
16593,"You are responsible for the blood drained out by you, and you are unclean through the images which you have made; and you have made your day come near, and the time of your judging has come; for this cause I have made you a name of shame to the nations a",d a cause of,lau,h,ng,o al,co,ntrie
16594,"Those who are near and those who are far from you will make sport of you; your name is unclean, you are full of sounds of fear.",,,,,,,
16595,"See, the rulers of Israel, every one in his family, have been causing death in you.",,,,,,,
16596,In you they have had no respect for father and mother; in you they have been cruel to the man from a strange land; in you they have done wrong to the child without a father and to the widow.,,,,,,,
16597,"You have made little of my holy things, and have made my Sabbaths unclean.",,,,,,,
16598,"In you there are men who say evil of others, causing death; in you they have taken the flesh with the blood for food; in your streets they have put evil designs into effect.",,,,,,,
16599,In you they have let the shame of their fathers be seen; in you they have done wrong to a woman at the time when she was unclean.,,,,,,,
16600,"And in you one man has done what was disgusting with his neighbour's wife; and another has made his daughter-in- law unclean; and another has done wrong to his sister, his father's daughter.",,,,,,,
16601,"In you they have taken rewards as the price of blood; you have taken interest and great profits, and you have taken away your neighbours' goods by force, and have not kept me in mind, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16602,"See, then, I have made my hands come together in wrath against your taking of goods by force and against the blood which has been flowing in you.",,,,,,,
16603,Will your heart be high or your hands strong in the days when I take you in hand? I the Lord have said it and will do it.,,,,,,,
16604,And I will send you in flight among the nations and wandering among the countries; and I will completely take away out of you everything which is unclean.,,,,,,,
16605,And you will be made low before the eyes of the nations; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord.,,,,,,,
16606,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16607,"Son of man, the children of Israel have become like the poorest sort of waste metal to me: they are all silver and brass and tin and iron and lead mixed with waste.",,,,,,,
16608,"For this cause the Lord has said: Because you have all become waste metal, see, I will get you together inside Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
16609,"As they put silver and brass and iron and lead and tin together inside the oven, heating up the fire on it to make it soft; so will I get you together in my wrath and in my passion, and, heating the fire with my breath, will make you soft.",,,,,,,

16613,"Son of man, say to her, You are a land on which no rain or thunderstorm has come in the day of wrath.",,,,,,,
16614,Her rulers in her are like a loud-voiced lion violently taking his food; they have made a meal of souls; they have taken wealth and valued property; they have made great the number of widows in her.,,,,,,,
16615,"Her priests have been acting violently against my law; they have made my holy things unclean: they have made no division between what is holy and what is common, and they have not made it clear that the unclean is different from the clean, and their eyes",have been sh,t t,,y S,bbat,"s,",nd I
16616,"Her rulers in her are like wolves violently taking their food; putting men to death and causing the destruction of souls, so that they may get their profit.",,,,,,,
16617,"And her prophets have been using whitewash, seeing foolish visions and making false use of secret arts, saying, This is what the Lord has said, when the Lord has said nothing.",,,,,,,
16618,"The people of the land have been acting cruelly, taking men's goods by force; they have been hard on the poor and those in need, and have done wrong to the man from a strange land.",,,,,,,
16619,"And I was looking for a man among them who would make up the wall and take his station in the broken place before me for the land, so that I might not send destruction on it: but there was no one.",,,,,,,
16620,"And I let loose my passion on them, and have put an end to them in the fire of my wrath: I have made the punishment of their ways come on their heads, says the Lord.The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,",,,,,,,
16621,"Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:",,,,,,,
16622,"They were acting like loose women in Egypt; when they were young their behaviour was loose: there their breasts were crushed, even the points of their young breasts were crushed.",,,,,,,
16623,"Their names were Oholah, the older, and Oholibah, her sister: and they became mine, and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem, Oholibah.",,,,,,,
16624,"And Oholah was untrue to me when she was mine; she was full of desire for her lovers, even for the Assyrians, her neighbours,",,,,,,,
16625,"Who were clothed in blue, captains and rulers, all of them young men to be desired, horsemen seated on horses.",,,,,,,
16626,"And she gave her unclean love to them, all of them the noblest men of Assyria: and she made herself unclean with the images of all who were desired by her.",,,,,,,
16627,"And she has not given up her loose ways from the time when she was in Egypt; for when she was young they were her lovers, and by them her young breasts were crushed, and they let loose on her their unclean desire.",,,,,,,
16628,"For this cause I gave her up into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians on whom her desire was fixed.",,,,,,,
16629,By these her shame was uncovered: they took her sons and daughters and put her to death with the sword: and she became a cause of wonder to women; for they gave her the punishment which was right.,,,,,,,
16630,"And her sister Oholibah saw this, but her desire was even more unmeasured, and her loose behaviour was worse than that of her sister.",,,,,,,
16631,"She was full of desire for the Assyrians, captains and rulers, her neighbours, clothed in blue, horsemen going on horses, all of them young men to be desired.",,,,,,,
16632,And I saw that she had become unclean; the two of them went the same way.,,,,,,,
16633,"And her loose behaviour became worse; for she saw men pictured on a wall, pictures of the Chaldaeans painted in bright red,",,,,,,,
16634,"With bands round their bodies and with head-dresses hanging round their heads, all of them looking like rulers, like the Babylonians, the land of whose birth is Chaldaea.",,,,,,,
16635,"And when she saw them she was full of desire for them, and sent servants to them in Chaldaea.",,,,,,,
16636,"And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and made her unclean with their loose desire, and she became unclean with them, and her soul was turned from them.",,,,,,,
16637,So her loose behaviour was clearly seen and her shame uncovered: then my soul was turned from her as it had been turned from her sister.,,,,,,,
16638,"But still she went on the more with her loose behaviour, keeping in mind the early days when she had been a loose woman in the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
16639,"And she was full of desire for her lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose seed is like the seed of horses.",,,,,,,
16640,"And she made the memory of the loose ways of her early years come back to mind, when her young breasts were crushed by the Egyptians.",,,,,,,
16641,"For this cause, O Oholibah, this is what the Lord has said: See, I will make your lovers come up against you, even those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust; and I will make them come up against you on every side;",,,,,,,
16642,"The Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: young men to be desired, captains and rulers all of them, and chiefs, her neighbours, all of them on horseback.",,,,,,,
16643,"And they will come against you from the north on horseback, with war-carriages and a great band of peoples; they will put themselves in order against you with breastplate and body-cover and metal head-dress round about you: and I will make them your judg","s, and they",ill,g,ve,heir,dec,sion
16644,"And my bitter feeling will be working against you, and they will take you in hand with passion; they will take away your nose and your ears, and the rest of you will be put to the sword: they will take your sons and daughters, and the rest of you will be",burned up in,the,f,re.,,,
16645,And they will take all your clothing off you and take away your ornaments.,,,,,,,
16646,"So I will put an end to your evil ways and your loose behaviour which came from the land of Egypt: and your eyes will never be lifted up to them again, and you will have no more memory of Egypt.",,,,,,,
16647,"For this is what the Lord has said: See, I will give you up into the hands of those who are hated by you, into the hands of those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust:",,,,,,,
16648,"And they will take you in hand with hate, and take away all the fruit of your work, and let you be unveiled and without clothing: and the shame of your loose behaviour will be uncovered, your evil designs and your loose ways.",,,,,,,
16649,"They will do these things to you because you have been untrue to me, and have gone after the nations, and have become unclean with their images.",,,,,,,
16650,You have gone in the way of your sister; and I will give her cup into your hand.,,,,,,,
16651,"This is what the Lord has said: You will take a drink from your sister's cup, which is deep and wide: you will be laughed at and looked down on, more than you are able to undergo.",,,,,,,
16652,"You will be broken and full of sorrow, with the cup of wonder and destruction, with the cup of your sister Samaria.",,,,,,,
16653,"And after drinking it and draining it out, you will take the last drops of it to the end, pulling off your breasts: for I have said it, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16654,"So this is what the Lord has said: Because you have not kept me in your memory, and because your back has been turned to me, you will even undergo the punishment of your evil designs and your loose ways.",,,,,,,
16655,"Then the Lord said to me: Son of man, will you be the judge of Oholibah? then make clear to her the disgusting things she has done.",,,,,,,
16656,"For she has been false to me, and blood is on her hands, and with her images she has been untrue; and more than this, she made her sons, whom she had by me, go through the fire to them to be burned up.",,,,,,,
16657,"Further, this is what she has done to me: she has made my holy place unclean and has made my Sabbaths unclean.",,,,,,,
16658,"For when she had made an offering of her children to her images, she came into my holy place to make it unclean; see, this is what she has done inside my house.",,,,,,,
16659,"And she even sent for men to come from far away, to whom a servant was sent, and they came: for whom she was washing her body and painting her eyes and making herself fair with ornaments.",,,,,,,
16660,"And she took her seat on a great bed, with a table put ready before it on which she put my perfume and my oil.",,,,,,,
16661,... and they put jewels on her hands and beautiful crowns on her head.,,,,,,,
16662,Then I said ... now she will go on with her loose ways.,,,,,,,
16663,"And they went in to her, as men go to a loose woman: so they went in to Oholibah, the loose woman.",,,,,,,
16664,"And upright men will be her judges, judging her as false wives and women who take lives are judged; because she has been untrue to me and blood is on her hands.",,,,,,,
16665,"For this is what the Lord has said: I will make a great meeting of the people come together against her, and will send on her shaking fear and take everything from her.",,,,,,,
16666,"And the meeting, after stoning her with stones, will put an end to her with their swords; they will put her sons and daughters to death and have her house burned up with fire.",,,,,,,
16667,"And I will put an end to evil in all the land, teaching all women not to do as you have done.",,,,,,,
16668,"And I will send on you the punishment of your evil ways, and you will be rewarded for your sins with your images: and you will be certain that I am the Lord.And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of th","month, sayi","g,",,,,,
16669,"Son of man, put down in writing this very day: The king of Babylon let loose the weight of his attack against Jerusalem on this very day.",,,,,,,
16670,"And make a comparison for this uncontrolled people, and say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Put on the cooking-pot, put it on the fire and put water in it:",,,,,,,
16671,"And get the bits together, the fat tail, every good part, the leg and the top part of it: make it full of the best bones.",,,,,,,
16672,"Take the best of the flock, put much wood under it: see that its bits are boiling well; let the bones be cooked inside it.",,,,,,,
16673,"For this is what the Lord has said: A curse is on the town of blood, the cooking-pot which is unclean inside, which has never been made clean! take out its bits; its fate is still to come on it.",,,,,,,
16674,For her blood is in her; she has put it on the open rock not draining it on to the earth so that it might be covered with dust;,,,,,,,
16675,"In order that it might make wrath come up to give punishment, she has put her blood on the open rock, so that it may not be covered.",,,,,,,
16676,For this cause the Lord has said: A curse is on the town of blood! and I will make great the burning mass.,,,,,,,
16677,"Put on much wood, heating up the fire, boiling the flesh well, and making the soup thick, and let the bones be burned.",,,,,,,
16678,"And I will put her on the coals so that she may be heated and her brass burned, so that what is unclean in her may become soft and her waste be completely taken away.",,,,,,,
16679,"I have made myself tired to no purpose: still all the waste which is in her has not come out, it has an evil smell.",,,,,,,
16680,"As for your unclean purpose: because I have been attempting to make you clean, but you have not been made clean from it, you will not be made clean till I have let loose my passion on you in full measure.",,,,,,,
16681,"I the Lord have said the word and I will do it; I will not go back or have mercy, and my purpose will not be changed; in the measure of your ways and of your evil doings you will be judged, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
16682,"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16683,"Son of man, see, I am taking away the desire of your eyes by disease: but let there be no sorrow or weeping or drops running from your eyes.",,,,,,,
16684,"Let there be no sound of sorrow; make no weeping for your dead, put on your head-dress and your shoes on your feet, let not your lips be covered, and do not take the food of those in grief.",,,,,,,
16685,So in the morning I was teaching the people and in the evening death took my wife; and in the morning I did what I had been ordered to do.,,,,,,,
16686,"And the people said to me, Will you not make clear to us the sense of these things; is it for us you do them?",,,,,,,
16687,"Then I said to them, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16688,"Say to the people of Israel, The Lord has said, See, I will make my holy place unclean, the pride of your strength, the pleasure of your eyes, and the desire of your soul; and your sons and daughters, who did not come with you here, will be put to the sw",rd.,,,,,,
16689,"And you will do as I have done, not covering your lips or taking the food of those in grief.",,,,,,,
16690,"And your head-dresses will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet: there will be no sorrow or weeping; but you will be wasting away in the punishment of your evil-doing, and you will be looking at one another in wonder.",,,,,,,
16691,"And Ezekiel will be a sign to you; everything he has done you will do: when this takes place, you will be certain that I am the Lord.",,,,,,,
16692,"And as for you, son of man, your mouth will be shut in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which their hearts are fixed, and their sons and daughters.",,,,,,,
16693,"In that day, one who has got away safe will come to you to give you news of it.",,,,,,,
16694,"In that day your mouth will be open to him who has got away safe, and you will say words to him and your lips will no longer be shut: so you will be a sign to them and they will be certain that I am the Lord.And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16695,"Son of man, let your face be turned to the children of Ammon, and be a prophet against them:",,,,,,,
16696,"And say to the children of Ammon, Give ear to the word of the Lord; this is what the Lord has said: Because you said, Aha! against my holy place when it was made unclean, and against the land of Israel when it was made waste, and against the people of Ju",ah when they,wer,,ake,awa,as,priso

16703,"To the children of the east I have given her for a heritage, as well as the children of Ammon, so that there may be no memory of her among the nations:",,,,,,,
16704,And I will be the judge of Moab; and they will see that I am the Lord.,,,,,,,
16705,"This is what the Lord has said: Because Edom has taken his payment from the people of Judah, and has done great wrong in taking payment from them;",,,,,,,
16706,"The Lord has said, My hand will be stretched out against Edom, cutting off from it man and beast: and I will make it waste, from Teman even as far as Dedan they will be put to the sword.",,,,,,,

16710,"And I will take great payment from them with acts of wrath; and they will be certain that I am the Lord when I send my punishment on them.Now in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",,,,,,,
16711,"Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she who was the doorway of the peoples is broken; she is turned over to them; she who was full is made waste;",,,,,,,
16712,"For this cause the Lord has said, See, I am against you, O Tyre, and will send up a number of nations against you as the sea sends up its waves.",,,,,,,
16713,"And they will give the walls of Tyre to destruction and have its towers broken: and I will take even her dust away from her, and make her an uncovered rock",,,,,,,
16714,"She will be a place for the stretching out of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have said it, says the Lord: and her goods will be given over to the nations.",,,,,,,
16715,And her daughters in the open country will be put to the sword: and they will be certain that I am the Lord.,,,,,,,
16716,"For this is what the Lord has said: See, I will send up from the north Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre, with horses and war-carriages and with an army and great numbers of people.",,,,,,,
16717,"He will put to the sword your daughters in the open country: he will make strong walls against you and put up an earthwork against you, arming himself for war against you.",,,,,,,
16718,"He will put up his engines of war against your walls, and your towers will be broken down by his axes.",,,,,,,
16719,"Because of the number of his horses you will be covered with their dust: your walls will be shaking at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the war-carriages, when he comes through your doorways, as into a town which has been broken open.",,,,,,,
16720,"Your streets will be stamped down by the feet of his horses: he will put your people to the sword, and will send down the pillars of your strength to the earth.",,,,,,,

17150,And the higher rooms were shorter: for the covered ways took up more space from these than from the lower and middle rooms.,,,,,,,

17328,And a regular amount of food and wine every day from the king's table was ordered for them by the king; and they were to be cared for for three years so that at the end of that time they might take their places before the king.,,,,,,,
17329,"And among these there were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",,,,,,,
17330,"And the captain of the unsexed servants gave them names; to Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar, to Hananiah the name of Shadrach, to Mishael the name of Meshach, and to Azariah the name of Abed-nego.",,,,,,,
17331,And Daniel had come to the decision that he would not make himself unclean with the king's food or wine; so he made a request to the captain of the unsexed servants that he might not make himself unclean.,,,,,,,
17332,And God put into the heart of the captain of the unsexed servants kind feelings and pity for Daniel.,,,,,,,
17333,"And the captain of the unsexed servants said to Daniel, I am in fear of my lord the king, who has given orders about your food and your drink; what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation? then you would have put my",ead in dange,fr,m,the,king,,

17335,Put your servants to the test for ten days; let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink.,,,,,,,
17336,"Then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the king's table; and, having seen them, do to your servants as it seems right to you.",,,,,,,
17337,So he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days.,,,,,,,
17338,And at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the king's table.,,,,,,,
17339,"So the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink, and gave them grain.",,,,,,,
17340,"Now as for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book-learning and wisdom: and Daniel was wise in all visions and dreams.",,,,,,,
17341,"Now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in, the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to Nebuchadnezzar.",,,,,,,
17342,"And the king had talk with them; and among them all there was no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they were given places before the king.",,,,,,,
17343,"And in any business needing wisdom and good sense, about which the king put questions to them, he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder-workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom.",,,,,,,
17344,"And Daniel went on till the first year of King Cyrus.In the second year of the rule of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him.",,,,,,,
17345,"Then the king gave orders that the wonder-workers, and the users of secret arts, and those who made use of evil powers, and the Chaldaeans, were to be sent for to make clear to the king his dreams. So they came and took their places before the king.",,,,,,,
17346,"And the king said to them, I have had a dream, and my spirit is troubled by the desire to have the dream made clear to me.",,,,,,,
17347,"Then the Chaldaeans said to the king in the Aramaean language, O King, have life for ever: give your servants an account of your dream, and we will make clear to you the sense of it.",,,,,,,
17348,"The king made answer and said to the Chaldaeans, This is my decision: if you do not make clear to me the dream and the sense of it, you will be cut in bits and your houses made waste.",,,,,,,
17349,"But if you make clear the dream and the sense of it, you will have from me offerings and rewards and great honour: so make clear to me the dream and the sense of it.",,,,,,,
17350,"A second time they said in answer, Let the king give his servants an account of his dream, and we will make clear the sense.",,,,,,,
17351,"The king made answer and said, I am certain that you are attempting to get more time, because you see that my decision is fixed;",,,,,,,
17352,"That if you do not make my dream clear to me there is only one fate for you: for you have made ready false and evil words to say before me till the times are changed: so give me an account of the dream, and I will be certain that you are able to make the",sense of it,lea,.,,,,
17353,"Then the Chaldaeans said to the king in answer, There is not a man on earth able to make clear the king's business; for no king, however great his power, has ever made such a request to any wonder-worker or user of secret arts or Chaldaean.",,,,,,,
17354,"The king's request is a very hard one, and there is no other who is able to make it clear to the king, but the gods, whose living-place is not with flesh.",,,,,,,
17355,"Because of this the king was angry and full of wrath, and gave orders for the destruction of all the wise men of Babylon.",,,,,,,
17356,So the order went out that the wise men were to be put to death; and they were looking for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.,,,,,,,
17357,"Then Daniel gave an answer with wisdom and good sense to Arioch, the captain of the king's armed men, who had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon;",,,,,,,
17358,"He made answer and said to Arioch, O captain of the king, why is the king's order so cruel? Then Arioch gave Daniel an account of the business.",,,,,,,
17359,And Daniel went in and made a request to the king to give him time and he would make clear the sense of his dream to the king.,,,,,,,
17360,"And Daniel went to his house and gave his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah the news:",,,,,,,
17361,So that they might make a request for the mercy of the God of heaven in the question of this secret; so that Daniel and his friends might not come to destruction with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.,,,,,,,
17362,Then the secret was made clear to Daniel in a vision of the night. And Daniel gave blessing to the God of heaven.,,,,,,,
17363,"And Daniel said in answer, May the name of God be praised for ever and ever: for wisdom and strength are his:",,,,,,,
17364,"By him times and years are changed: by him kings are taken away and kings are lifted up: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those whose minds are awake:",,,,,,,
17365,"He is the unveiler of deep and secret things: he has knowledge of what is in the dark, and the light has its living-place with him.",,,,,,,
17366,"I give you praise and worship, O God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and strength, and have now made clear to me what we were requesting from you: for you have given us knowledge of the king's business.",,,,,,,
17367,"For this reason Daniel went to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders for the destruction of the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, Do not put to death the wise men of Babylon: take me in before the king and I will make clear to him the sense of th",dream.,,,,,,
17368,"Then Arioch quickly took Daniel in before the king, and said to him, Here is a man from among the prisoners of Judah, who will make clear to the king the sense of the dream.",,,,,,,
17369,"The king made answer and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make clear to me the dream which I saw and its sense?",,,,,,,
17370,"Then Daniel said in answer to the king, No wise men, or users of secret arts, or wonder-workers, or readers of signs, are able to make clear to the king the secret he is searching for;",,,,,,,
17371,"But there is a God in heaven, the unveiler of secrets, and he has given to King Nebuchadnezzar knowledge of what will take place in the last days. Your dreams and the visions of your head on your bed are these:",,,,,,,
17372,"As for you, O King, the thoughts which came to you on your bed were of what will come about after this: and the unveiler of secrets has made clear to you what is to come.",,,,,,,
17373,"As for me, this secret is not made clear to me because of any wisdom which I have more than any living man, but in order that the sense of the dream may be made clear to the king, and that you may have knowledge of the thoughts of your heart.",,,,,,,
17374,"You, O King, were looking, and a great image was there. This image, which was very great, and whose glory was very bright, was placed before you: its form sent fear into the heart.",,,,,,,
17375,"As for this image, its head was made of the best gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its middle and its sides were of brass,",,,,,,,
17376,"Its legs of iron, its feet were in part of iron and in part of potter's earth.",,,,,,,
17377,"While you were looking at it, a stone was cut out, but not by hands, and it gave the image a blow on its feet, which were of iron and earth, and they were broken in bits.",,,,,,,
17378,"Then the iron and the earth, the brass and the silver and the gold, were smashed together, and became like the dust on the floors where grain is crushed in summer; and the wind took them away so that no sign of them was to be seen: and the stone which ga",e the image,bl,w,bec,me a,gre,t mou

17382,"And after you another kingdom, lower than you, will come to power; and a third kingdom, of brass, ruling over all the earth.",,,,,,,
17383,"And the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron: because, as all things are broken and overcome by iron, so it will have the power of crushing and smashing down all the earth.",,,,,,,
17384,"And as you saw the feet and toes, part of potter's work and part of iron, there will be a division in the kingdom; but there will be some of the strength of iron in it, because you saw the iron mixed with the potter's earth.",,,,,,,
17385,"And as the toes of the feet were in part of iron and in part of earth, so part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will readily be broken.",,,,,,,
17386,"And as you saw the iron mixed with earth, they will give their daughters to one another as wives: but they will not be united one with another, even as iron is not mixed with earth.",,,,,,,

17391,"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him offerings in great number, and made him ruler over all the land of Babylon, and chief over all the wise men of Babylon.",,,,,,,
17392,"And at Daniel's request, the king gave Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego authority over the business of the land of Babylon: but Daniel was kept near the king's person.Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide: h",put it up i,th,,all,y of,Dur,", in"

17397,And anyone not falling down and worshipping will that same hour be put into a burning and flaming fire.,,,,,,,
17398,"So at that time, all the people, when the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and all sorts of instruments, came to their ears, went down on their faces in worship before the image of gold which Nebuchadnezzar the king had put up.",,,,,,,
17399,At that time certain Chaldaeans came near and made a statement against the Jews.,,,,,,,
17400,"They made answer and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O King, have life for ever.",,,,,,,
17401,"You, O King, have given an order that every man, when the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all sorts of instruments, comes to his ears, is to go down on his face in worship before the image of gold:",,,,,,,
17402,And anyone not falling down and worshipping is to be put into a burning and flaming fire.,,,,,,,
17403,"There are certain Jews whom you have put over the business of the land of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego; these men have not given attention to you, O King: they are not servants of your gods or worshippers of the gold image which you have pu",up.,,,,,,

17405,"Nebuchadnezzar made answer and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you will not be servants of my god or give worship to the image of gold which I have put up?",,,,,,,
17406,"Now if you are ready, on hearing the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all sorts of instruments, to go down on your faces in worship before the image which I have made, it is well: but if you will not give worship, that same h",ur you will,e p,t,int,a b,rni,g and

17411,"And he gave orders to certain strong men in his army to put cords on Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego and put them into the burning and flaming fire.",,,,,,,
17412,"Then these men had cords put round them as they were, in their coats, their trousers, their hats, and their clothing, and were dropped into the burning and flaming fire.",,,,,,,
17413,"And because the king's order was not to be put on one side, and the heat of the fire was so great, the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego were burned to death by the flame of the fire.",,,,,,,
17414,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, with the cords about them, went down into the burning and flaming fire.",,,,,,,
17415,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar, full of fear and wonder, got up quickly, and said to his wise men, Did we not put three men in cords into the fire? and they made answer and said to the king, True, O King.",,,,,,,
17416,"He made answer and said, Look! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are not damaged; and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods.",,,,,,,
17417,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning and flaming fire: he made answer and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego, you servants of the Most High God, come out and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came out of the fire.",,,,,,,

17419,"Nebuchadnezzar made answer and said, Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent his angel and kept his servants safe who had faith in him, and who put the king's word on one side and gave up their bodies to the fire, so that t",ey might not,be,e,van,s or,wor,hippe

17422,It has seemed good to me to make clear the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done with me.,,,,,,,

17424,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my place, and all things were going well for me in my great house:",,,,,,,
17425,"I saw a dream which was a cause of great fear to me; I was troubled by the images of my mind on my bed, and by the visions of my head.",,,,,,,
17426,And I gave orders for all the wise men of Babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream.,,,,,,,
17427,"Then the wonder-workers, the users of secret arts, the Chaldaeans, and the readers of signs came in to me: and I put the dream before them but they did not make clear the sense of it to me.",,,,,,,
17428,"But at last Daniel came in before me, he whose name was Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I put the dream before him, saying,",,,,,,,
17429,"O Belteshazzar, master of the wonder-workers, because I am certain that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and you are troubled by no secret; this is the dream which I saw: make clear to me its sense.",,,,,,,
17430,"On my bed I saw a vision: there was a tree in the middle of the earth, and it was very high.",,,,,,,
17431,"And the tree became tall and strong, stretching up to heaven, and to be seen from the ends of the earth:",,,,,,,
17432,"Its leaves were fair and it had much fruit, and in it was food enough for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the birds of heaven were resting in its branches, and it gave food to all living things.",,,,,,,
17433,"In the visions of my head on my bed I saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven,",,,,,,,
17434,Crying out with a loud voice; and this is what he said: Let the tree be cut down and its branches broken off; let its leaves be taken off and its fruit sent in every direction: let the beasts get away from under it and the birds from its branches:,,,,,,,
17435,"But keep its broken end and its roots still in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass; let him have the young grass of the field for food, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his part be with the beasts.",,,,,,,
17436,"Let his heart be changed from that of a man, and the heart of a beast be given to him; and let seven times go by him.",,,,,,,
17437,"This order is fixed by the watchers, and the decision is by the word of the holy ones: so that the living may be certain that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure, lifting up over it the lowest of men.",,,,,,,
17438,"This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw; and do you, O Belteshazzar, make clear the sense of it, for all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the sense of it clear to me; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.",,,,,,,
17439,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was at a loss for a time, his thoughts troubling him.

17442,"It is you, O King, who have become great and strong: for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven, and your rule to the end of the earth.",,,,,,,
17443,"And as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, saying, Let the tree be cut down and given to destruction;",,,,,,,
17444,"This is the sense of it, O King, and it is the decision of the Most High which has come on my lord the king:",,,,,,,
17445,"That they will send you out from among men, to be with the beasts of the field; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will go by you, till you are certain that the Most High is r",ler in the k,ngd,m,of,"en,",nd,ives

17448,All this came to King Nebuchadnezzar.,,,,,,,
17449,At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in Babylon.,,,,,,,
17450,"The king made answer and said, Is this not great Babylon, which I have made for the living-place of kings, by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour?",,,,,,,
17451,"While the word was still in the king's mouth, a voice came down from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is said: The kingdom has gone from you:",,,,,,,
17452,"And they will send you out from among men, to be with the beasts of the field; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen, and seven times will go by you, till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and gives it to a",y man at his,ple,s,re.,,,

17454,"And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifting up my eyes to heaven, got back my reason, and, blessing the Most High, I gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever, whose rule is an eternal rule and whose kingdom goes on from generation",o generation,,,,,,
17455,"And all the people of the earth are as nothing: he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth: and no one is able to keep back his hand, or say to him, What are you doing?",,,,,,,
17456,"At the same time my reason came back to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and my great name came back to me; and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again; and I was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before.",,,,,,,

17503,"Then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole, and it was stamped with the king's stamp and with the stamp of the lords, so that the decision about Daniel might not be changed.",,,,,,,
17504,"Then the king went to his great house, and took no food that night, and no ... were placed before him, and his sleep went from him.",,,,,,,
17505,Then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions' hole.,,,,,,,
17506,"And when he came near the hole where Daniel was, he gave a loud cry of grief; the king made answer and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whose servant you are at all times, able to keep you safe from the lions?",,,,,,,
17507,"Then Daniel said to the king, O King, have life for ever.",,,,,,,
17508,"My God has sent his angel to keep the lions' mouths shut, and they have done me no damage: because I was seen to be without sin before him; and further, before you, O King, I have done no wrong.",,,,,,,

17513,"He gives salvation and makes men free from danger, and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth, who has kept Daniel safe from the power of the lions.",,,,,,,
17514,"So this Daniel did well in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions came into his head on his bed: then he put the dream in writing.",,,,,,,
17515,"I had a vision by night, and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea.",,,,,,,
17516,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.",,,,,,,
17517,"The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings; while I was watching its wings were pulled off, and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it.",,,,,,,
17518,"And I saw another beast, like a bear, and it was lifted up on one side, and three side-bones were in its mouth, between its teeth: and they said to it, Up! take much flesh.",,,,,,,
17519,"After this I saw another beast, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings like those of a bird; and the beast had four heads, and the power of a ruler was given to it.",,,,,,,
17520,"After this, in my vision of the night, I saw a fourth beast, a thing causing fear and very troubling, full of power and very strong; and it had great iron teeth: it took its food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet: it w",s different,rom,a,l t,e be,sts,befor
17521,"I was watching the horns with care, and I saw another coming up among them, a little one, before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots: and there were eyes like a man's eyes in this horn, and a mouth saying great things.",,,,,,,
17522,"I went on looking till the seats of kings were placed, and one like a very old man took his seat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool; his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire.",,,,,,,
17523,"A stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him: a thousand thousands were his servants, and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him: the judge was seated and the books were open.",,,,,,,
17524,"Then I saw — because of the voice of the great words which the horn said — I saw till the beast was put to death, and its body was given to destruction, and the beast was given to the burning of fire.",,,,,,,
17525,"As for the rest of the beasts, their authority was taken away: but they let them go on living for a measure of time.",,,,,,,
17526,"I saw in visions of the night, and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man, and he came to the one who was very old, and they took him near before him.",,,,,,,
17527,"And to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages were his servants: his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end, and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction.",,,,,,,
17528,"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was pained because of this, and the visions of my head were troubling me.",,,,,,,
17529,"I came near to one of those who were waiting there, questioning him about what all this was. And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things.",,,,,,,
17530,These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth.,,,,,,,
17531,"But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom, and it will be theirs for ever, even for ever and ever.",,,,,,,
17532,"Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, a cause of great fear, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass; who took his food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the re",t with his f,et;,,,,,
17533,"And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up, causing the fall of three; that horn which had eyes, and a mouth saying great things, which seemed to be greater than the other horns.",,,,,,,
17534,"And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them,",,,,,,,
17535,"Till he came, who was very old, and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints took the kingdom.",,,,,,,

17537,"And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power; and after them another will come up: he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings.",,,,,,,
17538,"And he will say words against the Most High, attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High; and he will have the idea of changing times and law; and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time.",,,,,,,
17539,"But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it.",,,,,,,
17540,"And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure.",,,,,,,
17541,"Here is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, I was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and the colour went from my face: but I kept the thing in my heart.In the third year of the rule of Belshazzar the king, a vision was seen by me, Daniel, after the",ne I saw at,irs,.,,,,
17542,"And I saw in the vision; and when I saw it, I was in the strong town Shushan, which is in the country of Elam; and in the vision I was by the water-door of the Ulai.",,,,,,,
17543,"And lifting up my eyes, I saw, there before the stream, a male sheep with two horns: and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, the higher one coming up last.",,,,,,,
17544,"I saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south; and no beasts were able to keep their place before him, and no one was able to get people out of his power; but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great.",,,,,,,
17545,"And while I was giving thought to this, I saw a he-goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth: and the he-goat had a great horn between his eyes.",,,,,,,
17546,"And he came to the two-horned sheep which I saw before the stream, rushing at him in the heat of his power.",,,,,,,
17547,"And I saw him come right up to the sheep, and he was moved with wrath against him, attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken; and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him, but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his",eet: and the,e w,s,no,ne t,ge,the
17548,"And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven.",,,,,,,
17549,"And out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which became very great, stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land.",,,,,,,
17550,"And it became great, even as high as the army of heaven, pulling down some of the army, even of the stars, to the earth and crushing them under its feet.",,,,,,,
17551,"It made itself great, even as great as the lord of the army; and by it the regular burned offering was taken away, and the place overturned and the holy place made waste.",,,,,,,
17552,"... against the regular burned offering; and ... crushed down to the earth, and it did its pleasure and things went well for it.",,,,,,,
17553,"Then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking, How long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away, and the unclean thing causing fear is put up, and the",oly place cr,she,,nde,foo,?,
17554,"And he said to him, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be made clean.",,,,,,,
17555,"And it came about that when I, Daniel, had seen this vision, I had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded; and I saw one before me in the form of a man.",,,,,,,
17556,"And the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the Ulai, crying out and saying, Gabriel, make the vision clear to this man.",,,,,,,
17557,"So he came and took his place near where I was; and when he came, I was full of fear and went down on my face: but he said to me, Let it be clear to you, O son of man; for the vision has to do with the time of the end.",,,,,,,
17558,"Now while he was talking to me, I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth: but touching me, he put me on my feet where I had been.",,,,,,,
17559,"And he said, See, I will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath: for it has to do with the fixed time of the end.",,,,,,,
17560,"The sheep which you saw with two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.",,,,,,,
17561,And the he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.,,,,,,,
17562,"And as for that which was broken, in place of which four came up, four kingdoms will come up from his nation, but not with his power.",,,,,,,
17563,"And in the later years of their kingdom, when their evil doings have become complete, there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings.",,,,,,,
17564,"And his power will be great, and he will be purposing strange things. And all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure; and he will send destruction on the strong ones.",,,,,,,
17565,"And his designs will be turned against the holy people, causing deceit to do well in his hand; in his heart he will make himself great, and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger; and he will put himself up against the pri",ce of prince,; b,t,he,ill,e b,"oken,"
17566,And the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true: and keep the vision secret; for it has to do with the far-off future.,,,,,,,
17567,"And I, Daniel, was ill for some days; then I got up and did the king's business: and I was full of wonder at the vision, but no one was able to give the sense of it.In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made",king over th,ki,g,om,f th,Ch,ldaea
17568,"In the first year of his rule, I, Daniel, saw clearly from the books the number of years given by the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah, in which the making waste of Jerusalem was to be complete, that is, seventy years.",,,,,,,
17569,"And turning my face to the Lord God, I gave myself up to prayer, requesting his grace, going without food, in haircloth and dust.",,,,,,,
17570,"And I made prayer to the Lord my God, putting our sins before him, and said, O Lord, the great God, greatly to be feared. keeping your agreement and mercy with those who have love for you and do your orders;",,,,,,,

17575,"With the Lord our God are mercies and forgiveness, for we have gone against him;",,,,,,,
17576,And have not given ear to the voice of the Lord our God to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets.,,,,,,,
17577,"And all Israel have been sinners against your law, turning away so as not to give ear to your voice: and the curse has been let loose on us, and the oath recorded in the law of Moses, the servant of God, for we have done evil against him.",,,,,,,
17578,"And he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges, by sending a great evil on us: for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
17579,"As it was recorded in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us: but we have made no prayer for grace from the Lord our God that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom.",,,,,,,
17580,"So the Lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us: for the Lord our God is upright in all his acts which he has done, and we have not given ear to his voice.",,,,,,,
17581,"And now, O Lord our God, who took your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day; we are sinners, we have done evil.",,,,,,,
17582,"O Lord, because of your righteousness, let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because, through our sins and the evil-doing of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all",who are roun,ab,u,us,,,
17583,"And now, give ear, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace, and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste, because of your servants, O Lord.",,,,,,,
17584,"O my God, let your ear be turned and give hearing; let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name: for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great",ercies.,,,,,,

17586,"And while I was still saying these words in prayer, and putting my sins and the sins of my people Israel before the Lord, and requesting grace from the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God;",,,,,,,
17587,"Even while I was still in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great, put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering.",,,,,,,
17588,"And teaching me and talking to me he said, O Daniel, I have come now to give you wisdom.",,,,,,,
17589,"At the first word of your prayer a word went out, and I have come to give you knowledge; for you are a man dearly loved: so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you.",,,,,,,

17595,"I had no pleasing food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, and I put no oil on my body till three full weeks were ended.",,,,,,,
17596,And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was by the side of the great river;,,,,,,,
17597,"And lifting up my eyes I saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe, and round him there was a band of gold, of the best gold:",,,,,,,
17598,"And his body was like the beryl, and his face had the look of a thunder-flame, and his eyes were like burning lights, and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass, and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army.",,,,,,,
17599,"And I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see it; but a great shaking came on them and they went in flight to take cover.",,,,,,,
17600,"So I was by myself, and I saw this great vision, and all my strength went from me; and the colour went from my face.",,,,,,,
17601,"But the sound of his words came to my ears, and on hearing his voice I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth.",,,,,,,
17602,"Then a hand gave me a touch, awaking me, and putting me on my knees and my hands.",,,,,,,
17603,"And he said to me, O Daniel, you man dearly loved, take in the sense of the words I say to you and get up on to your feet: for to you I am now sent; and when he had said this to me I got on to my feet, shaking with fear.",,,,,,,
17604,"Then he said to me, Have no fear, Daniel; for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your God, your words have come to his ears: and I have come because of your words.",,,,,,,
17605,"But the angel of the kingdom of Persia put himself against me for twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief angels, came to my help; and when I came he was still there with the angel of the kings of Persia.",,,,,,,
17606,Now I have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days; for there is still a vision for the days.,,,,,,,
17607,"And after he had said these words to me, I kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything.",,,,,,,
17608,"Then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips; and opening my mouth, I said to him who was before me, O my lord, because of the vision my pains have come on me, and I have no more strength.",,,,,,,
17609,"For how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord? for, as for me, straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body.",,,,,,,
17610,Then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength.,,,,,,,
17611,"And he said to me, O man greatly loved, have no fear: peace be with you, be strong and let your heart be lifted up. And at his words I became strong, and said, Let my lord say on, for you have given me strength.",,,,,,,
17612,"Then he said, It is clear to you why I have come to you. And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings:",,,,,,,
17613,"But I am going back to make war with the angel of Persia, and when I am gone, the angel of Greece will come. And there is no one on my side against these, but Michael, your angel.And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede I was on his side to ma",e his positi,n s,f,an,mak,hi,stro

17623,"And the king of the south will be moved with wrath, and will come out and make war on him, on this same king of the north: and he will get together a great army, but the army will be given into his hand.",,,,,,,
17624,"And the army will be taken away, and his heart will be uplifted: he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands, but he will not be strong.",,,,,,,
17625,"And again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first; and he will make an attack on him at the end of years, with a great army and much wealth.",,,,,,,
17626,"In those times, a number will take up arms against the king of the south: and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true; but it will be their downfall.",,,,,,,
17627,"So the king of the north will come, and put up earthworks and take a well-armed town: and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position, even the best of his army, but they will not have strength to do so.",,,,,,,
17628,"And he who comes against him will do his pleasure, and no one will be able to keep his place before him: he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction.",,,,,,,

17631,"Then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land: but his way will be stopped, causing his downfall, and he will not be seen again.",,,,,,,
17632,"Then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together; but after a short time destruction will overtake him, but not in wrath or in the fight.",,,,,,,
17633,"And his place will be taken by a low person, to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given: but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words.",,,,,,,
17634,And his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken; and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate.,,,,,,,
17635,"And from the time when they make an agreement with him, he will be working falsely: for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force,",,,,,,,
17636,"Against fertile places, and will make waste a part of the country; and he will do what his fathers have not done, or his fathers' fathers; he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force, and of property: he will even make designs",against the,tro,g,pla,es f,r a,time.

17643,"And armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place, even the strong place, and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear.",,,,,,,
17644,And those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words: but the people who have knowledge of their God will be strong and do well.,,,,,,,
17645,"And those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people: but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame, being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time.",,,,,,,
17646,"Now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help, but numbers will be joined to them in the town, and in their separate heritages.",,,,,,,
17647,"And some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean, till the time of the end: for it is still for the fixed time.",,,,,,,
17648,"And the king will do his pleasure; he will put himself on high, lifting himself over every god, and saying things to be wondered at against the God of gods; and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete; for what has been purposed will be done.",,,,,,,
17649,He will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women; he will have no respect for any god: for he will put himself on high over all.,,,,,,,

17651,"And he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places; to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour: and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people, and will make division of the land for a price.",,,,,,,
17652,"And at the time of the end, the king of the south will make an attack on him: and the king of the north will come against him like a storm-wind, with war-carriages and horsemen and numbers of ships; and he will go through many lands like overflowing wate",s.,,,,,,
17653,"And he will come into the beautiful land, and tens of thousands will be overcome: but these will be kept from falling into his hands: Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon.",,,,,,,

17689,"And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her regular meetings.",,,,,,,
17690,"And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are the payments which my lovers have made to me; and I will make them a waste of trees, and the beasts of the field will take them for food.",,,,,,,
17691,"And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
17692,For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her.,,,,,,,
17693,"And I will give her vine-gardens from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young, and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt.",,,,,,,
17694,"And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali;",,,,,,,
17695,"For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and never again will she say their names.",,,,,,,
17696,"And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth; I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land, and will make them take their rest in pea",e.,,,,,,

17710,"Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge; because you have given up knowledge, I will give you up, so that you will be no priest to me, because you have not kept in mind the law of your God, I will not keep your children in my m",mory.,,,,,,

17721,Ephraim is joined to false gods; let him be.,,,,,,,
17722,Their drink has become bitter; they are completely false; her rulers take pleasure in shame.,,,,,,,
17723,"They are folded in the skirts of the wind; they will be shamed because of their offerings.Give ear to this, O priests; give attention, O Israel, and you, family of the king; for you are to be judged; you have been a deceit at Mizpah and a net stretched o",t on Tabor.,,,,,,

17735,"When Ephraim saw his disease and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the great king; but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound.",,,,,,,
17736,"For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the children of Judah; I, even I, will give him wounds and go away; I will take him away, and there will be no helper.",,,,,,,
17737,"I will go back to my place till they are made waste; in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me.Come, let us go back to the Lord; for he has given us wounds and he will make us well; he has given blows and he will give help.",,,,,,,

17741,So I have had it cut in stones; I gave them teaching by the words of my mouth;,,,,,,,
17742,Because my desire is for mercy and not offerings; for the knowledge of God more than for burned offerings.,,,,,,,

17758,"When they go, my net will be stretched out over them; I will take them like the birds of heaven, I will give them punishment, I will take them away in the net for their sin.",,,,,,,
17759,"May trouble be theirs! for they have gone far away from me; and destruction, for they have been sinning against me; I was ready to be their saviour, but they said false words against me.",,,,,,,

17769,Israel has come to destruction; now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure.,,,,,,,

18084,"And the ship's captain came to him and said to him, What are you doing sleeping? Up! say a prayer to your God, if by chance God will give a thought to us, so that we may not come to destruction.",,,,,,,
18085,"And they said to one another, Come, let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us. So they did so, and Jonah was seen to be the man.",,,,,,,
18086,"Then they said to him, Now make clear to us what is your work, and where you come from? what is your country, and who are your people?",,,,,,,
18087,"And he said to them, I am a Hebrew, a worshipper of the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.",,,,,,,
18088,"And the men were in great fear, and they said to him, What is this you have done? For the men had knowledge of his flight from the Lord because he had not kept it from them.",,,,,,,
18089,"And they said to him, What are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us? For the sea was getting rougher and rougher.",,,,,,,
18090,"And he said to them, Take me up and put me into the sea, and the sea will become calm for you: for I am certain that because of me this great storm has come on you.",,,,,,,
18091,"And the men were working hard to get back to the land, but they were not able to do so: for the sea got rougher and rougher against them.",,,,,,,
18092,"So, crying to the Lord, they said, Give ear to our prayer, O Lord, give ear, and do not let destruction overtake us because of this man's life; do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause: for you, O Lord, have done what seemed good to you.",,,,,,,
18093,So they took Jonah up and put him into the sea: and the sea was no longer angry.,,,,,,,
18094,Then great was the men's fear of the Lord; and they made an offering to the Lord and took oaths to him.,,,,,,,
18095,"And the Lord made ready a great fish to take Jonah into its mouth; and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.Then Jonah made prayer to the Lord his God from the inside of the fish, and said,",,,,,,,
18096,"In my trouble I was crying to the Lord, and he gave me an answer; out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry, and you gave ear to my voice.",,,,,,,
18097,"For you have put me down into the deep, into the heart of the sea; and the river was round about me; all your waves and your rolling waters went over me.",,,,,,,
18098,"And I said, I have been sent away from before your eyes; how may I ever again see your holy Temple?",,,,,,,
18099,"The waters were circling round me, even to the neck; the deep was about me; the sea-grass was twisted round my head.",,,,,,,
18100,"I went down to the bases of the mountains; as for the earth, her walls were about me for ever: but you have taken up my life from the underworld, O Lord my God.",,,,,,,
18101,"When my soul in me was overcome, I kept the memory of the Lord: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy Temple.",,,,,,,
18102,The worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope.,,,,,,,
18103,But I will make an offering to you with the voice of praise; I will give effect to my oaths. Salvation is the Lord's.,,,,,,,
18104,"And at the Lord's order, the fish sent Jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land.And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying,",,,,,,,
18105,"Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and give it the word which I have given you.",,,,,,,
18106,"So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh as the Lord had said. Now Nineveh was a very great town, three days' journey from end to end.",,,,,,,
18107,"And Jonah first of all went a day's journey into the town, and crying out said, In forty days destruction will overtake Nineveh.",,,,,,,
18108,"And the people of Nineveh had belief in God; and a time was fixed for going without food, and they put on haircloth, from the greatest to the least.",,,,,,,
18109,"And the word came to the king of Nineveh, and he got up from his seat of authority, and took off his robe, and covering himself with haircloth, took his seat in the dust.",,,,,,,
18110,"And he had it given out in Nineveh, By the order of the king and his great men, no man or beast, herd or flock, is to have a taste of anything; let them have no food or water:",,,,,,,
18111,"And let man and beast be covered with haircloth, and let them make strong prayers to God: and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands.",,,,,,,
18112,"Who may say that God will not be turned, changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath, so that destruction may not overtake us?",,,,,,,
18113,"And God saw what they did, how they were turned from their evil way; and God's purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them, and he did it not.But this seemed very wrong to Jonah, and he was angry.",,,,,,,
18114,"And he made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my country? This is why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish: for I was certain that you were a loving God, full of pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy,",and ready to,be,u,ned,from,you,purp
18115,"So now, O Lord, give ear to my prayer and take my life from me; for death is better for me than life.",,,,,,,
18116,"And the Lord said, Have you any right to be angry?",,,,,,,
18117,"Then Jonah went out of the town, and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town.",,,,,,,
18118,And the Lord God made a vine come up over Jonah to give him shade over his head. And Jonah was very glad because of the vine.,,,,,,,
18119,"But early on the morning after, God made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine, and it became dry and dead.",,,,,,,
18120,"Then when the sun came up, God sent a burning east wind: and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that Jonah was overcome, and, requesting death for himself, said, Death is better for me than life.",,,,,,,
18121,"And the Lord said to Jonah, Have you any right to be angry about the vine? And he said, I have a right to be truly angry.",,,,,,,
18122,"And the Lord said, You had pity on the vine, for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible; which came up in a night and came to an end in a night;",,,,,,,
18123,"And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh, that great town, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left, as well as much cattle?The word of the Lord which came to Micah the Morashtite",in the days,of,o,ham,Aha,", a",d Hez

18126,"And the mountains will be turned to water under him, and the deep valleys will be broken open, like wax before the fire, like waters flowing down a slope.",,,,,,,
18127,All this is because of the wrongdoing of Jacob and the sins of the children of Israel. What is the wrongdoing of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?,,,,,,,
18128,"So I will make Samaria into a field and the plantings of a vine-garden: I will send its stones falling down into the valley, uncovering its bases.",,,,,,,
18129,"And all her pictured images will be hammered into bits, and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire, and all the images of her gods I will make waste: for with the price of a loose woman she got them together, and as the price of a l",ose woman wi,l t,e,be,give,ba,k.

18675,"And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had said to him, and took her as his wife;",,,,,,,
18676,"And he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son; and he gave him the name Jesus.Now when the birth of Jesus took place in Beth-lehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,",,,,,,,
18677,"Saying, Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place? We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship.",,,,,,,
18678,"And when it came to the ears of Herod the king, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.",,,,,,,
18679,"And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be.",,,,,,,
18680,"And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet,",,,,,,,
18681,"You Beth-lehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the chiefs of Judah: out of you will come a ruler, who will be the keeper of my people Israel.",,,,,,,
18682,"Then Herod sent for the wise men privately, and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen.",,,,,,,
18683,"And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said, Go and make certain where the young child is; and when you have seen him, let me have news of it, so that I may come and give him worship.",,,,,,,
18684,"And after hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the young child was.",,,,,,,
18685,And when they saw the star they were full of joy.,,,,,,,
18686,"And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary, his mother; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship; and from their store they gave him offeringsofgold, perfume, andspices.",,,,,,,
18687,Anditwasmade clearto thembyGodinadream that they were not to go back to Herod; so they went into their country by another way.,,,,,,,
18688,"And when they had gone, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream, saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into Egypt, and do not go from there till I give you word; for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him t",death.,,,,,,
18689,"So he took the young child and his mother by night, and went into Egypt;",,,,,,,
18690,"And was there till the death of Herod; so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true, Out of Egypt have I sent for my son.",,,,,,,
18691,"Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was very angry; and he sent out, and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it, from two years old and under, acting on the knowledge which he ha",got with ca,e f,o,th,wis,me,.
18692,"Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true,",,,,,,,
18693,"In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted for their loss.",,,,,,,
18694,"But when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,",,,,,,,
18695,"Saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: because they who were attempting to take the young child's life are dead.",,,,,,,
18696,"And he got up, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.",,,,,,,
18697,"But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was in fear of going there; and God having given him news of the danger in a dream, he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee.",,,,,,,
18698,"And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth: so that the word of the prophets might come true, He will be named a Nazarene.And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the waste land of Judaea,",,,,,,,
18699,"Saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin; for the kingdom of heaven is near.",,,,,,,
18700,"For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said, The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight.",,,,,,,
18701,"Now John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey.",,,,,,,
18702,"Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him, and all the people from near Jordan;",,,,,,,
18703,"And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying openly that they had done wrong.",,,,,,,
18704,"But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of snakes, at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come?",,,,,,,
18705,Let your change of heart be seen in your works:,,,,,,,
18706,"And say not to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham.",,,,,,,
18707,"And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees; every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down, and put into the fire.",,,,,,,
18708,"Truly, I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed; but he who comes after me is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to take up: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire:",,,,,,,
18709,"In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out.",,,,,,,
18710,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be given baptism by him.",,,,,,,
18711,"But John would have kept him back, saying, It is I who have need of baptism from you, and do you come to me?",,,,,,,
18712,"But Jesus made answer, saying to him, Let it be so now: because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete. Then he gave him baptism.",,,,,,,
18713,"And Jesus, having been given baptism, straight away went up from the water; and, the heavens opening, he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove;",,,,,,,
18714,"And a voice came out of heaven, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.Then Jesus was sent by the Spirit into the waste land to be tested by the Evil One.",,,,,,,
18715,"And after going without food for forty days and forty nights, he was in need of it.",,,,,,,
18716,"And the Evil One came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, give the word for these stones to become bread.",,,,,,,
18717,"But he made answer and said, It is in the Writings, Bread is not man's only need, but every word which comes out of the mouth of God.",,,,,,,
18718,"Then the Evil One took him to the holy town; and he put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him,",,,,,,,
18719,"If you are the Son of God, let yourself go down; for it is in the Writings, He will give his angels care over you; and, In their hands they will keep you up, so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone.",,,,,,,
18720,"Jesus said to him, Again it is in the Writings, You may not put the Lord your God to the test.",,,,,,,
18721,"Again, the Evil One took him up to a very high mountain, and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them;",,,,,,,
18722,"And he said to him, All these things will I give you, if you will go down on your face and give me worship.",,,,,,,
18723,"Then said Jesus to him, Away, Satan: for it is in the Writings, Give worship to the Lord your God and be his servant only.",,,,,,,
18724,"Then the Evil One went away from him, and angels came and took care of him.",,,,,,,
18725,"Now when it came to his ears that John had been put in prison, he went away to Galilee;",,,,,,,
18726,"And going away from Nazareth, he came and made his living-place in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali:",,,,,,,
18727,"So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might come true,",,,,,,,
18728,"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,",,,,,,,
18729,"The people who were in the dark saw a great light, and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up.",,,,,,,
18730,"From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near.",,,,,,,
18731,"And when he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, whose other name was Peter, and Andrew, his brother, who were putting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.",,,,,,,
18732,"And he said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.",,,,,,,
18733,And straight away they let go the nets and went after him.,,,,,,,
18734,"And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat with their father, stitching up their nets; and he said, Come.",,,,,,,
18735,And they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him.,,,,,,,
18736,"And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people.",,,,,,,
18737,"And news of him went out through all Syria; and they took to him all who were ill with different diseases and pains, those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads, and those who had no power of moving. And he made them well.",,,,,,,
18738,And there went after him great numbers from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from the other side of Jordan.And seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain; and when he was seated his disciples came to him.,,,,,,,
18739,"And with these words he gave them teaching, saying,",,,,,,,
18740,Happy are the poor in spirit: for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.,,,,,,,
18741,Happy are those who are sad: for they will be comforted.,,,,,,,
18742,Happy are the gentle: for the earth will be their heritage.,,,,,,,
18743,Happy are those whose heart's desire is for righteousness: for they will have their desire.,,,,,,,
18744,Happy are those who have mercy: for they will be given mercy.,,,,,,,
18745,Happy are the clean in heart: for they will see God.,,,,,,,
18746,Happy are the peacemakers: for they will be named sons of God.,,,,,,,
18747,Happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness: for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs.,,,,,,,
18748,"Happy are you when men give you a bad name, and are cruel to you, and say all evil things against you falsely, because of me.",,,,,,,
18749,Be glad and full of joy; for great is your reward in heaven: for so were the prophets attacked who were before you.,,,,,,,
18750,"You are the salt of the earth; but if its taste goes from the salt, how will you make it salt again? it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men.",,,,,,,
18751,You are the light of the world. A town put on a hill may be seen by all.,,,,,,,
18752,"And a burning light is not put under a vessel, but on its table; so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house.",,,,,,,
18753,"Even so let your light be shining before men, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
18754,"Let there be no thought that I have come to put an end to the law or the prophets. I have not come for destruction, but to make complete.",,,,,,,
18755,"Truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth come to an end, not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law, till all things are done.",,,,,,,
18756,"Whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws, teaching men to do the same, will be named least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who keeps the laws, teaching others to keep them, will be named great in the kingdom of heaven.",,,,,,,
18757,"For I say to you, If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.",,,,,,,
18758,"You have knowledge that it was said in old times, You may not put to death; and, Whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged:",,,,,,,
18759,"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged; and he who says to his brother, Raca, will be in danger from the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, You foolish one, will be in danger of the hell of fire.",,,,,,,
18760,"If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you,",,,,,,,
18761,"While your offering is still before the altar, first go and make peace with your brother, then come and make your offering.",,,,,,,
18762,"Come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law, while you are with him on the way, for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison.",,,,,,,
18763,"Truly I say to you, You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing.",,,,,,,
18764,"You have knowledge that it was said, You may not have connection with another man's wife:",,,,,,,
18765,But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart.,,,,,,,
18766,"And if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out and put it away from you; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part, than for all your body to go into hell.",,,,,,,
18767,"And if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off and put it away from you; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part, than for all your body to go into hell.",,,,,,,
18768,"Again, it was said, Whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose:",,,,,,,
18769,"But I say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue, makes her false to her husband; and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away, is no true husband to her.",,,,,,,
18770,"Again, you have knowledge that it was said in old times, Do not take false oaths, but give effect to your oaths to the Lord:",,,,,,,
18771,"But I say to you, Take no oaths at all: not by the heaven, because it is the seat of God;",,,,,,,
18772,"Or by the earth, because it is the resting-place for his foot; or by Jerusalem, because it is the town of the great King.",,,,,,,
18773,"You may not take an oath by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.",,,,,,,
18774,"But let your words be simply, Yes or No: and whatever is more than these is of the Evil One.",,,,,,,
18775,"You have knowledge that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:",,,,,,,
18776,"But I say to you, Do not make use of force against an evil man; but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned.",,,,,,,
18777,"And if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat, do not keep back your robe from him.",,,,,,,
18778,"And whoever makes you go one mile, go with him two.",,,,,,,
18779,"Give to him who comes with a request, and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it.",,,,,,,
18780,"You have knowledge that it was said, Have love for your neighbour, and hate for him who is against you:",,,,,,,
18781,"But I say to you, Have love for those who are against you, and make prayer for those who are cruel to you;",,,,,,,
18782,"So that you may be the sons of your Father in heaven; for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good, and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner.",,,,,,,
18783,"For if you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? do not the tax-farmers the same?",,,,,,,
18784,"And if you say, Good day, to your brothers only, what do you do more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same?",,,,,,,
18785,"Be then complete in righteousness, even as your Father in heaven is complete.Take care not to do your good works before men, to be seen by them; or you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
18786,"When then you give money to the poor, do not make a noise about it, as the false-hearted men do in the Synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Truly, I say to you, They have their reward.",,,,,,,
18787,"But when you give money, let not your left hand see what your right hand does:",,,,,,,
18788,"So that your giving may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward.",,,,,,,
18789,"And when you make your prayers, be not like the false-hearted men, who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the Synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.",,,,,,,
18790,"But when you make your prayer, go into your private room, and, shutting the door, say a prayer to your Father in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward.",,,,,,,
18791,"And in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again, as the Gentiles do: for they have the idea that God will give attention to them because of the number of their words.",,,,,,,
18792,So be not like them; because your Father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him.,,,,,,,
18793,"Let this then be your prayer: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.",,,,,,,
18794,"Let your kingdom come. Let your pleasure be done, as in heaven, so on earth.",,,,,,,
18795,Give us this day bread for our needs.,,,,,,,
18796,"And make us free of our debts, as we have made those free who are in debt to us.",,,,,,,
18797,"And let us not be put to the test, but keep us safe from the Evil One.",,,,,,,
18798,"For if you let men have forgiveness for their sins, you will have forgiveness from your Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
18799,"But if you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins, you will not have forgiveness from your Father for your sins.",,,,,,,
18800,"And when you go without food, be not sad-faced as the false-hearted are. For they go about with changed looks, so that men may see that they are going without food. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.",,,,,,,
18801,"But when you go without food, put oil on your head and make your face clean;",,,,,,,
18802,"So that no one may see that you are going without food, but your Father in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward.",,,,,,,
18803,"Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth, where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather, and where thieves may come in by force and take it away.",,,,,,,
18804,"But make a store for yourselves in heaven, where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away:",,,,,,,
18805,"For where your wealth is, there will your heart be.",,,,,,,
18806,"The light of the body is the eye; if then your eye is true, all your body will be full of light.",,,,,,,
18807,"But if your eye is evil, all your body will be dark. If then the light which is in you is dark, how dark it will be!",,,,,,,
18808,"No man is able to be a servant to two masters: for he will have hate for the one and love for the other, or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other. You may not be servants of God and of wealth.",,,,,,,
18809,"So I say to you, Take no thought for your life, about food or drink, or about clothing for your body. Is not life more than food, and the body more than its clothing?",,,,,,,
18810,"See the birds of heaven; they do not put seeds in the earth, they do not get in grain, or put it in store-houses; and your Father in heaven gives them food. Are you not of much more value than they?",,,,,,,
18811,And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller?,,,,,,,
18812,"And why are you troubled about clothing? See the flowers of the field, how they come up; they do no work, they make no thread:",,,,,,,
18813,But I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.,,,,,,,
18814,"But if God gives such clothing to the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven, will he not much more give you clothing, O you of little faith?",,,,,,,
18815,"Then do not be full of care, saying, What are we to have for food or drink? or, With what may we be clothed?",,,,,,,
18816,Because the Gentiles go in search of all these things: for your Father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things:,,,,,,,
18817,But let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness; and all these other things will be given to you in addition.,,,,,,,
18818,"Then have no care for tomorrow: tomorrow will take care of itself. Take the trouble of the day as it comes.Be not judges of others, and you will not be judged.",,,,,,,
18819,"For as you have been judging, so you will be judged, and with your measure will it be measured to you.",,,,,,,
18820,"And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye, but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye?",,,,,,,
18821,"Or how will you say to your brother, Let me take out the grain of dust from your eye, when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye?",,,,,,,
18822,"You false one, first take out the bit of wood from your eye, then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brother's eye.",,,,,,,
18823,"Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, or put your jewels before pigs, for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you.",,,,,,,
18824,"Make a request, and it will be answered; what you are searching for you will get; give the sign, and the door will be open to you:",,,,,,,
18825,"Because to everyone who makes a request, it will be given; and he who is searching will get his desire, and to him who gives the sign, the door will be open.",,,,,,,
18826,"Or which of you, if his son makes a request for bread, will give him a stone?",,,,,,,
18827,"Or if he makes a request for a fish, will give him a snake?",,,,,,,
18828,"If you, then, being evil, are able to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him?",,,,,,,
18829,"All those things, then, which you would have men do to you, even so do you to them: because this is the law and the prophets.",,,,,,,
18830,"Go in by the narrow door; for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction, and great numbers go in by it.",,,,,,,
18831,"For narrow is the door and hard the road to life, and only a small number make discovery of it.",,,,,,,
18832,"Be on the watch for false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inside they are cruel wolves.",,,,,,,
18833,By their fruits you will get knowledge of them. Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?,,,,,,,
18834,"Even so, every good tree gives good fruit; but the bad tree gives evil fruit.",,,,,,,
18835,"It is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit, and a bad tree will not give good fruit.",,,,,,,
18836,Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire.,,,,,,,
18837,So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them.,,,,,,,
18838,"Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will go into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
18839,"A great number will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, were we not prophets in your name, and did we not by your name send out evil spirits, and by your name do works of power?",,,,,,,
18840,"And then will I say to them, I never had knowledge of you: go from me, you workers of evil.",,,,,,,
18841,"Everyone, then, to whom my words come and who does them, will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock;",,,,,,,
18842,"And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house, but it was not moved; because it was based on the rock.",,,,,,,
18843,"And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not, will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand;",,,,,,,
18844,And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house; and it came down and great was its fall.,,,,,,,
18845,"And it came about, when Jesus had come to the end of these words, that the people were surprised at his teaching,",,,,,,,
18846,"for he was teaching as one having authority, and not as their scribes.And when he had come down from the mountain, great numbers of people came after him.",,,,,,,
18847,"And a leper came and gave him worship, saying, Lord, if it is your pleasure, you have power to make me clean.",,,,,,,
18848,"And he put his hand on him, saying, It is my pleasure; be clean. And straight away he was made clean.",,,,,,,
18849,"And Jesus said to him, See that you say nothing about this to anyone; but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by Moses, for a witness to them.",,,,,,,
18850,"And when Jesus was come into Capernaum, a certain captain came to him with a request,",,,,,,,
18851,"Saying, Lord, my servant is ill in bed at the house, with no power in his body, and in great pain.",,,,,,,
18852,"And he said to him, I will come and make him well.",,,,,,,
18853,"And the captain in answer said, Lord, I am not good enough for you to come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be made well.",,,,,,,
18854,"Because I myself am a man under authority, having under me fighting men; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.",,,,,,,
18855,"And when these words came to the ears of Jesus he was surprised, and said to those who came after him, Truly I say to you, I have not seen such great faith, no, not in Israel.",,,,,,,
18856,"And I say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west, and will take their seats with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:",,,,,,,
18857,"But the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark, and there will be weeping and cries of pain.",,,,,,,
18858,"And Jesus said to the captain, Go in peace; as your faith is, so let it be done to you. And the servant was made well in that hour.",,,,,,,
18859,"And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother in bed, very ill.",,,,,,,
18860,"And he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her, and she got up and took care of his needs.",,,,,,,
18861,"And in the evening, they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits; and he sent the spirits out of them with a word, and made well all who were ill;",,,,,,,
18862,So that the word of Isaiah the prophet might come true: He himself took our pains and our diseases.,,,,,,,
18863,"Now when Jesus saw a great mass of people about him, he gave an order to go to the other side.",,,,,,,
18864,"And there came a scribe and said to him, Master, I will come after you wherever you go.",,,,,,,
18865,"And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have a resting-place; but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head.",,,,,,,
18866,"And another of the disciples said to him, Lord, let me first go and give the last honours to my father.",,,,,,,
18867,"But Jesus said to him, Come after me; and let the dead take care of their dead.",,,,,,,
18868,"And when he had got into a boat, his disciples went after him.",,,,,,,
18869,"And there came up a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was sleeping.",,,,,,,
18870,"And they came to him, and, awaking him, said, Help, Lord; destruction is near.",,,,,,,
18871,"And he said to them, Why are you full of fear, O you of little faith? Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.",,,,,,,
18872,"And the men were full of wonder, saying, What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea do his orders?",,,,,,,
18873,"And when he had come to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, there came out to him from the place of the dead, two who had evil spirits, so violent that no man was able to go that way.",,,,,,,
18874,"And they gave a loud cry, saying, What have we to do with you, you Son of God? Have you come here to give us punishment before the time?",,,,,,,
18875,"Now there was, some distance away, a great herd of pigs taking their food.",,,,,,,
18876,"And the evil spirits made strong prayers to him, saying, If you send us out, let us go into the herd of pigs.",,,,,,,
18877,"And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water.",,,,,,,
18878,"And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything, and of the men who had the evil spirits.",,,,,,,
18879,And all the town came out to Jesus; and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country.And he got into a boat and went across and came to his town.,,,,,,,
18880,"And they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving; and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man who was ill, Son, take heart; you have forgiveness for your sins.",,,,,,,
18881,"And some of the scribes said among themselves, This man has no respect for God.",,,,,,,
18882,"And Jesus, having knowledge of what was in their minds, said, Why are your thoughts evil?",,,,,,,
18883,"For which is the simpler, to say, You have forgiveness for your sins; or to say, Get up and go?",,,,,,,
18884,"But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins, (then said he to the man who was ill,) Get up, and take up your bed, and go to your house.",,,,,,,
18885,And he got up and went away to his house.,,,,,,,
18886,"But when the people saw it they were full of fear, and gave glory to God who had given such authority to men.",,,,,,,
18887,"And when Jesus was going from there, he saw a man whose name was Matthew, seated at the place where taxes were taken; and he said to him, Come after me. And he got up and went after him.",,,,,,,
18888,"And it came about, when he was in the house taking food, that a number of tax-farmers and sinners came and took their places with Jesus and his disciples.",,,,,,,
18889,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your Master take food with tax-farmers and sinners?",,,,,,,
18890,"But on hearing this he said, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill.",,,,,,,
18891,"But go and take to heart the sense of these words, My desire is for mercy, not offerings: for I have come not to get the upright, but sinners.",,,,,,,
18892,"Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees frequently go without food, but your disciples do not?",,,,,,,
18893,"And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of the newly-married man be sad as long as he is with them? But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then will they go without food.",,,,,,,
18894,"And no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat, for by pulling away from the old, it makes a worse hole.",,,,,,,
18895,"And men do not put new wine into old wine- skins; or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out, and the skins are of no more use: but they put new wine into new wine-skins, and so the two will be safe.",,,,,,,
18896,"While he was saying these things to them, there came a ruler and gave him worship, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and put your hand on her, and she will come back to life.",,,,,,,
18897,"And Jesus got up and went after him, and so did his disciples.",,,,,,,
18898,"And a woman, who for twelve years had had a flow of blood, came after him, and put her hand on the edge of his robe:",,,,,,,
18899,"Because, she said to herself, if I may but put my hand on his robe, I will be made well.",,,,,,,
18900,"But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Daughter, take heart; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.",,,,,,,
18901,"And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise,",,,,,,,
18902,"He said, Make room; for the girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they were laughing at him.",,,,,,,
18903,"But when the people were sent out, he went in and took her by the hand; and the girl got up.",,,,,,,
18904,And the news of it went out into all that land.,,,,,,,
18905,"And when Jesus went on from there, two blind men came after him, crying out, Have mercy on us, you Son of David.",,,,,,,
18906,"And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, Have you faith that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.",,,,,,,
18907,"Then he put his hand on their eyes, saying, As your faith is, let it be done to you.",,,,,,,
18908,"And their eyes were made open. And Jesus said to them sharply, Let no man have knowledge of it.",,,,,,,
18909,But they went out and gave news of him in all that land.,,,,,,,
18910,"And while they were going away, there came to him a man without the power of talking, and with an evil spirit.",,,,,,,
18911,"And when the evil spirit had been sent out, the man had the power of talking: and they were all surprised, saying, Such a thing has never been seen in Israel.",,,,,,,
18912,"But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of evil spirits, he sends evil spirits out of men.",,,,,,,
18913,"And Jesus went about all the towns and small places, teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain.",,,,,,,
18914,"But when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them, because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper.",,,,,,,
18915,"Then he said to his disciples, There is much grain but not enough men to get it in.",,,,,,,
18916,"Make prayer, then, to the Lord of the grain-fields, that he may send out workers to get in his grain.And he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits, and of making well all sorts of disease and pain.",,,,,,,
18917,"Now the names of the twelve are these: The first, Simon, who is named Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother;",,,,,,,
18918,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew, the tax-farmer; James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;",,,,,,,
18919,"Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who was false to him.",,,,,,,
18920,"These twelve Jesus sent out and gave them orders, saying, Do not go among the Gentiles, or into any town of Samaria,",,,,,,,
18921,"But go to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel,",,,,,,,
18922,"And, on your way, say, The kingdom of heaven is near.",,,,,,,
18923,"Make well those who are ill, give life to the dead, make lepers clean, send evil spirits out of men; freely it has been given to you, freely give.",,,,,,,
18924,Take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets;,,,,,,,
18925,Take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick: for the workman has a right to his food.,,,,,,,
18926,"And into whatever town or small place you go, make search there for someone who is respected, and make his house your resting-place till you go away.",,,,,,,
18927,"And when you go in, say, May peace be on this house.",,,,,,,
18928,"And if the house is good enough, let your peace come on it: but if not, let your peace come back to you.",,,,,,,
18929,"And whoever will not take you in, or give ear to your words, when you go out from that house or that town, put off its dust from your feet.",,,,,,,
18930,"Truly I say to you, It will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of God's judging than for that town.",,,,,,,
18931,"See, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Be then as wise as snakes, and as gentle as doves.",,,,,,,
18932,"But be on the watch against men: for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins, and in their Synagogues they will give you blows;",,,,,,,
18933,"And you will come before rulers and kings because of me, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
18934,"But when you are given up into their hands, do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it: for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you;",,,,,,,
18935,"Because it is not you who say the words, but the Spirit of your Father in you.",,,,,,,
18936,"And brother will give up brother to death, and the father his child: and children will go against their fathers and mothers, and put them to death.",,,,,,,
18937,And you will be hated by all men because of my name: but he who is strong to the end will have salvation.,,,,,,,
18938,"But when they are cruel to you in one town, go in flight to another: for truly, I say to you, You will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes.",,,,,,,
18939,"A disciple is not greater than his master, or a servant than his lord.",,,,,,,
18940,"It is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have given the name Beelzebub to the master of the house, how much more to those of his house!",,,,,,,
18941,"Have, then, no fear of them: because nothing is covered which will not come to light, or secret which will not be made clear.",,,,,,,
18942,"What I say to you in the dark, say in the light: and what comes to your ear secretly, say publicly from the house-tops.",,,,,,,
18943,"And have no fear of those who put to death the body, but are not able to put to death the soul. But have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell.",,,,,,,
18944,Are not sparrows two a farthing? and not one of them comes to an end without your Father:,,,,,,,
18945,But the hairs of your head are all numbered.,,,,,,,
18946,Then have no fear; you are of more value than a flock of sparrows.,,,,,,,
18947,"To everyone, then, who gives witness to me before men, I will give witness before my Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
18948,"But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me, I will say that I have no knowledge of him before my Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
18949,Do not have the thought that I have come to send peace on the earth; I came not to send peace but a sword.,,,,,,,
18950,"For I have come to put a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:",,,,,,,
18951,And a man will be hated by those of his house.,,,,,,,
18952,He who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me; he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me.,,,,,,,
18953,And he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me.,,,,,,,
18954,"He who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him.",,,,,,,
18955,He who gives honour to you gives honour to me; and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me.,,,,,,,
18956,"He who gives honour to a prophet, in the name of a prophet, will be given a prophet's reward; and he who gives honour to an upright man, in the name of an upright man, will be given an upright man's reward.",,,,,,,
18957,"And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will not go without his reward.And it came about that when Jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples,",he went away,fro,,her,", te",chi,g and
18958,"Now when John had news in prison of the works of the Christ, he sent his disciples",,,,,,,
18959,"To say to him, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?",,,,,,,
18960,"And Jesus, answering, said to them, Go and give news to John of the things which you are seeing and hearing:",,,,,,,
18961,"The blind see; those who were not able to, are walking; lepers are made clean; those who were without hearing, now have their ears open; the dead come to life again, and the poor have the good news given to them.",,,,,,,
18962,And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me.,,,,,,,
18963,"And when they were going away, Jesus, talking of John, said to all the people, What went you out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind?",,,,,,,
18964,But what went you out to see? a man delicately clothed? Those who have fair robes are in kings' houses.,,,,,,,
18965,"But why did you go out? to see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.",,,,,,,
18966,"This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you.",,,,,,,
18967,"Truly I say to you, Among the sons of women there has not been a greater than John the Baptist: but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.",,,,,,,
18968,"And from the days of John the Baptist till now, the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in, and men of force take it.",,,,,,,
18969,For all the prophets and the law were in force till John.,,,,,,,
18970,"And if you are able to see it, this is Elijah who was to come.",,,,,,,
18971,"He who has ears, let him give ear.",,,,,,,
18972,"But what comparison may I make of this generation? It is like children seated in the market-places, crying out to one another,",,,,,,,
18973,We made music for you and you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief.,,,,,,,
18974,"For John came, taking no food or drink, and they say, He has an evil spirit.",,,,,,,
18975,"The Son of man has come feasting, and they say, See, a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners! And wisdom is judged to be right by her works.",,,,,,,
18976,"Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done, because they had not been turned from their sins.",,,,,,,
18977,"Unhappy are you, Chorazin! Unhappy are you, Beth-saida! For if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by, clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on th",ir heads.,,,,,,
18978,"But I say to you, It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging, than for you.",,,,,,,
18979,"And you, Capernaum, were you not to be lifted up to heaven? you will go down into hell: for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been here to this day.",,,,,,,
18980,"But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom in the day of judging, than for you.",,,,,,,
18981,"At that time Jesus made answer and said, I give praise to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning, and have made them clear to little children.",,,,,,,
18982,"Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing in your eyes.",,,,,,,
18983,"All things have been given to me by my Father; and no one has knowledge of the Son, but the Father; and no one has knowledge of the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear.",,,,,,,
18984,"Come to me, all you who are troubled and weighted down with care, and I will give you rest.",,,,,,,
18985,"Take my yoke on you and become like me, for I am gentle and without pride, and you will have rest for your souls;",,,,,,,
18986,"For my yoke is good, and the weight I take up is not hard.At that time Jesus went through the fields on the Sabbath day; and his disciples, being in need of food, were taking the heads of grain.",,,,,,,
18987,"But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, See, your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the Sabbath.",,,,,,,
18988,"But he said to them, Have you no knowledge of what David did when he had need of food, and those who were with him?",,,,,,,
18989,"How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take, but only for the priests?",,,,,,,
18990,"Or is it not said in the law, how the Sabbath is broken by the priests in the Temple and they do no wrong?",,,,,,,
18991,But I say to you that a greater thing than the Temple is here.,,,,,,,
18992,"But if these words had been in your minds, My desire is for mercy and not for offerings, you would not have been judging those who have done no wrong.",,,,,,,
18993,For the Son of man is lord of the Sabbath.,,,,,,,
18994,And he went from there into their Synagogue:,,,,,,,
18995,"And there was a man with a dead hand. And they put a question to him, saying, Is it right to make a man well on the Sabbath day? so that they might have something against him.",,,,,,,
18996,"And he said to them, Which of you, having a sheep, if it gets into a hole on the Sabbath day, will not put out a helping hand and get it back?",,,,,,,
18997,Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! For this reason it is right to do good on the Sabbath day.,,,,,,,
18998,"Then said he to the man, Put out your hand. And he put it out, and it was made as well as the other.",,,,,,,
18999,"But the Pharisees went out and made designs against him, how they might put him to death.",,,,,,,
19000,"And Jesus, having knowledge of this, went away from there, and a great number went after him; and he made them all well,",,,,,,,
19001,Ordering them not to give people word of him:,,,,,,,
19002,"So that what was said by Isaiah the prophet might come true,",,,,,,,
19003,"See my servant, the man of my selection, my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit on him, and he will make my decision clear to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
19004,His coming will not be with fighting or loud cries; and his voice will not be lifted up in the streets.,,,,,,,
19005,"The crushed stem will not be broken by him; and the feebly burning light will he not put out, till he has made righteousness overcome all.",,,,,,,
19006,And in his name will the Gentiles put their hope.,,,,,,,
19007,"Then they took to him one with an evil spirit, who was blind and had no power of talking: and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing.",,,,,,,
19008,"And all the people were surprised and said, Is not this the Son of David?",,,,,,,
19009,"But the Pharisees, hearing of it, said, This man only sends evil spirits out of men by Beelzebub, the ruler of evil spirits.",,,,,,,
19010,"And having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them, Every kingdom having division in itself is made waste, and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction.",,,,,,,
19011,"And if Satan sends out Satan, he makes war against himself; how then will he keep his kingdom?",,,,,,,
19012,"And if I by Beelzebub send evil spirits out of men, by whom do your sons send them out? So let them be your judges.",,,,,,,
19013,"But if I by the Spirit of God send out evil spirits, then is the kingdom of God come on you.",,,,,,,
19014,"Or how may one go into a strong man's house and take his goods, if he does not first put cords round the strong man? and then he may take his goods.",,,,,,,
19015,"Whoever is not with me is against me; and he who does not take part with me in getting people together, is driving them away.",,,,,,,
19016,"So I say to you, Every sin and every evil word against God will have forgiveness; but for evil words against the Spirit there will be no forgiveness.",,,,,,,
19017,"And whoever says a word against the Son of man, will have forgiveness; but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit, will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come.",,,,,,,
19018,"Make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree.",,,,,,,
19019,"You offspring of snakes, how are you, being evil, able to say good things? because out of the heart's store come the words of the mouth.",,,,,,,
19020,The good man out of his good store gives good things; and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things.,,,,,,,
19021,"And I say to you that in the day when they are judged, men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said.",,,,,,,
19022,"For by your words will your righteousness be seen, and by your words you will be judged.",,,,,,,
19023,"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees, hearing this, said to him, Master, we are looking for a sign from you.",,,,,,,
19024,"But he, answering, said to them, An evil and false generation is looking for a sign; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah:",,,,,,,
19025,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.",,,,,,,
19026,The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation: because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of Jonah; and now a greater than Jonah is here.,,,,,,,
19027,The queen of the South will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation: for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon; and now a greater than Solomon is here.,,,,,,,
19028,"But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, goes through dry places looking for rest, and getting it not.",,,,,,,
19029,"Then he says, I will go back into my house from which I came out; and when he comes, he sees that there is no one in it, but that it has been made fair and clean.",,,,,,,
19030,"Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself, and they go in and make it their living-place: and the last condition of that man is worse than the first. Even so will it be with this evil generation.",,,,,,,
19031,"While he was still talking to the people, his mother and his brothers came, desiring to have talk with him.",,,,,,,
19032,"And one said to him, See, your mother and your brothers are outside, desiring to have talk with you.",,,,,,,
19033,"But he in answer said to him who gave the news, Who is my mother and who are my brothers?",,,,,,,
19034,"And he put out his hand to his disciples and said, See, my mother and my brothers!",,,,,,,
19035,"For whoever does the pleasure of my Father in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.On that day Jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside.",,,,,,,
19036,"And great numbers of people came together to him, so that he got into a boat; and the people took up their position by the sea.",,,,,,,
19037,"And he gave them teaching in the form of a story, saying, A man went out to put seed in the earth;",,,,,,,
19038,"And while he did so, some seeds were dropped by the wayside, and the birds came and took them for food:",,,,,,,
19039,"And some of the seed went among the stones, where it had not much earth, and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep:",,,,,,,
19040,"And when the sun was high, it was burned; and because it had no root it became dry and dead.",,,,,,,
19041,"And some seeds went among thorns, and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth:",,,,,,,
19042,"And some, falling on good earth, gave fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times as much.",,,,,,,
19043,"He who has ears, let him give ear.",,,,,,,
19044,"And the disciples came and said to him, Why do you say things to them in the form of stories?",,,,,,,
19045,"And he said to them in answer, To you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.",,,,,,,
19046,"Because whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have more; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.",,,,,,,
19047,"For this reason I put things into the form of stories; because they see without seeing, and give ear without hearing, and the sense is not clear to them.",,,,,,,
19048,"And for them the words of Isaiah have come true, Though you give ear, you will not get knowledge; and seeing, you will see, but the sense will not be clear to you:",,,,,,,
19049,"For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut; for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me, so that I mig",t make them,ell,,,,,
19050,"But a blessing be on your eyes, because they see; and on your ears, because they are open.",,,,,,,
19051,"For truly, I say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see, and saw them not; and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears, and they had it not.",,,,,,,
19052,"Give ear, then, to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth.",,,,,,,
19053,"When the word of the kingdom comes to anyone, and the sense of it is not clear to him, then the Evil One comes, and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart. He is the seed dropped by the wayside.",,,,,,,
19054,"And that which went on the stones, this is he who, hearing the word, straight away takes it with joy;",,,,,,,
19055,"But having no root in himself, he goes on for a time; and when trouble comes or pain, because of the word, he quickly becomes full of doubts.",,,,,,,
19056,"And that which was dropped among the thorns, this is he who has the word; and the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit.",,,,,,,
19057,"And the seed which was put in good earth, this is he who gives ear to the word, and gets the sense of it; who gives fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times as much.",,,,,,,
19058,"And he gave them another story, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field:",,,,,,,
19059,"But while men were sleeping, one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain, and went away.",,,,,,,
19060,"But when the green stem came up and gave fruit, the evil plants were seen at the same time.",,,,,,,
19061,"And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not put good seed in your field? how then has it evil plants?",,,,,,,
19062,"And he said, Someone has done this in hate. And the servants say to him, Is it your pleasure that we go and take them up?",,,,,,,
19063,"But he says, No, for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants, you may be rooting up the grain with them.",,,,,,,
19064,"Let them come up together till the getting in of the grain; and then I will say to the workers, Take up first the evil plants, and put them together for burning: but put the grain into my store-house.",,,,,,,
19065,"He put another story before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field:",,,,,,,
19066,"Which is smaller than all seeds; but when it has come up it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting-places in its branches.",,,,,,,
19067,"Another story he gave to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and put in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.",,,,,,,
19068,All these things Jesus said to the people in the form of stories; and without a story he said nothing to them:,,,,,,,
19069,"That it might come true which was said by the prophet, Opening my mouth, I will give out stories; I will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time.",,,,,,,
19070,"Then he went away from the people, and went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field.",,,,,,,
19071,"And he made answer and said, He who puts the good seed in the earth is the Son of man;",,,,,,,
19072,And the field is the world; and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom; and the evil seeds are the sons of the Evil One;,,,,,,,
19073,And he who put them in the earth is Satan; and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world; and those who get it in are the angels.,,,,,,,
19074,"As then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire, so will it be in the end of the world.",,,,,,,
19075,"The Son of man will send out his angels, and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error, and all those who do wrong,",,,,,,,
19076,And will put them into the fire; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.,,,,,,,
19077,"Then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him give ear.",,,,,,,
19078,"The kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field, which a man came across and put back again; and in his joy he goes and gives all he has, to get that field.",,,,,,,
19079,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beautiful jewels.",,,,,,,
19080,"And having come across one jewel of great price, he went and gave all he had in exchange for it.",,,,,,,
19081,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish:",,,,,,,
19082,"When it was full, they took it up on the sands; and seated there they put the good into vessels, but the bad they put away.",,,,,,,
19083,"So will it be in the end of the world: the angels will come and take out the bad from the good,",,,,,,,
19084,And will put them into the fire: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.,,,,,,,
19085,"Are all these things now clear to you? They say to him, Yes.",,,,,,,
19086,"And he said to them, For this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house, who gives out from his store things new and old.",,,,,,,
19087,And when Jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there.,,,,,,,
19088,"And coming into his country, he gave them teaching in their Synagogue, so that they were greatly surprised and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?",,,,,,,
19089,Is not this the woodworker's son? is not his mother named Mary? and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?,,,,,,,
19090,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? from where, then, has he all these things?",,,,,,,
19091,"And they were bitter against him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family.",,,,,,,
19092,And the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith.At that time news of Jesus came to Herod the king;,,,,,,,
19093,"And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has come back from the dead, and so these powers are working in him.",,,,,,,
19094,"For Herod had taken John and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.",,,,,,,
19095,"Because John had said to him, It is not right for you to have her.",,,,,,,
19096,"And he would have put him to death, but for his fear of the people, because in their eyes John was a prophet.",,,,,,,
19097,"But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias was dancing before them, and Herod was pleased with her.",,,,,,,
19098,So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for.,,,,,,,
19099,"And she, at her mother's suggestion, said, Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist.",,,,,,,
19100,"And the king was sad; but because of his oaths and because of his guests, he gave the order for it to be given to her;",,,,,,,
19101,And he sent and had John's head cut off in the prison.,,,,,,,
19102,And his head was put on a plate and given to the girl; and she took it to her mother.,,,,,,,
19103,"And his disciples came, and took up his body and put it in the earth; and they went and gave Jesus news of what had taken place.",,,,,,,
19104,"Now when it came to the ears of Jesus, he went away from there in a boat, to a waste place by himself: and the people hearing of it, went after him on foot from the towns.",,,,,,,
19105,"And he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them, and made well those of them who were ill.",,,,,,,
19106,"And when evening had come, the disciples came to him, saying, This place is waste land, and the time is now past; send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food.",,,,,,,
19107,"But Jesus said to them, There is no need for them to go away; give them food yourselves.",,,,,,,
19108,"And they say to him, We have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes.",,,,,,,
19109,"And he said, Give them to me.",,,,,,,
19110,"And he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass; and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing, and made division of the food, and gave it to the disciples, and the disciples gave",t to the peo,le.,,,,,
19111,And they all took of the food and had enough: and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used.,,,,,,,
19112,"And those who had food were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.",,,,,,,
19113,"And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, till he had sent the people away.",,,,,,,
19114,"And after he had sent the people away, he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer: and when evening was come, he was there by himself.",,,,,,,
19115,"But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, and was troubled by the waves: for the wind was against them.",,,,,,,
19116,"And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.",,,,,,,
19117,"And when they saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they gave cries of fear.",,,,,,,
19118,"But straight away Jesus said to them, Take heart; it is I, have no fear.",,,,,,,
19119,"And Peter, answering, said to him, Lord, if it is you, give me the order to come to you on the water.",,,,,,,
19120,"And he said, Come. And Peter got out of the boat, and walking on the water, went to Jesus.",,,,,,,
19121,"But when he saw the wind he was in fear and, starting to go down, he gave a cry, saying, Help, Lord.",,,,,,,
19122,"And straight away Jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him, and said to him, O man of little faith, why were you in doubt?",,,,,,,
19123,"And when they had got into the boat, the wind went down.",,,,,,,
19124,"And those who were in the boat gave him worship, saying, Truly you are the Son of God.",,,,,,,
19125,"And when they had gone across, they came to land at Gennesaret.",,,,,,,
19126,"And when the men of that place had news of him, they sent into all the country round about, and took to him all who were ill,",,,,,,,
19127,"With the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe: and all those who did so were made well.Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,",,,,,,,
19128,Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers? for they take food with unwashed hands.,,,,,,,
19129,"And in answer he said to them, Why do you, yourselves, go against the word of God on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you?",,,,,,,
19130,"For God said, Give honour to your father and mother: and, He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death.",,,,,,,
19131,"But you say, If a man says to his father or his mother, That by which you might have had profit from me is given to God;",,,,,,,
19132,There is no need for him to give honour to his father. And you have made the word of God without effect because of your teaching.,,,,,,,
19133,"You false ones, well did Isaiah say of you,",,,,,,,
19134,"These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",,,,,,,
19135,"But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men.",,,,,,,
19136,"And he got the people together and said to them, Give ear, and let my words be clear to you:",,,,,,,
19137,"Not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean, but that which comes out of the mouth.",,,,,,,
19138,"Then the disciples came and said to him, Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears?",,,,,,,
19139,"But he said in answer, Every plant which my Father in heaven has not put in the earth, will be taken up by the roots.",,,,,,,
19140,"Let them be: they are blind guides. And if a blind man is guiding a blind man, the two will go falling into a hole together.",,,,,,,
19141,"Then Peter said to him, Make the story clear to us.",,,,,,,
19142,"And he said, Are you, like them, still without wisdom?",,,,,,,
19143,"Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach, and is sent out as waste?",,,,,,,
19144,But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart; and they make a man unclean.,,,,,,,
19145,"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, the taking of life, broken faith between the married, unclean desires of the flesh, taking of property, false witness, bitter words:",,,,,,,
19146,These are the things which make a man unclean; but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean.,,,,,,,
19147,And Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon.,,,,,,,
19148,"And a woman of Canaan came out from those parts, crying and saying, Have pity on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit.",,,,,,,
19149,"But he gave her no answer. And his disciples came and said to him, Send her away, for she is crying after us.",,,,,,,
19150,"But he made answer and said, I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel.",,,,,,,
19151,"But she came and gave him worship, saying, Help, Lord.",,,,,,,
19152,"And he made answer and said, It is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs.",,,,,,,
19153,"But she said, Yes, Lord: but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters' table.",,,,,,,
19154,"Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman, great is your faith: let your desire be done. And her daughter was made well from that hour.",,,,,,,
19155,"And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and took his seat there.",,,,,,,
19156,"And there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body, or blind, or without voice, or wounded, or ill in any way, and a number of others; they put them down at his feet and he made them well:",,,,,,,
19157,"So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking, the feeble were made strong, those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking, and the blind were able to see: and they gave glory to the God of Israel.",,,,,,,
19158,"And Jesus got his disciples together and said, I have pity for the people, because they have now been with me three days and have no food: and I will not send them away without food, or they will have no strength for the journey.",,,,,,,
19159,"And the disciples say to him, How may we get enough bread in a waste place, to give food to such a number of people?",,,,,,,
19160,"And Jesus says to them, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven cakes, and some small fishes.",,,,,,,
19161,"Then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth,",,,,,,,
19162,"And he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes; and having given praise, he gave the broken bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the people.",,,,,,,
19163,"And they all took food, and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits, seven baskets full.",,,,,,,
19164,"And there were four thousand men who took food, together with women and children.",,,,,,,
19165,"And when he had sent the people away, he got into the boat, and came into the country of Magadan.And the Pharisees and Sadducees came and, testing him, made a request to him to give them a sign from heaven.",,,,,,,
19166,"But in answer he said to them, At nightfall you say, The weather will be good, for the sky is red.",,,,,,,
19167,"And in the morning, The weather will be bad today, for the sky is red and angry. You are able to see the face of heaven, but not the signs of the times.",,,,,,,
19168,An evil and false generation is searching after a sign; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah. And he went away from them.,,,,,,,
19169,And when the disciples came to the other side they had not taken thought to get bread.,,,,,,,
19170,"And Jesus said to them, Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",,,,,,,
19171,"And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, We took no bread.",,,,,,,
19172,"And Jesus, seeing it, said, O you of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves, because you have no bread?",,,,,,,
19173,"Do you still not see, or keep in mind the five cakes of bread of the five thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?",,,,,,,
19174,"Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?",,,,,,,
19175,"How is it that you do not see that I was not talking to you about bread, but about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?",,,,,,,
19176,"Then they saw that it was not the leaven of bread which he had in mind, but the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",,,,,,,
19177,"Now when Jesus had come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he said, questioning his disciples, Who do men say that the Son of man is?",,,,,,,
19178,"And they said, Some say, John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.",,,,,,,
19179,"He says to them, But who do you say that I am?",,,,,,,
19180,"And Simon Peter made answer and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.",,,,,,,
19181,"And Jesus made answer and said to him, A blessing on you, Simon Bar- jonah: because this knowledge has not come to you from flesh and blood, but from my Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
19182,"And I say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock will my church be based, and the doors of hell will not overcome it.",,,,,,,
19183,I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever is fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven: and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven.,,,,,,,
19184,Then he gave orders to the disciples to give no man word that he was the Christ.,,,,,,,
19185,"From that time Jesus went on to make clear to his disciples how he would have to go up to Jerusalem, and undergo much at the hands of those in authority and the chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and the third day come again from the dead.",,,,,,,
19186,"And Peter, protesting, said to him, Be it far from you, Lord; it is impossible that this will come about.",,,,,,,
19187,"But he, turning to Peter, said, Get out of my way, Satan: you are a danger to me because your mind is not on the things of God, but on the things of men.",,,,,,,
19188,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him give up all, and take up his cross, and come after me.",,,,,,,
19189,"Because whoever has a desire to keep his life safe will have it taken from him; but whoever gives up his life because of me, will have it given back to him.",,,,,,,
19190,"For what profit has a man, if he gets all the world with the loss of his life? or what will a man give in exchange for his life?",,,,,,,
19191,For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he will give to every man the reward of his works.,,,,,,,
19192,"Truly I say to you, There are some of those here who will not have a taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, his brother, and makes them go up with him into a",igh mountain,by,h,mse,ves.,,
19193,"And he was changed in form before them; and his face was shining like the sun, and his clothing became white as light.",,,,,,,
19194,"And Moses and Elijah came before their eyes, talking with him.",,,,,,,
19195,"And Peter made answer and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will let me, I will make here three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.",,,,,,,
19196,"While he was still talking, a bright cloud came over them: and a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased; give ear to him.",,,,,,,
19197,And at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear.,,,,,,,
19198,"And Jesus came and put his hand on them and said, Get up and have no fear.",,,,,,,
19199,"And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, but Jesus only.",,,,,,,
19200,"And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave them orders, saying, Let no man have word of what you have seen, till the Son of man has come again from the dead.",,,,,,,
19201,"And his disciples, questioning him, said, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?",,,,,,,
19202,"And in answer he said, Elijah truly has to come and put all things right:",,,,,,,
19203,"But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they had no knowledge of him, but did to him whatever they were pleased to do; the same will the Son of man undergo at their hands.",,,,,,,
19204,Then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of John the Baptist.,,,,,,,
19205,"And when they came to the people, a man went down on his knees to him, saying,",,,,,,,
19206,"Lord have mercy on my son: for he is off his head, and is in great pain; and frequently he goes falling into the fire, and frequently into the water.",,,,,,,
19207,"And I took him to your disciples, and they were not able to make him well.",,,,,,,
19208,"And Jesus, answering, said, O false and foolish generation, how long will I be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come here to me.",,,,,,,
19209,"And Jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit, and it went out of him: and the boy was made well from that hour.",,,,,,,
19210,"Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why were we not able to send it out?",,,,,,,
19211,"And he says to them, Because of your little faith: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Be moved from this place to that; and it will be moved; and nothing will be impossible to you.",,,,,,,
19212,[],,,,,,,
19213,"And while they were going about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men;",,,,,,,
19214,"And they will put him to death, and the third day he will come again from the dead. And they were very sad.",,,,,,,
19215,"And when they had come to Capernaum, those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax?",,,,,,,
19216,"He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax? from their sons or from other people?",,,,,,,
19217,"And when he said, From other people, Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.",,,,,,,
19218,"But, so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them, go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish which comes up; and in his mouth you will see a bit of money: take that, and give it to them for me and you.In that hour the disciples came","to Jesus, sa",ing,,ho,s gr,ate,t in
19219,"And he took a little child, and put him in the middle of them,",,,,,,,
19220,"And said, Truly, I say to you, If you do not have a change of heart and become like little children, you will not go into the kingdom of heaven.",,,,,,,
19221,"Whoever, then, will make himself as low as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.",,,,,,,
19222,"And whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name, gives honour to me:",,,,,,,
19223,"But whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck, and to come to his end in the deep sea.",,,,,,,
19224,A curse is on the earth because of trouble! for it is necessary for trouble to come; but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes.,,,,,,,
19225,"And if your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble, let it be cut off and put it away from you: it is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than, having two hands or two feet, to go into the eternal fire.",,,,,,,
19226,"And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out, and put it away from you: it is better for you to go into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to go into the hell of fire.",,,,,,,
19227,Let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value; for I say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my Father in heaven.,,,,,,,
19228,[],,,,,,,
19229,"What would you say now? if a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone wandering away, will he not let the ninety-nine be, and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one?",,,,,,,
19230,"And if he comes across it, truly I say to you, he has more joy over it than over the ninety-nine which have not gone out of the way.",,,,,,,
19231,Even so it is not the pleasure of your Father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction.,,,,,,,
19232,"And if your brother does wrong to you, go, make clear to him his error between you and him in private: if he gives ear to you, you have got your brother back again.",,,,,,,
19233,"But if he will not give ear to you, take with you one or two more, that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain.",,,,,,,
19234,"And if he will not give ear to them, let it come to the hearing of the church: and if he will not give ear to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax-farmer.",,,,,,,
19235,"Truly I say to you, Whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven: and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven.",,,,,,,
19236,"Again, I say to you, that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.",,,,,,,
19237,"For where two or three are come together in my name, there am I among them.",,,,,,,
19238,"Then Peter came and said to him, Lord, what number of times may my brother do wrong against me, and I give him forgiveness? till seven times?",,,,,,,
19239,"Jesus says to him, I say not to you, Till seven times; but, Till seventy times seven.",,,,,,,
19240,"For this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king, who went over his accounts with his servants.",,,,,,,
19241,"And at the start, one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents.",,,,,,,
19242,"And because he was not able to make payment, his lord gave orders for him, and his wife, and his sons and daughters, and all he had, to be given for money, and payment to be made.",,,,,,,
19243,"So the servant went down on his face and gave him worship, saying, Lord, give me time to make payment and I will give you all.",,,,,,,
19244,"And the lord of that servant, being moved with pity, let him go, and made him free of the debt.",,,,,,,
19245,"But that servant went out, and meeting one of the other servants, who was in debt to him for one hundred pence, he took him by the throat, saying, Make payment of your debt.",,,,,,,
19246,"So that servant went down on his face, requesting him and saying, Give me time and I will make payment to you.",,,,,,,
19247,And he would not: but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt.,,,,,,,
19248,"So when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad, and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done.",,,,,,,
19249,"Then his lord sent for him and said, You evil servant; I made you free of all that debt, because of your request to me:",,,,,,,
19250,"Was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant, even as I had mercy on you?",,,,,,,
19251,"And his lord was very angry, and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt.",,,,,,,
19252,"So will my Father in heaven do to you, if you do not everyone, from your hearts, give forgiveness to his brother.And it came about that after saying these words, Jesus went away from Galilee, and came into the parts of Judaea on the other side of Jordan.",,,,,,,
19253,And a great number went after him; and he made them well there.,,,,,,,
19254,"And certain Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every cause?",,,,,,,
19255,"And he said in answer, Have you not seen in the Writings, that he who made them at the first made them male and female, and said,",,,,,,,
19256,"For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother, and be joined to his wife; and the two will become one flesh?",,,,,,,
19257,"So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Then let not that which has been joined by God be parted by man.",,,,,,,
19258,"They say to him, Why then did Moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her?",,,,,,,
19259,"He says to them, Moses, because of your hard hearts, let you put away your wives: but it has not been so from the first.",,,,,,,
19260,"And I say to you, Whoever puts away his wife for any other cause than the loss of her virtue, and takes another, is a false husband: and he who takes her as his wife when she is put away, is no true husband to her.",,,,,,,
19261,"The disciples say to him, If this is the position of a man in relation to his wife, it is better not to be married.",,,,,,,
19262,"But he said to them, Not all men are able to take in this saying, but only those to whom it is given.",,,,,,,
19263,"For there are men who, from birth, were without sex: and there are some who were made so by men: and there are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to take it, let him take it.",,,,,,,
19264,"Then some people took little children to him, so that he might put his hands on them in blessing: and the disciples said sharp words to them.",,,,,,,
19265,"But Jesus said, Let the little ones come to me, and do not keep them away: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.",,,,,,,
19266,"And he put his hands on them, and went away.",,,,,,,
19267,"And one came to him and said, Master, what good thing have I to do, so that I may have eternal life?",,,,,,,
19268,"And he said to him, Why are you questioning me about what is good? One there is who is good: but if you have a desire to go into life, keep the rules of the law.",,,,,,,
19269,"He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Do not put anyone to death, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not take what is not yours, Do not give false witness,",,,,,,,
19270,"Give honour to your father and your mother: and, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.",,,,,,,
19271,"The young man says to him, All these things have I done: what more is there?",,,,,,,
19272,"Jesus said to him, If you have a desire to be complete, go, get money for your property, and give it to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven: and come after me.",,,,,,,
19273,But hearing these words the young man went away sorrowing: for he had much property.,,,,,,,
19274,"And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, It is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven.",,,,,,,
19275,"And again I say to you, It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
19276,"And the disciples, hearing this, were greatly surprised, saying, Who then may have salvation?",,,,,,,
19277,"And Jesus, looking at them, said, With men this is not possible; but with God all things are possible.",,,,,,,
19278,"Then Peter said to him, See, we have given up everything and have come after you; what then will we have?",,,,,,,
19279,"And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that in the time when all things are made new, and the Son of man is seated in his glory, you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",,,,,,,
19280,"And everyone who has given up houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or child, or land, for my name, will be given a hundred times as much, and have eternal life.",,,,,,,
19281,"But a great number who are first will be last, and some who are last will be first.For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house, who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vine-garden.",,,,,,,
19282,"And when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day, he sent them into his vine-garden.",,,,,,,
19283,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others in the market-place doing nothing;",,,,,,,
19284,"And he said to them, Go into the vine-garden with the others, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went to work.",,,,,,,
19285,"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same.",,,,,,,
19286,"And about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing; and he says to them, Why are you here all the day doing nothing?",,,,,,,
19287,"They say to him, Because no man has given us work. He says to them, Go in with the rest, into the vine- garden.",,,,,,,
19288,"And when evening came, the lord of the vine-garden said to his manager, Let the workers come, and give them their payment, from the last to the first.",,,,,,,
19289,"And when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour, they were given every man a penny.",,,,,,,
19290,"Then those who came first had the idea that they would get more; and they, like the rest, were given a penny.",,,,,,,
19291,"And when they got it, they made a protest against the master of the house,",,,,,,,
19292,"Saying, These last have done only one hour's work, and you have made them equal to us, who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat.",,,,,,,
19293,"But he in answer said to one of them, Friend, I do you no wrong: did you not make an agreement with me for a penny?",,,,,,,
19294,"Take what is yours, and go away; it is my pleasure to give to this last, even as to you.",,,,,,,
19295,"Have I not the right to do as seems good to me in my house? or is your eye evil, because I am good?",,,,,,,
19296,"So the last will be first, and the first last.",,,,,,,
19297,"And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples on one side, and said to them,",,,,,,,
19298,"See, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes; and they will give orders for him to be put to death,",,,,,,,
19299,And will give him up to the Gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross: and the third day he will come back again from the dead.,,,,,,,
19300,"Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, giving him worship and making a request of him.",,,,,,,
19301,"And he said to her, What is your desire? She says to him, Let my two sons be seated, the one at your right hand, and the other at your left, in your kingdom.",,,,,,,
19302,"But Jesus made answer and said, You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup which I am about to take?",,,,,,,
19303,"They say to him, We are able. He says to them, Truly, you will take of my cup: but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give, but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready.",,,,,,,
19304,"And when it came to the ears of the ten, they were angry with the two brothers.",,,,,,,
19305,"But Jesus said to them, You see that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords over them, and their great ones have authority over them.",,,,,,,
19306,"Let it not be so among you: but if anyone has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant;",,,,,,,
19307,"And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him take the lowest place:",,,,,,,
19308,"Even as the Son of man did not come to have servants, but to be a servant, and to give his life for the salvation of men.",,,,,,,
19309,"And when they were going out from Jericho, a great number went after him.",,,,,,,
19310,"And two blind men seated by the wayside, when they had the news that Jesus was going by, gave a loud cry, saying, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.",,,,,,,
19311,"And the people gave them orders to be quiet; but they went on crying even louder, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.",,,,,,,
19312,"And Jesus, stopping, sent for them, and said, What would you have me do to you?",,,,,,,
19313,"They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be open.",,,,,,,
19314,"And Jesus, being moved with pity, put his fingers on their eyes: and straight away they were able to see, and went after him.And when they were near Jerusalem, and had come to Beth-phage, to the Mountain of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,",,,,,,,
19315,"Saying to them, Go into the little town in front of you, and straight away you will see an ass with a cord round her neck, and a young one with her; let them loose and come with them to me.",,,,,,,
19316,"And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, The Lord has need of them; and straight away he will send them.",,,,,,,
19317,"Now this took place so that these words of the prophet might come true,",,,,,,,
19318,"Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your King comes to you, gentle and seated on an ass, and on a young ass.",,,,,,,
19319,"And the disciples went and did as Jesus had given them orders,",,,,,,,
19320,"And got the ass and the young one, and put their clothing on them, and he took his seat on it.",,,,,,,
19321,"And all the people put their clothing down in the way; and others got branches from the trees, and put them down in the way.",,,,,,,
19322,"And those who went before him, and those who came after, gave loud cries, saying, Glory to the Son of David: A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord: Glory in the highest.",,,,,,,
19323,"And when he came into Jerusalem, all the town was moved, saying, Who is this?",,,,,,,
19324,"And the people said, This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.",,,,,,,
19325,"And Jesus went into the Temple and sent out all who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those trading in doves.",,,,,,,
19326,"And he said to them, It is in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer, but you are making it a hole of thieves.",,,,,,,
19327,"And the blind and the broken in body came to him in the Temple, and he made them well.",,,,,,,
19328,"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did, and the children crying out in the Temple, Glory to the son of David, they were angry and said to him,",,,,,,,
19329,"Have you any idea what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes: have you not seen in the Writings, From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete?",,,,,,,
19330,"And he went away from them, and went out of the town to Bethany, and was there for the night.",,,,,,,
19331,"Now in the morning when he was coming back to the town, he had a desire for food.",,,,,,,
19332,"And seeing a fig-tree by the wayside, he came to it, and saw nothing on it but leaves only; and he said to it, Let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever. And straight away the fig-tree became dry and dead.",,,,,,,
19333,"And when the disciples saw it they were surprised, saying, How did the fig-tree become dry in so short a time?",,,,,,,
19334,"And Jesus in answer said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, without doubting, not only may you do what has been done to the fig-tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and put into the sea, it will be done.",,,,,,,
19335,"And all things, whatever you make request for in prayer, having faith, you will get.",,,,,,,
19336,"And when he had come into the Temple, the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? and who gave you this authority?",,,,,,,
19337,"And Jesus said to them in answer, I will put one question to you, and if you give me the answer, I will say by what authority I do these things.",,,,,,,
19338,"The baptism of John, where did it come from? from heaven or from men? And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not have faith in him?",,,,,,,
19339,"But if we say, From men; we are in fear of the people, because all take John to be a prophet.",,,,,,,
19340,"And they made answer and said, We have no idea. Then he said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.",,,,,,,
19341,"But how does it seem to you? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go and do work today in the vine-garden.",,,,,,,
19342,"And he said in answer, I will not: but later, changing his decision, he went.",,,,,,,
19343,"And he came to the second and said the same. And he made answer and said, I go, sir: and went not.",,,,,,,
19344,"Which of the two did his father's pleasure? They say, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that tax- farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of God before you.",,,,,,,
19345,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you had no faith in him, but the tax-farmers and the loose women had faith in him: and you, when you saw it, did not even have regret for your sins, so as to have faith in him.",,,,,,,
19346,"Give ear to another story. A master of a house made a vine garden, and put a wall round it, and made a place for crushing out the wine, and made a tower, and let it out to field-workers, and went into another country.",,,,,,,
19347,"And when the time for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the workmen, to get the fruit.",,,,,,,
19348,"And the workmen made an attack on his servants, giving blows to one, putting another to death, and stoning another.",,,,,,,
19349,"Again, he sent other servants more in number than the first: and they did the same to them.",,,,,,,
19350,"But after that he sent his son to them, saying, They will have respect for my son.",,,,,,,
19351,"But when the workmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death and take his heritage.",,,,,,,
19352,"And they took him and, driving him out of the vine-garden, put him to death.",,,,,,,
19353,"When, then, the lord of the vine-garden comes, what will he do to those workmen?",,,,,,,
19354,"They say to him, He will put those cruel men to a cruel death, and will let out the vine-garden to other workmen, who will give him the fruit when it is ready.",,,,,,,
19355,"Jesus says to them, Did you never see in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has been made the chief stone of the building: this was the Lord's doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes?",,,,,,,
19356,"For this reason I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.",,,,,,,
19357,"Any man falling on this stone will be broken, but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust.",,,,,,,
19358,"And when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the Pharisees, they saw that he was talking of them.",,,,,,,
19359,"And though they had a desire to take him, they were in fear of the people, because in their eyes he was a prophet.And Jesus, talking to them again in stories, said:",,,,,,,
19360,"The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a feast when his son was married,",,,,,,,
19361,And sent out his servants to get in the guests to the feast: and they would not come.,,,,,,,
19362,"Again he sent out other servants, with orders to say to the guests, See, I have made ready my feast: my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death, and all things are ready: come to the feast.",,,,,,,
19363,"But they gave no attention, and went about their business, one to his farm, another to his trade:",,,,,,,
19364,"And the rest put violent hands on his servants, and did evil to them, and put them to death.",,,,,,,
19365,"But the king was angry; and he sent his armies, and those who had put his servants to death he gave to destruction, burning down their town with fire.",,,,,,,
19366,"Then he said to his servants, The feast is ready but the guests were not good enough.",,,,,,,
19367,"Go then to the cross-roads, and get all those whom you see to come to the bride-feast.",,,,,,,
19368,"And those servants went out into the streets, and got together all those whom they came across, bad and good: and the feast was full of guests.",,,,,,,
19369,"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a guest's robe;",,,,,,,
19370,"And he says to him, Friend, how came you in here not having a guest's robe? And he had nothing to say.",,,,,,,
19371,"Then the king said to the servants, Put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.",,,,,,,
19372,"For out of all to whom the good news has come, only a small number will get salvation.",,,,,,,
19373,Then the Pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him.,,,,,,,
19374,"And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we see that you are true, and that you are teaching the true way of God, and have no fear of anyone, because you have no respect for a man's position.",,,,,,,
19375,"Give us, then, your opinion of this: Is it right to give tax to Caesar, or not?",,,,,,,
19376,"But Jesus saw their trick and said, Oh false ones, why are you attempting to put me in the wrong?",,,,,,,
19377,Let me see the tax money. And they gave him a penny.,,,,,,,
19378,"And he said to them, Whose is this image and name on it?",,,,,,,
19379,"They say to him, Caesar's. Then he said to them, Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.",,,,,,,
19380,"And hearing it, they were full of wonder, and went away from him.",,,,,,,
19381,"On the same day there came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no coming back from the dead: and they put a question to him, saying,",,,,,,,
19382,"Master, Moses said, If a man, at the time of his death, has no children, let his brother take his wife, and get a family for his brother;",,,,,,,
19383,"Now there were among us seven brothers; and the first was married and at his death, having no seed, gave his wife to his brother;",,,,,,,
19384,"In the same way the second and the third, up to the seventh.",,,,,,,
19385,And last of all the woman came to her end.,,,,,,,
19386,"When they come back from the dead, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? because they all had her.",,,,,,,
19387,"But Jesus said to them in answer, You are in error, not having knowledge of the Writings, or of the power of God.",,,,,,,
19388,"For when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives, but they are as the angels in heaven.",,,,,,,
19389,"But about the dead coming back to life, have you no knowledge of what was said to you by God in the Writings:",,,,,,,
19390,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead but of the living.",,,,,,,
19391,And the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching.,,,,,,,
19392,"But the Pharisees, hearing how the mouths of the Sadducees had been stopped, came together;",,,,,,,
19393,"And one of them, a teacher of the law, put a question to him, testing him, and saying,",,,,,,,
19394,"Master, which is the chief rule in the law?",,,,,,,
19395,"And he said to him, Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.",,,,,,,
19396,This is the first and greatest rule.,,,,,,,
19397,"And a second like it is this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.",,,,,,,
19398,On these two rules all the law and the prophets are based.,,,,,,,
19399,"Now while the Pharisees were together, Jesus put a question to them, saying,",,,,,,,
19400,"What is your opinion of the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The Son of David.",,,,,,,
19401,"He says to them, How then does David in the Spirit give him the name of Lord, saying,",,,,,,,
19402,"The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put under your feet all those who are against you?",,,,,,,
19403,"If David then gives him the name of Lord, how is he his son?",,,,,,,
19404,"And no one was able to give him an answer, and so great was their fear of him, that from that day no one put any more questions to him.Then Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:",,,,,,,
19405,The scribes and the Pharisees have the authority of Moses;,,,,,,,
19406,"All things, then, which they give you orders to do, these do and keep: but do not take their works as your example, for they say and do not.",,,,,,,
19407,They make hard laws and put great weights on men's backs; but they themselves will not put a finger to them.,,,,,,,
19408,"But all their works they do so as to be seen by men: for they make wide their phylacteries, and the edges of their robes,",,,,,,,
19409,"And the things desired by them are the first places at feasts, and the chief seats in the Synagogues,",,,,,,,
19410,"And words of respect in the market-places, and to be named by men, Teacher.",,,,,,,
19411,"But you may not be named Teacher: for one is your teacher, and you are all brothers.",,,,,,,
19412,"And give no man the name of father on earth: because one is your Father, who is in heaven.",,,,,,,
19413,"And you may not be named guides: because one is your Guide, even Christ.",,,,,,,
19414,But let the greatest among you be your servant.,,,,,,,
19415,"And whoever makes himself high will be made low, and whoever makes himself low will be made high.",,,,,,,
19416,"But a curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men: for you do not go in yourselves, and those who are going in, you keep back.",,,,,,,
19417,[],,,,,,,
19418,"A curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! for you go about land and sea to get one disciple and, having him, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.",,,,,,,
19419,"A curse is on you, blind guides, who say, Whoever takes an oath by the Temple, it is nothing; but whoever takes an oath by the gold of the Temple, he is responsible.",,,,,,,
19420,"You foolish ones and blind: which is greater, the gold, or the Temple which makes the gold holy?",,,,,,,
19421,"And, Whoever takes an oath by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever takes an oath by the offering which is on it, he is responsible.",,,,,,,
19422,"You blind ones: which is greater, the offering, or the altar which makes the offering holy?",,,,,,,
19423,"He, then, who takes an oath by the altar, takes it by the altar and by all things on it.",,,,,,,
19424,"And he who takes an oath by the Temple, takes it by the Temple and by him whose house it is.",,,,,,,
19425,"And he who takes an oath by heaven, takes it by the seat of God, and by him who is seated on it.",,,,,,,
19426,"A curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! for you make men give a tenth of all sorts of sweet-smelling plants, but you give no thought to the more important things of the law, righteousness, and mercy, and faith; but it is right for you to do","these, and n",t t,,et,he o,her,be u

19428,"A curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of violent behaviour and uncontrolled desire.",,,,,,,
19429,"You blind Pharisee, first make clean the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become equally clean.",,,,,,,
19430,"A curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! for you are like the resting-places of the dead, which are made white, and seem beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and of all unclean things.",,,,,,,
19431,"Even so you seem to men to be full of righteousness, but inside you are all false and full of wrongdoing.",,,,,,,
19432,"A curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! because you put up buildings for housing the dead bodies of the prophets, and make fair the last resting- places of good men, and say,",,,,,,,
19433,"If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets.",,,,,,,
19434,So that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death.,,,,,,,
19435,"Make full, then, the measure of your fathers.",,,,,,,
19436,"You snakes, offspring of snakes, how will you be kept from the punishment of hell?",,,,,,,
19437,"For this reason, I send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them you will put to death and put on the cross, and to some of them you will give blows in your Synagogues, driving them from town to town;",,,,,,,
19438,"So that on you may come all the blood of the upright on the earth, from the blood of upright Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you put to death between the Temple and the altar.",,,,,,,
19439,"Truly I say to you, All these things will come on this generation.",,,,,,,
19440,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, putting to death the prophets, and stoning those who are sent to her! Again and again would I have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings, and you would not!",,,,,,,
19441,"See, your house is made waste.",,,,,,,
19442,"For I say to you, You will not see me from this time till you say, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord.And Jesus went out of the Temple, and on the way his disciples came to him, pointing out the buildings of the Temple.",,,,,,,
19443,"But he, answering, said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you that here there will not be one stone resting on another, which will not be pulled down.",,,,,,,
19444,"And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Make clear to us, when will these things be? and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?",,,,,,,
19445,"And Jesus said to them in answer, Take care that you are not tricked.",,,,,,,
19446,"For people will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and a number will be turned from the true way through them.",,,,,,,
19447,"And news will come to you of wars and talk of wars: do not be troubled, for these things have to be; but it is still not the end.",,,,,,,
19448,"For nation will be moved against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and men will be without food, and the earth will be shaking in different places;",,,,,,,
19449,But all these things are the first of the troubles.,,,,,,,
19450,"Then they will be cruel to you, and will put you to death: and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.",,,,,,,
19451,"And numbers of people will be turned from the right way, and will give one another up and have hate for one another.",,,,,,,
19452,"And a number of false prophets will come, causing error.",,,,,,,
19453,"And because wrongdoing will be increased, the love of most people will become cold.",,,,,,,
19454,But he who goes through to the end will get salvation.,,,,,,,
19455,And this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations; and then the end will come.,,,,,,,
19456,"When, then, you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction, of which word was given by Daniel the prophet (let this be clear to the reader),",,,,,,,
19457,Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains:,,,,,,,
19458,Let not him who is on the house-top go down to take anything out of his house:,,,,,,,
19459,And let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat.,,,,,,,
19460,But it will be hard for women who are with child and for those with babies at the breast in those days.,,,,,,,
19461,"And say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath.",,,,,,,
19462,"Because in those days there will be great sorrow, such as there has not been from the start of the world till now, or ever will be.",,,,,,,
19463,"And if those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any, but because of the saints those days will be made short.",,,,,,,
19464,"Then if any man says to you, See, here is the Christ, or, Here; do not put faith in him;",,,,,,,
19465,"For there will come up false Christs, and false prophets, who will do great signs and wonders; so that if possible even the saints might be tricked.",,,,,,,
19466,"See, I have made it clear to you before it comes about.",,,,,,,
19467,"If, then, they say to you, See, he is in the waste land; go not out: See, he is in the inner rooms; put no faith in it.",,,,,,,
19468,Because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west; so will be the coming of the Son of man.,,,,,,,
19469,"Wherever the dead body is, there will the eagles come together.",,,,,,,
19470,"But straight away, after the trouble of those days, the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved:",,,,,,,
19471,"And then the sign of the Son of man will be seen in heaven: and then all the nations of the earth will have sorrow, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.",,,,,,,
19472,"And he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn, and they will get his saints together from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.",,,,,,,
19473,"Now take an example from the fig-tree: when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves, you are certain that the summer is near;",,,,,,,
19474,"Even so, when you see all these things, you may be certain that he is near, even at the doors.",,,,,,,
19475,"Truly I say to you, This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete.",,,,,,,
19476,"Heaven and earth will come to an end, but my words will not come to an end.",,,,,,,
19477,"But of that day and hour no one has knowledge, not even the angels in heaven, or the Son, but the Father only.",,,,,,,
19478,"And as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man.",,,,,,,
19479,"Because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters, they were feasting and taking wives and getting married, till the day when Noah went into the ark,",,,,,,,
19480,And they had no care till the waters came and took them all away; so will be the coming of the Son of man.,,,,,,,
19481,"Then two men will be in the field; one is taken, and one let go;",,,,,,,
19482,"Two women will be crushing grain; one is taken, and one let go.",,,,,,,
19483,"Be watching, then! for you have no knowledge on what day your Lord will come.",,,,,,,
19484,"But be certain of this, that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming, he would have been watching, and would not have let his house be broken into.",,,,,,,
19485,Be ready then; for at a time which you have no thought of the Son of man will come.,,,,,,,
19486,"Who is the true and wise servant, whom his lord has put over those in his house, to give them their food at the right time?",,,,,,,
19487,"A blessing on that servant, who will be doing so when his lord comes.",,,,,,,
19488,"Truly, I say to you, he will put him over all he has.",,,,,,,
19489,"But if that evil servant says in his heart, My lord is a long time in coming;",,,,,,,
19490,"And is cruel to the other servants, taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine;",,,,,,,
19491,"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not looking for him, and in an hour of which he has no knowledge,",,,,,,,
19492,"And will have him cut in two, and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, the friends of the bride, who took their lights, and went out with the pu",pose of meet,ng,h,hu,band,,
19493,"And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.",,,,,,,
19494,"For the foolish, when they took their lights, took no oil with them.",,,,,,,
19495,But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights.,,,,,,,
19496,"Now the husband was a long time in coming, and they all went to sleep.",,,,,,,
19497,"But in the middle of the night there is a cry, The husband comes! Go out to him.",,,,,,,
19498,"Then all those virgins got up, and made ready their lights.",,,,,,,
19499,"And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lights are going out.",,,,,,,
19500,"But the wise made answer, saying, There may not be enough for us and you; it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves.",,,,,,,
19501,"And while they went to get oil, the master came; and those who were ready went in with him to the feast: and the door was shut.",,,,,,,
19502,"After that the other virgins came, saying, Lord, Lord, let us in.",,,,,,,
19503,"But he made answer and said, Truly I say to you, I have no knowledge of you.",,,,,,,
19504,"Keep watch, then, because you are not certain of the day or of the hour.",,,,,,,
19505,"For it is as when a man, about to take a journey, got his servants together, and gave them his property.",,,,,,,
19506,"And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to everyone as he was able; and he went on his journey.",,,,,,,
19507,"Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them, and made five more.",,,,,,,
19508,In the same way he who had been given the two got two more.,,,,,,,
19509,"But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth, and kept his lord's money in a secret place.",,,,,,,
19510,"Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes up his account with them.",,,,,,,
19511,"And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents, saying, Lord, you gave into my care five talents: see, I have got five more.",,,,,,,
19512,"His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord.",,,,,,,
19513,"And he who had the two talents came and said, Lord, you gave into my care two talents: see, I have got two more.",,,,,,,
19514,"His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord.",,,,,,,
19515,"And he who had had the one talent came and said, Lord, I had knowledge that you are a hard man, getting in grain where you have not put seed, and making profits for which you have done no work:",,,,,,,
19516,"And I was in fear, and went away, and put your talent in the earth: here is what is yours.",,,,,,,
19517,"But his lord in answer said to him, You are a bad and unready servant; if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed, and make profits for which I have done no work,",,,,,,,
19518,"Why, then, did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest?",,,,,,,
19519,"Take away, then, his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents.",,,,,,,
19520,"For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have more: but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.",,,,,,,
19521,And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.,,,,,,,
19522,"But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he be seated in his glory:",,,,,,,
19523,"And before him all the nations will come together; and they will be parted one from another, as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper.",,,,,,,
19524,"And he will put the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.",,,,,,,
19525,"Then will the King say to those on his right, Come, you who have the blessing of my Father, into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was:",,,,,,,
19526,"For I was in need of food, and you gave it to me: I was in need of drink, and you gave it to me: I was wandering, and you took me in;",,,,,,,
19527,"I had no clothing, and you gave it to me: when I was ill, or in prison, you came to me.",,,,,,,
19528,"Then will the upright make answer to him, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food, and give it to you? or in need of drink, and give it to you?",,,,,,,
19529,"And when did we see you wandering, and take you in? or without clothing, and give it to you?",,,,,,,
19530,"And when did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you?",,,,,,,
19531,"And the King will make answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Because you did it to the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.",,,,,,,
19532,"Then will he say to those on the left, Go from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels:",,,,,,,
19533,"For I was in need of food, and you gave it not to me; I was in need of drink, and you gave it not to me:",,,,,,,
19534,"I was wandering, and you took me not in; without clothing, and you gave me no clothing; ill, and in prison, and you came not to me.",,,,,,,
19535,"Then will they make answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food or drink, or wandering, or without clothing, or ill, or in prison, and did not take care of you?",,,,,,,
19536,"Then will he make answer to them, saying, Truly I say to you, Because you did it not to the least of these, you did it not to me.",,,,,,,
19537,"And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the upright into eternal life.And when Jesus had come to the end of all these words, he said to his disciples,",,,,,,,
19538,"After two days is the Passover, and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross.",,,,,,,
19539,"Then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.",,,,,,,
19540,"And they made designs together to take Jesus by some trick, and put him to death.",,,,,,,
19541,"But they said, Not while the feast is going on, for fear of trouble among the people.",,,,,,,
19542,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,",,,,,,,
19543,"There came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price, and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table.",,,,,,,
19544,"But when the disciples saw it they were angry, saying, To what purpose is this waste?",,,,,,,
19545,For we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor.,,,,,,,
19546,"But Jesus, seeing it, said to them, Why are you troubling the woman? she has done a kind act to me.",,,,,,,
19547,"For the poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever.",,,,,,,
19548,"For in putting this perfume on my body, she did it to make me ready for my last resting-place.",,,,,,,
19549,"Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news goes out in all the world, what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her.",,,,,,,
19550,"Then one of the twelve, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,",,,,,,,
19551,"What will you give me, if I give him up to you? And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver.",,,,,,,
19552,And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands.,,,,,,,
19553,"Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal?",,,,,,,
19554,"And he said to them, Go into the town to such a man, and say to him, The Master says, My time is near: I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.",,,,,,,
19555,And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them; and they made ready the Passover.,,,,,,,
19556,"Now when evening was come, he was seated at table with the twelve disciples;",,,,,,,
19557,"And while they were taking food, he said, Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me.",,,,,,,
19558,"And they were very said, and said to him, one by one, Is it I, Lord?",,,,,,,
19559,"And he made answer and said, He who puts his hand into the plate with me, the same will be false to me.",,,,,,,
19560,"The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up; it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world.",,,,,,,
19561,"And Judas, who was false to him, made answer and said, Is it I, Master? He says to him, Yes.",,,,,,,
19562,"And when they were taking food, Jesus took bread and, after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said, Take it; this is my body.",,,,,,,
19563,"And he took a cup and, having given praise, he gave it to them, saying,",,,,,,,
19564,"Take of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the testament, which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins.",,,,,,,
19565,"But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I take it new with you in my Father's kingdom.",,,,,,,
19566,"And after a song of praise to God, they went out to the Mountain of Olives.",,,,,,,
19567,"Then said Jesus to them, All of you will be turned away from me this night: for it is said in the Writings, I will put to death the keeper of the sheep, and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight.",,,,,,,
19568,"But after I am come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.",,,,,,,
19569,"But Peter made answer and said to him, Though all may be turned away from you, I will never be turned away.",,,,,,,
19570,"Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the hour of the cock's cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.",,,,,,,
19571,"Peter says to him, Even if I am put to death with you, I will not be false to you. So said all the disciples.",,,,,,,
19572,"Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Be seated here, while I go over there for prayer.",,,,,,,
19573,"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became sad and very troubled.",,,,,,,
19574,"Then says he to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: keep watch with me here.",,,,,,,
19575,"And he went forward a little, and falling down on his face in prayer, he said, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup go from me; but let not my pleasure, but yours be done.",,,,,,,
19576,"And he comes to the disciples, and sees that they are sleeping, and says to Peter, What, were you not able to keep watch with me one hour?",,,,,,,
19577,"Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test: the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.",,,,,,,
19578,"Again, a second time he went away, and said in prayer, O my Father, if this may not go from me without my taking it, let your pleasure be done.",,,,,,,
19579,"And he came again and saw them sleeping, for their eyes were tired.",,,,,,,
19580,"And he went away from them again, and a third time said the same prayer.",,,,,,,
19581,"Then he comes to the disciples; and says to them, Go on sleeping now, and take your rest: for the hour is come, and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men.",,,,,,,
19582,"Up, let us be going: see, he who gives me up is near.",,,,,,,
19583,"And while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a band armed with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and those in authority over the people.",,,,,,,
19584,"Now the false one had given them a sign saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he: take him.",,,,,,,
19585,"And straight away he came to Jesus and said, Master! and gave him a kiss.",,,,,,,
19586,"And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that for which you have come. Then they came and put hands on Jesus, and took him.",,,,,,,
19587,"And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand, and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.",,,,,,,
19588,"Then says Jesus to him, Put up your sword again into its place: for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword.",,,,,,,
19589,Does it not seem possible to you that if I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels?,,,,,,,
19590,"But how then would the Writings come true, which say that so it has to be?",,,,,,,
19591,"In that hour Jesus said to the people, Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not.",,,,,,,
19592,But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true. Then all his disciples went from him in flight.,,,,,,,
19593,"And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together.",,,,,,,
19594,"But Peter went after him at a distance, to the house of the high priest, and went in and took his seat with the servants, to see the end.",,,,,,,
19595,"Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;",,,,,,,
19596,"And they were not able to get it, though a number of false witnesses came.",,,,,,,
19597,"But later there came two who said, This man said, I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction, and to put it up again in three days.",,,,,,,
19598,"And the high priest got up and said to him, Have you no answer? what is it which these say against you?",,,,,,,
19599,"But Jesus said not a word. And the high priest said to him, I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will say to us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.",,,,,,,
19600,"Jesus says to him, You say so: but I say to you, From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.",,,,,,,
19601,"Then the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, He has said evil against God: what more need have we of witnesses? for now his words against God have come to your ears:",,,,,,,
19602,"What is your opinion? They made answer and said, It is right for him to be put to death.",,,,,,,
19603,"Then they put shame on him, and were cruel to him: and some gave him blows, saying,",,,,,,,
19604,"Be a prophet, O Christ, and say who gave you a blow!",,,,,,,
19605,"Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house: and a servant-girl came to him, saying, You were with Jesus the Galilaean.",,,,,,,
19606,"But he said before them all that it was false, saying, I have no knowledge of what you say.",,,,,,,
19607,"And when he had gone out into the doorway, another saw him and says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.",,,,,,,
19608,"And again he said with an oath, I have no knowledge of the man.",,,,,,,
19609,"And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; because your talk is witness against you.",,,,,,,
19610,"Then with curses and oaths he said, I have no knowledge of the man. And straight away there came the cry of a cock.",,,,,,,
19611,"And the word of Jesus came back to Peter, when he said, Before the hour of the cock's cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And he went out, weeping bitterly.Now when it was morning, all the chief priests and those in authority",ook thought,oge,h,r w,th t,e p,rpose
19612,"And they put cords on him and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate, the ruler.",,,,,,,
19613,"Then Judas, who was false to him, seeing that he was to be put to death, in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority,",,,,,,,
19614,"Saying, I have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man. But they said, What is that to us? it is your business.",,,,,,,
19615,"And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out, and put himself to death by hanging.",,,,,,,
19616,"And the chief priests took the silver and said, It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood.",,,,,,,
19617,"And they made a decision to get with the silver the potter's field, as a place for the dead of other countries.",,,,,,,
19618,"For this cause that field was named, The field of blood, to this day.",,,,,,,
19619,"Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet, And they took the thirty bits of silver, the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel;",,,,,,,
19620,"And they gave them for the potter's field, as I had word from the Lord.",,,,,,,
19621,"And Jesus was before the ruler, who put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say so.",,,,,,,
19622,"But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.",,,,,,,
19623,"Then says Pilate to him, Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?",,,,,,,
19624,"And he gave him no answer, not even a word: so that the ruler was greatly surprised.",,,,,,,
19625,"Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner, at their selection.",,,,,,,
19626,"And they had then an important prisoner, whose name was Barabbas.",,,,,,,
19627,"So when they came together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you have? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is named Christ?",,,,,,,
19628,For he saw that for envy they had given him up.,,,,,,,
19629,"And while he was on the judge's seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that upright man, for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.",,,,,,,
19630,"Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.",,,,,,,
19631,"But the ruler made answer and said to them, Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free? And they said, Barabbas.",,,,,,,
19632,"Pilate says to them, What, then, am I to do with Jesus, who is named Christ? They all say, Let him be put to death on the cross.",,,,,,,
19633,"And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they gave loud cries, saying, To the cross with him!",,,,,,,
19634,"So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing, but that trouble was working up, he took water and, washing his hands before the people, said, The blood of this upright man is not on my hands: you are responsible.",,,,,,,
19635,"And all the people made answer and said, Let his blood be on us, and on our children.",,,,,,,
19636,"Then he let Barabbas go free: but after having Jesus whipped, he gave him up to be put to death on the cross.",,,,,,,
19637,"Then the ruler's armed men took Jesus into the open square, and got all their band together.",,,,,,,
19638,"And they took off his clothing, and put on him a red robe.",,,,,,,
19639,"And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a rod in his right hand, and they went down on their knees before him, and made sport of him, saying, Long life to the King of the Jews.",,,,,,,
19640,"And they put shame on him, and gave him blows on the head with the rod.",,,,,,,
19641,"And when they had made sport of him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothing on him, and took him away to put him on the cross.",,,,,,,
19642,"And while they were coming out, they saw a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they made him go with them, so that he might take up his cross.",,,,,,,
19643,"And when they came to the place named Golgotha, that is to say, Dead Man's Head,",,,,,,,
19644,"They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink: and after tasting it, he took no more.",,,,,,,
19645,"And when they had put him on the cross, they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.",,,,,,,
19646,And they were seated there watching him.,,,,,,,
19647,"And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.",,,,,,,
19648,"Then two thieves were put on crosses with him, one on the right and one on the left.",,,,,,,
19649,"And those who went by said bitter words to him, shaking their heads and saying,",,,,,,,
19650,"You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days, get yourself free: if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.",,,,,,,
19651,"In the same way, the chief priests, making sport of him, with the scribes and those in authority, said,",,,,,,,
19652,"A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will have faith in him.",,,,,,,
19653,"He put his faith in God; let God be his saviour now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.",,,,,,,
19654,And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him.,,,,,,,
19655,Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.,,,,,,,
19656,"And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?",,,,,,,
19657,"And some of those who were near by, hearing it, said, This man is crying to Elijah.",,,,,,,
19658,"And straight away one of them went quickly, and took a sponge, and made it full of bitter wine, and put it on a rod and gave him drink.",,,,,,,
19659,"And the rest said, Let him be; let us see if Elijah will come to his help.",,,,,,,
19660,"And Jesus gave another loud cry, and gave up his spirit.",,,,,,,
19661,And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end; and there was an earth-shock; and the rocks were broken;,,,,,,,
19662,And the resting-places of the dead came open; and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life;,,,,,,,
19663,"And coming out of their resting-places, after he had come again from the dead, they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people.",,,,,,,
19664,"Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earth-shock and the things which were done, were in great fear and said, Truly this was a son of God.",,,,,,,
19665,"And a number of women were there, watching from a distance, who had come with Jesus from Galilee, waiting on his needs.",,,,,,,
19666,"Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.",,,,,,,
19667,"And in the evening, there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea, Joseph by name, who was a disciple of Jesus:",,,,,,,
19668,"This man went in to Pilate, and made a request for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate gave orders for it to be given to him.",,,,,,,
19669,"And Joseph took the body, folding it in clean linen,",,,,,,,
19670,And put it in the resting-place which had been cut out of the rock for himself; and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away.,,,,,,,
19671,"And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, seated by the place of the dead.",,,,,,,
19672,"Now on the day after the getting ready of the Passover, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,",,,,,,,
19673,"Saying, Sir, we have in mind how that false man said, while he was still living, After three days I will come again from the dead.",,,,,,,
19674,"Give orders, then, that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day, for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people, He has come back from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.",,,,,,,
19675,"Pilate said to them, You have watchmen; go and make it as safe as you are able.",,,,,,,
19676,"So they went, and made safe the place where his body was, putting a stamp on the stone, and the watchmen were with them.Now late on the Sabbath, when the dawn of the first day of the week was near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place",here his bod,wa,.,,,,
19677,"And there was a great earth-shock; for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, rolling back the stone, took his seat on it.",,,,,,,
19678,"His form was shining like the light, and his clothing was white as snow:",,,,,,,
19679,"And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking, and became as dead men.",,,,,,,
19680,"And the angel said to the women, Have no fear: for I see that you are searching for Jesus, who was put to death on the cross.",,,,,,,
19681,"He is not here, for he has come to life again, evenashesaid. Come, seetheLord'sresting-place.",,,,,,,
19682,"Andgoquicklyandgivehisdisciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you.",,,,,,,
19683,"And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news.",,,,,,,
19684,"And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship.",,,,,,,
19685,"Then said Jesus to them, Have no fear: go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they will see me.",,,,,,,
19686,"Now, while they were going, some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place.",,,,,,,
19687,"And when they had come together with those in authority, and had made their decision, they gave much money to the watchmen, saying,",,,,,,,
19688,"Say, His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping.",,,,,,,
19689,"And if this comes to the ruler's ears, we will see that he does not make you responsible.",,,,,,,
19690,"So they took the money, and did as they had been ordered: and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time.",,,,,,,
19691,"But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go.",,,,,,,
19692,And when they saw him they gave him worship: but some were in doubt.,,,,,,,
19693,"And Jesus came to them and said, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.",,,,,,,
19694,"Go then, and make disciples of all the nations, giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:",,,,,,,
19695,"Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world.The first words of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",,,,,,,
19696,"Even as it is said in the book of Isaiah the prophet, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way;",,,,,,,
19697,"The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight;",,,,,,,
19698,"John came, and gave baptism in the waste land, preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed.",,,,,,,
19699,"And there went out to him all the people of Judaea, and all those of Jerusalem, and they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying that they were sinners.",,,,,,,
19700,"And John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey.",,,,,,,
19701,"And he said to them all, There is one coming after me who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo.",,,,,,,
19702,"I have given you baptism with water, but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
19703,"And it came about in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was given baptism by John in the Jordan.",,,,,,,
19704,"And straight away, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens broken open and the Spirit coming down on him as a dove:",,,,,,,
19705,"And a voice came out of heaven, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.",,,,,,,
19706,And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land.,,,,,,,
19707,"And he was in the waste land for forty days, being tested by Satan; and he was with the beasts; and the angels took care of him.",,,,,,,
19708,"Now after John had been put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God,",,,,,,,
19709,"And saying, The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near: let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news.",,,,,,,
19710,"And going by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, the brother of Simon, putting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.",,,,,,,
19711,"And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.",,,,,,,
19712,"And they went straight from their nets, and came after him.",,,,,,,
19713,"And going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat stitching up their nets.",,,,,,,
19714,"And he said, Come after me: and they went away from their father Zebedee, who was in the boat with the servants, and came after him.",,,,,,,
19715,And they came to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching.,,,,,,,
19716,"And they were full of wonder at his teaching, because he gave it as one having authority, and not like the scribes.",,,,,,,
19717,"And there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he gave a cry,",,,,,,,
19718,"Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to put an end to us? I see well who you are, the Holy One of God.",,,,,,,
19719,"And Jesus said to him sharply, Be quiet, and come out of him.",,,,,,,
19720,"And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.",,,,,,,
19721,"And they were all greatly surprised, so that they put questions to one another, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they do what he says.",,,,,,,
19722,And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about.,,,,,,,
19723,"And when they came out of the Synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.",,,,,,,
19724,"Now Simon's wife's mother was ill, with a burning heat; and they gave him word of her:",,,,,,,
19725,"And he came and took her by the hand, lifting her up; and she became well, and took care of their needs.",,,,,,,
19726,"And in the evening, at sundown, they took to him all who were diseased, and those who had evil spirits.",,,,,,,
19727,And all the town had come together at the door.,,,,,,,
19728,"And a number, who were ill with different diseases, he made well, and sent out evil spirits; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything, because they had knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
19729,"And in the morning, a long time before daylight, he got up and went out to a quiet place, and there he gave himself up to prayer.",,,,,,,
19730,And Simon and those who were with him came after him.,,,,,,,
19731,"And when they came up with him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you.",,,,,,,
19732,"And he said to them, Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns, so that I may give teaching there, because for this purpose I came.",,,,,,,
19733,"And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.",,,,,,,
19734,"And a leper came to him and, going down on his knees before him, made a request, saying, If it is your pleasure, you have the power to make me clean.",,,,,,,
19735,"And being moved with pity, he put out his hand, and touching him said to him, It is my pleasure; be made clean.",,,,,,,
19736,"And straight away the disease went from him, and he was made clean.",,,,,,,
19737,"And he sent him away, saying to him very sharply,",,,,,,,
19738,"See that you say nothing to any man: but go and let the priest see you, and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses, for a witness to them.",,,,,,,
19739,"But he went out, and made it public, giving an account of it everywhere, so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town, but was outside in the waste land; and they came to him from every part.And when he came into Capernaum again after some d","ys, the news",wen,,bou,tha,he,was i
19740,"And a great number had come together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he gave them teaching.",,,,,,,
19741,And four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving.,,,,,,,
19742,"And when they were unable to get near him because of all the people, they got the roof uncovered where he was: and when it was broken up, they let down the bed on which the man was.",,,,,,,
19743,"And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to him, Son, you have forgiveness for your sins.",,,,,,,
19744,"But there were certain of the scribes seated there, and reasoning in their hearts,",,,,,,,
19745,Why does this man say such things? he has no respect for God: from whom does forgiveness come but from God only?,,,,,,,
19746,"And Jesus, having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?",,,,,,,
19747,"Which is the simpler, to say to a man who is ill, You have forgiveness for your sins, or, Get up, take up your bed, and go?",,,,,,,
19748,"But so that you may see that the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth, (he said to the man,)",,,,,,,
19749,"I say to you, Get up, take up your bed, and go to your house.",,,,,,,
19750,"And he got up, and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all, so that they were all full of wonder, and gave glory to God, saying, We have never seen anything like this.",,,,,,,
19751,"And he went out again by the seaside; and all the people came to him, and he gave them teaching.",,,,,,,
19752,"And when he went by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and he said to him, Come with me. And he got up, and went with him.",,,,,,,
19753,"And it came about that he was seated at meat in his house, and a number of tax-farmers and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples: for there were a great number of them, and they came after him.",,,,,,,
19754,"And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was taking food with the tax-farmers and sinners, said to his disciples, Why does he take food and drink with such men?",,,,,,,
19755,"And Jesus, hearing it, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill: I have come not to get the upright but sinners.",,,,,,,
19756,"And John's disciples and the Pharisees were taking no food: and they came and said to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees go without food, but your disciples do not?",,,,,,,
19757,"And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of a newly-married man go without food while he is with them? as long as they have him with them they will not go without food.",,,,,,,
19758,"But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.",,,,,,,
19759,"No man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat: or the new, by pulling away from the old, makes a worse hole.",,,,,,,
19760,"And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins: or the skins will be burst by the wine, and the wine and the skins will be wasted: but new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.",,,,,,,
19761,"And it came about that on the Sabbath day he was going through the grain-fields; and while they were walking, his disciples took the heads of grain.",,,,,,,
19762,"And the Pharisees said to him, Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?",,,,,,,
19763,"And he said to them, Have you no knowledge of what David did, when he had need and was without food, he, and those who were with him?",,,,,,,
19764,"How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?",,,,,,,
19765,"And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;",,,,,,,
19766,So that the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.And he went again into the Synagogue; and there was a man there whose hand was dead.,,,,,,,
19767,"And they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath day, so that they might have something against him.",,,,,,,
19768,"And he said to the man, Get up and come forward.",,,,,,,
19769,"And he said to them, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to put to death? But they said nothing.",,,,,,,
19770,"And looking round on them he was angry, being sad because of their hard hearts; and he said to the man, Put out your hand. And he put it out, and his hand was made well.",,,,,,,
19771,"And the Pharisees went out, and straight away made designs with the Herodians about how they might put him to death.",,,,,,,
19772,"And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great number from Galilee came after him: and from Judaea,",,,,,,,
19773,"And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and the other side of Jordan, and the country about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing what great things he did, came to him.",,,,,,,
19774,"And he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him, so that he might not be crushed by the people;",,,,,,,
19775,For he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him.,,,,,,,
19776,"And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, went down before him, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God.",,,,,,,
19777,And he gave them special orders not to say who he was.,,,,,,,
19778,"And he went up into the mountain, and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him: and they went to him.",,,,,,,
19779,"And he took twelve to be with him, so that he might send them out as preachers,",,,,,,,
19780,And give them the power of driving out evil spirits:,,,,,,,
19781,To Simon he gave the second name of Peter;,,,,,,,
19782,"And to James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, he gave the second name of Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:",,,,,,,
19783,"And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;",,,,,,,
19784,"And Judas Iscariot, who was false to him.",,,,,,,
19785,"And he went into a house. And the people came together again, so that they were not even able to take bread.",,,,,,,
19786,"And when his friends had news of it, they went out to get him, saying, He is off his head.",,,,,,,
19787,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men.",,,,,,,
19788,"And turning to them, he said to them in the form of a story, How is it possible for Satan to put out Satan?",,,,,,,
19789,"If there is division in a kingdom, that kingdom will come to destruction;",,,,,,,
19790,"And if there is division in a house, that house will come to destruction;",,,,,,,
19791,"And if Satan is at war with himself, and there is division in him, he will not keep his place but will come to an end.",,,,,,,
19792,"But no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods, without first putting cords round the strong man, and then he will take his goods.",,,,,,,
19793,"Truly, I say to you, The sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say:",,,,,,,
19794,"But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but the evil he has done will be with him for ever:",,,,,,,
19795,"Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.",,,,,,,
19796,"And his mother and brothers came and were outside, and sent for him, requesting to see him.",,,,,,,
19797,"And a great number were seated round him; and they said to him, See, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.",,,,,,,
19798,"And he said in answer, Who are my mother and my brothers?",,,,,,,
19799,"And looking round at those who were seated about him, he said, See, my mother and my brothers!",,,,,,,
19800,"Whoever does God's pleasure, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.And again he was teaching by the seaside. And a very great number of people had come to him, so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat; and all the people were on t",e land by th,se,s,de.,,,
19801,"And he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories, and said to them in his teaching, Give ear:",,,,,,,
19802,A man went out to put seed in the earth:,,,,,,,
19803,"And while he was doing it, some was dropped by the wayside, and the birds came and took it for food.",,,,,,,
19804,"And some went on the stones, where it had not much earth; and it came up straight away, because the earth was not deep:",,,,,,,
19805,"And when the sun was high, it was burned; and because it had no root, it became dry and dead.",,,,,,,
19806,"And some went among the thorns, and the thorns came up, and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit.",,,,,,,
19807,"And some, falling on good earth, gave fruit, coming up and increasing, and giving thirty, sixty, and a hundred times as much.",,,,,,,
19808,"And he said to them, Whoever has ears, let him give ear.",,,,,,,
19809,"And when he was by himself, those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories.",,,,,,,
19810,"And he said to them, To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are given in the form of stories;",,,,,,,
19811,"So that seeing they may see, and it will not be clear to them; and hearing it, they will not get the sense; for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness.",,,,,,,
19812,"And he said to them, If you are not clear about this story, how will you be clear about the others?",,,,,,,
19813,The seed is the word.,,,,,,,
19814,"And these are they by the wayside, where the word is planted; and when they have given ear, the Evil One comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them.",,,,,,,
19815,"And in the same way, these are they who are planted on the stones, who, when the word has come to their ears, straight away take it with joy;",,,,,,,
19816,"And they have no root in themselves, but go on for a time; then, when trouble comes or pain, because of the word, they quickly become full of doubts.",,,,,,,
19817,"And others are those planted among the thorns; these are they who have given ear to the word,",,,,,,,
19818,"And the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, and the desire for other things coming in, put a stop to the growth of the word, and it gives no fruit.",,,,,,,
19819,"And these are they who were planted on the good earth; such as give ear to the word, and take it into their hearts, and give fruit, thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much.",,,,,,,
19820,"And he said to them, When the light comes in, do people put it under a vessel, or under the bed, and not on its table?",,,,,,,
19821,"There is nothing covered which will not be seen openly, and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light.",,,,,,,
19822,"If any man has ears, let him give ear.",,,,,,,
19823,"And he said to them, Take care what you give ear to: in the same measure as you give you will get, and more will be given to you.",,,,,,,
19824,"He who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.",,,,,,,
19825,"And he said, Such is the kingdom of God, as if a man put seed in the earth,",,,,,,,
19826,"And went to sleep and got up, night and day, and the seed came to growth, though he had no idea how.",,,,,,,
19827,"The earth gives fruit by herself; first the leaf, then the head, then the full grain.",,,,,,,
19828,"But when the grain is ready, he quickly sends men to get it cut, because the time for cutting has come.",,,,,,,
19829,"And he said, What picture may we give of the kingdom of God, or with what story may we make it clear?",,,,,,,
19830,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is put in the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth,",,,,,,,
19831,"But when it is planted, it comes up, and becomes taller than all the plants, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade.",,,,,,,
19832,"And with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching, as they were able to take it:",,,,,,,
19833,And without a story he said nothing to them: but privately to his disciples he made all things clear.,,,,,,,
19834,"And on that day, when the evening had come, he said to them, Let us go over to the other side.",,,,,,,
19835,"And going away from the people, they took him with them, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.",,,,,,,
19836,"And a great storm of wind came up, and the waves came into the boat, so that the boat was now becoming full.",,,,,,,
19837,"And he himself was in the back of the boat, sleeping on the cushion: and they, awaking him, said, Master, is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?",,,,,,,
19838,"And he came out of his sleep, and gave strong orders to the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be at rest. And the wind went down, and there was a great calm.",,,,,,,
19839,"And he said to them, Why are you full of fear? have you still no faith?",,,,,,,
19840,"And their fear was great, and they said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea do his orders?And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.",,,,,,,
19841,"And when he had got out of the boat, straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit.",,,,,,,
19842,"He was living in the place of the dead: and no man was able to keep him down, no, not with a chain;",,,,,,,
19843,"Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands, and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him: and no man was strong enough to make him quiet.",,,,,,,
19844,"And all the time, by day and by night, in the place of the dead, and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.",,,,,,,
19845,"And when he saw Jesus from far off, he went quickly to him and gave him worship;",,,,,,,
19846,"And crying out with a loud voice he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name, do not be cruel to me.",,,,,,,
19847,"For Jesus had said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.",,,,,,,
19848,"And Jesus said, What is your name? And he made answer, My name is Legion, because there are a great number of us.",,,,,,,
19849,And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country.,,,,,,,
19850,Now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food.,,,,,,,
19851,"And they said to him, Send us into the pigs, so that we may go into them.",,,,,,,
19852,"And he let them do it. And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they came to their death in the sea.",,,,,,,
19853,And their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country. And people came to see what had taken place.,,,,,,,
19854,"And they came to Jesus, and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, and they were full of fear.",,,,,,,
19855,"And those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits, and of the fate of the pigs.",,,,,,,
19856,And they made a request to him to go out of their country.,,,,,,,
19857,"And when he was getting into the boat, the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him.",,,,,,,
19858,"And he would not let him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.",,,,,,,
19859,"And he went on his way, and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men were full of wonder.",,,,,,,
19860,"And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side, a great number of people came to him: and he was by the sea.",,,,,,,
19861,"And one of the rulers of the Synagogue, Jairus by name, came, and seeing him, went down at his feet,",,,,,,,
19862,"And made strong prayers to him, saying, My little daughter is near to death: it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and have life.",,,,,,,
19863,"And he went with him; and a great number of people went after him, and came round him.",,,,,,,
19864,"And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,",,,,,,,
19865,"And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men, and had given all she had, and was no better, but even worse,",,,,,,,
19866,"When she had news of the things which Jesus did, went among the people coming after him, and put her hand on his robe.",,,,,,,
19867,"For she said, If I may only put my hand on his robe, I will be made well.",,,,,,,
19868,"And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped, and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well.",,,,,,,
19869,"And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him; and, turning to the people, he said, Who was touching my robe?",,,,,,,
19870,"And his disciples said to him, You see the people round you on every side, and you say, Who was touching me?",,,,,,,
19871,"And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing,",,,,,,,
19872,"The woman, shaking with fear, conscious of what had been done to her, came and, falling on her face before him, gave him a true account of everything.",,,,,,,
19873,"And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be free from your disease.",,,,,,,
19874,"And while he was still talking, they came from the ruler of the Synagogue's house, saying, Your daughter is dead: why are you still troubling the Master?",,,,,,,
19875,"But Jesus, giving no attention to their words, said to the ruler of the Synagogue, Have no fear, only have faith.",,,,,,,
19876,"And he did not let anyone come with him, but Peter and James and John, the brother of James.",,,,,,,
19877,"And they came to the house of the ruler of the Synagogue; and he saw people running this way and that, and weeping and crying loudly.",,,,,,,
19878,"And when he had gone in, he said to them, Why are you making such a noise and weeping? The child is not dead, but sleeping.",,,,,,,
19879,"And they were laughing at him. But he, having sent them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.",,,,,,,
19880,"And taking her by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, My child, I say to you, Get up.",,,,,,,
19881,"And the young girl got up straight away, and was walking about; she being twelve years old. And they were overcome with wonder.",,,,,,,
19882,"And he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this; and he said that some food was to be given to her.And he went away from there, and came into his country; and his disciples went with him.",,,,,,,
19883,"And when the Sabbath day had come, he was teaching in the Synagogue; and a number of people hearing him were surprised, saying, From where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom given to this man, and what are these works of power done by",his hands?,,,,,,
19884,"Is not this the woodworker, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were bitter against him.",,,,,,,
19885,"And Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour, but in his country, and among his relations, and in his family.",,,,,,,
19886,"And he was unable to do any work of power there, but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill, and make them well.",,,,,,,
19887,And he was greatly surprised because they had no faith. And he went about the country places teaching.,,,,,,,
19888,"And he gave orders to the twelve, and sent them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;",,,,,,,
19889,"And he said that they were to take nothing for their journey, but a stick only; no bread, no bag, no money in their pockets;",,,,,,,
19890,"They were to go with common shoes on their feet, and not to take two coats.",,,,,,,
19891,"And he said to them, Wherever you go into a house, make that your resting-place till you go away.",,,,,,,
19892,"And whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you, when you go away, put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them.",,,,,,,
19893,"And they went out, preaching the need for a change of heart in men.",,,,,,,
19894,"And they sent out a number of evil spirits, and put oil on a great number who were ill, and made them well.",,,,,,,
19895,"And king Herod had news of him, because his name was on the lips of all; and he said, John the Baptist has come back from the dead, and for this reason these powers are working in him.",,,,,,,
19896,"But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even like one of the prophets.",,,,,,,
19897,"But Herod, when he had news of it, said, John, whom I put to death, has come back from the dead.",,,,,,,
19898,"For Herod himself had sent men out to take John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had taken for himself.",,,,,,,
19899,"For John said to Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brother's wife.",,,,,,,

19941,"And the Pharisees and the scribes put the question to him, Why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers, but take their bread with unwashed hands?",,,,,,,
19942,"And he said, Well did Isaiah say of you, you false ones: These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",,,,,,,
19943,"But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men.",,,,,,,
19944,"For, turning away from the law of God, you keep the rules of men.",,,,,,,
19945,"And he said to them, Truly you put on one side the law of God, so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you.",,,,,,,
19946,"For Moses said, Give honour to your father and mother, and, He who says evil of father or mother, let him have the punishment of death:",,,,,,,

19954,"And he said to them, Have even you so little wisdom? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean,",,,,,,,
19955,"Because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach, and goes out with the waste? He said this, making all food clean.",,,,,,,
19956,"And he said, That which comes out of the man, that makes the man unclean.",,,,,,,
19957,"Because from inside, from the heart of men, come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures,",,,,,,,

20020,"And they put a question to him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?",,,,,,,

20104,"And they came to Jericho: and when he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great number of people, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind man, was seated by the wayside, with his hand out for money.",,,,,,,
20105,"And when it came to his ears that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he gave a cry, and said, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.",,,,,,,
20106,"And some of them, turning in protest, gave him an order to be quiet: but he went on crying out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.",,,,,,,
20107,"And Jesus came to a stop and said, Let him come. And crying out to the blind man, they said to him, Be comforted: come, he has sent for you.",,,,,,,
20108,"And he, putting off his coat, got up quickly, and came to Jesus.",,,,,,,
20109,"And Jesus said to him, What would you have me do to you? And the blind man said, Master, make me able to see.",,,,,,,
20110,"And Jesus said to him, Go on your way; your faith has made you well. And straight away he was able to see, and went after him in the way.And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Beth-phage and Bethany, at the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of his discip","es,",,,,,,
20111,"And said to them, Go into the little town opposite: and when you come to it, you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose, and come back with him.",,,,,,,
20112,"And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away.",,,,,,,
20113,And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street; and they were getting him loose.,,,,,,,
20114,"And some of those who were there said to them, What are you doing, taking the ass?",,,,,,,
20115,And they said to them the words which Jesus had said; and they let them go.,,,,,,,
20116,"And they took the young ass to Jesus, and put their clothing on him, and he got on his back.",,,,,,,
20117,And a great number put down their clothing in the way; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields.,,,,,,,
20118,"And those who went in front, and those who came after, were crying, Glory: A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord:",,,,,,,
20119,A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David: Glory in the highest.,,,,,,,
20120,"And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple; and after looking round about on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.",,,,,,,
20121,"And on the day after, when they had come out from Bethany, he was in need of food.",,,,,,,
20122,"And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves, he went to see if by chance it had anything on it: and when he came to it, he saw nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for the fruit.",,,,,,,
20123,"And he said to it, Let no man take fruit from you for ever. And his disciples took note of his words.",,,,,,,
20124,"And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money;",,,,,,,
20125,And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple.,,,,,,,
20126,"And he gave them teaching, and said to them, Is it not in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a hole of thieves.",,,,,,,
20127,"And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes, and they took thought how they might put him to death; being in fear of him, because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching.",,,,,,,
20128,And every evening he went out of the town.,,,,,,,
20129,"And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots.",,,,,,,
20130,"And Peter, having a memory of it, said to him, Master, see, the tree which was cursed by you is dead.",,,,,,,
20131,"And Jesus, answering, said to them, Have God's faith.",,,,,,,
20132,"Truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be put into the sea; and has no doubt in his heart, but has faith that what he says will come about, he will have his desire.",,,,,,,
20133,"For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.",,,,,,,

20136,"And they came again to Jerusalem: and while he was walking in the Temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority:",,,,,,,
20137,"And they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? or who gave you authority to do these things?",,,,,,,
20138,"And Jesus said to them, I will put to you one question; give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.",,,,,,,
20139,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer.",,,,,,,
20140,"And they gave thought to it among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not have faith in him?",,,,,,,
20141,"But if we say, From men — they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet.",,,,,,,
20142,"And they said in answer to Jesus, We have no idea. And Jesus said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.And he gave them teaching in the form of stories. A man had a vine-garden planted, and put a wall about it, and made",place for c,ush,n,ou,the,win,", and"
20143,"And when the time came, he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden.",,,,,,,
20144,"And they took him, and gave him blows, and sent him away with nothing.",,,,,,,
20145,"And again he sent to them another servant; and they gave him wounds on the head, and were very cruel to him.",,,,,,,
20146,"And he sent another; and they put him to death: and a number of others, whipping some, and putting some to death.",,,,,,,
20147,"He still had one, a dearly loved son: he sent him last to them, saying, They will have respect for my son.",,,,,,,
20148,"But those workmen said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death, and the heritage will be ours.",,,,,,,
20149,"And they took him and put him to death, pushing his body out of the garden.",,,,,,,
20150,"What then will the master of the garden do? He will come and put the workmen to death, and will give the garden into the hands of others.",,,,,,,
20151,"Have you not seen this which is in the Writings: The stone which the builders put on one side, the same was made the chief stone of the building:",,,,,,,
20152,"This was the Lord's doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes?",,,,,,,
20153,"And they made attempts to take him; but they were in fear of the people, because they saw that the story was against them; and they went away from him.",,,,,,,
20154,"Then they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and the Herodians, so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick.",,,,,,,
20155,"And when they had come, they said to him, Master, we are certain that you are true, and have no fear of anyone: you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God: Is it right to give taxes to Caesar or not?",,,,,,,
20156,"Are we to give or not to give? But he, conscious of their false hearts, said to them, Why do you put me to the test? give me a penny, so that I may see it.",,,,,,,
20157,"And they gave him one. And he said to them, Whose is this image and name on it? And they said to him, Caesar's.",,,,,,,
20158,"And Jesus said to them, Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's. And they were full of wonder at him.",,,,,,,
20159,"And there came to him Sadducees, who say there is no coming back from the dead; and they put a question to him, saying,",,,,,,,
20160,"Master, in the law Moses says, If a man's brother comes to his end, and has a wife still living and no child, it is right for his brother to take his wife, and get a family for his brother.",,,,,,,
20161,"There were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and at his death there were no offspring;",,,,,,,
20162,"And the second took her, and at his death there were no offspring; and the third the same:",,,,,,,
20163,And all the seven had no seed. Last of all the woman herself came to her death.,,,,,,,
20164,"In the future life, when they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for the seven had her for a wife.",,,,,,,
20165,"Jesus said to them, Is not this the reason for your error, that you have no knowledge of the holy Writings or of the power of God?",,,,,,,
20166,"When they come back from the dead, they do not get married, but are like the angels in heaven.",,,,,,,
20167,"But as to the dead coming back to life; have you not seen in the book of Moses, about the burning thorn-tree, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?",,,,,,,
20168,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you are greatly in error.",,,,,,,
20169,"And one of the scribes came, and hearing their argument together, and seeing that he had given them a good answer, put the question to him, Which law is the first of all?",,,,,,,
20170,"Jesus said in answer, The first is, Give ear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord;",,,,,,,
20171,"And you are to have love for the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.",,,,,,,
20172,"The second is this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. There is no other law greater than these.",,,,,,,
20173,"And the scribe said to him, Truly, Master, you have well said that he is one, and there is no other but he:",,,,,,,
20174,"And to have love for him with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself, is much more than all forms of offerings.",,,,,,,
20175,"And when Jesus saw that he gave a wise answer, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more.",,,,,,,
20176,"And Jesus, when he was teaching in the Temple, said, How do the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?",,,,,,,
20177,"David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put those who are against you under your feet.",,,,,,,
20178,David himself gives him the name of Lord; and how then is he his son? And the common people gave ear to him gladly.,,,,,,,
20179,"And in his teaching he said, Be on your watch against the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and be respected in the market-places,",,,,,,,
20180,And to have the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts;,,,,,,,
20181,"Who take away the property of widows, and before the eyes of men make long prayers; these will be judged more hardly.",,,,,,,
20182,"And he took a seat by the place where the money was kept, and saw how the people put money into the boxes: and a number who had wealth put in much.",,,,,,,
20183,"And there came a poor widow, and she put in two little bits of money, which make a farthing.",,,,,,,
20184,"And he made his disciples come to him, and said to them, Truly I say to you, This poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box:",,,,,,,
20185,"Because they all put in something out of what they had no need for; but she out of her need put in all she had, even all her living.And when he was going out of the Temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see, what stones and what buildings!",,,,,,,
20186,"And Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? there is not one stone here resting on another which will not be overturned.",,,,,,,
20187,"And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives opposite the Temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew said to him privately,",,,,,,,
20188,"Say when these things will be, and what will be the sign when these things are all about to be done.",,,,,,,
20189,"And Jesus said to them, Take care that you are not tricked by anyone.",,,,,,,
20190,"People will come in my name, saying, I am he; and a number will be turned from the true way.",,,,,,,
20191,"And when you have news of wars and talk of wars, do not be troubled; these things have to be, but it is still not the end.",,,,,,,
20192,"Nation will go to war with nation, and kingdom with kingdom: there will be earth- shocks in different places; there will be times when there is no food; these things are the first of the troubles.",,,,,,,
20193,"But take care: for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins; and in Synagogues you will be whipped; and you will be taken before rulers and kings because of me, for a sign to them.",,,,,,,
20194,And the good news has first to be given to all the nations.,,,,,,,
20195,"And when you are taken and given up to be judged, do not be troubled about what to say: but whatever is given to you in that hour, say: because it is not you who say it, but the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
20196,"And brother will give up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will go against their fathers and mothers, and put them to death.",,,,,,,
20197,"And you will be hated by all men, because of my name; but he who goes through to the end will have salvation.",,,,,,,
20198,"But when you see the unclean thing which makes destruction, in the place where it has no right to be (let this be clear to the reader), then let those who are in Judaea go quickly to the mountains:",,,,,,,
20199,"And let him who is on the house-top not go down, or go in, to take anything out of his house:",,,,,,,
20200,And let not him who is in the field go back to take his coat.,,,,,,,
20201,And it will be hard for women who are with child and for her who has a baby at the breast in those days.,,,,,,,
20202,And say a prayer that it may not be in the winter.,,,,,,,
20203,"For in those days there will be sorrow, such as there has not been from the time when God made the world till now, and will not ever be again.",,,,,,,
20204,"And if the Lord had not made the time short, no flesh would have been kept from destruction; but because of the saints he has made the time short.",,,,,,,
20205,"And then if any man says to you, See, here is Christ; or, See, there; have no faith in it:",,,,,,,
20206,"Because there will be false Christs and false prophets, and they will give signs and wonders in the hope of turning even the saints from the true way.",,,,,,,
20207,"But take care; see, I have made all things clear to you before the time.",,,,,,,
20208,"But in those days, after that time of trouble, the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light,",,,,,,,
20209,"And the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers which are in the heavens will be moved.",,,,,,,
20210,And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.,,,,,,,
20211,"And then he will send out the angels, and will get together his saints from the four winds, from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven.",,,,,,,
20212,"Take an example from the fig-tree: when its branches become soft and put out their leaves, you see that the summer is near;",,,,,,,
20213,"Even so, when you see these things taking place, you may be certain that he is near, even at the doors.",,,,,,,
20214,"Truly, I say to you, This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete.",,,,,,,
20215,"Heaven and earth will come to an end, but my words will not come to an end.",,,,,,,
20216,"But of that day or that hour no one has knowledge, not even the angels in heaven, or the Son, but the Father.",,,,,,,
20217,"Take care, keep watch with prayer: for you are not certain when the time will be.",,,,,,,
20218,"It is as when a man who is in another country for a time, having gone away from his house, and given authority to his servants and to everyone his work, gives the porter an order to keep watch.",,,,,,,
20219,"So you are to keep watch: because you are not certain when the master of the house is coming, in the evening, or in the middle of the night, or at the cock's cry, or in the morning;",,,,,,,
20220,"For fear that, coming suddenly, he sees you sleeping.",,,,,,,
20221,"And what I say to you, I say to all, Keep watch.It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes made designs how they might take him by deceit and put him to death:",,,,,,,
20222,"But they said, Not while the feast is going on, for fear there may be trouble among the people.",,,,,,,
20223,"And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, seated at table, there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price; and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head.",,,,,,,
20224,"But some of them were angry among themselves, saying, For what purpose has this oil been wasted?",,,,,,,
20225,"We might have got more than three hundred pence for it, and given the money to the poor. And they said things against her among themselves.",,,,,,,
20226,"But Jesus said, Let her be; why are you troubling her? she has done a kind act to me.",,,,,,,
20227,"The poor you have ever with you, and whenever you have the desire you may do them good: but me you have not for ever.",,,,,,,
20228,She has done what she was able: she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last resting-place.,,,,,,,
20229,"And truly I say to you, Wherever the good news goes out through all the earth, what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her.",,,,,,,
20230,"And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, so that he might give him up to them.",,,,,,,
20231,"And hearing what he said, they were glad, and gave him their word to make him a payment of money. And he took thought how he might best give him up to them.",,,,,,,
20232,"And on the first day of unleavened bread, when the Passover lamb is put to death, his disciples said to him, Where are we to go and make ready for you to take the Passover meal?",,,,,,,
20233,"And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the town, and there will come to you a man with a vessel of water: go after him;",,,,,,,
20234,"And wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house, The Master says, Where is my guest-room, where I may take the Passover with my disciples?",,,,,,,
20235,And he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats: there make ready for us.,,,,,,,
20236,"And the disciples went out and came into the town, and saw that it was as he had said: and they made ready the Passover.",,,,,,,
20237,And when it was evening he came with the twelve.,,,,,,,
20238,"And while they were seated taking food, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will be false to me, one who is taking food with me.",,,,,,,
20239,"They were sad, and said to him one by one, Is it I?",,,,,,,
20240,"And he said to them, It is one of the twelve, one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate.",,,,,,,
20241,"The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but cursed is that man through whom the Son of man is given up! It would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth.",,,,,,,
20242,"And while they were taking food, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said, Take it: this is my body.",,,,,,,
20243,"And he took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them: and they all had a drink from it.",,,,,,,
20244,"And he said to them, This is my blood of the testament, which is given for men.",,,,,,,
20245,"Truly I say to you, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
20246,And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives.,,,,,,,
20247,"And Jesus said to them, You will all be turned away from me: for it is in the Writings, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.",,,,,,,
20248,"But after I have come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.",,,,,,,
20249,"But Peter said to him, Though the others may be turned away from you, I will not.",,,,,,,
20250,"And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that you, today, even this night, before the cock's second cry, will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.",,,,,,,
20251,"But he said with passion, If I have to be put to death with you, I will not be false to you. And they all said the same.",,,,,,,
20252,"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Be seated here while I say a prayer.",,,,,,,
20253,"And he took with him Peter and James and John, and grief and great trouble came on him.",,,,,,,
20254,"And he said to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: be here a little time, and keep watch.",,,,,,,
20255,"And he went forward a little, and falling down on the earth, made request that, if possible, the hour might go from him.",,,,,,,
20256,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: but even so let not my pleasure, but yours be done.",,,,,,,
20257,"And he came, and saw them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? were you not able to keep watch one hour?",,,,,,,
20258,"Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test; the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.",,,,,,,
20259,"And again he went away, and said a prayer, using the same words.",,,,,,,
20260,"And again he came and saw them sleeping, because their eyes were very tired; and they had nothing to say in answer.",,,,,,,
20261,"And he came the third time, and said to them, Go on sleeping now and take your rest: it is enough; the hour has come; see, the Son of man is given up into the hands of evil men.",,,,,,,
20262,"Get up, let us be going; see, he who gives me up is near.",,,,,,,
20263,"And straight away, while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great band with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority.",,,,,,,
20264,"Now he who had been false to him had given them a sign, saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he; take him, and get him away safely.",,,,,,,
20265,"And when he had come, he went straight to him and said, Master; and gave him a kiss.",,,,,,,
20266,"And they put their hands on him, and took him.",,,,,,,
20267,"But a certain one of those who were near took out his sword, and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.",,,,,,,
20268,"And Jesus said to them, Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and sticks to take me?",,,,,,,
20269,"I was with you every day in the Temple teaching, and you did not take me; but this is done so that the Writings may come true.",,,,,,,
20270,And they all went away from him in fear.,,,,,,,
20271,"And a certain young man went after him, with only a linen cloth about his body; and they put their hands on him;",,,,,,,
20272,"But he got away unclothed, without the linen cloth.",,,,,,,
20273,And they took Jesus away to the high priest; and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes.,,,,,,,
20274,"And Peter had come after him at a distance, even into the house of the high priest; and he was seated with the captains, warming himself in the light of the fire.",,,,,,,
20275,Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death; and they were unable to get any.,,,,,,,
20276,For a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement.,,,,,,,
20277,"Then some got up and gave false witness against him, saying,",,,,,,,
20278,"He said in our hearing, I will put an end to this Temple which is made with hands, and in three days I will make another without hands.",,,,,,,
20279,And even so their witness was not in agreement.,,,,,,,
20280,"And the high priest got up in the middle of them, and said to Jesus, Do you say nothing in answer? what is it which these say against you?",,,,,,,
20281,"But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioning him said, Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?",,,,,,,
20282,"And Jesus said, I am: and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.",,,,,,,
20283,"And the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, What more need have we of witnesses?",,,,,,,
20284,His words against God have come to your ears: what is your opinion? And they all said it was right for him to be put to death.,,,,,,,
20285,"And some put shame on him and, covering his face, gave him blows and said to him, Now say what is to come: and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands.",,,,,,,
20286,"And while Peter was down in the open square of the building, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came;",,,,,,,
20287,"And seeing Peter warming himself by the fire, she gave him a look, and said, You were with this Nazarene, even Jesus.",,,,,,,
20288,"But he said, I have no knowledge of him, or of what you are saying: and he went out into the doorway; and there came the cry of a cock.",,,,,,,
20289,"And the girl saw him, and said again to those who were near, This is one of them.",,,,,,,
20290,"But again he said it was not so. And after a little time, again those who were near said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; for you are a Galilaean.",,,,,,,
20291,"But, with curses and oaths, he said, I have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking.",,,,,,,
20292,"And in the same minute, the cock gave a second cry. And it came to Peter's mind how Jesus had said to him, Before the cock's second cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And at this thought he was overcome with weeping.And the f",rst thing in,the,m,rni,g th,ch,ef pr
20293,"And Pilate put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he, answering, said to him, You say so.",,,,,,,
20294,And the chief priests said a number of things against him.,,,,,,,
20295,"And Pilate again put a question, Do you say nothing in answer? see how much evil they say you have done.",,,,,,,
20296,"But Jesus gave no more answers, so that Pilate was full of wonder.",,,,,,,
20297,Now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request.,,,,,,,
20298,"And there was one named Barabbas, in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life.",,,,,,,
20299,"And the people went up, requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years.",,,,,,,
20300,"And Pilate said in answer to them, Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?",,,,,,,
20301,For he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy.,,,,,,,
20302,But the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let Barabbas go free.,,,,,,,
20303,"And Pilate again said in answer to them, What then am I to do to him to whom you give the name of the King of the Jews?",,,,,,,
20304,"And they said again loudly, To the cross with him!",,,,,,,
20305,"And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But their cry was the louder, To the cross!",,,,,,,
20306,"And Pilate, desiring to do what was pleasing to the people, let Barabbas go free, and gave up Jesus, when he had been whipped, to be put to death on the cross.",,,,,,,
20307,"And the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the Praetorium, and they got together all the band.",,,,,,,
20308,"And they put a purple robe on him, and twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;",,,,,,,
20309,"And, as if honouring him, they said, Long life to the King of the Jews!",,,,,,,
20310,"And they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and, going down on their knees, gave him worship.",,,,,,,
20311,"And when they had made sport of him, they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him. And they took him out to put him to death on the cross.",,,,,,,
20312,"And they made one, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was going by, coming from the country, go with them, so that he might take his cross.",,,,,,,
20313,"And they took him to the place named Golgotha, which is, Dead Man's Head.",,,,,,,
20314,And they gave him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.,,,,,,,
20315,"And he was nailed to the cross; and they made a division of his clothing among them, putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take.",,,,,,,
20316,And it was the third hour when they put him on the cross.,,,,,,,
20317,"And the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",,,,,,,
20318,"And they put two thieves on crosses with him, one on his right side, and one on his left.",,,,,,,
20319,[],,,,,,,
20320,"And those who went by made sport of him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ha! you who give the Temple to destruction, and put it up again in three days,",,,,,,,
20321,"Keep yourself from death, and come down from the cross.",,,,,,,
20322,"In the same way the chief priests, laughing at him among themselves with the scribes, said, A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself.",,,,,,,
20323,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and have belief. And those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him.",,,,,,,
20324,"And when the sixth hour had come, it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.",,,,,,,
20325,"And at the ninth hour, Jesus said in a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?",,,,,,,
20326,"And some of those who were near, hearing it, said, See, he is crying to Elijah.",,,,,,,
20327,"And one of them went quickly and, getting a sponge full of bitter wine, put it on a rod, and gave it to him for drink, saying, Let be; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.",,,,,,,
20328,"And Jesus gave a loud cry, and gave up his spirit.",,,,,,,
20329,And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end.,,,,,,,
20330,"And when the captain, who was near, saw how he gave up his spirit, he said, Truly this man was a son of God.",,,,,,,
20331,"And there were women watching from a distance: among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,",,,,,,,
20332,Who went with him when he was in Galilee and took care of him; and a number of other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
20333,"And when it was evening, because it was the time of getting ready, that is, the day before the Sabbath,",,,,,,,
20334,"There came Joseph of Arimathaea, a responsible man in high honour, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God; and he went in to Pilate without fear, and made a request for the body of Jesus.",,,,,,,
20335,"And Pilate was surprised that he was dead; and, sending for the captain, he put a question to see if he had been dead for long.",,,,,,,
20336,"And when he had news of it from the captain, he let Joseph have the body.",,,,,,,
20337,"And he got a linen cloth and, taking him down, put the linen cloth round him, and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock; and a stone was rolledagainstthedoor.",,,,,,,
20338,"AndMaryMagdaleneandMary, themotherofJoses, sawwhere he was put.And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James, and Salome, got spices, so that they might come and put them on him.",,,,,,,
20339,"And very early after dawn on the first day of the week, they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put.",,,,,,,
20340,"And they were saying among themselves, Who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us?",,,,,,,
20341,"And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; and it was of great size.",,,,,,,
20342,"And when they went in, they saw a young man seated on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were full of wonder.",,,,,,,
20343,"And he said to them, Do not be troubled: you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been put to death on the cross; he has come back from the dead; he is not here: see, the place where they put him!",,,,,,,
20344,"But go, say to his disciples and to Peter, He goes before you into Galilee: there you will see him, as he said to you.",,,,,,,
20345,"And they went out quickly from the place, because fear and great wonder had come on them: and they said nothing to anyone, because they were full of fear that ...",,,,,,,
20346,"Now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week, he went first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits.",,,,,,,
20347,"She went and gave news of it to those who had been with him, while they were sorrowing and weeping.",,,,,,,
20348,"And they, when it came to their ears that he was living, and had been seen by her, had no belief in it.",,,,,,,
20349,"And after these things he was seen in another form by two of them, while they were walking on their way into the country.",,,,,,,
20350,And they went away and gave news of it to the rest; and they had no belief in what was said.,,,,,,,
20351,"And later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food; and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard, and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dea",.,,,,,,
20352,"And he said to them, Go into all the world, and give the good news to everyone.",,,,,,,
20353,He who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation; but he who has not faith will be judged.,,,,,,,
20354,And these signs will be with those who have faith: in my name they will send out evil spirits; and they will make use of new languages;,,,,,,,
20355,"They will take up snakes, and if there is poison in their drink, it will do them no evil; they will put their hands on those who are ill, and they will get well.",,,,,,,
20356,"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had said these words to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.",,,,,,,
20357,"And they went out, preaching everywhere, the Lord working with them, and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after. So be it.As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among","s,",,,,,,
20358,"As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word,",,,,,,,
20359,"It seemed good to me, having made observation, with great care, of the direction of events in their order, to put the facts in writing for you, most noble Theophilus;",,,,,,,
20360,So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching.,,,,,,,
20361,"In the days of Herod, king of Judaea, there was a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the order of Abijah; and he had a wife of the family of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.",,,,,,,
20362,"They were upright in the eyes of God, keeping all the rules and orders of God, and doing no wrong.",,,,,,,
20363,"And they were without children, because Elisabeth had never given birth, and they were at that time very old.",,,,,,,
20364,"Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God,",,,,,,,
20365,"And as was the way of the priests, he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes.",,,,,,,
20366,"And all the people were offering prayers outside, at the time of the burning of perfumes.",,,,,,,
20367,And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar.,,,,,,,
20368,"And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear came on him.",,,,,,,
20369,"But the angel said, Have no fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your wife Elisabeth will have a son, and his name will be John.",,,,,,,
20370,And you will be glad and have great delight; and numbers of people will have joy at his birth.,,,,,,,
20371,For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord; he will not take wine or strong drink; and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth.,,,,,,,
20372,And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God.,,,,,,,
20373,"And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, turning the hearts of fathers to their children, and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness; to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord.",,,,,,,
20374,"And Zacharias said to the angel, How may I be certain of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far on in years.",,,,,,,
20375,"And the angel, answering, said, I am Gabriel, whose place is before God; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news.",,,,,,,
20376,"Now, see, you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about, because you had not faith in my words, which will have effect at the right time.",,,,,,,
20377,And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time.,,,,,,,
20378,"And when he came out he was not able to say anything, and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple; and he was making signs to them without words.",,,,,,,
20379,"And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended, he went back to his house.",,,,,,,
20380,"After that time, Elisabeth, being certain that she was to become a mother, kept herself from men's eyes for five months, saying,",,,,,,,
20381,"The Lord has done this to me, for his eyes were on me, to take away my shame in the eyes of men.",,,,,,,
20382,"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee, named Nazareth,",,,,,,,
20383,"To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph, of the family of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.",,,,,,,
20384,"And the angel came in to her and said, Peace be with you, to whom special grace has been given; the Lord is with you.",,,,,,,
20385,"But she was greatly troubled at his words, and said to herself, What may be the purpose of these words?",,,,,,,
20386,"And the angel said to her, Have no fear, Mary, for you have God's approval.",,,,,,,
20387,"And see, you will give birth to a son, and his name will be Jesus.",,,,,,,
20388,"He will be great, and will be named the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David, his father:",,,,,,,
20389,"He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.",,,,,,,
20390,"And Mary said to the angel, How may this be, because I have had no knowledge of a man?",,,,,,,
20391,"And the angel in answer said to her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you, and so that which will come to birth will be named holy, Son of God.",,,,,,,
20392,"Even now Elisabeth, who is of your family, is to be a mother, though she is old: and this is the sixth month with her who was without children.",,,,,,,
20393,For there is nothing which God is not able to do.,,,,,,,
20394,And Mary said: I am the servant of the Lord; may it be to me as you say. And the angel went away.,,,,,,,
20395,"Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands, to a town of Judah;",,,,,,,
20396,And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms.,,,,,,,
20397,"And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth, the baby made a sudden move inside her; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit,",,,,,,,
20398,"And she said with a loud voice: May blessing be on you among women, and a blessing on the child of your body.",,,,,,,
20399,How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me?,,,,,,,
20400,"For, truly, when the sound of your voice came to my ears, the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy.",,,,,,,
20401,Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done.,,,,,,,
20402,And Mary said: My soul gives glory to God;,,,,,,,
20403,My spirit is glad in God my Saviour.,,,,,,,
20404,"For he has had pity on his servant, though she is poor and lowly placed: and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me.",,,,,,,
20405,For he who is strong has done great things for me; and holy is his name.,,,,,,,
20406,His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him.,,,,,,,
20407,With his arm he has done acts of power; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts.,,,,,,,
20408,"He has put down kings from their seats, lifting up on high the men of low degree.",,,,,,,
20409,Those who had no food he made full of good things; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands;,,,,,,,
20410,"His help he has given to Israel, his servant, so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever,",,,,,,,
20411,As he gave his word to our fathers.,,,,,,,
20412,And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house.,,,,,,,
20413,"Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth, and she had a son.",,,,,,,
20414,"And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her, and they took part in her joy.",,,,,,,
20415,"And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child, and they would have given him the name of Zacharias, his father's name;",,,,,,,
20416,"But his mother made answer and said, No, his name is John.",,,,,,,
20417,"And they said, Not one of your relations has that name.",,,,,,,
20418,"And they made signs to his father, to say what name was to be given to him.",,,,,,,
20419,And he sent for writing materials and put down: His name is John; and they were all surprised.,,,,,,,
20420,And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God.,,,,,,,
20421,And fear came on all those who were living round about them: and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill-country of Judaea.,,,,,,,
20422,"And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said, What will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.",,,,,,,
20423,"And his father, Zacharias, was full of the Holy Spirit, and with the voice of a prophet said these words:",,,,,,,
20424,"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has come to his people and made them free,",,,,,,,
20425,"Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,",,,,,,,
20426,"(As he said, by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the earliest times,)",,,,,,,
20427,"Salvation from those who are against us, and from the hands of those who have hate for us;",,,,,,,
20428,"To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word,",,,,,,,
20429,"The oath which he made to Abraham, our father,",,,,,,,
20430,"That we, being made free from the fear of those who are against us, might give him worship,",,,,,,,
20431,In righteousness and holy living before him all our days.,,,,,,,
20432,"And you, child, will be named the prophet of the Most High: you will go before the face of the Lord, to make ready his ways;",,,,,,,
20433,"To give knowledge of salvation to his people, through the forgiveness of sins,",,,,,,,
20434,"Because of the loving mercies of our God, by which the dawn from heaven has come to us,",,,,,,,
20435,"To give light to those in dark places, and in the shade of death, so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace.",,,,,,,
20436,"And the child became tall, and strong in spirit; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel.Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all t",e world.,,,,,,
20437,"This was the first numbering, which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria.",,,,,,,
20438,"And all men went to be numbered, everyone to his town.",,,,,,,
20439,"And Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the town of Nazareth, into Judaea, to Beth-lehem, the town of David, because he was of the house and family of David,",,,,,,,
20440,"To be put on the list with Mary, his future wife, who was about to become a mother.",,,,,,,
20441,"And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.",,,,,,,
20442,"And she had her first son; and folding him in linen, she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food, because there was no room for them in the house.",,,,,,,
20443,"And in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields, watching over their flock by night.",,,,,,,
20444,"And an angel of the Lord came to them, and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them: and fear came on them.",,,,,,,
20445,"And the angel said, Have no fear; for truly, I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people:",,,,,,,
20446,"For on this day, in the town of David, a Saviour has come to birth, who is Christ the Lord.",,,,,,,
20447,"And this is the sign to you: you will see a young child folded in linen, in the place where the cattle have their food.",,,,,,,
20448,"And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven, giving praise to God, and saying,",,,,,,,
20449,"Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased.",,,,,,,
20450,"And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the keepers of the sheep said to one another, Let us go now to Beth-lehem, and see this thing which has come about, which the Lord has made clear to us.",,,,,,,
20451,"And they came quickly, and saw Mary and Joseph, and the child in the place where the cattle had their food.",,,,,,,
20452,"And when they saw it, they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child.",,,,,,,
20453,And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep.,,,,,,,
20454,"But Mary kept all these words in her heart, and gave much thought to them.",,,,,,,
20455,"Then the keepers of the sheep went back, giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen, as it had been said to them.",,,,,,,
20456,"And when, after eight days, the time came for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, the name which the angel had given to him before his birth.",,,,,,,
20457,"And when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of Moses had come to an end, they took him to Jerusalem to give him to the Lord",,,,,,,
20458,"(As it says in the law of the Lord, Every mother's first male child is to be holy to the Lord),",,,,,,,
20459,"And to make an offering, as it is ordered in the law of the Lord, of two doves or other young birds.",,,,,,,
20460,"And there was then in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon; and he was an upright man, fearing God and waiting for the comfort of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was on him.",,,,,,,
20461,"And he had knowledge, through the Holy Spirit, that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ.",,,,,,,
20462,"And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple; and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus, to do with him what was ordered by the law,",,,,,,,

20464,"Now you are letting your servant go in peace, O Lord, as you have said;",,,,,,,
20465,"For my eyes have seen your salvation,",,,,,,,
20466,Which you have made ready before the face of all nations;,,,,,,,
20467,"A light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.",,,,,,,
20468,And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him.,,,,,,,
20469,"And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary, his mother, See, this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel, and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said;",,,,,,,
20470,(And a sword will go through your heart;) so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light.,,,,,,,

20472,"She had been a widow for eighty-four years); she was in the Temple at all times, worshipping with prayers and going without food, night and day.",,,,,,,
20473,"And coming up at that time, she gave praise to God, talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem.",,,,,,,

20476,And every year his father and mother went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.,,,,,,,
20477,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up, as their way was, to the feast;",,,,,,,
20478,"And when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back, the boy Jesus was still in Jerusalem, but they had no knowledge of it:",,,,,,,
20479,"And in the belief that he was with some of their number, they went a day's journey; and after looking for him among their relations and friends,",,,,,,,
20480,"And seeing that he was not there, they went back to Jerusalem, to make search for him.",,,,,,,
20481,"And after three days they came across him in the Temple, seated among the wise men, giving ear to their words and putting questions to them.",,,,,,,
20482,And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave.,,,,,,,
20483,"And when they saw him they were surprised, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you done this to us? see, your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow.",,,,,,,
20484,"And he said to them, Why were you looking for me? was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Father's house?",,,,,,,

20490,"As it says in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight.",,,,,,,

20492,And all flesh will see the salvation of God.,,,,,,,
20493,"So he said to the people who went out to him for baptism: You offspring of snakes, at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come?",,,,,,,
20494,"Make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed; and do not say to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children of Abraham.",,,,,,,
20495,And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees; and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire.,,,,,,,
20496,"And the people put questions to him, saying, What have we to do?",,,,,,,
20497,"And he made answer and said to them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has not even one; and he who has food, let him do the same.",,,,,,,
20498,"Then tax-farmers came to him for baptism and said to him, Master, what have we to do?",,,,,,,
20499,"And he said to them, Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount.",,,,,,,
20500,"And men of the army put questions to him, saying, And what have we to do? And he said to them, Do no violent acts to any man, and do not take anything without right, and let your payment be enough for you.",,,,,,,
20501,"And while the people were waiting, and all men were questioning in their hearts about John, if he was the Christ or not,",,,,,,,
20502,"John made answer, saying to them all, Truly, I give you baptism with water, but one is coming who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:",,,,,,,

20526,"And the Evil One said to him, If you are the Son of God, give orders to this stone to become bread.",,,,,,,
20527,"And Jesus made answer to him, It has been said in the Writings, Bread is not man's only need.",,,,,,,
20528,And he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time.,,,,,,,

20542,To give knowledge that the year of the Lord's good pleasure is come.,,,,,,,
20543,And shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat: and the eyes of all in the Synagogue were fixed on him.,,,,,,,
20544,"Then he said to them, Today this word has come true in your hearing.",,,,,,,
20545,"And they were all giving witness, with wonder, to the words of grace which came from his mouth: and they said, Is not this the son of Joseph?",,,,,,,
20546,"And he said to them, Without doubt you will say to me, Let the medical man make himself well: the things which to our knowledge were done at Capernaum, do them here in your country.",,,,,,,
20547,"And he said to them, Truly I say to you, No prophet is honoured in his country.",,,,,,,
20548,"Truly I say to you, There were a number of widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land;",,,,,,,
20549,"But Elijah was not sent to one of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.",,,,,,,
20550,"And there were a number of lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and not one of them was made clean, but only Naaman the Syrian.",,,,,,,
20551,And all who were in the Synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them.,,,,,,,
20552,"And they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was, so that they might send him down to his death.",,,,,,,
20553,But he came through them and went on his way.,,,,,,,
20554,"And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee; and he was giving them teaching on the Sabbath.",,,,,,,

20559,"And wonder came on them all and they said to one another, What are these words? for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out.",,,,,,,
20560,And there was much talk about him in all the places round about.,,,,,,,
20561,And he got up and went out of the Synagogue and went into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was very ill with a burning heat; and in answer to their prayers for her,,,,,,,
20562,"He went near her, and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her; and straight away she got up and took care of their needs.",,,,,,,
20563,"And at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease, took them to him, and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well.",,,,,,,
20564,"And evil spirits came out of a number of them, crying out and saying, You are the Son of God. But he gave them sharp orders not to say a word, because they had knowledge that he was the Christ.",,,,,,,
20565,"And when it was day, he came out and went to a waste place; and great numbers of people came looking for him, and they came to him and would have kept him from going away.",,,,,,,
20566,"But he said to them, I have to give the good news of the kingdom of God in other towns, because that is why I was sent.",,,,,,,
20567,"And he was teaching in the Synagogues of Galilee.Now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him, and to have knowledge of the word of God, he was by a wide stretch of water named Gennesaret;",,,,,,,
20568,"And he saw two boats by the edge of the water, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.",,,,,,,
20569,"And he got into one of the boats, the property of Simon, and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land. And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat.",,,,,,,
20570,"And when his talk was ended, he said to Simon, Go out into deep water, and let down your nets for fish.",,,,,,,
20571,"And Simon, answering, said, Master, we were working all night and we took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets.",,,,,,,
20572,"And when they had done this, they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken;",,,,,,,
20573,"And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help. And they came, and the two boats were so full that they were going down.",,,,,,,
20574,"But Simon, when he saw it, went down at the knees of Jesus and said, Go away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinner.",,,,,,,
20575,"For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him, at the number of fish which they had taken;",,,,,,,
20576,"And so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were working with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Have no fear; from this time forward you will be a fisher of men.",,,,,,,
20577,"And when they had got their boats to the land, they gave up everything and went after him.",,,,,,,
20578,"And it came about that while he was in one of the towns, there was a leper there: and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him, saying, Lord, if it is your pleasure, you have power to make me clean.",,,,,,,
20579,"And he put out his hand to him and said, It is my pleasure; be clean. And straight away his disease went from him.",,,,,,,
20580,"And he gave him orders: Say nothing to any man, but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean, as the law of Moses says, and for a witness to them.",,,,,,,
20581,"But news of him went out all the more, in every direction, and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases.",,,,,,,
20582,But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer.,,,,,,,
20583,"And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching; and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there, who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him, to make those who we",e ill free f,om,h,ir,isea,es.,
20584,"And some men had with them, on a bed, a man who was ill, without power of moving; and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus.",,,,,,,
20585,"And because of the mass of people, there was no way to get him in; so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof, on his bed, into the middle in front of Jesus.",,,,,,,
20586,"And seeing their faith he said, Man, you have forgiveness for your sins.",,,,,,,
20587,"And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument, saying, Who is this, who has no respect for God? who is able to give forgiveness for sins, but God only?",,,,,,,
20588,"But Jesus, who had knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?",,,,,,,
20589,"Which is the simpler: to say, You have forgiveness for your sins; or to say, Get up and go?",,,,,,,
20590,"But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins, (he said to the man who was ill,) I say to you, Get up, and take up your bed, and go into your house.",,,,,,,
20591,"And straight away he got up before them, and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God.",,,,,,,
20592,"And wonder overcame them all, and they gave glory to God; and they were full of fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.",,,,,,,
20593,"And after these things he went out, and saw Levi, a tax-farmer, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and said to him, Come after me.",,,,,,,
20594,"And giving up his business, he got up and went after him.",,,,,,,
20595,And Levi made a great feast for him in his house: and a great number of tax-farmers and others were seated at table with them.,,,,,,,
20596,"And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples, saying, Why do you take food and drink with tax-farmers and sinners?",,,,,,,
20597,"And Jesus, answering, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill.",,,,,,,
20598,"I have come, not to get the upright, but sinners, so that they may be turned from their sins.",,,,,,,
20599,"And they said to him, The disciples of John frequently go without food, and make prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees; but your disciples take food and drink.",,,,,,,
20600,"And Jesus said, Are you able to make the friends of the newly-married man go without food when he is with them?",,,,,,,
20601,"But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.",,,,,,,
20602,"And he said to them, in a story, No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat, for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old.",,,,,,,
20603,"And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins, for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine, and the wine be let out, and the skins come to destruction.",,,,,,,
20604,But new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.,,,,,,,
20605,"And no man, having had old wine, has any desire for new, for he says, The old is better.Now it came about that on the Sabbath he was going through the fields of grain, and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food, crushing them in their hands.",,,,,,,
20606,"But some of the Pharisees said, Why do you do what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?",,,,,,,
20607,"And Jesus said, Have you not seen in the Writings what David did when he was in need of food, he, and those who were with him;",,,,,,,
20608,"How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?",,,,,,,
20609,"And he said, The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.",,,,,,,
20610,"And it came about, on another Sabbath, that he went into the Synagogue and was teaching there. And a man was there whose right hand was dead.",,,,,,,
20611,"And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to say something against him.",,,,,,,
20612,"But he had knowledge of their thoughts; and he said to the man whose hand was dead, Get up and come into the middle. And he got up and came forward.",,,,,,,
20613,"And Jesus said, I put the question to you, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to take it away?",,,,,,,
20614,"And looking round on all of them, he said to him, Put out your hand. And he did so: and his hand was made well.",,,,,,,
20615,"But they were full of wrath, and were talking together about what they might do to Jesus.",,,,,,,
20616,And it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer; and he was all night in prayer to God.,,,,,,,
20617,"And the day came and, turning to his disciples, he made a selection from among them of twelve, to whom he gave the name of Apostles;",,,,,,,
20618,"Simon, to whom he gave the name of Peter, and Andrew, his brother, and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew",,,,,,,
20619,"And Matthew and Thomas and James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who was named the Zealot,",,,,,,,
20620,"And Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, he who was false to him.",,,,,,,
20621,"And he came down with them to a level place, and a great band of his disciples, and a very great number of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the parts of Tyre and Sidon by the sea, came to give hearing to him, and to be made well from their d",seases;,,,,,,
20622,And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well.,,,,,,,
20623,"And all the people were desiring to be touched by him, for power came from him and made them all well.",,,,,,,
20624,"And turning his eyes to his disciples he said, Happy are you who are poor: for the kingdom of God is yours.",,,,,,,
20625,Happy are you who are in need of food now: for you will be made full. Happy are you who are weeping now; for you will be glad.,,,,,,,
20626,"Happy are you, when men have hate for you, and put you away from among them and say angry words to you, turning away in disgust at your name, because of the Son of man.",,,,,,,
20627,"Be glad in that day, and be lifted up for joy, for your reward in heaven will be great: for their fathers did these same things to the prophets.",,,,,,,
20628,But unhappy are you who have wealth: for you have been comforted now.,,,,,,,
20629,Unhappy are you who are full of food now: for you will be in need. Unhappy are you who are laughing now: for you will be crying in sorrow.,,,,,,,
20630,Unhappy are you when all men give you their approval: for so their fathers did to the false prophets.,,,,,,,
20631,"But I say to you who give ear to me, Have love for those who are against you, do good to those who have hate for you,",,,,,,,
20632,"Give blessing to those who give you curses, say prayers for those who are cruel to you.",,,,,,,
20633,"If a man gives you a blow on one side of your face, then let the other side be turned to him; from him who takes away your coat, do not keep back your robe.",,,,,,,
20634,"Give to everyone who comes with a request, and if a man takes away your property, make no attempt to get it back again.",,,,,,,
20635,Do to others as you would have them do to you.,,,,,,,
20636,"If you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? for even sinners have love for those who have love for them.",,,,,,,
20637,"And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is it to you? for even sinners do the same.",,,,,,,
20638,"And if you let those have the use of your money, from whom you are hoping to get it back, what credit is it to you? even sinners do so to sinners, hoping to get back as much as they gave.",,,,,,,
20639,"But be loving to those who are against you and do them good, and give them your money, not giving up hope, and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the Most High: for he is kind to evil men, and to those who have hard hearts.",,,,,,,
20640,"Be full of pity, even as your Father is full of pity.",,,,,,,
20641,"Be not judges of others, and you will not be judged: do not give punishment to others, and you will not get punishment yourselves: make others free, and you will be made free:",,,,,,,
20642,"Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, crushed down, full and running over, they will give to you. For in the same measure as you give, it will be given to you again.",,,,,,,
20643,"And he gave them teaching in the form of a story, saying, Is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another? will they not go falling together into a hole?",,,,,,,
20644,"The disciple is not greater than his master, but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master.",,,,,,,
20645,"And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye, but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye?",,,,,,,
20646,"How will you say to your brother, Brother, let me take the grain of dust out of your eye, when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye? O false one! first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of you",brother's e,e.,,,,,
20647,"For no good tree gives bad fruit, and no bad tree gives good fruit.",,,,,,,
20648,"For every tree is judged by its fruit. Men do not get figs from thorns, or grapes from blackberry plants.",,,,,,,
20649,"The good man, out of the good store of his heart, gives good things; and the evil man, out of his evil store, gives evil: for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth.",,,,,,,
20650,"Why do you say to me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?",,,,,,,
20651,"Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them, I will make clear to you what he is like:",,,,,,,
20652,"He is like a man building a house, who went deep and put the base of it on a rock; and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house, it was not moved, because the building was good.",,,,,,,
20653,"But he who gives hearing, without doing, is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it; and when the force of the river came against it, straight away it came down; and the destruction of that house was great.After he had come to the",nd of all hi,wo,d,in,the,ear,ng of
20654,And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him; this servant was ill and near to death.,,,,,,,
20655,"And when news of Jesus came to his ears, he sent to him rulers of the Jews, requesting that he would come and make his servant well.",,,,,,,
20656,"And they, when they came to Jesus, made their request warmly, saying,",,,,,,,
20657,"It is right for you to do this for him, because he is a friend to our nation, and himself has put up a Synagogue for us.",,,,,,,
20658,"And Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the man sent friends to him, saying, Lord, do not give yourself trouble: for I am not important enough for you to come into my house:",,,,,,,
20659,"And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you: but say the word only, and my servant will be well.",,,,,,,
20660,"For I, myself, am a man under authority, having men under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.",,,,,,,
20661,"And when these things were said to Jesus, he was surprised, and, turning to the mass of people coming after him, said, I have not seen such great faith, no, not in Israel.",,,,,,,
20662,And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well.,,,,,,,
20663,"And it came about, after a little time, that he went to a town named Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great number of people.",,,,,,,
20664,"Now when he came near the door of the town, a dead man was being taken out, the only son of his mother, who was a widow: and a great number of people from the town were with her.",,,,,,,
20665,"And when the Lord saw her, he had pity on her and said to her, Be not sad.",,,,,,,
20666,"And he came near, and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was: and those who were moving it came to a stop. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Get up.",,,,,,,
20667,"And the dead man got up, and words came from his lips. And he gave him to his mother.",,,,,,,
20668,"And fear came on all, and they gave praise to God, saying, A great prophet is among us: and, God has given thought to his people.",,,,,,,
20669,And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about.,,,,,,,
20670,And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things.,,,,,,,
20671,"Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?",,,,,,,
20672,"And when the men came to him they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?",,,,,,,
20673,"At that time, he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains, and from evil spirits; and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes.",,,,,,,
20674,"And answering them he said, Go back and give news to John of what you have seen, and the things which have come to your ears; the blind now see, those who had no power in their legs are walking, lepers are made clean, those who had no hearing now have th",ir ears open,de,d,men,come,to,ife a
20675,And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me.,,,,,,,
20676,"And when the men who were sent by John had gone away, he said to the people, about John, What did you go out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind?",,,,,,,
20677,"But what did you go out to see? a man in soft clothing? See now, those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings' houses.",,,,,,,
20678,"But what did you go out to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.",,,,,,,
20679,"This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you.",,,,,,,
20680,"I say to you, Among all the sons of women, not one is greater than John: but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.",,,,,,,
20681,"(And all the people, and the tax-farmers, to whom John had given baptism, when they had knowledge of these things, gave glory to God.",,,,,,,
20682,"But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves, not having had his baptism.)",,,,,,,
20683,What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation? what are they like?,,,,,,,
20684,"They are like children who are seated in the market-place, crying out to one another, and saying, We made music for you, but you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow, but you were not sad.",,,,,,,
20685,"For John the Baptist came, taking no food or drink, and you say, He has an evil spirit.",,,,,,,
20686,"The Son of man came feasting, and you say, Here is a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners.",,,,,,,
20687,But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children.,,,,,,,
20688,And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house and took his seat at the table.,,,,,,,
20689,"And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner; and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisee's house, she took a bottle of perfume,",,,,,,,
20690,"And went in and took her place at the back of him, near his feet, weeping, so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes, and with her hair she made them dry, and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them.",,,,,,,
20691,"Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he was a prophet, would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him, that she is a sinner.",,,,,,,
20692,"And Jesus, answering, said, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Master, say on.",,,,,,,
20693,"And he said, Two men were in debt to a certain man of business: one had a debt of five hundred pence, and the other of fifty.",,,,,,,
20694,"When they were unable to make payment, he made the two of them free of their debts. Which of them, now, will have the greater love for him?",,,,,,,
20695,"Simon, in answer, said, It seems he whose debt was greater. And he said, Your decision is right.",,,,,,,
20696,"And turning to the woman he said to Simon, You see this woman? I came into your house; you did not give me water for my feet: but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes, and drying them with her hair.",,,,,,,
20697,"You did not give me a kiss: but she, from the time when I came in, has gone on kissing my feet.",,,,,,,
20698,You put no oil on my head: but she has put perfume on my feet.,,,,,,,
20699,"And so I say to you, She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number, because of her great love: but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love.",,,,,,,
20700,"And he said to her, You have forgiveness for your sins.",,,,,,,
20701,"And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves, Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins?",,,,,,,
20702,"And he said to the woman, By your faith you have salvation; go in peace.And it came about, after a short time, that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God, and with him were the twelve,",,,,,,,
20703,"And certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases, Mary named Magdalene, from whom seven evil spirits had gone out,",,,,,,,
20704,"And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's chief house-servant, and Susanna and a number of others, who gave him of their wealth for his needs.",,,,,,,
20705,"And when a great number of people came together, and men from every town went out to him, he gave them teaching in the form of a story:",,,,,,,
20706,"A man went out to put in seed, and while he was doing it, some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot, and was taken by the birds of heaven.",,,,,,,
20707,"And some went on the rock, and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water.",,,,,,,
20708,"And some went among thorns, and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth.",,,,,,,
20709,"And some falling on good earth, came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much. And with these words he said in a loud voice, He who has ears, let him give ear.",,,,,,,
20710,And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story.,,,,,,,
20711,"And he said, To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to the others, they are given in stories, so that seeing, they may not see, and though they give hearing, the sense will not be clear to them.",,,,,,,
20712,Now this is the point of the story: The seed is the word of God.,,,,,,,
20713,"Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing; then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not have faith and get salvation.",,,,,,,
20714,"And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word; but having no root, they have faith for a time, and when the test comes they give up.",,,,,,,
20715,"And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing, and go on their way, but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life, and they give no fruit.",,,,,,,
20716,"And those in the good earth are those who, having given ear to the word, keep it with a good and true heart, and in quiet strength give fruit.",,,,,,,
20717,"No man, when the light is lighted, puts a cover over it, or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on its table, so that those who come in may see the light.",,,,,,,
20718,"For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear, and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light.",,,,,,,
20719,"So take care how you give hearing, for to him who has will be given, and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have.",,,,,,,
20720,"And his mother and his brothers came to him, and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people.",,,,,,,
20721,"And someone said to him, Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you.",,,,,,,
20722,"But he said to them in answer, My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it.",,,,,,,
20723,"Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the water: and they put out the boat.",,,,,,,
20724,"But while they were sailing he went to sleep: and a storm of wind came down on the sea, and the boat became full of water and they were in danger.",,,,,,,
20725,"Then they came to him and, awaking him out of his sleep, said, Master, Master, destruction is near. And he, when he was awake, gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves, and the storm came to an end, and all was calm.",,,,,,,
20726,"And he said to them, Where is your faith? And fear and wonder overcame them, and they said to one another, Who then is this, who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says?",,,,,,,
20727,"And they came to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.",,,,,,,
20728,"And when he had come to the land, there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits; and for a long time he had had no clothing on, and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead.",,,,,,,
20729,"And when he saw Jesus, he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Do not be cruel to me.",,,,,,,
20730,"For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man. For frequently it would take a grip of him: and he was kept under control, and prisoned with chains; but parting the chains in two, he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into wa",te places.,,,,,,
20731,"And Jesus said to him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for a number of spirits had gone into him.",,,,,,,
20732,And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep.,,,,,,,
20733,"Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place, getting food on the mountain: and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs, and he let them.",,,,,,,
20734,And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs: and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction.,,,,,,,
20735,"And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about, they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country.",,,,,,,
20736,"And they went out to see what had taken place, and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone, seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, at the feet of Jesus; and fear came on them.",,,,,,,
20737,And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well.,,,,,,,
20738,And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them; for they were in great fear: and he got into a boat and went back.,,,,,,,
20739,"But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him, but he sent him away, saying,",,,,,,,
20740,"Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you. And he went away, giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him.",,,,,,,
20741,"And when Jesus went back, the people were glad to see him, for they were all waiting for him.",,,,,,,
20742,"Then there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler in the Synagogue: and he went down at the feet of Jesus, desiring him to come to his house;",,,,,,,
20743,"For he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was near to death. But while he was on his way, the people were pushing to be near him.",,,,,,,
20744,"And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had given all her money to medical men, and not one of them was able to make her well,",,,,,,,
20745,"Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe, and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped.",,,,,,,
20746,"And Jesus said, Who was touching me? And when they all said, It is not I, Peter and those who were with him said, Master, the people are pushing round you on every side.",,,,,,,
20747,"But Jesus said, Someone was touching me, for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me.",,,,,,,
20748,"And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret, she came, shaking with fear, and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him, and how she was made well straight away.",,,,,,,
20749,"And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.",,,,,,,
20750,"While he was still talking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue, saying, Your daughter is dead; do not go on troubling the Master.",,,,,,,
20751,"But Jesus at these words said to him, Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be made well.",,,,,,,
20752,"And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him, but only Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and her mother.",,,,,,,
20753,"And all the people were weeping and crying for her; but he said, Do not be sad, for she is not dead, but sleeping.",,,,,,,
20754,"And they were laughing at him, being certain that she was dead.",,,,,,,
20755,"But he, taking her hand, said to her, My child, get up.",,,,,,,
20756,And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away: and he gave orders that food was to be given to her.,,,,,,,
20757,"And her father and mother were full of wonder, but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone.And getting the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases, to make them well.",,,,,,,
20758,"And he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of God, and to make well those who were ill.",,,,,,,
20759,"And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, no stick or bag or bread or money, and do not take two coats.",,,,,,,
20760,"And if you go into a house, let that house be your resting-place till you go away.",,,,,,,
20761,"And if any people will not take you in, when you go away from that town, put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them.",,,,,,,
20762,"And they went away, journeying through all the towns, preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places.",,,,,,,
20763,"Now Herod the king had news of all these things: and he was in doubt, because it was said by some people that John had come back from the dead;",,,,,,,
20764,"And by some, that Elijah had come; and by others, that one of the old prophets had come back to life.",,,,,,,
20765,"And Herod said, I put John to death: but who is this, of whom such stories are given to me? And he had a desire to see him.",,,,,,,
20766,"And the twelve, when they came back, gave him an account of what they had done. And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Beth-saida.",,,,,,,
20767,"But the people, getting news of it, went after him: and he was pleased to see them, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God, and made those well who were in need of it.",,,,,,,
20768,"And the day went on; and the twelve came to him and said, Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting-places and food for themselves, for we are in a waste place.",,,,,,,
20769,"But he said, Give them food yourselves. And they said, We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes, if we do not go and get food for all these people.",,,,,,,
20770,"For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them be seated in groups, about fifty to a group.",,,,,,,
20771,"And they did so, and made them all be seated.",,,,,,,
20772,"And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them, and when they had been broken, he gave them to the disciples to give to the people.",,,,,,,
20773,"And they all took the food and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits which were over, twelve baskets full.",,,,,,,
20774,"And it came about that when he was in prayer, by himself, and the disciples were with him, he put a question to them, saying, Who do the people say I am?",,,,,,,
20775,"And they, answering, said, John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has come back.",,,,,,,
20776,"And he said, But who do you say that I am? And Peter, answering, said, The Christ of God.",,,,,,,
20777,"But he gave them special orders, not to say this to any man;",,,,,,,
20778,"Saying, The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and be put to death, and on the third day he will come back to life.",,,,,,,
20779,"And he said to them all, If any man has a desire to come after me, let him give up all, and take up his cross every day, and come after me.",,,,,,,
20780,"For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, but whoever gives up his life because of me, will keep it.",,,,,,,
20781,"For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world, but undergoes loss or destruction himself?",,,,,,,
20782,"For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words, the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.",,,,,,,
20783,"But truly I say to you, Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
20784,"And about eight days after he had said these things, he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer.",,,,,,,
20785,"And while he was in prayer, his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining.",,,,,,,
20786,"And two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with him;",,,,,,,
20787,Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
20788,"Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were with him.",,,,,,,
20789,"And when they were about to go away from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah: having no knowledge of what he was saying.",,,,,,,
20790,"And while he said these things, the shade of a cloud came over them, and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud.",,,,,,,
20791,"And there was a voice from the cloud saying, This is my Son, the man of my selection; give ear to him.",,,,,,,
20792,"And after the voice was gone they saw that Jesus was by himself. And they kept quiet, and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen.",,,,,,,
20793,"And on the day after, when they came down from the mountain, a great band of people came to him.",,,,,,,
20794,"And a man from among them, crying out, said, Master, I make a request to you, give a thought to my son, for he is my only child:",,,,,,,
20795,"And see, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he gives a cry, twisted in pain and streaming at the lips, and when it goes away from him at last, he is marked as from blows.",,,,,,,
20796,"And I made a request to your disciples to send it out of him, but they were not able to do it.",,,,,,,
20797,"And Jesus said, O generation without faith and false in heart, how long will I have to be with you and put up with you? let your son come here.",,,,,,,
20798,"And while he was coming, he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit. But Jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit, and made the boy well, and gave him back to his father.",,,,,,,
20799,"And they were full of wonder at the great power of God. But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,",,,,,,,
20800,"Let these words go deep into your ears, for the Son of man will be given up into the hands of men.",,,,,,,
20801,But this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it: and they had fear of questioning him about it.,,,,,,,
20802,Now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest.,,,,,,,
20803,"But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts, he took a small child and put him by his side,",,,,,,,
20804,"And said to them, Whoever gives honour to this child in my name, gives honour to me: and whoever gives honour to me, gives honour to him who sent me: for whoever is least among you all, that man is great.",,,,,,,
20805,"And John, answering, said, Master, we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name, and we did not let him do it, because he was not one of us.",,,,,,,
20806,"But Jesus said to him, Let him do it, for he who is not against you is for you.",,,,,,,
20807,"And it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up, his face was turned to go to Jerusalem,",,,,,,,
20808,And he sent men before: and they came to a small town of Samaria to make ready for him.,,,,,,,
20809,"But they would not have him there, because he was clearly going to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
20810,"And when his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them?",,,,,,,
20811,But turning round he said sharp words to them.,,,,,,,
20812,And they went to another small town.,,,,,,,
20813,"And when they were on the way, a certain man said to him, I will come after you wherever you go.",,,,,,,
20814,"And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting-places, but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head.",,,,,,,
20815,"And he said to another, Come after me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and give the last honours to my father.",,,,,,,
20816,"But he said to him, Let the dead take care of their dead; it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
20817,"And another man said, I will come with you, Lord, but first let me say a last good-day to those who are at my house.",,,,,,,
20818,"But Jesus said, No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is good enough for the kingdom of God.Now after these things, the Lord made selection of seventy others and sent them before him, two together, into every town and place where he",himself was,bou,,o c,me.,,
20819,"And he said to them, There is much grain ready to be cut, but not enough workers: so make prayer to the Lord of the grain-fields that he will send workers to get in the grain.",,,,,,,
20820,"Go on your way: see, I send you out like lambs among wolves.",,,,,,,
20821,"Take no bag for money or for food, and no shoes; say no word to any man on the way.",,,,,,,
20822,"And whenever you go into a house, first say, Peace be to this house.",,,,,,,
20823,"And if a son of peace is there, your peace will be with him: but if not, it will come back to you again.",,,,,,,
20824,"And keep in that same house, taking what food and drink they give you: for the worker has a right to his reward. Do not go from house to house.",,,,,,,
20825,"And into whatever town you go, if they take you in, take whatever food is given to you:",,,,,,,
20826,"And make well those in it who are ill and say to them, The kingdom of God is near to you.",,,,,,,
20827,"But if you go into a town where they will not have you, go out into the streets of it and say,",,,,,,,
20828,"Even the dust of your town, which is on our feet, we put off as a witness against you; but be certain of this, that the kingdom of God is near.",,,,,,,
20829,"I say to you, It will be better in that day for Sodom than for that town.",,,,,,,
20830,"A curse is on you, Chorazin! A curse is on you, Beth-saida! For if such works of power had been done in Tyre and Sidon as have been done in you, they would have been turned from their sins, in days gone by, seated in the dust.",,,,,,,
20831,"But it will be better for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judging, than for you.",,,,,,,
20832,"And you, Capernaum, were you not lifted up to heaven? you will go down to hell.",,,,,,,
20833,"Whoever gives ear to you, gives ear to me; and whoever is against you, is against me; and whoever is against me, is against him who sent me.",,,,,,,
20834,"And the seventy came back with joy, saying, Lord, even the evil spirits are under our power in your name.",,,,,,,
20835,"And he said, I was watching for Satan, falling from heaven like a star.",,,,,,,
20836,"See, I have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts, and over all the strength of him who is against you: and nothing will do you damage.",,,,,,,
20837,"Do not be glad, however, because you have power over spirits, but because your names are recorded in heaven.",,,,,,,
20838,"In that same hour he was full of joy in the Holy Spirit and said, I give praise to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning, and have made them clear to little children: for","o, O Father,",it,a,pl,asin,in,your
20839,"All things have been given to me by my Father: and no one has knowledge of the Son, but only the Father: and of the Father, but only the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear.",,,,,,,
20840,"And, turning to the disciples, he said privately, Happy are the eyes which see the things you see:",,,,,,,
20841,"For I say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see, and have not seen them, and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears, and they had it not.",,,,,,,
20842,"And a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test, saying, Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life?",,,,,,,
20843,"And he said to him, What does the law say, in your reading of it?",,,,,,,
20844,"And he, answering, said, Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and for your neighbour as for yourself.",,,,,,,
20845,"And he said, You have given the right answer: do this and you will have life.",,,,,,,
20846,"But he, desiring to put himself in the right, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?",,,,,,,
20847,"And Jesus, answering him, said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he got into the hands of thieves, who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows, and when they went away, he was half dead.",,,,,,,
20848,"And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he went by on the other side.",,,,,,,
20849,"And in the same way, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, went by on the other side.",,,,,,,
20850,"But a certain man of Samaria, journeying that way, came where he was, and when he saw him, he was moved with pity for him,",,,,,,,
20851,"And came to him and put clean linen round his wounds, with oil and wine; and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him.",,,,,,,
20852,"And the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said, Take care of him; and if this money is not enough, when I come again I will give you whatever more is needed.",,,,,,,
20853,"Which of these three men, in your opinion, was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves?",,,,,,,
20854,"And he said, The one who had mercy on him. And Jesus said, Go and do the same.",,,,,,,
20855,"Now, while they were on their way, he came to a certain town; and a woman named Martha took him into her house.",,,,,,,
20856,"And she had a sister, by name Mary, who took her seat at the Lord's feet and gave attention to his words.",,,,,,,
20857,"But Martha had her hands full of the work of the house, and she came to him and said, Lord, is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work? Say to her that she is to give me some help.",,,,,,,
20858,"But the Lord, answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things:",,,,,,,
20859,"Little is needed, or even one thing only: for Mary has taken that good part, which will not be taken away from her.And it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place, and when he came to an end, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, will you gi",e us teachin,ab,u,pr,"yer,",as,ohn d
20860,"And he said to them, When you say your prayers, say, Father, may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come.",,,,,,,
20861,Give us every day bread for our needs.,,,,,,,
20862,"May we have forgiveness for our sins, as we make free all those who are in debt to us. And let us not be put to the test.",,,,,,,
20863,"And he said to them, Which of you, having a friend, would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him, Friend, let me have three cakes of bread;",,,,,,,
20864,"Because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to put before him;",,,,,,,
20865,"And he, from inside the house, would say in answer, Do not be a trouble to me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; it is not possible for me to get up and give to you?",,,,,,,
20866,"I say to you, Though he will not get up and give to him, because he is his friend, still, if he keeps on making his request, he will get up and give him as much as he has need of.",,,,,,,
20867,"And I say to you, Make requests, and they will be answered; what you are searching for, you will get; when you give the sign, the door will be open to you.",,,,,,,
20868,"For to everyone who makes a request, it will be given; and he who is searching will get his desire; and to him who gives the sign, the door will be open.",,,,,,,
20869,"And which of you, being a father, will give a stone to his son, who makes request for bread? or for a fish, will give him a snake?",,,,,,,
20870,"Or for an egg, will give him a scorpion?",,,,,,,
20871,"If, then, you who are evil are able to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who make request to him?",,,,,,,
20872,And he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking. And it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking; and the people were full of wonder.,,,,,,,
20873,"But some of them said, He sends out evil spirits by Beelzebul, the ruler of evil spirits.",,,,,,,
20874,"And others, testing him, were looking for a sign from heaven from him.",,,,,,,
20875,"But he, having knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom in which there is division is made waste; and a house in which there is division comes to destruction.",,,,,,,
20876,"If, then, Satan is at war with himself, how will he keep his kingdom? because you say that I send evil spirits out of men by the help of Beelzebul.",,,,,,,
20877,"And if I, by Beelzebul, send out evil spirits, by whose help do your sons send them out? so let them be your judges.",,,,,,,
20878,"But if I, by the finger of God, send out evil spirits, then the kingdom of God has overtaken you.",,,,,,,
20879,"When the strong man armed keeps watch over his house, then his goods are safe:",,,,,,,
20880,"But when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him, he takes away his instruments of war, in which he had put his faith, and makes division of his goods.",,,,,,,
20881,"He who is not with me is against me, and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away.",,,,,,,
20882,"The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of a man, goes through dry places, looking for rest; and when he does not get it, he says, I will go back to my house from which I came.",,,,,,,
20883,"And when he comes, he sees that it has been made fair and clean.",,,,,,,
20884,"Then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they go in, and take their places there: and the last condition of that man is worse than the first.",,,,,,,
20885,"And it came about that when he said these things, a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice, Happy is the body which gave you birth, and the breasts from which you took milk.",,,,,,,
20886,"But he said, More happy are they who give hearing to the word of God and keep it.",,,,,,,
20887,"And when a great number of people came together to him, he said, This generation is an evil generation: it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.",,,,,,,
20888,"For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of man be to this generation.",,,,,,,
20889,The queen of the South will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation: for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon; and now something greater than Solomon is here.,,,,,,,
20890,The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation: for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of Jonah; but now something greater than Jonah is here.,,,,,,,
20891,"No man, when the light has been lighted, puts it in a secret place, or under a vessel, but on its table, so that those who come in may see the light.",,,,,,,
20892,"The light of the body is the eye: when your eye is true, all your body is full of light; but when it is evil, your body is dark.",,,,,,,
20893,So take care that the light which is in you is not dark.,,,,,,,
20894,"If, then, all your body is light, with no part of it dark, it will be completely full of light, as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light.",,,,,,,
20895,"Now, while he was talking, a Pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him; and he went in and took his seat at the meal.",,,,,,,
20896,"And when the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself.",,,,,,,
20897,"And the Lord said to him, You Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean; but inside you are thieves and full of evil.",,,,,,,
20898,O you foolish ones! did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside?,,,,,,,
20899,"But if you give to the poor such things as you are able, then all things are clean to you.",,,,,,,
20900,"But a curse is on you, Pharisees! for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant, and give no thought to right and the love of God; but it is right for you to do these things, and not let the others be undone.",,,,,,,
20901,"A curse is on you, Pharisees! for your desires are for the most important seats in the Synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the market-place.",,,,,,,
20902,"A curse is on you! for you are like the resting-places of dead men, which are not seen, and men go walking over them without knowledge of it.",,,,,,,
20903,"And one of the teachers of the law, answering, said to him, Master, in saying this, you give a bad name to us as to them.",,,,,,,
20904,"And he said, A curse is on you, teachers of the law! for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them, you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them.",,,,,,,
20905,"A curse is on you! for you make resting-places for the bodies of the prophets, but your fathers put them to death.",,,,,,,
20906,So you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers; for they put them to death and you make their last resting-places.,,,,,,,
20907,"For this reason the wisdom of God has said, I will send them prophets and teachers, and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains;",,,,,,,
20908,So that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days;,,,,,,,
20909,"From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who was put to death between the altar and the Temple. Yes, I say to you, It will come on this generation.",,,,,,,
20910,"A curse is on you, teachers of the law! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you did not go in yourselves, and you got in the way of those who were going in.",,,,,,,
20911,"And when he had come out of that place, the scribes and the Pharisees came round him angrily, questioning him about more things;",,,,,,,
20912,"And watching him, for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him.At that time, when thousands of the people had come together, in such numbers that they were crushing one another, he said first to his disciples, Have nothing",to do with t,e l,a,en,f th,Ph,risee
20913,"But nothing is covered up, which will not come to light, or secret, which will not be made clear.",,,,,,,
20914,"So, whatever you have said in the dark, will come to men's hearing in the light, and what you have said secretly inside the house, will be made public from the house-tops.",,,,,,,
20915,"And I say to you, my friends, Have no fear of those who may put the body to death, and are able to do no more than that.",,,,,,,
20916,"But I will make clear to you of whom you are to be in fear: of him who after death has power to send you to hell; yes, truly I say, Have fear of him.",,,,,,,
20917,Are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings? and God has every one of them in mind.,,,,,,,
20918,But even the hairs of your head are numbered. Have no fear: you are of more value than a flock of sparrows.,,,,,,,
20919,"And I say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men, the Son of man will give witness before the angels of God.",,,,,,,
20920,"But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me, I will say that I have no knowledge of him before the angels of God.",,,,,,,
20921,"And if anyone says a word against the Son of man, he will have forgiveness: but for him who says evil words against the Holy Spirit, there will be no forgiveness.",,,,,,,
20922,"And when they take you before the Synagogues and the authorities and the rulers, take no thought about what answers you will give, or what you will say:",,,,,,,
20923,For the Holy Spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say.,,,,,,,
20924,"And one of the people said to him, Master, give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me.",,,,,,,
20925,"But he said, Man, who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you?",,,,,,,
20926,"And he said to them, Take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property; for a man's life is not made up of the number of things which he has.",,,,,,,
20927,"And he said to them, in a story, The land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile:",,,,,,,
20928,"And he said to himself, What is to be done? for I have no place in which to put all my fruit.",,,,,,,
20929,"And he said, This I will do: I will take down my store-houses and make greater ones, and there I will put all my grain and my goods.",,,,,,,
20930,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have a great amount of goods in store, enough for a number of years; be at rest, take food and wine and be happy.",,,,,,,
20931,"But God said to him, You foolish one, tonight I will take your soul from you, and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together?",,,,,,,
20932,"So that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself, and has not wealth in the eyes of God.",,,,,,,
20933,"And he said to his disciples, For this reason I say to you, Take no thought for your life, about what food you will take, or for your body, how it may be clothed.",,,,,,,
20934,"Is not life more than food, and the body than its clothing?",,,,,,,
20935,"Give thought to the ravens; they do not put seeds into the earth, or get together grain; they have no store-houses or buildings; and God gives them their food: of how much greater value are you than the birds!",,,,,,,
20936,And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller?,,,,,,,
20937,"If, then, you are not able to do even that which is least, why are you troubled about the rest?",,,,,,,
20938,"Give thought to the flowers: they do no work, they make no thread; and still I say to you, Even Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these.",,,,,,,
20939,"But if God gives such clothing to the grass in the field, which today is living, and tomorrow will be burned in the oven, how much more will he give clothing to you, O men of little faith?",,,,,,,
20940,"And do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink, and let not your mind be full of doubts.",,,,,,,
20941,For the nations of the world go in search of all these things: but your Father has knowledge that you have need of them.,,,,,,,
20942,"But let your chief care be for his kingdom, and these other things will be given to you in addition.",,,,,,,
20943,"Have no fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.",,,,,,,
20944,"Give what property you have in exchange for money, and give the money to the poor; make for yourselves money-bags which will not get old, wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever, where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction",,,,,,,
20945,"For where your wealth is, there will your heart be.",,,,,,,
20946,"Be ready, dressed as for a journey, with your lights burning.",,,,,,,
20947,"And be like men who are looking for their lord, when he comes back from the bride-feast; so that when he comes to the door, it will be open to him quickly.",,,,,,,
20948,"Happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes; truly I say to you, he will make himself their servant and, placing them at the table, he will come out and give them food.",,,,,,,
20949,"And if he comes in the second division of the night or in the third, and they are watching for him, happy are those servants.",,,,,,,
20950,"But be certain of this, that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming, he would have been watching, and would not have let his house be broken into.",,,,,,,
20951,So be ready: for the Son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him.,,,,,,,
20952,"And Peter said to him, Lord, are these words said to us only, or to all men?",,,,,,,
20953,"And the Lord said, Who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family, to give them their food at the right time?",,,,,,,
20954,"Happy is that servant who, when his lord comes, is doing so.",,,,,,,
20955,"Truly I say to you, he will put him in control of all his goods.",,,,,,,
20956,"But if that servant says to himself, My lord is a long time coming; and goes about giving blows to the men-servants and the women-servants, feasting and taking overmuch wine;",,,,,,,
20957,"The lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him, and at an hour when he is not ready for him, and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith;",,,,,,,
20958,"And the servant who had knowledge of his lord's desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered, will be given a great number of blows;",,,,,,,
20959,"But he who, without knowledge, did things for which punishment is given, will get only a small number of blows. The man to whom much is given, will have to give much; if much is given into his care, of him more will be requested.",,,,,,,
20960,"I came to send a fire on the earth, and it may even now have been lighted.",,,,,,,
20961,But there is a baptism which I have to undergo; and how am I kept back till it is complete!,,,,,,,
20962,"Is it your opinion that I have come to give peace on earth? I say to you, No, but division:",,,,,,,
20963,"For from this time, a family of five in one house will be on opposite sides, three against two and two against three.",,,,,,,
20964,"They will be at war, the father against his son, and the son against his father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.",,,,,,,
20965,"Then he said to the people, When you see a cloud coming up in the west, straight away you say, There will be rain; and so it is.",,,,,,,
20966,"And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, There will be heat; and so it is.",,,,,,,
20967,O false ones! the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you; how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you?,,,,,,,
20968,"And why are you, in your hearts, unable to be judges of what is right?",,,,,,,
20969,"For if anyone has a cause at law against you, and you are going with him before the ruler, make an attempt, on the way, to come to an agreement with him, for if you do not, he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police, an",they will p,t y,u,in,riso,.,
20970,"I say to you, You will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing.Now some people who were there at that time, gave him an account of how the blood of some Galilaeans had been mixed by Pilate with their offerings.",,,,,,,
20971,"And he, in answer, said to them, Are you of the opinion that these Galilaeans were worse than all other Galilaeans, because these things were done to them?",,,,,,,
20972,"I say to you, It is not so: but if your hearts are not changed, you will all come to the same end.",,,,,,,
20973,"Or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of Siloam, were they worse than all the other men living in Jerusalem?",,,,,,,
20974,"I say to you, It is not so: but if your hearts are not changed, you will all come to an end in the same way.",,,,,,,
20975,"And he made up this story for them: A certain man had a fig-tree in his garden, and he came to get fruit from it, and there was no fruit.",,,,,,,
20976,"And he said to the gardener, See, for three years I have been looking for fruit from this tree, and I have not had any: let it be cut down; why is it taking up space?",,,,,,,
20977,"And he said, Lord, let it be for this year, and I will have the earth turned up round it, and put animal waste on it, to make it fertile:",,,,,,,
20978,"And if, after that, it has fruit, it is well; if not, let it be cut down.",,,,,,,
20979,And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath.,,,,,,,
20980,"And there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years; she was bent, and was not able to make herself straight.",,,,,,,
20981,"And when Jesus saw her, he said to her, Woman, you are made free from your disease.",,,,,,,
20982,"And he put his hands on her, and she was made straight, and gave praise to God.",,,,,,,
20983,"And the ruler of the Synagogue was angry because Jesus had made her well on the Sabbath, and he said to the people, There are six days in which men may do work: so come on those days to be made well, and not on the Sabbath.",,,,,,,
20984,"But the Lord gave him an answer and said, O you false men! do you not, every one of you, on the Sabbath, let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water?",,,,,,,
20985,"And is it not right for this daughter of Abraham, who has been in the power of Satan for eighteen years, to be made free on the Sabbath?",,,,,,,
20986,"And when he said these things, those who were against him were shamed, and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him.",,,,,,,
20987,"Then he said, What is the kingdom of God like? what comparison may I make of it?",,,,,,,
20988,"It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden, and it became a tree, and the birds of heaven made their resting-places in its branches.",,,,,,,
20989,"And again he said, What is the kingdom of God like?",,,,,,,
20990,"It is like leaven, which a woman put into three measures of meal, and it was all leavened.",,,,,,,
20991,"And he went on his way, through towns and country places, teaching and journeying to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
20992,"And someone said to him, Lord, will only a small number have salvation? And he said to them,",,,,,,,
20993,"Do your best to go in by the narrow door, for I say to you, A number will make the attempt to go in, but will not be able to do so.",,,,,,,
20994,"When the master of the house has got up, and the door has been shut, and you, still outside, give blows on the door, saying, Lord, let us in; he will make answer and say, I have no knowledge of where you come from.",,,,,,,
20995,"Then you will say, We have taken food and drink with you, and you were teaching in our streets.",,,,,,,
20996,"But he will say, Truly, I have no knowledge of you or where you come from; go away from me, you workers of evil.",,,,,,,
20997,"There will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are shut outside.",,,,,,,
20998,"And they will come from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south, and take their places in the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
20999,"And the last will be first, and the first will be last.",,,,,,,
21000,"At that time, certain Pharisees came to him and said, Go away from this place, because Herod's purpose is to put you to death.",,,,,,,
21001,"And he said, Go and say to that fox, I send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow, and on the third day my work will be complete.",,,,,,,
21002,"But I have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day, for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
21003,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, putting to death the prophets, and stoning those who were sent to her! again and again would I have taken your children to myself, as a bird takes her young ones under her wings, but you would not!",,,,,,,
21004,"Now see, your house is waste, and I say to you, You will not see me again till you say, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord.And it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath, to have a meal, t",ey were watc,ing,h,m.,,,
21005,And a certain man was there who had a disease.,,,,,,,
21006,"And Jesus, answering, said to the scribes and Pharisees, Is it right to make people well on the Sabbath or not?",,,,,,,
21007,But they said nothing. And he made him well and sent him away.,,,,,,,
21008,"And he said to them, Which of you, whose ox or ass has got into a water-hole, will not straight away get him out on the Sabbath?",,,,,,,
21009,And they had no answer to that question.,,,,,,,
21010,"And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast, when he saw how they took the best seats; saying to them,",,,,,,,
21011,"When you get a request to come to a feast, do not take the best seat, for a more important man than you may be coming,",,,,,,,
21012,"And then the giver of the feast will come to you and say, Give your place to this man; and you, with shame, will have to take the lowest seat.",,,,,,,
21013,"But when you come, go and take the lowest seat, so that when the giver of the feast comes, he may say to you, Friend, come up higher; and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there.",,,,,,,
21014,"For every man who gives himself a high place will be put down, but he who takes a low place will be lifted up.",,,,,,,
21015,"And he said to the master of the house, When you give a feast, do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth, for they may give a feast for you, and so you will get a reward.",,,,,,,
21016,"But when you give a feast, send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body:",,,,,,,
21017,"And you will have a blessing, because they will not be able to give you any payment, and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead.",,,,,,,
21018,"And, hearing these words, one of those who were at table with him said to him, Happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
21019,"And he said to them, A certain man gave a great feast, and sent word of it to a number of people.",,,,,,,
21020,"And when the time had come, he sent his servants to say to them, Come, for all things are now ready.",,,,,,,
21021,"And they all gave reasons why they were not able to come. The first said to him, I have got a new field, and it is necessary for me to go and see it: I am full of regret that I am unable to come.",,,,,,,
21022,"And another said, I have got some cattle, and I am going to make a test of them: I am full of regret that I am unable to come.",,,,,,,
21023,"And another said, I have been married, and so I am not able to come.",,,,,,,
21024,"And the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things. Then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant, Go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor, the blind, and those who are broken in body.",,,,,,,
21025,"And the servant said, Lord, your orders have been done, and still there is room.",,,,,,,
21026,"And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the roads and the fields, and make them come in, so that my house may be full.",,,,,,,
21027,For I say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast.,,,,,,,
21028,Now a great number of people went with him.,,,,,,,
21029,"And turning round, he said to them, If any man comes to me, and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and even for his life, he may not be my disciple.",,,,,,,
21030,Whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple.,,,,,,,
21031,"For which of you, desiring to put up a tower, does not first give much thought to the price, if he will have enough to make it complete?",,,,,,,
21032,"For fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end, all who see it will be laughing at him,",,,,,,,
21033,"And saying, This man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete.",,,,,,,
21034,"Or what king, going to war with another king, will not first take thought if he will be strong enough, with ten thousand men, to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand?",,,,,,,
21035,"Or while the other is still a great distance away, he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace.",,,,,,,
21036,And so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple.,,,,,,,
21037,"For salt is good, but if the taste goes from it, of what use is it?",,,,,,,
21038,"It is no good for the land or for the place of waste; no one has a use for it. He who has ears, let him give ear.Now all the tax-farmers and sinners came near to give ear to him.",,,,,,,
21039,"And the Pharisees and scribes were angry, saying, This man gives approval to sinners, and takes food with them.",,,,,,,
21040,"And he made a story for them, saying,",,,,,,,
21041,"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if one of them gets loose and goes away, will not let the ninety-nine be in the waste land by themselves, and go after the wandering one, till he sees where it is?",,,,,,,
21042,"And when he has got it again, he takes it in his arms with joy.",,,,,,,
21043,"And when he gets back to his house, he sends for his neighbours and friends, saying to them, Be glad with me, for I have got back my sheep which had gone away.",,,,,,,
21044,"I say to you that even so there will be more joy in heaven when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing, than for ninety-nine good men, who have no need of a change of heart.",,,,,,,
21045,"Or what woman, having ten bits of silver, if one bit has gone from her hands, will not get a light, and go through her house, searching with care till she sees it?",,,,,,,
21046,"And when she has it again, she gets her friends and neighbours together, saying, Be glad with me, for I have got back the bit of silver which had gone from me.",,,,,,,
21047,"Even so, I say to you, There is joy among the angels of God, when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing.",,,,,,,
21048,"And he said, A certain man had two sons:",,,,,,,
21049,"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me that part of your property which will be mine. And he made division of his goods between them.",,,,,,,
21050,"And not long after, the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far-away country, and there all his money went in foolish living.",,,,,,,
21051,"And when everything was gone, there was no food to be had in that country, and he was in need.",,,,,,,
21052,"And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country, and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food.",,,,,,,
21053,"And so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs' food, and no one gave him anything.",,,,,,,
21054,"But when he came to his senses, he said, What numbers of my father's servants have bread enough, and more, while I am near to death here through need of food!",,,,,,,
21055,"I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes:",,,,,,,
21056,I am no longer good enough to be named your son: make me like one of your servants.,,,,,,,
21057,"And he got up and went to his father. But while he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss.",,,,,,,
21058,"And his son said to him, Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes: I am no longer good enough to be named your son.",,,,,,,
21059,"But the father said to his servants, Get out the first robe quickly, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet:",,,,,,,
21060,"And get the fat young ox and put it to death, and let us have a feast, and be glad.",,,,,,,
21061,"For this, my son, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away from me, and has come back. And they were full of joy.",,,,,,,
21062,"Now the older son was in the field: and when he came near the house, the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears.",,,,,,,
21063,"And he sent for one of the servants, questioning him about what it might be.",,,,,,,
21064,"And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely.",,,,,,,
21065,But he was angry and would not go in; and his father came out and made a request to him to come in.,,,,,,,
21066,"But he made answer and said to his father, See, all these years I have been your servant, doing your orders in everything: and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends:",,,,,,,
21067,"But when this your son came, who has been wasting your property with bad women, you put to death the fat young ox for him.",,,,,,,
21068,"And he said to him, Son, you are with me at all times, and all I have is yours.",,,,,,,
21069,"But it was right to be glad and to have a feast; for this your brother, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away and has come back.And another time he said to the disciples, There was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant; and it was sai",to him that,thi,,erv,nt w,s w,sting
21070,"And he sent for him and said, What is this which is said about you? give me an account of all you have done, for you will no longer be the manager of my property.",,,,,,,
21071,"And the servant said to himself, What am I to do now that my lord takes away my position? I have not enough strength for working in the fields, and I would be shamed if I made requests for money from people in the streets.",,,,,,,
21072,"I have come to a decision what to do, so that when I am put out of my position they will take me into their houses.",,,,,,,
21073,"And sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first, What is the amount of your debt to my lord?",,,,,,,
21074,"And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said, Take your account straight away and put down fifty.",,,,,,,
21075,"Then he said to another, What is the amount of your debt? And he said, A hundred measures of grain. And he said to him, Take your account and put down eighty.",,,,,,,
21076,"And his lord was pleased with the false servant, because he had been wise; for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light.",,,,,,,
21077,"And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life, so that when it comes to an end, you may be taken into the eternal resting-places.",,,,,,,
21078,"He who is true in a little, is true in much; he who is false in small things, is false in great.",,,,,,,
21079,"If, then, you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life, who will give into your care the true wealth?",,,,,,,
21080,"And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people, who will give you that which is yours?",,,,,,,
21081,No man may be a servant to two masters: for he will have hate for the one and love for the other; or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other. You may not be servants of God and of wealth.,,,,,,,
21082,"And the Pharisees, who had a great love of money, hearing these things, were making sport of him.",,,,,,,
21083,"And he said, You take care to seem right in the eyes of men, but God sees your hearts: and those things which are important in the opinion of men, are evil in the eyes of God.",,,,,,,
21084,"The law and the prophets were till John: but then came the preaching of the kingdom of God, and everyone makes his way into it by force.",,,,,,,
21085,But heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out.,,,,,,,
21086,"Everyone who puts away his wife and takes another, is a false husband: and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away, is no true husband to her.",,,,,,,
21087,"Now there was a certain man of great wealth, who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen, and was shining and glad every day.",,,,,,,
21088,"And a certain poor man, named Lazarus, was stretched out at his door, full of wounds,",,,,,,,

21093,"But Abraham said, Keep in mind, my son, that when you were living, you had your good things, while Lazarus had evil things: but now, he is comforted and you are in pain.",,,,,,,
21094,"And in addition, there is a deep division fixed between us and you, so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so, and no one may come from you to us.",,,,,,,
21095,"And he said, Father, it is my request that you will send him to my father's house;",,,,,,,

21105,"But which of you, having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep, will say to him, when he comes in from the field, Come now and be seated and have a meal,",,,,,,,
21106,"Will he not say, Get a meal for me, and make yourself ready and see to my needs till I have had my food and drink; and after that you may have yours?",,,,,,,
21107,Does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered?,,,,,,,

21117,"And he said to him, Get up, and go on your way; your faith has made you well.",,,,,,,
21118,"And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come, he gave them an answer and said, The kingdom of God will not come through observation:",,,,,,,
21119,"And men will not say, See, it is here! or, There! for the kingdom of God is among you.",,,,,,,
21120,"And he said to his disciples, The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but you will not see it.",,,,,,,

21175,"What would you have me do for you? And he said, Lord, that I may be able to see again.",,,,,,,
21176,"And Jesus said, See again: your faith has made you well.",,,,,,,

21178,"A man, named Zacchaeus, who was the chief tax-farmer, and a man of wealth,",,,,,,,
21179,"Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus, and was not able to do so, because of the people, for he was a small man.",,,,,,,
21180,"And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him, for he was going that way.",,,,,,,
21181,"And when Jesus came to the place, looking up, he said to him, Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I am coming to your house today.",,,,,,,
21182,"And he came down quickly, and took him into his house with joy.",,,,,,,
21183,"And when they saw it, they were all angry, saying, He has gone into the house of a sinner.",,,,,,,
21184,"And Zacchaeus, waiting before him, said to the Lord, See, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone wrongly, I give him back four times as much.",,,,,,,
21185,"And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, for even he is a son of Abraham.",,,,,,,
21186,"For the Son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way, and to be their Saviour.",,,,,,,
21187,"And while they were giving ear to these words, he made another story for them, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of God was coming straight away.",,,,,,,
21188,"So he said, A certain man of high birth went into a far-away country to get a kingdom for himself, and to come back.",,,,,,,
21189,"And he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them, Do business with this till I come.",,,,,,,
21190,"But his people had no love for him, and sent representatives after him, saying, We will not have this man for our ruler.",,,,,,,
21191,"And when he came back again, having got his kingdom, he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him, so that he might have an account of what business they had done.",,,,,,,
21192,"And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your pound has made ten pounds.",,,,,,,
21193,"And he said to him, You have done well, O good servant: because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns.",,,,,,,
21194,"And another came, saying, Your pound has made five pounds.",,,,,,,
21195,"And he said, You will be ruler over five towns.",,,,,,,
21196,"And another came, saying, Lord, here is your pound, which I put away in a cloth;",,,,,,,
21197,"Because I was in fear of you, for you are a hard man: you take up what you have not put down, and get in grain where you have not put seed.",,,,,,,
21198,"He said to him, By the words of your mouth you will be judged, you bad servant. You had knowledge that I am a hard man, taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed;",,,,,,,
21199,"Why then did you not put my money in a bank, so that when I came I would get it back with interest?",,,,,,,
21200,"And he said to the others who were near, Take the pound away from him, and give it to the man who has ten.",,,,,,,
21201,"And they say to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.",,,,,,,
21202,"And I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.",,,,,,,
21203,"And as for those who were against me, who would not have me for their ruler, let them come here, and be put to death before me.",,,,,,,
21204,"And when he had said this, he went on in front of them, going up to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
21205,"And it came about that when he got near Beth-phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,",,,,,,,
21206,"Saying, Go into the little town in front of you, and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose and take him.",,,,,,,
21207,"And if anyone says to you, Why are you taking him? say, The Lord has need of him.",,,,,,,
21208,"And those whom he sent went away, and it was as he said.",,,,,,,
21209,"And when they were getting the young ass, the owners of it said to them, Why are you taking the young ass?",,,,,,,
21210,"And they said, The Lord has need of him.",,,,,,,
21211,"And they took him to Jesus, and they put their clothing on the ass, and Jesus got on to him.",,,,,,,
21212,And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him.,,,,,,,
21213,"And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives, all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy, because of all the great works which they had seen;",,,,,,,
21214,"Saying, A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven and glory in the highest.",,,,,,,
21215,"And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him, Master, make your disciples be quiet.",,,,,,,
21216,"And he said in answer, I say to you, if these men keep quiet, the very stones will be crying out.",,,,,,,
21217,"And when he got near and saw the town, he was overcome with weeping for it,",,,,,,,
21218,"Saying, If you, even you, had knowledge today, of the things which give peace! but you are not able to see them.",,,,,,,
21219,"For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you, and come all round you and keep you in on every side,",,,,,,,
21220,"And will make you level with the earth, and your children with you; and there will not be one stone resting on another in you, because you did not see that it was your day of mercy.",,,,,,,
21221,"And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there,",,,,,,,
21222,"Saying to them, It has been said, My house is to be a house of prayer, but you have made it a hole of thieves.",,,,,,,
21223,And every day he was teaching in the Temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death;,,,,,,,
21224,"But they were not able to do anything, because the people all kept near him, being greatly interested in his words.And it came about on one of those days, when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news,",,,,,,,
21225,"That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said, Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority.",,,,,,,
21226,"And in answer he said to them, I will put a question to you, and do you give me an answer:",,,,,,,
21227,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men?",,,,,,,
21228,"And they said among themselves, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why did you not have faith in him?",,,,,,,
21229,"But if we say, Of men; we will be stoned by the people, for they are certain that John was a prophet.",,,,,,,
21230,And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from.,,,,,,,
21231,"And Jesus said, And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things.",,,,,,,
21232,And he gave the people this story: A man made a vine-garden and gave the use of it to some field-workers and went into another country for a long time.,,,,,,,
21233,And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing.,,,,,,,
21234,"And he sent another servant, and they gave blows to him in the same way, and put shame on him, and sent him away with nothing.",,,,,,,
21235,"And he sent a third, and they gave him wounds and put him out.",,,,,,,
21236,"And the lord of the garden said, What am I to do? I will send my dearly loved son; they may give respect to him.",,,,,,,
21237,"But when the workmen saw him, they said to one another, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property: let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours.",,,,,,,
21238,And driving him out of the garden they put him to death. Now what will the lord do to these workmen?,,,,,,,
21239,"He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others. And when he said this, they said, May it not be so.",,,,,,,
21240,"But he, looking on them, said, Is it not in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has become the chief stone of the building?",,,,,,,
21241,"Everyone falling on that stone will be broken, but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust.",,,,,,,
21242,"And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour; and they were in fear of the people, for they saw that he had made up this story against them.",,,,,,,
21243,"And they kept watch on him, and sent out secret representatives, who were acting the part of good men, in order that they might get something from his words, on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler.",,,,,,,
21244,"And they put a question to him, saying, Master, we are certain that your teaching and your words are right, and that you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God:",,,,,,,
21245,Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not?,,,,,,,
21246,"But he saw through their trick and said to them,",,,,,,,
21247,"Let me see a penny. Whose image and name are on it? And they said, Caesar's.",,,,,,,
21248,"And he said, Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.",,,,,,,
21249,"And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people: but they were full of wonder at his answer, and said nothing.",,,,,,,
21250,"And some of the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no coming back from the dead; and they said to him,",,,,,,,
21251,"Master, Moses said that if a man's brother comes to his end, having a wife, but no children, his brother is to take the wife, and get a family for his brother.",,,,,,,
21252,"Now there were seven brothers, and the first had a wife and came to his end, having no children;",,,,,,,
21253,And the second;,,,,,,,
21254,"And the third took her; and in the same way, all the seven, without having any children, came to their end.",,,,,,,
21255,"And last of all, the woman came to her end.",,,,,,,
21256,"When they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for all the seven had her.",,,,,,,
21257,"And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world are married and have wives;",,,,,,,
21258,"But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come, and to come back from the dead, have no wives, and are not married;",,,,,,,
21259,"And death has no more power over them, for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being of those who will come back from the dead.",,,,,,,
21260,"But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life, saying, in the story of the burning thorn-tree, The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.",,,,,,,
21261,Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all men are living to him.,,,,,,,
21262,"And some of the scribes, in answer to this, said, Master, you have said well.",,,,,,,
21263,And they had fear of putting any more questions to him.,,,,,,,
21264,"And he said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David?",,,,,,,
21265,"For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Take your seat at my right hand,",,,,,,,
21266,Till I put under your feet all those who are against you.,,,,,,,
21267,"David then gives him the name of Lord, so how is it possible for him to be his son?",,,,,,,
21268,"And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,",,,,,,,
21269,"Keep away from the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes, and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places, and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts;",,,,,,,
21270,"Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers; they will get a greater punishment.And looking up, he saw the men of wealth putting their offerings in the money-box.",,,,,,,
21271,And he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing.,,,,,,,
21272,"And he said, Truly I say to you, This poor widow has given more than all of them:",,,,,,,
21273,"For they gave out of their wealth, having more than enough for themselves: but she, even out of her need, has put in all her living.",,,,,,,
21274,"And some were talking about the Temple, how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings, but he said,",,,,,,,
21275,"As for these things which you see, the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another, but all will be broken down.",,,,,,,
21276,"And they said to him, Master, when will these things be? and what sign will there be when these events are to take place?",,,,,,,
21277,"And he said, Take care that you are not tricked: for a number of people will come in my name, saying, I am he; and, The time is near: do not go after them.",,,,,,,
21278,"And when news of wars and troubled times comes to your ears, have no fear; for these things have to be, but the end will not be now.",,,,,,,
21279,"Then he said to them, Nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom:",,,,,,,
21280,"There will be great earth-shocks and outbursts of disease in a number of places, and men will be without food; and there will be wonders and great signs from heaven.",,,,,,,
21281,"But before all this, they will take you and be very cruel to you, giving you up to the Synagogues and to prisons, taking you before kings and rulers, because of my name.",,,,,,,
21282,And it will be turned to a witness for you.,,,,,,,
21283,"So take care not to be troubled before the time comes, about what answers you will give:",,,,,,,
21284,"For I will give you words and wisdom, so that not one of those who are against you will be able to get the better of you, or to put you in the wrong.",,,,,,,

21288,"By going through all these things, you will keep your lives.",,,,,,,
21289,"But when you see armies all round about Jerusalem, then be certain that her destruction is near.",,,,,,,
21290,Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains; and those who are in the middle of the town go out; and let not those who are in the country come in.,,,,,,,
21291,"For these are the days of punishment, in which all the things in the Writings will be put into effect.",,,,,,,
21292,"It will be hard for women who are with child, and for her with a baby at the breast, in those days. For great trouble will come on the land, and wrath on this people.",,,,,,,
21293,"And they will be put to death with the sword, and will be taken as prisoners into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be crushed under the feet of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles are complete.",,,,,,,
21294,"And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and on the earth, fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves;",,,,,,,

21297,"But when these things come about, let your heads be lifted up, because your salvation is near.",,,,,,,
21298,"And he made a story for them: See the fig-tree, and all the trees;",,,,,,,
21299,"When they put out their young leaves, you take note of it, and it is clear to you that summer is coming.",,,,,,,
21300,"In the same way, when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of God is near.",,,,,,,
21301,"Truly I say to you, This generation will not come to an end till all things are complete.",,,,,,,
21302,"Heaven and earth will come to an end, but my words will not come to an end.",,,,,,,
21303,"But give attention to yourselves, for fear that your hearts become over-full of the pleasures of food and wine, and the cares of this life, and that day may come on you suddenly, and take you as in a net:",,,,,,,
21304,For so it will come on all those who are living on the face of all the earth.,,,,,,,
21305,"But keep watch at all times with prayer, that you may be strong enough to come through all these things and take your place before the Son of man.",,,,,,,
21306,And every day he was teaching in the Temple and every night he went out to the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives to take his rest.,,,,,,,
21307,"And all the people came early in the morning to give ear to his words in the Temple.Now the feast of unleavened bread was near, which is called the Passover.",,,,,,,
21308,"And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death, but they went in fear of the people.",,,,,,,
21309,"And Satan came into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve.",,,,,,,
21310,"And he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers, about how he might give him up to them.",,,,,,,
21311,"And they were glad, and undertook to give him money.",,,,,,,
21312,"And he made an agreement with them to give him up to them, if he got a chance, when the people were not present.",,,,,,,
21313,"And the day of unleavened bread came, when the Passover lamb is put to death.",,,,,,,
21314,"And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make the Passover ready for us, so that we may take it.",,,,,,,
21315,"And they said to him, Where are we to get it ready?",,,,,,,
21316,"And he said to them, When you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water; go after him into the house into which he goes.",,,,,,,
21317,"And say to the master of the house, The Master says, Where is the guest-room, where I may take the Passover with my disciples?",,,,,,,
21318,And he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats: there make ready.,,,,,,,
21319,"And they went, and it was as he had said: and they made the Passover ready.",,,,,,,
21320,"And when the time had come, he took his seat, and the Apostles with him.",,,,,,,
21321,"And he said, I have had a great desire to keep this Passover with you before I come to my death;",,,,,,,
21322,"For I say to you, I will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
21323,"And he took a cup and, having given praise, he said, Make division of this among yourselves;",,,,,,,
21324,"For I say to you, I will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come.",,,,,,,
21325,"And he took bread and, having given praise, he gave it to them when it had been broken, saying, This is my body, which is given for you: do this in memory of me.",,,,,,,
21326,"And in the same way, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new testament, made with my blood which is given for you.",,,,,,,
21327,But the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table.,,,,,,,
21328,"For it will be done to the Son of man after the purpose of God, but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up.",,,,,,,
21329,And they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing.,,,,,,,
21330,And there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.,,,,,,,
21331,"And he said, The kings of the Gentiles are lords over them, and those who have authority are given names of honour.",,,,,,,
21332,"But let it not be so with you; but he who is greater, let him become like the younger; and he who is chief, like a servant.",,,,,,,
21333,"For which is greater, the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him? is it not the guest? but I am among you as a servant.",,,,,,,
21334,But you are those who have kept with me through my troubles;,,,,,,,
21335,"And I will give you a kingdom as my Father has given one to me,",,,,,,,
21336,"So that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated like kings, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",,,,,,,
21337,"Simon, Simon, Satan has made a request to have you, so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested:",,,,,,,
21338,"But I have made prayer for you, that your faith may not go from you: and when you are turned again, make your brothers strong.",,,,,,,
21339,"And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.",,,,,,,
21340,"And he said, I say to you, Peter, before the cock's second cry today, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.",,,,,,,
21341,"And he said to them, When I sent you out without money or bag or shoes, were you in need of anything? And they said, Nothing.",,,,,,,
21342,"And he said to them, But now, he who has a money-bag, or a bag for food, let him take it: and he who has not, let him give his coat for money and get a sword.",,,,,,,
21343,"For I say to you that these words will be put into effect in me, And he was numbered among the evil-doers: for what has been said in the Writings about me has an end.",,,,,,,
21344,"And they said, Lord, here are two swords. And he said, It is enough.",,,,,,,
21345,"And he came out, and went, as his way was, to the Mountain of Olives, and the disciples went with him.",,,,,,,
21346,"And when he came to the place, he said to them, Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test.",,,,,,,
21347,"And he went a little distance away from them and, falling on his knees in prayer, he said,",,,,,,,
21348,"Father, if it is your pleasure, take this cup from me: but still, let your pleasure, not mine, be done.",,,,,,,
21349,"And an angel from heaven came to him, to give him strength.",,,,,,,
21350,"And being in great trouble of soul, the force of his prayer became stronger, and great drops, like blood, came from him, falling to the earth.",,,,,,,
21351,"And, getting up from prayer, he came to the disciples, and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow.",,,,,,,
21352,"And he said, Why are you sleeping? Get up, and give yourselves to prayer, so that you may not be put to the test.",,,,,,,
21353,"And while he was saying these words, there came a band of people, and Judas, one of the twelve, was in front of them, and he came near to Jesus to give him a kiss.",,,,,,,
21354,"But Jesus said to him, Judas, will you be false to the Son of man with a kiss?",,,,,,,
21355,"And when those who were with him saw what was coming, they said, Lord, may we not make use of our swords?",,,,,,,
21356,"And one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.",,,,,,,
21357,"But Jesus, answering, said, Put up with this, at least. And touching his ear, he made it well.",,,,,,,
21358,"And Jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the Temple and the rulers, who had come against him, Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and sticks?",,,,,,,
21359,"When I was in the Temple with you every day, your hands were not stretched out against me: but this is your hour, and the authority of the dark power.",,,,,,,
21360,And they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest. But Peter went after them at a distance.,,,,,,,
21361,"And a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square, and they were seated together, and Peter was among them.",,,,,,,
21362,"And a certain woman-servant, seeing him in the light of the fire, and looking at him with attention, said, This man was with him.",,,,,,,
21363,"But he said, Woman, it is not true; I have no knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
21364,"And after a little time, another saw him and said, You are one of them; and he said, Man, I am not.",,,,,,,
21365,"And after about an hour, another man said, with decision, Certainly this man was with him, for he is a Galilaean.",,,,,,,
21366,"And Peter said, Man, I have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking. And straight away, while he was saying these words, there came the cry of a cock.",,,,,,,
21367,"And the Lord, turning, gave Peter a look. And the words of the Lord came to Peter's mind, how he had said, This night, before the hour of the cock's cry, you will be false to me three times.",,,,,,,
21368,"And he went out, weeping bitterly.",,,,,,,
21369,"And the men in whose hands Jesus was, made sport of him and gave him blows.",,,,,,,
21370,"And, covering his eyes, they said to him, Are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow?",,,,,,,
21371,And they said a number of other evil things against him.,,,,,,,
21372,"And when it was day, the rulers of the people came together, with the chief priests and the scribes, and they took him before their Sanhedrin, saying,",,,,,,,
21373,"If you are the Christ, say so. But he said, If I say so you will not have belief;",,,,,,,
21374,"And if I put a question to you, you will not give an answer.",,,,,,,
21375,But in the future the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.,,,,,,,
21376,"And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? and he said, You say that I am.",,,,,,,
21377,"And they said, What more need have we of witness? we have the very words of his mouth.And they all went and took him before Pilate.",,,,,,,
21378,"And they made statements against him, saying, This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong, and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar, even saying that he himself is Christ, a king.",,,,,,,
21379,"And Pilate said to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said in answer, You say so.",,,,,,,
21380,"And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people, In my opinion this man has done no wrong.",,,,,,,
21381,"But they became more violent than before, saying, He has made trouble among the people, teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place.",,,,,,,
21382,"But at these words Pilate said, Is the man a Galilaean?",,,,,,,
21383,"And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was in Jerusalem himself at that time.",,,,,,,
21384,"Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad, having for a long time had a desire to see him, for he had had accounts of him, and was hoping to see some wonders done by him.",,,,,,,
21385,"And he put a great number of questions to him, but he said nothing.",,,,,,,
21386,"And the chief priests and the scribes were there, making statements against him violently.",,,,,,,
21387,"And Herod, with the men of his army, put shame on him and made sport of him, and dressing him in shining robes, he sent him back to Pilate.",,,,,,,
21388,"And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another, for before they had been against one another.",,,,,,,
21389,"And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them,",,,,,,,
21390,"You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things: now I, after going into the question before you, see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him:",,,,,,,
21391,"And Herod is of the same opinion, for he has sent him back to us; for, you see, he has done nothing for which I might put him to death.",,,,,,,
21392,And so I will give him punishment and let him go.,,,,,,,
21393,[],,,,,,,
21394,"But with loud voices they said all together, Put this man to death, and make Barabbas free.",,,,,,,
21395,"Now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town, in which there had been loss of life.",,,,,,,
21396,And Pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let Jesus go free.,,,,,,,
21397,"But crying out they said, To the cross with him!",,,,,,,
21398,"And he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has he done? I see no reason for putting him to death: I will give him punishment and let him go.",,,,,,,
21399,"But they went on crying out loudly, Let him be put to death on the cross. And they had their way.",,,,,,,
21400,And Pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect.,,,,,,,
21401,"And in answer to their request, he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death, and Jesus he gave up to their pleasure.",,,,,,,
21402,"And while they were taking him away, they put their hands on Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and made him take the cross after Jesus.",,,,,,,
21403,"And a great band of people went after him, and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him.",,,,,,,
21404,"But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, let not your weeping be for me, but for yourselves and for your children.",,,,,,,
21405,"For the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are those who have had no children, whose bodies have never given birth, whose breasts have never given milk.",,,,,,,
21406,"And they will say to the mountains, Come down on us, and to the hills, Be a cover over us.",,,,,,,
21407,"For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will they do when it is dry?",,,,,,,
21408,"And two others, evil-doers, were taken with him to be put to death.",,,,,,,
21409,"And when they came to the place which is named Golgotha, they put him on the cross, and the evil-doers, one on the right side, and the other on the left.",,,,,,,
21410,"And Jesus said, Father, let them have forgiveness, for they have no knowledge of what they are doing. And they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.",,,,,,,
21411,"And the people were looking on. And the rulers made sport of him, saying, He was a saviour of others; let him do something for himself, if he is the Christ, the man of God's selection.",,,,,,,
21412,"And the men of the army made sport of him, coming to him and giving him bitter wine,",,,,,,,
21413,"And saying, If you are the King of the Jews, get yourself free.",,,,,,,
21414,"And these words were put in writing over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.",,,,,,,
21415,"And one of the evil-doers on the cross, with bitter feeling, said to him, Are you not the Christ? Get yourself and us out of this.",,,,,,,
21416,"But the other, protesting, said, Have you no fear of God? for you have a part in the same punishment,",,,,,,,
21417,"And with reason; for we have the right reward of our acts, but this man has done nothing wrong.",,,,,,,
21418,"And he said, Jesus, keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom.",,,,,,,
21419,"And he said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you will be with me in Paradise.",,,,,,,
21420,And it was now about the sixth hour; and all the land was dark till the ninth hour;,,,,,,,
21421,"The light of the sun went out, and the curtain in the Temple was parted in two.",,,,,,,
21422,"And Jesus gave a loud cry and said, Father, into your hands I give my spirit: and when he had said this, he gave up his spirit.",,,,,,,
21423,"And when the captain saw what was done, he gave praise to God, saying, Without doubt this was an upright man.",,,,,,,
21424,"And all the people who had come together to see it, when they saw the things which were done, went back again making signs of grief.",,,,,,,
21425,"And all his friends and the women who came with him from Galilee, were waiting at a distance, watching these things.",,,,,,,
21426,"Now there was a man named Joseph, a man of authority and a good and upright man",,,,,,,
21427,"(He had not given his approval to their decision or their acts), of Arimathaea, a town of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God:",,,,,,,
21428,This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus.,,,,,,,
21429,"And he took it down, and folding it in a linen cloth, he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body; and no one had ever been put in it.",,,,,,,
21430,Now it was the day of making ready and the Sabbath was coming on.,,,,,,,
21431,And the women who had come with him from Galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest;,,,,,,,
21432,"And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes; and on the Sabbath they took their rest, in agreement with the law.But on the first day of the week, at dawn, they came to the place where his body had been put, taking the spices which they had got r",ady.,,,,,,
21433,And they saw that the stone had been rolled away.,,,,,,,
21434,"And they went in, but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there.",,,,,,,
21435,"And while they were in doubt about it, they saw two men in shining clothing by them:",,,,,,,
21436,"And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear, these said to them, Why are you looking for the living among the dead?",,,,,,,
21437,"He is not here, he has come back to life: have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee, saying,",,,,,,,
21438,"The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evil-doers, and be put to death on the cross, and on the third day he will come back to life.",,,,,,,
21439,"And his words came back into their minds,",,,,,,,
21440,And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others.,,,,,,,
21441,"Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James: and the other women with them said these things to the Apostles.",,,,,,,
21442,"But these words seemed foolish to them, and they had no belief in them.",,,,,,,
21443,"But Peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put, and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place.",,,,,,,
21444,"And then, two of them, on that very day, were going to a little town named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
21445,And they were talking together about all those things which had taken place.,,,,,,,
21446,"And while they were talking and questioning together, Jesus himself came near and went with them.",,,,,,,
21447,But their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him.,,,,,,,
21448,"And he said to them, What are you talking about together while you go?",,,,,,,
21449,"Then stopping, and looking sadly at him, one of them, named Cleopas, said to him, Are you the only man living in Jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time?",,,,,,,
21450,"And he said to them, What things? And they said, The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, great in his acts and his words, before God and all the people:",,,,,,,
21451,And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross.,,,,,,,
21452,But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel. In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place;,,,,,,,
21453,"And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder, for they went early to the place where his body had been put,",,,,,,,
21454,And it was not there; then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living.,,,,,,,
21455,"And some of those who were with us went to the place, and saw that it was as the women had said, but him they did not see.",,,,,,,
21456,"And he said, O foolish men! how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said.",,,,,,,
21457,"Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things, and to come into his glory?",,,,,,,
21458,"And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings, from Moses and from all the prophets, which had to do with himself.",,,,,,,
21459,"And they came near the town to which they were going, and he seemed as if he was going on;",,,,,,,
21460,"But they kept him back, saying, Do not go, for evening is near, the day is almost gone. And he went in with them.",,,,,,,
21461,"And when he was seated with them at table, he took the bread, and said words of blessing and, making division of it, he gave it to them.",,,,,,,
21462,"And then their eyes were open, and they had knowledge of him, but he went from their view.",,,,,,,
21463,"And they said to one another, Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way, making clear to us the holy Writings?",,,,,,,
21464,"And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem, where the eleven and the others had come together.",,,,,,,
21465,"And they said to them, The Lord has truly come back to life again, and Simon has seen him.",,,,,,,
21466,"And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way, and how, when he gave them bread, they had knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
21467,"And while they were saying these things, he himself was among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!",,,,,,,
21468,"But they were full of fear, being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit.",,,,,,,
21469,"And he said to them, Why are you troubled, and why are your hearts full of doubt?",,,,,,,
21470,See; my hands and my feet: it is I myself; put your hands on me and make certain; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.,,,,,,,
21471,"And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his feet.",,,,,,,
21472,"And because, for joy and wonder, they were still in doubt, he said to them, Have you any food here?",,,,,,,
21473,And they gave him a bit of cooked fish.,,,,,,,
21474,And before their eyes he took a meal.,,,,,,,
21475,"And he said to them, These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you, how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me, to be put into effect.",,,,,,,
21476,Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds.,,,,,,,
21477,"And he said to them, So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death, and come back to life again on the third day;",,,,,,,
21478,And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name.,,,,,,,
21479,You are witnesses of these things.,,,,,,,
21480,"And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you, but do not go from the town, till the power from heaven comes to you.",,,,,,,
21481,"And he took them out till they were near Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he gave them a blessing.",,,,,,,
21482,"And while he was doing so, he went from them and was taken up into heaven.",,,,,,,
21483,And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy.,,,,,,,
21484,"And they were in the Temple at all times, giving praise to God.From the first he was the Word, and the Word was in relation with God and was God.",,,,,,,
21485,This Word was from the first in relation with God.,,,,,,,
21486,"All things came into existence through him, and without him nothing was.",,,,,,,
21487,"What came into existence in him was life, and the life was the light of men.",,,,,,,
21488,And the light goes on shining in the dark; it is not overcome by the dark.,,,,,,,
21489,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.",,,,,,,
21490,"He came for witness, to give witness about the light, so that all men might have faith through him.",,,,,,,
21491,He himself was not the light: he was sent to give witness about the light.,,,,,,,
21492,"The true light, which gives light to every man, was then coming into the world.",,,,,,,
21493,"He was in the world, the world which came into being through him, but the world had no knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
21494,He came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts.,,,,,,,
21495,"To all those who did so take him, however, he gave the right of becoming children of God — that is, to those who had faith in his name:",,,,,,,
21496,"Whose birth was from God and not from blood, or from an impulse of the flesh and man's desire.",,,,,,,
21497,And so the Word became flesh and took a place among us for a time; and we saw his glory — such glory as is given to an only son by his father — saw it to be true and full of grace.,,,,,,,
21498,"John gave witness about him, crying, This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me.",,,,,,,
21499,From his full measure we have all been given grace on grace.,,,,,,,
21500,For the law was given through Moses; grace and the true way of life are ours through Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
21501,"No man has seen God at any time; the only Son, who is on the breast of the Father, he has made clear what God is.",,,,,,,
21502,"And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question, Who are you?",,,,,,,
21503,"He said quite openly and straightforwardly, I am not the Christ.",,,,,,,
21504,"And they said to him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And his answer was, I am not.",,,,,,,
21505,"So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?",,,,,,,
21506,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the waste land, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.",,,,,,,
21507,Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees.,,,,,,,
21508,"And they put this question to him, saying, Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?",,,,,,,
21509,John's answer was: I give baptism with water; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge;,,,,,,,
21510,It is he who is coming after me; I am not good enough to undo his shoes.,,,,,,,
21511,"These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was giving baptism.",,,,,,,
21512,"The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",,,,,,,
21513,"This is he of whom I said, One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me.",,,,,,,
21514,"I myself had no knowledge of him, but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel.",,,,,,,
21515,"And John gave this witness, saying, I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him.",,,,,,,
21516,"I had no knowledge who he was, but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting, it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
21517,This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God.,,,,,,,
21518,"The day after, John was there again with two of his disciples;",,,,,,,
21519,"And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said, See, there is the Lamb of God!",,,,,,,
21520,"Hearing what he said, the two disciples went after Jesus.",,,,,,,
21521,"And Jesus, turning round, saw them coming after him and said to them, What are you looking for? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where are you living?",,,,,,,
21522,"He said to them, Come and see. They went with him then and saw where he was living; and they were with him all that day: it was then about the tenth hour of the day.",,,,,,,
21523,"Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two men who, hearing what John said, went after Jesus.",,,,,,,
21524,"Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him, We have made discovery! It is the Messiah! (which is to say, the Christ).",,,,,,,
21525,"And he took him to Jesus. Looking at him fixedly Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; your name will be Cephas (which is to say, Peter).",,,,,,,
21526,"The day after this, Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee. He came across Philip and said to him, Come and be my disciple.",,,,,,,
21527,"Now Philip's town was Beth-saida, where Andrew and Peter came from.",,,,,,,
21528,"Philip came across Nathanael and said to him, We have made a discovery! It is he of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets were writing, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.",,,,,,,
21529,"Nazareth! said Nathanael, Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.",,,,,,,
21530,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, See, here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false.",,,,,,,
21531,"Nathanael said to him, Where did you get knowledge of me? In answer Jesus said, Before Philip was talking with you, while you were still under the fig-tree, I saw you.",,,,,,,
21532,"Nathanael said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel!",,,,,,,
21533,"In answer Jesus said to him, You have faith because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than these.",,,,,,,
21534,"And he said to him, Truly I say to you all, You will see heaven opening and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of man.On the third day two people were going to be married at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there:",,,,,,,
21535,And Jesus with his disciples came as guests.,,,,,,,
21536,"When they had not enough wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.",,,,,,,
21537,"Jesus said to her, Woman, this is not your business; my time is still to come.",,,,,,,
21538,"His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.",,,,,,,
21539,"Now six pots of stone, every one taking two or three firkins of water, were placed there for the purpose of washing, as is the way of the Jews.",,,,,,,
21540,"Jesus said to the servants, Make the pots full of water. And they made them full to the top.",,,,,,,
21541,"Then he said to them, Now take some, and give it to the master of the feast. So they took it to him.",,,,,,,
21542,"After tasting the water which had now become wine, the master of the feast (having no idea where it came from, though it was clear to the servants who took the water out) sent for the newly-married man,",,,,,,,
21543,"And said to him, Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good; but you have kept the good wine till now.",,,,,,,
21544,"This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly; and his disciples put their faith in him.",,,,,,,
21545,"After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they were there not more than two or three days.",,,,,,,
21546,The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
21547,"And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves, and he saw the changers of money in their seats:",,,,,,,
21548,"And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables;",,,,,,,
21549,"And to those who were trading in doves he said, Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a market.",,,,,,,
21550,"And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say, I am on fire with passion for your house.",,,,,,,
21551,"Then the Jews put this question to him: What sign of authority have you to give us, seeing that you do these things?",,,,,,,
21552,"And Jesus said to them, Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days.",,,,,,,
21553,"The Jews said, The building of this Temple took forty-six years; and you will put it up in three days!",,,,,,,
21554,But his words were about that holy building which was his body.,,,,,,,
21555,"So when he had come back again from the dead, the memory of these words came back to the disciples, and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said.",,,,,,,
21556,"Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, a great number of people came to have faith in his name, after seeing the signs which he did.",,,,,,,
21557,"But Jesus did not have faith in them, because he had knowledge of them all.",,,,,,,
21558,"He had no need for any witness about man; for he himself had knowledge of what was in man.Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus, who was one of the rulers of the Jews.",,,,,,,
21559,"He came to Jesus by night and said to him, Rabbi, we are certain that you have come from God as a teacher, because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if God was not with him.",,,,,,,
21560,"Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you, Without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
21561,"Nicodemus said to him, How is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old? Is he able to go into his mother's body a second time and come to birth again?",,,,,,,
21562,"Jesus said in answer, Truly, I say to you, If a man's birth is not from water and from the Spirit, it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
21563,"That which has birth from the flesh is flesh, and that which has birth from the Spirit is spirit.",,,,,,,
21564,"Do not be surprised that I say to you, It is necessary for you to have a second birth.",,,,,,,
21565,"The wind goes where its pleasure takes it, and the sound of it comes to your ears, but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes: so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit.",,,,,,,
21566,"And Nicodemus said to him, How is it possible for these things to be?",,,,,,,
21567,"And Jesus, answering, said, Are you the teacher of Israel and have no knowledge of these things?",,,,,,,
21568,"Truly, I say to you, We say that of which we have knowledge; we give witness of what we have seen; and you do not take our witness to be true.",,,,,,,
21569,"If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth, how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven?",,,,,,,
21570,"And no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man.",,,,,,,
21571,"As the snake was lifted up by Moses in the waste land, even so it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up:",,,,,,,
21572,So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life.,,,,,,,
21573,"For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life.",,,,,,,
21574,God did not send his Son into the world to be judge of the world; he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him.,,,,,,,
21575,"The man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged; but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now, because he has no faith in the name of the only Son of God.",,,,,,,
21576,"And this is the test by which men are judged: the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light, because their acts are evil.",,,,,,,
21577,The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen.,,,,,,,
21578,"But he whose life is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of God.",,,,,,,
21579,"After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judaea, and there he was with them for some time, giving baptism.",,,,,,,
21580,"Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were given baptism.",,,,,,,
21581,For at this time John had not been put into prison.,,,,,,,
21582,Then a question came up between John's disciples and a Jew about washing.,,,,,,,
21583,"And they went to John and said to him, Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the man to whom you gave witness, is now giving baptism, and everyone is going to him.",,,,,,,
21584,And this was John's answer: A man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven.,,,,,,,
21585,"You yourselves give witness that I said, I am not the Christ. What I said was, I am sent before the Christ.",,,,,,,
21586,"He who has the bride is the husband: but the husband's friend, whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him, is full of joy because of the husband's voice: such is my joy, and it is complete.",,,,,,,
21587,He has to become greater while I become less.,,,,,,,
21588,"He who comes from heaven is greater than all others: he who comes from earth is of the earth, and of the earth are his words: he who comes from heaven is over all.",,,,,,,
21589,He gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears; and no man takes his witness as true.,,,,,,,
21590,He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true.,,,,,,,
21591,For he whom God has sent says God's words; and God does not give him the Spirit by measure.,,,,,,,
21592,The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands.,,,,,,,
21593,He who has faith in the Son has eternal life; but he who has not faith in the Son will not see life; God's wrath is resting on him.Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than,John and was,giv,n,th,m ba,tis,
21594,"(Though, in fact, it was his disciples who gave baptism, not Jesus himself),",,,,,,,
21595,He went out of Judaea into Galilee again.,,,,,,,
21596,And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.,,,,,,,
21597,"So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar, near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph:",,,,,,,
21598,"Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.",,,,,,,
21599,"A woman of Samaria came to get water, and Jesus said to her, Give me some water.",,,,,,,
21600,For his disciples had gone to the town to get food.,,,,,,,
21601,"The woman of Samaria said to him, Why do you, a Jew, make a request for water to me, a woman of Samaria? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria.",,,,,,,
21602,"In answer Jesus said, If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you, Give me water, you would make your prayer to him, and he would give you living water.",,,,,,,
21603,"The woman said to him, Sir, you have no vessel and the fountain is deep; from where will you get the living water?",,,,,,,
21604,"Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself, with his children and his cattle?",,,,,,,
21605,"Jesus said to her, Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again:",,,,,,,
21606,But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life.,,,,,,,
21607,"The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it.",,,,,,,
21608,"Jesus said to her, Go, get your husband and come back here with him.",,,,,,,
21609,"In answer, the woman said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have said rightly, I have no husband:",,,,,,,
21610,"You have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband: that was truly said.",,,,,,,
21611,"The woman said to him, Sir, I see that you are a prophet.",,,,,,,
21612,"Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
21613,"Jesus said to her, Woman, take my word for this; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
21614,"You give worship, but without knowledge of what you are worshipping: we give worship to what we have knowledge of: for salvation comes from the Jews.",,,,,,,
21615,"But the time is coming, and is even now here, when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit, for these are the worshippers desired by the Father.",,,,,,,
21616,God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.,,,,,,,
21617,"The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.",,,,,,,
21618,"Jesus said to her, I, who am talking to you, am he.",,,,,,,
21619,"At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?",,,,,,,
21620,"Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town, and said to the people,",,,,,,,
21621,Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did! Is it possible that this is the Christ?,,,,,,,
21622,So they went out of the town and came to him.,,,,,,,
21623,"While this was taking place, the disciples were saying to Jesus, Master, take some food.",,,,,,,
21624,"But he said to them, I have food of which you have no knowledge.",,,,,,,
21625,"So the disciples said one to another, Did anyone give him food?",,,,,,,
21626,"Jesus said, My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete.",,,,,,,
21627,"You would say, Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting. Take a look, I say to you, at the fields; they are even now white for cutting.",,,,,,,
21628,"He who does the cutting now has his reward; he is getting together fruit for eternal life, so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together.",,,,,,,
21629,"In this the saying is a true one, One does the planting, and another gets in the grain.",,,,,,,
21630,"I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting: other men did that work, and you take the reward.",,,,,,,
21631,Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness: He has been talking to me of everything I ever did.,,,,,,,
21632,"So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time, and he was there two days.",,,,,,,
21633,And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said.,,,,,,,
21634,"And they said to the woman, Now we have faith, but not because of your story: we ourselves have given ear to his words, and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world.",,,,,,,
21635,And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee.,,,,,,,
21636,For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth.,,,,,,,
21637,"So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast — they themselves having been there at the feast.",,,,,,,
21638,"So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.",,,,,,,
21639,"When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son, who was near to death, and make him well.",,,,,,,
21640,"Then Jesus said to him, You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders.",,,,,,,
21641,"The man said, Sir, come down before my boy is dead.",,,,,,,
21642,"And Jesus said, Go in peace; your son is living. The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away.",,,,,,,
21643,"And while he was going down, his servants came to him and said, Your boy is living.",,,,,,,
21644,"So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.",,,,,,,
21645,"It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him, Your son is living. And he had faith in Jesus, he and all his family.",,,,,,,
21646,"Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
21647,Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha. It has five doorways.,,,,,,,
21648,"In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases: some unable to see, some without the power of walking, some with wasted bodies.",,,,,,,
21649,[],,,,,,,
21650,One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.,,,,,,,
21651,"When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition, and so he said to the man, Is it your desire to get well?",,,,,,,
21652,"The ill man said in answer, Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me.",,,,,,,
21653,"Jesus said to him, Get up, take your bed and go.",,,,,,,
21654,"And the man became well straight away, and took up his bed and went. Now that day was the Sabbath.",,,,,,,
21655,"So the Jews said to the man who had been made well, It is the Sabbath; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed.",,,,,,,
21656,"He said to them, But he who made me well, said to me, Take up your bed and go.",,,,,,,
21657,"Then they put to him the question: Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and go?",,,,,,,
21658,"Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was, Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place.",,,,,,,
21659,"After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him, See, you are well and strong; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you.",,,,,,,
21660,The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.,,,,,,,
21661,"And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.",,,,,,,
21662,"But his answer was: My Father is still working even now, and so I am working.",,,,,,,
21663,"For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.",,,,,,,
21664,"So Jesus made answer and said, Truly I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything himself; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way.",,,,,,,
21665,For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does: and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder.,,,,,,,
21666,"In the same way, as the Father gives life to the dead, even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it.",,,,,,,
21667,"The Father is not the judge of men, but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son;",,,,,,,
21668,So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father. He who gives no honour to the Son gives no honour to the Father who sent him.,,,,,,,
21669,"Truly I say to you, The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me, has eternal life; he will not be judged, but has come from death into life.",,,,,,,
21670,"Truly I say to you, The time is coming, it has even now come, when the voice of the Son of God will come to the ears of the dead, and those hearing it will have life.",,,,,,,
21671,"For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself.",,,,,,,
21672,And he has given him authority to be judge because he is the Son of man.,,,,,,,
21673,"Do not be surprised at this: for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead,",,,,,,,
21674,"And they will come out; those who have done good, into the new life; and those who have done evil, to be judged.",,,,,,,
21675,"Of myself I am unable to do anything: as the voice comes to me so I give a decision: and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself, but only what is pleasing to him who sent me.",,,,,,,
21676,"If I gave witness about myself, my witness would not be true.",,,,,,,
21677,There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true.,,,,,,,
21678,You sent to John and he gave true witness.,,,,,,,
21679,But I have no need of a man's witness: I only say these things so that you may have salvation.,,,,,,,
21680,"He was a burning and shining light, and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light.",,,,,,,
21681,"But the witness which I have is greater than that of John: the work which the Father has given me to do, the very work which I am now doing, is a witness that the Father has sent me.",,,,,,,
21682,And the Father himself who sent me has given witness about me. Not one of you has ever given ear to his voice; his form you have not seen.,,,,,,,
21683,"And you have not kept his word in your hearts, because you have not faith in him whom he has sent.",,,,,,,
21684,"You make search in the holy Writings, in the belief that through them you get eternal life; and it is those Writings which give witness about me.",,,,,,,
21685,And still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life.,,,,,,,
21686,I do not take honour from men;,,,,,,,
21687,But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts.,,,,,,,
21688,"I have come in my Father's name, and your hearts are not open to me. If another comes with no other authority but himself, you will give him your approval.",,,,,,,
21689,How is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only God?,,,,,,,
21690,"Put out of your minds the thought that I will say things against you to the Father: the one who says things against you is Moses, on whom you put your hopes.",,,,,,,
21691,If you had belief in Moses you would have belief in me; for his writings are about me.,,,,,,,
21692,"If you have no belief in his writings, how will you have belief in my words?After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee — that is, the sea of Tiberias.",,,,,,,
21693,And a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill.,,,,,,,
21694,Then Jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples.,,,,,,,
21695,"Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.",,,,,,,
21696,"Lifting up his eyes, Jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was, and he said to Philip, Where may we get bread for all these people?",,,,,,,
21697,"This he said, testing him: for he had no doubt what he himself would do.",,,,,,,
21698,"Philip made answer, Bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little.",,,,,,,
21699,"One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to Jesus,",,,,,,,
21700,There is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes: but what is that among such a number?,,,,,,,
21701,"Jesus said, Let the people be seated. Now there was much grass in that place. And those seated on the grass were about five thousand.",,,,,,,
21702,"Then Jesus took the cakes and having given praise to God, he gave them to the people who were seated, and the fishes in the same way, as much as they had need of.",,,,,,,
21703,"And when they had had enough, Jesus said to his disciples, Take up the broken bits which are over, so that nothing may be wasted.",,,,,,,
21704,So they took them up: twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough.,,,,,,,
21705,"And when the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, Truly, this is the prophet who is to come into the world.",,,,,,,
21706,"Now when Jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, he went away again up the mountain by himself.",,,,,,,
21707,When evening came the disciples went down to the sea;,,,,,,,
21708,And they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of Capernaum. By then it was dark and still Jesus had not come to them.,,,,,,,
21709,The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing.,,,,,,,
21710,After they had gone three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat; and they had great fear.,,,,,,,
21711,"But he said to them, It is I, have no fear.",,,,,,,
21712,Then they readily took him into the boat: and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going.,,,,,,,
21713,"The day after, the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there, that Jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples, but that the disciples had gone away by themselves.",,,,,,,
21714,"Some other boats, however, came from Tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the Lord had given praise.",,,,,,,
21715,"So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples, they got into those boats and went over to Capernaum looking for Jesus.",,,,,,,
21716,"And when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said, Rabbi, when did you come here?",,,,,,,
21717,"Jesus, answering them, said, Truly I say to you, You come after me, not because you saw signs, but because you were given the bread and had enough.",,,,,,,
21718,"Let your work not be for the food which comes to an end, but for the food which goes on for eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for on him has God the Father put his mark.",,,,,,,
21719,"Then they said to him, How may we do the works of God?",,,,,,,
21720,"Jesus, answering, said to them, This is to do the work of God: to have faith in him whom God has sent.",,,,,,,
21721,"So they said, What sign do you give us, so that we may see and have faith in you? What do you do?",,,,,,,
21722,"Our fathers had the manna in the waste land, as the Writings say, He gave them bread from heaven.",,,,,,,
21723,"Jesus then said to them, Truly I say to you, What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven; it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.",,,,,,,
21724,The bread of God is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.,,,,,,,
21725,"Ah, Lord, they said, give us that bread for ever!",,,,,,,
21726,"And this was the answer of Jesus: I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be in need of food, and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink.",,,,,,,
21727,"But it is as I said to you: you have seen me, and still you have no faith.",,,,,,,
21728,Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me; and I will not send away anyone who comes to me.,,,,,,,
21729,"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my pleasure, but the pleasure of him who sent me.",,,,,,,
21730,"And this is the pleasure of him who sent me, that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me, but I am to give it new life on the last day.",,,,,,,
21731,"This, I say, is my Father's pleasure, that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life: and I will take him up on the last day.",,,,,,,
21732,"Now the Jews said bitter things about Jesus because of his words, I am the bread which came down from heaven.",,,,,,,
21733,"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have seen? How is it then that he now says, I have come down from heaven?",,,,,,,
21734,"Jesus made answer and said, Do not say things against me, one to another.",,,,,,,
21735,No man is able to come to me if the Father who sent me does not give him the desire to come: and I will take him up from the dead on the last day.,,,,,,,
21736,"The writings of the prophets say, And they will all have teaching from God. Everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the Father comes to me.",,,,,,,
21737,"Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only he who is from God, he has seen the Father.",,,,,,,
21738,"Truly I say to you, He who has faith in me has eternal life.",,,,,,,
21739,I am the bread of life.,,,,,,,
21740,Your fathers took the manna in the waste land — and they are dead.,,,,,,,
21741,The bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death.,,,,,,,
21742,"I am the living bread which has come from heaven: if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever: and more than this, the bread which I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.",,,,,,,
21743,"Then the Jews had an angry discussion among themselves, saying, How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food?",,,,,,,
21744,"Then Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, If you do not take the flesh of the Son of man for food, and if you do not take his blood for drink, you have no life in you.",,,,,,,
21745,He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life: and I will take him up from the dead at the last day.,,,,,,,
21746,My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.,,,,,,,
21747,He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and I in him.,,,,,,,
21748,"As the living Father has sent me, and I have life because of the Father, even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me.",,,,,,,
21749,"This is the bread which has come down from heaven. It is not like the food which your fathers had: they took of the manna, and are dead; but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever.",,,,,,,
21750,Jesus said these things in the Synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum.,,,,,,,
21751,"Then, hearing this, a number of his disciples said, This is a hard saying; who is able to take in such teaching?",,,,,,,
21752,"When Jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said, he said to them, Does this give you trouble?",,,,,,,
21753,What then will you say if you see the Son of man going up to where he was before?,,,,,,,
21754,The spirit is the life giver; the flesh is of no value: the words which I have said to you are spirit and they are life.,,,,,,,
21755,"But still some of you have no faith. For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith, and who it was who would be false to him.",,,,,,,
21756,"And he said, This is why I said to you, No man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the Father.",,,,,,,
21757,"Because of what he said, a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him.",,,,,,,
21758,"So Jesus said to the twelve, Have you a desire to go away?",,,,,,,
21759,"Then Simon Peter gave this answer: Lord, to whom are we to go? you have the words of eternal life;",,,,,,,
21760,And we have faith and are certain that you are the Holy One of God.,,,,,,,
21761,"Then Jesus said, Did I not make a selection of you, the twelve, and one of you is a son of the Evil One?",,,,,,,
21762,"He was talking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. It was he who was to be false to Jesus — one of the twelve.After this, Jesus went from place to place in Galilee. He did not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were looking for a chance to put him to",eath.,,,,,,
21763,"But the feast of the Jews, the feast of tents, was near.",,,,,,,
21764,"So his brothers said to him, Go away from here into Judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do.",,,,,,,
21765,"Because no man does things secretly if he has a desire that men may have knowledge of him. If you do these things, let yourself be seen by all men.",,,,,,,
21766,For even his brothers had no belief in him.,,,,,,,
21767,"Jesus said to them, My time is still to come, but any time is good for you.",,,,,,,
21768,"It is not possible for you to be hated by the world; but I am hated by it, because I give witness that what it does is evil.",,,,,,,
21769,Go you up to the feast: I am not going up now to the feast because my time has not fully come.,,,,,,,
21770,"Having said these things to them, he still kept in Galilee.",,,,,,,
21771,"But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he went up, not publicly, but in secret.",,,,,,,
21772,"At the feast the Jews were looking for him and saying, Where is he?",,,,,,,
21773,"And there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people. Some said, He is a good man; but others said, No, he is giving people false ideas.",,,,,,,
21774,But no man said anything about him openly for fear of the Jews.,,,,,,,
21775,Now in the middle of the feast Jesus went up to the Temple and was teaching.,,,,,,,
21776,"Then the Jews were surprised and said, How has this man got knowledge of books? He has never been to school.",,,,,,,
21777,"Jesus gave them this answer: It is not my teaching, but his who sent me.",,,,,,,
21778,If any man is ready to do God's pleasure he will have knowledge of the teaching and of where it comes from — from God or from myself.,,,,,,,
21779,"The man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself, but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent him — that man is true and there is no evil in him.",,,,,,,
21780,"Did not Moses give you the law? Even so, not one of you keeps the law. Why have you a desire to put me to death?",,,,,,,
21781,"The people said in answer, You have an evil spirit: who has any desire to put you to death?",,,,,,,
21782,This was the answer of Jesus: I have done one work and you are all surprised at it.,,,,,,,
21783,"Moses gave you circumcision — not that it comes from Moses, but from the fathers — and even on the Sabbath you give a child circumcision.",,,,,,,
21784,"If a child is given circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?",,,,,,,
21785,"Let not your decisions be based on what you see, but on righteousness.",,,,,,,
21786,"Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the man whose death is desired?",,,,,,,
21787,And here he is talking openly and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that the rulers have knowledge that this is truly the Christ?,,,,,,,
21788,"However, it is clear to us where this man comes from: but when the Christ comes no one will have knowledge where he comes from.",,,,,,,
21789,"Then, when he was teaching in the Temple, Jesus said with a loud voice, You have knowledge of me and you have knowledge of where I come from; and I have not come of myself; but there is One who has sent me; he is true, but you have no knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
21790,I have knowledge of him because I came from him and he sent me.,,,,,,,
21791,Then they had a desire to take him: but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come.,,,,,,,
21792,"And numbers of the people had belief in him, and they said, When the Christ comes will he do more signs than this man has done?",,,,,,,
21793,This discussion of the people came to the ears of the Pharisees; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent servants to take him.,,,,,,,
21794,"Then Jesus said, I will be with you a little longer and then I go to him who sent me.",,,,,,,
21795,"You will be looking for me, and you will not see me: and where I am you may not come.",,,,,,,
21796,"So the Jews said among themselves, To what place is he going where we will not see him? will he go to the Jews living among the Greeks and become the teacher of the Greeks?",,,,,,,
21797,"What is this saying of his, You will be looking for me and will not see me, and where I am you may not come?",,,,,,,
21798,"On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus got up and said in a loud voice, If any man is in need of drink let him come to me and I will give it to him.",,,,,,,
21799,"He who has faith in me, out of his body, as the Writings have said, will come rivers of living water.",,,,,,,
21800,"This he said of the Spirit which would be given to those who had faith in him: the Spirit had not been given then, because the glory of Jesus was still to come.",,,,,,,
21801,"When these words came to their ears, some of the people said, This is certainly the prophet.",,,,,,,
21802,"Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Not so; will the Christ come from Galilee?",,,,,,,
21803,"Do not the Writings say that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from Beth-lehem, the little town where David was?",,,,,,,
21804,So there was a division among the people because of him.,,,,,,,
21805,And some of them had a desire to take him; but no man put hands on him.,,,,,,,
21806,"Then the servants went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why have you not got him with you?",,,,,,,
21807,"The servants made answer, No man ever said things like this man.",,,,,,,
21808,"Then the Pharisees said to them, Have you, like the others, been given false ideas?",,,,,,,
21809,"Have any of the rulers belief in him, or any one of the Pharisees?",,,,,,,
21810,But these people who have no knowledge of the law are cursed.,,,,,,,
21811,"Nicodemus — he who had come to Jesus before, being himself one of them — said to them,",,,,,,,
21812,Is a man judged by our law before it has given him a hearing and has knowledge of what he has done?,,,,,,,
21813,This was their answer: And do you come from Galilee? Make search and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.,,,,,,,
21814,[And every man went to his house;But Jesus went to the Mountain of Olives.,,,,,,,
21815,And early in the morning he came again into the Temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them.,,,,,,,
21816,"Now the scribes and Pharisees came, with a woman who had been taken in the act of sinning against the married relation;",,,,,,,
21817,"And putting her forward, they said to him, Master, this woman has been taken in the very act of sinning against the married relation.",,,,,,,
21818,Now in the law Moses gave directions that such women were to be stoned; what do you say about it?,,,,,,,
21819,"They said this, testing him, so that they might have something against him. But Jesus, with his head bent down, made letters on the floor with his finger.",,,,,,,
21820,"But when they went on with their questions, he got up and said to them, Let him among you who is without sin be the first to send a stone at her.",,,,,,,
21821,"And again, with bent head, he made letters on the floor.",,,,,,,
21822,"And when his words came to their ears, they went out one by one, starting with the oldest even to the last, because they were conscious of what was in their hearts: and Jesus was there by himself with the woman before him.",,,,,,,
21823,"Then Jesus got up, and seeing nobody but the woman, he said to her, Where are the men who said things against you? did no one give a decision against you?",,,,,,,
21824,"And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, And I do not give a decision against you: go, and never do wrong again.]",,,,,,,
21825,"Then again Jesus said to them, I am the light of the world; he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life.",,,,,,,
21826,"So the Pharisees said to him, The witness you give is about yourself: your witness is not true.",,,,,,,
21827,"Jesus said in answer, Even if I give witness about myself, my witness is true, because I have knowledge of where I came from and where I am going; but you have no knowledge of where I come from or of where I am going.",,,,,,,
21828,You are judging from what you see; I am judging no man.,,,,,,,
21829,"Even if I am judging, my decision is right, because I am not by myself — with me is the Father who sent me.",,,,,,,
21830,Even in your law it is said that the witness of two men is true.,,,,,,,
21831,I give witness about myself and the Father who sent me gives witness about me.,,,,,,,
21832,"Then they said to him, Where is your Father? Jesus said in answer, You have no knowledge of me or of my Father: if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my Father.",,,,,,,
21833,"Jesus said these words in the place where the offerings were stored, while he was teaching in the Temple: but no man took him because his time was still to come.",,,,,,,
21834,"Then he said to them again, I am going away and you will be looking for me, but death will overtake you in your sins. It is not possible for you to come where I am going.",,,,,,,
21835,"So the Jews said, Will he take his life? Is that why he says, Where I go it is not possible for you to come?",,,,,,,
21836,"And he said to them, You are of the earth; I am from heaven: you are of this world; I am not of this world.",,,,,,,
21837,"For this reason I said to you that death will overtake you in your sins: for if you have not faith that I am he, death will come to you while you are in your sins.",,,,,,,
21838,"Then they said to him, Who are you? Jesus said, What I said to you from the first.",,,,,,,
21839,I have much to say about you and against you: but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me I say to the world.,,,,,,,
21840,They did not see that his words were about the Father.,,,,,,,
21841,"So Jesus said, When the Son of man has been lifted up by you, then it will be clear to you who I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but say as the Father gave me teaching.",,,,,,,
21842,"He who sent me is with me; he has not gone from me, because at all times I do the things which are pleasing to him.",,,,,,,
21843,When he said this a number came to have faith in him.,,,,,,,
21844,"Then Jesus said to the Jews who had faith in him, If you keep my word, then you are truly my disciples;",,,,,,,
21845,"And you will have knowledge of what is true, and that will make you free.",,,,,,,
21846,"They said to him in answer, We are Abraham's seed and have never been any man's servant: why do you say, You will become free?",,,,,,,
21847,"And this was the answer Jesus gave them: Truly I say to you, Everyone who does evil is the servant of sin.",,,,,,,
21848,"Now the servant does not go on living in the house for ever, but the son does.",,,,,,,
21849,"If then the son makes you free, you will be truly free.",,,,,,,
21850,I am conscious that you are Abraham's seed; but you have a desire to put me to death because my word has no place in you.,,,,,,,
21851,I say the things which I have seen in my Father's house: and you do the things which come to you from your father's house.,,,,,,,
21852,"In answer they said to him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children you would do what Abraham did.",,,,,,,
21853,"But now you have a desire to put me to death, a man who has said to you what is true, as I had it from God: Abraham did not do that.",,,,,,,
21854,"You are doing the works of your father. They said to him, We are true sons of Abraham; we have one Father, who is God.",,,,,,,
21855,"Jesus said to them, If God was your Father you would have love for me, because it was from God I came and am here. I did not come of myself, but he sent me.",,,,,,,
21856,Why are my words not clear to you? It is because your ears are shut to my teaching.,,,,,,,
21857,"You are the children of your father the Evil One and it is your pleasure to do his desires. From the first he was a taker of life; and he did not go in the true way because there is no true thing in him. When he says what is false, it is natural to him,",or he is fal,e a,d,the,fath,r o,what
21858,"But because I say what is true, you have no belief in me.",,,,,,,
21859,"Which of you is able truly to say that I am a sinner? If I say what is true, why have you no belief in me?",,,,,,,
21860,He who is a child of God gives ear to the words of God: your ears are not open to them because you are not from God.,,,,,,,
21861,"The Jews said to him in answer, Are we not right in saying that you are of Samaria and have an evil spirit?",,,,,,,
21862,And this was the answer of Jesus: I have not an evil spirit; but I give honour to my Father and you do not give honour to me.,,,,,,,
21863,"I, however, am not in search of glory for myself: there is One who is searching for it and he is judge.",,,,,,,
21864,"Truly I say to you, If a man keeps my word he will never see death.",,,,,,,
21865,"The Jews said to him, Now we are certain that you have an evil spirit. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead; and you say, If a man keeps my word he will never see death.",,,,,,,
21866,"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: who do you say that you are?",,,,,,,
21867,"Jesus said in answer, If I take glory for myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who gives me glory, of whom you say that he is your God.",,,,,,,
21868,"You have no knowledge of him, but I have knowledge of him; and if I said I have no knowledge of him I would be talking falsely like you: but I have full knowledge of him, and I keep his word.",,,,,,,
21869,Your father Abraham was full of joy at the hope of seeing my day: he saw it and was glad.,,,,,,,
21870,"Then the Jews said to him, You are not fifty years old; have you seen Abraham?",,,,,,,
21871,"Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.",,,,,,,
21872,"So they took up stones to send at him: but Jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the Temple.And when he went on his way, he saw a man blind from birth.",,,,,,,
21873,"And his disciples put a question to him, saying, Master, was it because of this man's sin, or the sin of his father and mother, that he has been blind from birth?",,,,,,,
21874,"Jesus said in answer, It was not because of his sin, or because of his father's or mother's; it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him.",,,,,,,
21875,While it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me: the night comes when no work may be done.,,,,,,,
21876,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.",,,,,,,
21877,"Having said these words, he put earth, mixed with water from his mouth, on the man's eyes,",,,,,,,
21878,"And said to him, Go and make yourself clean in the bath of Siloam (the sense of the name is, Sent). So he went away and, after washing, came back able to see.",,,,,,,
21879,"Then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street, with his hand out for money, said, Is not this the man who got money from people?",,,,,,,
21880,"Some said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.",,,,,,,
21881,"So they said to him, How then were your eyes made open?",,,,,,,
21882,"His answer was: The man who is named Jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes, and said to me, Go and make yourself clean in Siloam: so I went away and, after washing, am now able to see.",,,,,,,
21883,"And they said to him, Where is he? His answer was: I have no knowledge.",,,,,,,
21884,They took him before the Pharisees — this man who had been blind.,,,,,,,
21885,Now the day on which the earth was mixed by Jesus and the man's eyes were made open was the Sabbath.,,,,,,,
21886,"So the Pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open. And he said to them, He put earth on my eyes, and I had a wash and am able to see.",,,,,,,
21887,"Then some of the Pharisees said, That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs? So there was a division among them.",,,,,,,
21888,"Again they said to the blind man, What have you to say about him for opening your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.",,,,,,,
21889,"Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see, till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open,",,,,,,,
21890,"And put the question to them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was blind at birth? how is it then that he is now able to see?",,,,,,,
21891,"In answer his father and mother said, We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth:",,,,,,,
21892,"But how it is he is now able to see, or who made his eyes open, we are not able to say: put the question to him; he is old enough to give an answer for himself.",,,,,,,
21893,They said this because of their fear of the Jews: for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue.,,,,,,,
21894,"That was the reason why they said, He is old enough; put the question to him.",,,,,,,
21895,"So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him, Give glory to God: it is clear to us that this man is a sinner.",,,,,,,
21896,"He said in answer, I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not, but one thing I am certain about; I was blind, and now I see.",,,,,,,
21897,"Then they said to him, What did he do to you? how did he give you the use of your eyes?",,,,,,,
21898,"His answer was: I have said it before, but your ears were shut: why would you have me say it again? is it your desire to become his disciples?",,,,,,,
21899,"And they were angry with him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.",,,,,,,
21900,"We are certain that God gave his word to Moses: but as for this man, we have no knowledge where he comes from.",,,,,,,
21901,"The man said in answer, Why, here is a strange thing! You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes.",,,,,,,
21902,"We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners, but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure, to him God's ears are open.",,,,,,,
21903,In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open.,,,,,,,
21904,If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything.,,,,,,,
21905,Their answer was: You came to birth through sin; do you make yourself our teacher? And they put him out of the Synagogue.,,,,,,,
21906,"It came to the ears of Jesus that they had put him out, and meeting him he said, Have you faith in the Son of man?",,,,,,,
21907,"He said in answer, And who is he, Lord? Say, so that I may have faith in him.",,,,,,,
21908,"Jesus said to him, You have seen him; it is he who is talking to you.",,,,,,,
21909,"And he said, Lord, I have faith. And he gave him worship.",,,,,,,
21910,"And Jesus said, I came into this world to be a judge, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.",,,,,,,
21911,"These words came to the ears of the Pharisees who were with him and they said to him, Are we, then, blind?",,,,,,,
21912,"Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin: but now that you say, We see; your sin is there still.Truly I say to you, He who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept, but gets in by some other way, is a thief",nd an outlaw,,,,,,
21913,He who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep.,,,,,,,
21914,"The porter lets him in; and the sheep give ear to his voice; he says over the names of the sheep, and takes them out.",,,,,,,
21915,"When he has got them all out, he goes before them, and the sheep go after him, for they have knowledge of his voice.",,,,,,,
21916,"They will not go after another who is not their keeper, but will go from him in flight, because his voice is strange to them.",,,,,,,
21917,In this Jesus was teaching them in the form of a story: but what he said was not clear to them.,,,,,,,
21918,"So Jesus said again, Truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.",,,,,,,
21919,All who came before me are thieves and outlaws: but the sheep did not give ear to them.,,,,,,,
21920,"I am the door: if any man goes in through me he will have salvation, and will go in and go out, and will get food.",,,,,,,
21921,The thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death: he comes for their destruction: I have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure.,,,,,,,
21922,I am the good keeper of sheep: the good keeper gives his life for the sheep.,,,,,,,
21923,"He who is a servant, and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and goes in flight, away from the sheep; and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions:",,,,,,,
21924,Because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep.,,,,,,,
21925,"I am the good keeper; I have knowledge of my sheep, and they have knowledge of me,",,,,,,,
21926,Even as the Father has knowledge of me and I of the Father; and I am giving my life for the sheep.,,,,,,,
21927,"And I have other sheep which are not of this field: I will be their guide in the same way, and they will give ear to my voice, so there will be one flock and one keeper.",,,,,,,
21928,"For this reason am I loved by the Father, because I give up my life so that I may take it again.",,,,,,,
21929,"No one takes it away from me; I give it up of myself. I have power to give it up, and I have power to take it again. These orders I have from my Father.",,,,,,,
21930,There was a division again among the Jews because of these words.,,,,,,,
21931,"And a number of them said, He has an evil spirit and is out of his mind; why do you give ear to him?",,,,,,,
21932,"Others said, These are not the words of one who has an evil spirit. Is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see?",,,,,,,
21933,Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem: it was winter;,,,,,,,
21934,"And Jesus was walking in the Temple, in Solomon's covered way.",,,,,,,
21935,"Then the Jews came round him, saying, how long are you going to keep us in doubt? If you are the Christ, say so clearly.",,,,,,,
21936,"Jesus said in answer, I have said it and you have no belief: the works which I do in my Father's name, these give witness about me.",,,,,,,
21937,But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep.,,,,,,,
21938,"My sheep give ear to my voice, and I have knowledge of them, and they come after me:",,,,,,,
21939,"And I give them eternal life; they will never come to destruction, and no one will ever take them out of my hand.",,,,,,,
21940,That which my Father has given to me has more value than all; and no one is able to take anything out of the Father's hand.,,,,,,,
21941,I and my Father are one.,,,,,,,
21942,Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him.,,,,,,,
21943,"Jesus said to them in answer, I have let you see a number of good works from the Father; for which of those works are you stoning me?",,,,,,,
21944,This was their answer: We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words; because being a man you make yourself God.,,,,,,,
21945,"In answer, Jesus said, Is there not a saying in your law, I said, You are gods?",,,,,,,
21946,"If he said they were gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Writings may not be broken),",,,,,,,
21947,"Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, Your words are evil; because I said, I am God's Son?",,,,,,,
21948,"If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not have belief in me;",,,,,,,
21949,"But if I am doing them, then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me; so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.",,,,,,,
21950,Then again they made an attempt to take him; but he got away from them.,,,,,,,
21951,"And he went again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John first gave baptism; and he was there for a time.",,,,,,,
21952,"And a great number of people came to him, saying, John did no sign: but everything John said of this man was true.",,,,,,,
21953,"And a number came to have faith in him there.Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.",,,,,,,
21954,"(The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who put perfumed oil on the Lord and made his feet dry with her hair.)",,,,,,,
21955,"So the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, your dear friend is ill.",,,,,,,
21956,"When this came to his ears, Jesus said, The end of this disease is not death, but the glory of God, so that the Son of God may have glory because of it.",,,,,,,
21957,Now Jesus had love in his heart for Martha and her sister and Lazarus.,,,,,,,
21958,"So when the news came to him that Lazarus was ill, he did not go from the place where he was for two days.",,,,,,,
21959,"Then after that time he said to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.",,,,,,,
21960,"The disciples said to him, Master, the Jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned, and are you going back there again?",,,,,,,
21961,"Then Jesus said in answer, Are there not twelve hours in the day? A man may go about in the day without falling, because he sees the light of this world.",,,,,,,
21962,"But if a man goes about in the night, he may have a fall because the light is not in him.",,,,,,,
21963,"These things said he: and after that he said to them, Lazarus our friend is at rest; but I go so that I may make him come out of his sleep.",,,,,,,
21964,"Then his disciples said to him, Lord, if he is resting he will get well.",,,,,,,
21965,"Jesus, however, was talking of his death: but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep.",,,,,,,
21966,"Then Jesus said to them clearly, Lazarus is dead.",,,,,,,
21967,"And because of you I am glad I was not there, so that you may have faith; but let us go to him.",,,,,,,
21968,"Then Thomas, who was named Didymus, said to the other disciples, Let us go so that we may be with him in death.",,,,,,,
21969,"Now when Jesus came, he made the discovery that Lazarus had been put into the earth four days before.",,,,,,,
21970,"Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about two miles away;",,,,,,,
21971,And a number of Jews had come to Martha and Mary to give them comfort about their brother.,,,,,,,
21972,"When Martha had the news that Jesus was on the way, she went out to him, but Mary did not go from the house.",,,,,,,
21973,"Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead.",,,,,,,
21974,"But I am certain that, even now, whatever request you make to God, God will give it to you.",,,,,,,
21975,"Jesus said to her, Your brother will come to life again.",,,,,,,
21976,"Martha said to him, I am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day.",,,,,,,
21977,"Jesus said to her, I am myself that day and that life; he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead;",,,,,,,
21978,And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death. Is this your faith?,,,,,,,
21979,"She said to him, Yes, Lord: my faith is that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.",,,,,,,
21980,"And having said this, she went away and said secretly to her sister Mary, The Master is here and has sent for you.",,,,,,,
21981,"And Mary, hearing this, got up quickly and went to him.",,,,,,,
21982,"Now Jesus had not at this time come into the town, but was still in the place where Martha had seen him.",,,,,,,
21983,"Then the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, when they saw Mary get up quickly and go out, went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there.",,,,,,,
21984,"When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she went down at his feet, saying, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead.",,,,,,,
21985,"And when Jesus saw her weeping, and saw the Jews weeping who came with her, his spirit was moved and he was troubled,",,,,,,,
21986,"And said, Where have you put him? They said, Come and see, Lord.",,,,,,,
21987,And Jesus himself was weeping.,,,,,,,
21988,"So the Jews said, See how dear he was to him!",,,,,,,
21989,"But some of them said, This man, who made open the eyes of the blind man, was he not able to keep his friend from death?",,,,,,,
21990,"So Jesus, deeply troubled in heart, came to the place of the dead. It was a hole in the rock, and a stone was over the opening.",,,,,,,
21991,"Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said, Lord, by this time the body will be smelling, for he has been dead four days.",,,,,,,
21992,"Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of God?",,,,,,,
21993,"So they took away the stone. And Jesus, looking up to heaven, said, Father, I give praise to you for hearing me.",,,,,,,
21994,"I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me, but I said it because of these who are here, so that they may see that you sent me.",,,,,,,
21995,"Then he said in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!",,,,,,,
21996,"And he who was dead came out, with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet, and a cloth about his face. Jesus said to them, Make him free and let him go.",,,,,,,
21997,Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him.,,,,,,,
21998,But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done.,,,,,,,
21999,"Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said, What are we doing? This man is doing a number of signs.",,,,,,,
22000,"If we let him go on in this way, everybody will have belief in him and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.",,,,,,,
22001,"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You have no knowledge of anything;",,,,,,,
22002,"You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people, so that all the nation may not come to destruction.",,,,,,,
22003,"He did not say this of himself, but being the high priest that year he said, as a prophet, that Jesus would be put to death for the nation;",,,,,,,
22004,"And not for that nation only, but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world.",,,,,,,
22005,And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death.,,,,,,,
22006,"So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near to the waste land, to a town named Ephraim, where he was for some time with the disciples.",,,,,,,
22007,"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover.",,,,,,,
22008,"They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple, What is your opinion? Will he not come to the feast?",,,,,,,
22009,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was, he was to give them word, so that they might take him.Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had made to",ome back fro,th,,ead,,,
22010,"So they made him a meal there, and he was waited on by Martha, and Lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table.",,,,,,,
22011,"Then Mary, taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value, put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair: and the house became full of the smell of the perfume.",,,,,,,
22012,"But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to give him up), said,",,,,,,,
22013,"Why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence, and the money given to the poor?",,,,,,,
22014,"(He said this, not because he had any love for the poor; but because he was a thief, and, having the money-bag, took for himself what was put into it.)",,,,,,,
22015,"Then Jesus said, Let her be. Let her keep what she has for the day of my death.",,,,,,,
22016,"The poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever.",,,,,,,
22017,"Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there: and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life.",,,,,,,
22018,Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death;,,,,,,,
22019,For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus.,,,,,,,
22020,"The day after, a great number of people who were there for the feast, when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,",,,,,,,
22021,"Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him, crying, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!",,,,,,,
22022,"And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it; as the Writings say,",,,,,,,
22023,"Have no fear, daughter of Zion: see your King is coming, seated on a young ass.",,,,,,,
22024,"(These things were not clear to his disciples at first: but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory, then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him.)",,,,,,,
22025,"Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead, and gave him life again, had been talking about it.",,,,,,,
22026,"And that was the reason the people went out to him, because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign.",,,,,,,
22027,"Then the Pharisees said one to another, You see, you are unable to do anything: the world has gone after him.",,,,,,,
22028,Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast:,,,,,,,
22029,"They came to Philip, who was of Beth-saida in Galilee, and made a request, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.",,,,,,,
22030,Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew; and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus.,,,,,,,
22031,"And Jesus said to them in answer, The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come.",,,,,,,
22032,"Truly I say to you, If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end, it is still a seed and no more; but through its death it gives much fruit.",,,,,,,
22033,He who is in love with life will have it taken from him; and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever.,,,,,,,
22034,"If any man is my servant, let him come after me; and where I am, there will my servant be. If any man becomes my servant, my Father will give him honour.",,,,,,,
22035,"Now is my soul troubled; and what am I to say? Father, keep me from this hour. No: for this purpose have I come to this hour.",,,,,,,
22036,"Father, give glory to your name. Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, I have given it glory, and I will give it glory again.",,,,,,,
22037,"Hearing the sound, a number of people who were there said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him.",,,,,,,
22038,"Jesus said in answer, This voice came not for me but for you.",,,,,,,
22039,Now is this world to be judged: now will the ruler of this world be sent out.,,,,,,,
22040,"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will make all men come to me.",,,,,,,
22041,"(This he said, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)",,,,,,,
22042,"Then the people in answer said to him, The law says that the Christ will have life without end: how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?",,,,,,,
22043,"Jesus said to them, For a little time longer the light will be among you; while you have the light go on walking in it, so that the dark may not overtake you: one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going.",,,,,,,
22044,"In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them.",,,,,,,
22045,"But though he had done such a number of signs before them, they still had no belief in him:",,,,,,,
22046,"So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true, when he said, Lord, who has any belief in our preaching? and the arm of the Lord, to whom has it been unveiled?",,,,,,,
22047,"For this reason they were unable to have belief, because Isaiah said again,",,,,,,,
22048,"He has made their eyes blind, and their hearts hard; for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts, and be changed, and I might make them well.",,,,,,,
22049,(Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory. His words were about him.),,,,,,,
22050,"However, a number even of the rulers had belief in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue:",,,,,,,
22051,For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God.,,,,,,,
22052,"Then Jesus said with a loud voice, He who has faith in me, has faith not in me, but in him who sent me.",,,,,,,
22053,"And he who sees me, sees him who sent me.",,,,,,,
22054,"I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark.",,,,,,,
22055,"And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them, I am not his judge: I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world.",,,,,,,
22056,"He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart, is not without a judge: the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day.",,,,,,,
22057,"For I have not said it on my authority, but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it.",,,,,,,
22058,"And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life: so that the things which I say, I say them even as the Father says them to me.Now before the feast of the Passover, it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to th",Father. Hav,ng,n,e h,d lo,e f,r tho
22059,"So while a meal was going on, the Evil One having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to be false to him,",,,,,,,
22060,"Jesus, being conscious that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he came from God and was going to God,",,,,,,,
22061,"Got up from table, put off his robe and took a cloth and put it round him.",,,,,,,
22062,Then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him.,,,,,,,
22063,"So he came to Simon Peter. Peter said, Lord, are my feet to be washed by you?",,,,,,,
22064,"And Jesus, answering, said to him, What I do is not clear to you now, but it will be clear to you in time to come.",,,,,,,
22065,"Peter said, I will never let my feet be washed by you, never. Jesus said in answer, If I do not make you clean you have no part with me.",,,,,,,
22066,"Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head.",,,,,,,
22067,"Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over: and you, my disciples, are clean, but not all of you.",,,,,,,
22068,"(He had knowledge who was false to him; that is why he said, You are not all clean.)",,,,,,,
22069,"Then, after washing their feet and putting on his robe again, he took his seat and said to them, Do you see what I have done to you?",,,,,,,
22070,You give me the name of Master and Lord: and you are right; that is what I am.,,,,,,,
22071,"If then I, the Lord and the Master, have made your feet clean, it is right for you to make one another's feet clean.",,,,,,,
22072,"I have given you an example, so that you may do what I have done to you.",,,,,,,
22073,"Truly I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him.",,,,,,,
22074,"If these things are clear to you, happy are you if you do them.",,,,,,,
22075,"I am not talking of you all: I have knowledge of my true disciples, but things are as they are, so that the Writings may come true, The foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me.",,,,,,,
22076,"From this time forward, I give you knowledge of things before they come about, so that when they come about you may have belief that I am he.",,,,,,,
22077,"Truly I say to you, He who takes to his heart anyone whom I send, takes me to his heart; and he who so takes me, takes him who sent me.",,,,,,,
22078,"When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit, and gave witness, saying, Truly I say to you, that one of you will be false to me.",,,,,,,
22079,"Then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another, in doubt as to whom he had in mind.",,,,,,,
22080,"There was at table one of his disciples, the one dear to Jesus, resting his head on Jesus' breast.",,,,,,,
22081,"Making a sign to him, Simon Peter said, Who is it he is talking about?",,,,,,,
22082,"He, then, resting his head on Jesus' breast, said to him, Lord, who is it?",,,,,,,
22083,"This was the answer Jesus gave: It is the one to whom I will give this bit of bread after I have put it in the vessel. Then he took the bit of bread, put it into the vessel, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.",,,,,,,
22084,"And when Judas took the bread Satan went into him. Then Jesus said to him, Do quickly what you have to do.",,,,,,,
22085,Now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him.,,,,,,,
22086,"Some were of the opinion that because Judas kept the money-bag Jesus said to him, Get the things we have need of for the feast; or, that he was to give something to the poor.",,,,,,,
22087,"So Judas, having taken the bit of bread, straight away went out: and it was night.",,,,,,,
22088,"Then when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is glory given to the Son of man, and God is given glory in him.",,,,,,,
22089,"If God is given glory in him, God will give him glory in himself, and will give him glory even now.",,,,,,,
22090,"My dear children, I am only to be with you a little longer. Then you will be looking for me: and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you, Where I am going you may not come.",,,,,,,
22091,"I give you a new law: Have love one for another; even as I have had love for you, so are you to have love one for another.",,,,,,,
22092,"By this it will be clear to all men that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.",,,,,,,
22093,"Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus said in answer, Where I am going you may not come with me now, but you will come later.",,,,,,,
22094,"Peter said to him, Why may I not come with you even now? I will give up my life for you.",,,,,,,
22095,"Jesus said in answer, Will you give up your life for me? Truly I say to you, Before the cry of the cock you will have said three times that you are not my disciple.Let not your heart be troubled: have faith in God and have faith in me.",,,,,,,
22096,"In my Father's house are rooms enough; if it was not so, would I have said that I am going to make ready a place for you?",,,,,,,
22097,"And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will come back again and will take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am.",,,,,,,
22098,"And you all have knowledge of where I am going, and of the way to it.",,,,,,,
22099,"Thomas said, Lord, we have no knowledge of where you are going; how may we have knowledge of the way?",,,,,,,
22100,"Jesus said to him, I am the true and living way: no one comes to the Father but by me.",,,,,,,
22101,"If you had knowledge of me, you would have knowledge of my Father: you have knowledge of him now and have seen him.",,,,,,,
22102,"Philip said to him, Lord, let us see the Father, and we have need of nothing more.",,,,,,,
22103,"Jesus said to him, Philip, have I been with you all this time, and still you have no knowledge of me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. Why do you say, Let us see the Father?",,,,,,,
22104,"Have you not faith that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words which I say to you, I say not from myself: but the Father who is in me all the time does his works.",,,,,,,
22105,"Have faith that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me: at least, have faith in me because of what I do.",,,,,,,
22106,"Truly I say to you, He who puts his faith in me will do the very works which I do, and he will do greater things than these, because I am going to my Father.",,,,,,,
22107,"And whatever request you make in my name, that I will do, so that the Father may have glory in the Son.",,,,,,,
22108,"If you make any request to me in my name, I will do it.",,,,,,,
22109,"If you have love for me, you will keep my laws.",,,,,,,
22110,"And I will make prayer to the Father and he will give you another Helper to be with you for ever,",,,,,,,
22111,"Even the Spirit of true knowledge. That Spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him: but you have knowledge of him, because he is ever with you and will be in you.",,,,,,,
22112,I will not let you be without a friend: I am coming to you.,,,,,,,
22113,"A little time longer, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me; and you will be living because I am living.",,,,,,,
22114,"At that time it will be clear to you that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I in you.",,,,,,,
22115,"He who has my laws and keeps them, he it is who has love for me: and he who has love for me will be loved by my Father, and I will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him.",,,,,,,
22116,"Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, How is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world?",,,,,,,
22117,"Jesus said to him in answer, If anyone has love for me, he will keep my words: and he will be dear to my Father; and we will come to him and make our living-place with him.",,,,,,,
22118,He who has no love for me does not keep my words; and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the Father's who sent me.,,,,,,,
22119,I have said all this to you while I am still with you.,,,,,,,
22120,"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything I have said to you.",,,,,,,
22121,May peace be with you; my peace I give to you: I give it not as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled; let it be without fear.,,,,,,,
22122,"Keep in mind how I said to you, I go away and come to you again. If you had love for me you would be glad, because I am going to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.",,,,,,,
22123,"And now I have given you word of it before it comes, so that, when it comes, you may have faith.",,,,,,,
22124,"After this I will not say much to you, because the ruler of this world comes: and he has no power over me;",,,,,,,
22125,"But he comes so that the world may see that I have love for the Father, and that I am doing as I am ordered by the Father. Get up, and let us go.I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener.",,,,,,,
22126,"He takes away every branch in me which has no fruit, and every branch which has fruit he makes clean, so that it may have more fruit.",,,,,,,
22127,"You are clean, even now, through the teaching which I have given you.",,,,,,,
22128,"Be in me at all times as I am in you. As the branch is not able to give fruit of itself, if it is not still on the vine, so you are not able to do so if you are not in me.",,,,,,,
22129,"I am the vine, you are the branches: he who is in me at all times as I am in him, gives much fruit, because without me you are able to do nothing.",,,,,,,
22130,"If a man does not keep himself in me, he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch; such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned.",,,,,,,
22131,"If you are in me at all times, and my words are in you, then anything for which you make a request will be done for you.",,,,,,,
22132,"Here is my Father's glory, in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples.",,,,,,,
22133,"Even as the Father has given me his love, so I have given my love to you: be ever in my love.",,,,,,,
22134,"If you keep my laws, you will be ever in my love, even as I have kept my Father's laws, and am ever in his love.",,,,,,,
22135,I have said these things to you so that I may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete.,,,,,,,
22136,"This is the law I give you: Have love one for another, even as I have love for you.",,,,,,,
22137,"Greater love has no man than this, that a man gives up his life for his friends.",,,,,,,
22138,"You are my friends, if you do what I give you orders to do.",,,,,,,
22139,"No longer do I give you the name of servants; because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing: I give you the name of friends, because I have given you knowledge of all the things which my Father has said to me.",,,,,,,
22140,"You did not take me for yourselves, but I took you for myself; and I gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever; so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you.",,,,,,,
22141,So this is my law for you: Have love one for another.,,,,,,,
22142,"If you are hated by the world, keep in mind that I was hated by the world before you.",,,,,,,
22143,"If you were of the world, you would be loved by the world: but because you are not of the world, but I have taken you out of the world, you are hated by the world.",,,,,,,
22144,"Keep in mind the words I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they were cruel to me, they will be cruel to you; if they kept my words, they will keep yours.",,,,,,,
22145,They will do all this to you because of my name — because they have no knowledge of him who sent me.,,,,,,,
22146,If I had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin: but now they have no reason to give for their sin.,,,,,,,
22147,He who has hate for me has hate for my Father.,,,,,,,
22148,"If I had not done among them the works which no other man ever did, they would have had no sin: but now they have seen, and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my Father.",,,,,,,

22169,"Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him, so he said to them, Is this what you are questioning one with another, why I said, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me?",,,,,,,

22209,"And Judas, who was false to him, had knowledge of the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples.",,,,,,,
22210,"So Judas, getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lights and with arms.",,,,,,,
22211,"Then Jesus, having knowledge of everything which was coming on him, went forward and said to them, Who are you looking for?",,,,,,,
22212,"Their answer was, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said, I am he. And Judas, who was false to him, was there at their side.",,,,,,,
22213,"And when he said to them, I am he, they went back, falling to the earth.",,,,,,,
22214,"So again he put the question to them, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.",,,,,,,
22215,"Jesus made answer, I have said that I am he; if you are looking for me, let these men go away.",,,,,,,
22216,"(He said this so that his words might come true, I have kept safe all those whom you gave to me.)",,,,,,,
22217,"Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, took it out and gave the high priest's servant a blow, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.",,,,,,,
22218,"Then Jesus said to Peter, Put back your sword: am I not to take the cup which my Father has given to me?",,,,,,,
22219,Then the band and the chief captain and the police took Jesus and put cords round him.,,,,,,,
22220,"They took him first to Annas, because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year.",,,,,,,
22221,It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people.,,,,,,,
22222,And Simon Peter went after Jesus with another disciple. Now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with Jesus into the house of the high priest;,,,,,,,
22223,"But Peter was kept outside at the door. Then this other disciple, who was a friend of the high priest, came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door, and took Peter in.",,,,,,,
22224,"Then the girl who was the door-keeper said to Peter, Are you not one of this man's disciples? In answer he said, I am not.",,,,,,,
22225,"Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them, warming himself.",,,,,,,
22226,Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.,,,,,,,
22227,"Jesus made answer, I said things openly to the world at all times; I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come; and I have said nothing secretly.",,,,,,,
22228,Why are you questioning me? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them: they have knowledge of what I said.,,,,,,,
22229,"When he said this, one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand, saying, Do you give such an answer to the high priest?",,,,,,,
22230,"Jesus said in answer, If I have said anything evil, give witness to the evil: but if I said what is true, why do you give me blows?",,,,,,,
22231,"Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas, the high priest.",,,,,,,
22232,"But Simon Peter was still there warming himself by the fire. They said to him, Are you not one of his disciples? He said, No, I am not.",,,,,,,
22233,"One of the servants of the high priest, a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter, said, Did I not see you with him in the garden?",,,,,,,
22234,"Then again Peter said, No. And straight away a cock gave its cry.",,,,,,,
22235,"So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not go into the Praetorium, so that they might not become unclean, but might take the Passover.",,,,,,,
22236,So Pilate came out to them and put the question: What have you to say against this man?,,,,,,,
22237,"They said to him in answer, If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you.",,,,,,,
22238,"Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.",,,,,,,
22239,"(That the word of Jesus might come true, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)",,,,,,,
22240,"Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?",,,,,,,
22241,"Jesus made answer, Do you say this of yourself, or did others say it about me?",,,,,,,
22242,"Pilate said, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands: what have you done?",,,,,,,
22243,"Jesus said in answer, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom was of this world, my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews: but my kingdom is not here.",,,,,,,
22244,"Then Pilate said to him, Are you then a king? Jesus made answer, You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I given birth, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might give witness to what is true. Every lover of what is true gives ear to",my voice.,,,,,,
22245,"Pilate said to him, True? what is true? Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I see no wrong in him.",,,,,,,
22246,But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover. Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?,,,,,,,
22247,"Then again they gave a loud cry, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was an outlaw.Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords.",,,,,,,
22248,"And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.",,,,,,,
22249,"And they kept coming and saying, Long life to the King of the Jews! And they gave him blows with their hands.",,,,,,,
22250,"And Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him.",,,,,,,
22251,"Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Here is the man!",,,,,,,
22252,"So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry, To the cross! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and put him on the cross: I see no crime in him.",,,,,,,
22253,"And the Jews made answer, We have a law, and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God.",,,,,,,
22254,When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater;,,,,,,,
22255,"And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.",,,,,,,
22256,"Then Pilate said to him, You say nothing to me? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross?",,,,,,,
22257,Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.,,,,,,,
22258,"Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.",,,,,,,
22259,"So when these words came to Pilate's ear, he took Jesus out, seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew, Gabbatha, or the Stone Floor.",,,,,,,
22260,"(It was the day when they made ready for the Passover; and it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, There is your King!",,,,,,,
22261,"Then they gave a loud cry, Away with him! away with him! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Am I to put your King to death on the cross? The chief priests said in answer, We have no king but Caesar.",,,,,,,
22262,So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross. And they took Jesus away;,,,,,,,
22263,"And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):",,,,,,,
22264,"Where they put him on the cross with two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle.",,,,,,,
22265,"And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing. The writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",,,,,,,
22266,"The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.",,,,,,,
22267,"Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not put, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.",,,,,,,
22268,"But Pilate made answer, What I have put in writing will not be changed.",,,,,,,
22269,"And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.",,,,,,,
22270,"So they said among themselves, Let this not be cut up, but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it. (They did this so that the Writings might come true, which say, They made a distribution of my clothing among them, and my coat they p",t to the dec,sio,,f c,ance,) T,is wa
22271,"Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.",,,,,,,
22272,"So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him, he said to his mother, Mother, there is your son!",,,,,,,
22273,"Then he said to the disciple, There is your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house.",,,,,,,
22274,"After this, being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true, Jesus said, Give me water.",,,,,,,
22275,"Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.",,,,,,,
22276,"So when Jesus had taken the wine he said, All is done. And with his head bent he gave up his spirit.",,,,,,,
22277,"Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they migh",be taken aw,y.,,,,,
22278,"So the men of the army came, and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus:",,,,,,,
22279,"But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead by this time, and so his legs were not broken;",,,,,,,
22280,"But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.",,,,,,,
22281,And he who saw it has given witness (and his witness is true; he is certain that what he says is true) so that you may have belief.,,,,,,,
22282,"These things came about so that the Writings might be true, No bone of his body will be broken.",,,,,,,
22283,"And again another verse says, They will see him who was wounded by their spears.",,,,,,,
22284,"After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate said he might do so. So he went and took away his body.",,,,,,,
22285,"And Nicodemus came (he who had first come to Jesus by night) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed, about a hundred pounds.",,,,,,,
22286,"Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.",,,,,,,
22287,"Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.",,,,,,,
22288,"So they put Jesus there, because it was the Jews' day of getting ready for the Passover, and the place was near.Now on the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken",way from it.,,,,,,
22289,"Then she went running to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him.",,,,,,,
22290,So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead.,,,,,,,
22291,"They went running together, and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock;",,,,,,,
22292,"And looking in, he saw the linen bands on the earth; but he did not go in,",,,,,,,
22293,"Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock; and he saw the linen bands on the earth,",,,,,,,
22294,"And the cloth, which had been round his head, not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself.",,,,,,,
22295,Then the other disciple who came there first went in; and he saw and belief came to him.,,,,,,,
22296,For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead.,,,,,,,
22297,So then the disciples went away again to their houses.,,,,,,,
22298,"But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock, weeping; and while she was weeping and looking into the hole,",,,,,,,
22299,"She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head and the other at the feet.",,,,,,,
22300,"They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I have no knowledge where they have put him.",,,,,,,
22301,"And then looking round, she saw Jesus there, but had no idea that it was Jesus.",,,,,,,
22302,"Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.",,,,,,,
22303,"Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master).",,,,,,,
22304,"Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.",,,,,,,
22305,"Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples, and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her.",,,,,,,
22306,"At evening on that day, the first day of the week, when, for fear of the Jews, the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus came among them and said to them, May peace be with you!",,,,,,,
22307,"And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.",,,,,,,
22308,"And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you.",,,,,,,
22309,"And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you:",,,,,,,
22310,"Any to whom you give forgiveness, will be made free from their sins; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness, will still be in their sins.",,,,,,,
22311,"Now Thomas, one of the twelve, named Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.",,,,,,,
22312,"So the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails, and if I do not put my hand into his side, I will never have belief.",,,,,,,
22313,"And after eight days, his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came, and taking his place in the middle of them, he said, May peace be with you!",,,,,,,
22314,"Then he said to Thomas, Put out your finger, and see my hands; and put your hand here into my side: and be no longer in doubt but have belief.",,,,,,,
22315,"And Thomas said in answer, My Lord and my God!",,,,,,,
22316,"Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me you have belief: a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me!",,,,,,,
22317,A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book:,,,,,,,
22318,"But these are recorded, so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, having this faith you may have life in his name.After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and it c",me about in,his,w,y.,,,
22319,"Simon Peter, Thomas named Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were all together.",,,,,,,
22320,"Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, And we will come with you. They went out and got into the boat; but that night they took no fish.",,,,,,,
22321,Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea (though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus).,,,,,,,
22322,"So Jesus said to them, Children, have you taken any fish? They made answer, No.",,,,,,,
22323,"And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.",,,,,,,
22324,"So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter, It is the Lord! Hearing that it was the Lord, Peter put his coat round him (because he was not clothed) and went into the sea.",,,,,,,
22325,"And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.",,,,,,,
22326,"When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish cooking on it, and bread.",,,,,,,
22327,"Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.",,,,,,,
22328,"So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there was such a number the net was not broken.",,,,,,,
22329,"Jesus said to them, Come and take some food. And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question, Who are you? being conscious that it was the Lord.",,,,,,,
22330,"Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.",,,,,,,
22331,Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead.,,,,,,,
22332,"Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.",,,,,,,
22333,"Again, a second time, he said to him, Simon, son of John, have you any love for me? Yes, Lord, he said, you are certain of my love for you. Then take care of my sheep, said Jesus.",,,,,,,
22334,"He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me",Jesus said,o h,m,Th,n gi,e m,shee
22335,"Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.",,,,,,,
22336,"Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.",,,,,,,
22337,"Then Peter, turning round, saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them — the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal, and said, Lord, who is it who will be false to you?",,,,,,,
22338,"Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, What about this man?",,,,,,,
22339,"Jesus said to him, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you? come yourself after me.",,,,,,,
22340,"So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death: Jesus, however, did not say that he would not undergo death, but, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you?",,,,,,,
22341,This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing: and we have knowledge that his witness is true.,,,,,,,
22342,"And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be.I have given an earlier account, O Theophilus, of all the things which Jesus did, an",of his teac,ing,f,om,he f,rst,
22343,"Till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders, through the Holy Spirit, to the Apostles of whom he had made selection:",,,,,,,
22344,"And to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living, after his death; for he was seen by them for forty days, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God:",,,,,,,
22345,"And when they were all together, with him, he gave them orders not to go away from Jerusalem, but to keep there, waiting till the word of the Father was put into effect, of which, he said, I have given you knowledge:",,,,,,,
22346,"For the baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit, after a little time.",,,,,,,
22347,"So, when they were together, they said to him, Lord, will you at this time give back the kingdom to Israel?",,,,,,,
22348,"And he said to them, It is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the Father has kept in his control.",,,,,,,
22349,"But you will have power, when the Holy Spirit has come on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.",,,,,,,
22350,"And when he had said these things, while they were looking, he was taken up, and went from their view into a cloud.",,,,,,,
22351,"And while they were looking up to heaven with great attention, two men came to them, in white clothing,",,,,,,,
22352,"And said, O men of Galilee, why are you looking up into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come again, in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.",,,,,,,
22353,"Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.",,,,,,,
22354,"And when they came in, they went up into the room where they were living; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas, the son of James.",,,,,,,
22355,"And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.",,,,,,,
22356,"And in those days Peter got up among the brothers (there were about one hundred and twenty of them), and said,",,,,,,,
22357,"My brothers, the word of God had to be put into effect, which the Holy Spirit had said before, by the mouth of David, about Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus,",,,,,,,
22358,"For he was numbered among us, and had his part in our work.",,,,,,,
22359,"(Now this man, with the reward of his evil-doing, got for himself a field, and falling head first, came to a sudden and violent end there.",,,,,,,
22360,"And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem, so that the field was named in their language, Akel-dama, or, The field of blood.)",,,,,,,
22361,"For in the book of Psalms it says, Let his house be waste, and let no man be living in it: and, Let his position be taken by another.",,,,,,,
22362,"For this reason, of the men who have been with us all the time, while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,",,,,,,,
22363,"Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us, one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death.",,,,,,,
22364,"And they made selection of two, Joseph, named Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias.",,,,,,,
22365,"And they made prayers and said, Lord, having knowledge of the hearts of all men, make clear which of these two has been marked out by you,",,,,,,,
22366,"To take that position as a servant and Apostle, from which Judas by his sin was shut out, so that he might go to his place.",,,,,,,
22367,"And they put it to the decision of chance, and the decision was given for Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all together in one place.",,,,,,,
22368,"And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind, and all the house where they were was full of it.",,,,,,,
22369,"And they saw tongues, like flames of fire, coming to rest on every one of them.",,,,,,,
22370,"And they were all full of the Holy Spirit, and were talking in different languages, as the Spirit gave them power.",,,,,,,
22371,"Now there were living at Jerusalem, Jews, God-fearing men, from every nation under heaven.",,,,,,,
22372,"And when this sound came to their ears, they all came together, and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language.",,,,,,,
22373,"And they were full of wonder and said, Are not all these men Galilaeans?",,,,,,,
22374,And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth?,,,,,,,
22375,"Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,",,,,,,,
22376,"In Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, andthosewhohavecomefromRome, Jewsbybirthandotherswhohavebecome Jews,",,,,,,,
22377,"Men of Crete and Arabia, to all of us they are talking in our different languages, of the great works of God.",,,,,,,
22378,"And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this?",,,,,,,
22379,"But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine.",,,,,,,
22380,"But Peter, getting up, with the eleven, said in a loud voice, O men of Judaea, and all you who are living in Jerusalem, take note of this and give ear to my words.",,,,,,,
22381,"For these men are not overcome with wine, as it seems to you, for it is only the third hour of the day;",,,,,,,
22382,But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel;,,,,,,,
22383,"And it will come about, in the last days, says God, that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams:",,,,,,,
22384,"And on my men-servants and my women- servants I will send my Spirit, and they will be prophets.",,,,,,,
22385,"And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke:",,,,,,,
22386,"The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood, before that great day of the Lord comes in glory:",,,,,,,
22387,And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation.,,,,,,,
22388,"Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge,",,,,,,,
22389,"Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:",,,,,,,
22390,"But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.",,,,,,,
22391,"For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:",,,,,,,
22392,"And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:",,,,,,,
22393,For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.,,,,,,,
22394,You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.,,,,,,,
22395,"My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today.",,,,,,,
22396,"But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king,",,,,,,,
22397,"He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction.",,,,,,,
22398,"This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses.",,,,,,,
22399,"And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.",,,,,,,
22400,"For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand,",,,,,,,
22401,Till I put all those who are against you under your feet.,,,,,,,
22402,"For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ.",,,,,,,
22403,"Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do?",,,,,,,
22404,"And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.",,,,,,,
22405,"For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God.",,,,,,,
22406,"And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.",,,,,,,
22407,Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day.,,,,,,,
22408,And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.,,,,,,,
22409,But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.,,,,,,,
22410,"And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common;",,,,,,,
22411,"And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need.",,,,,,,
22412,"And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts,",,,,,,,
22413,"Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord.Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer;",,,,,,,
22414,"And a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs, was taken there every day, and put down at the door of the Temple which is named Beautiful, requesting money from those who went into the Temple;",,,,,,,
22415,"He then, seeing Peter and John going into the Temple, made a request to them.",,,,,,,
22416,"And Peter, looking at him, with John, said, Keep your eyes on us.",,,,,,,
22417,"And he gave attention to them, hoping to get something from them.",,,,,,,
22418,"But Peter said, I have no silver or gold, but what I have, that I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up on your feet.",,,,,,,
22419,"And he took him by his right hand, lifting him up; and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong,",,,,,,,
22420,"And, jumping up, he got on to his feet and went into the Temple with them, walking and jumping and giving praise to God.",,,,,,,
22421,And all the people saw him walking and praising God:,,,,,,,
22422,"And they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the Temple, and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place.",,,,,,,
22423,"And while he kept his hands on Peter and John, all the people came running together to the covered way which is named Solomon's, full of wonder.",,,,,,,
22424,"And when Peter saw it he said to the people, You men of Israel, why are you so greatly surprised at this man? or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs?",,,,,,,
22425,"The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has given glory to his servant Jesus; whom you gave up, turning your backs on him, when Pilate had made the decision to let him go free.",,,,,,,
22426,"But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One, and made request for a man of blood to be given to you,",,,,,,,
22427,And put to death the Lord of life; whom God gave back from the dead; of which fact we are witnesses.,,,,,,,
22428,"And his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom you see and have knowledge of: yes, the faith which is through him has made him well, before you all.",,,,,,,
22429,"And now, my brothers, I am conscious that you did this, as did your rulers, without knowledge.",,,,,,,
22430,"But the things which God had made clear before, by the mouth of all the prophets, that the Christ would have to undergo, he has put into effect in this way.",,,,,,,
22431,"So then, let your hearts be changed and be turned to God, so that your sins may be completely taken away, and times of blessing may come from the Lord;",,,,,,,
22432,"And that he may send the Christ who was marked out for you from the first, even Jesus:",,,,,,,
22433,"Who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right, of which God has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been from the earliest times.",,,,,,,
22434,"For Moses said, The Lord will give you a prophet from among your people, like me; you will give ear to everything which he will say to you.",,,,,,,
22435,"And every soul who does not give attention to that prophet, will be cut off from among the people.",,,,,,,
22436,"And all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after, every one of them, gave word of these days.",,,,,,,
22437,"You are the sons of the prophets, and of the agreement which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, Through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth.",,,,,,,
22438,"To you, first, God sent his servant, blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins.And while they were talking to the people, the priests and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees came up to them,",,,,,,,
22439,Being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching Jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead.,,,,,,,
22440,"And they took them and put them in prison till the morning, for it was now evening.",,,,,,,
22441,But a number of those who gave hearing to the word had faith; and they were now about five thousand.,,,,,,,
22442,"And on the day after, the rulers and those in authority and the scribes came together in Jerusalem;",,,,,,,
22443,"And Annas, the high priest, was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all the relations of the high priest.",,,,,,,
22444,"Then sending for Peter and John, they said, By what power and in whose name have you done this?",,,,,,,
22445,"Then Peter, being full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, O you rulers of the people and men of authority,",,,,,,,
22446,"If we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill, as to how he has been made well,",,,,,,,
22447,"Take note, all of you, and all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you put to death on the cross, whom God gave back from the dead, even through him is this man now before you completely well.",,,,,,,
22448,"He is the stone which you builders had no use for, but which has been made the chief stone of the building.",,,,,,,
22449,"And in no other is there salvation: for there is no other name under heaven, given among men, through which we may have salvation.",,,,,,,
22450,"Now when they saw that Peter and John were without fear, though they were men of no education or learning, they were greatly surprised; and they took note of them that they had been with Jesus.",,,,,,,
22451,"And, seeing that the man who had been made well was there with them, they were not able to say anything against it.",,,,,,,
22452,"But when they had given them orders to go out of the Sanhedrin, they had a discussion among themselves,",,,,,,,
22453,"Saying, What are we to do with these men? for certainly it is clear to all who are living in Jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them, and it is not possible to say that it is not so.",,,,,,,
22454,"But so that it may not go farther among the people, let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name.",,,,,,,
22455,"And they sent for them, and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of Jesus.",,,,,,,
22456,"But Peter and John in answer said to them, It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God:",,,,,,,
22457,For it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of.,,,,,,,
22458,"And when they had said more sharp words to them, they let them go, not seeing what punishment they might give them, because of the people; for all men were giving praise to God for what had taken place.",,,,,,,
22459,For the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old.,,,,,,,
22460,"And when they had been made free, they came back to their friends, and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them.",,,,,,,
22461,"And hearing it, they all, with one mind, made prayer to God and said, O Lord, maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them:",,,,,,,
22462,"Who has said, by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish?",,,,,,,
22463,"The kings of the earth were lifted up, the rulers came together, against the Lord, and against his Christ:",,,,,,,
22464,"For, truly, in this town, against your holy servant, Jesus, who was marked out by you as Christ, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, came together,",,,,,,,
22465,To do that which had been fixed before by your hand and your purpose.,,,,,,,
22466,"And now, Lord, take note of their cruel words, and give your servants power to be preachers of your word without fear,",,,,,,,
22467,While your hand is stretched out to do works of mercy; so that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.,,,,,,,
22468,"And when their prayer was ended, the place where they were was violently moved, and they all became full of the Holy Spirit, preaching the word of God without fear.",,,,,,,
22469,And all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul: and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only; but they had all things in common.,,,,,,,
22470,And with great power the Apostles gave witness of the coming back of the Lord Jesus from the dead; and grace was on them all.,,,,,,,
22471,"And no one among them was in need; for everyone who had land or houses, exchanging them for money, took the price of them,",,,,,,,
22472,And put it at the feet of the Apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need.,,,,,,,
22473,"And Joseph, who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas (the sense of which is, Son of comfort), a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth,",,,,,,,
22474,"Having a field, got money for it and put the money at the feet of the Apostles.ButacertainmannamedAnanias, with Sapphirahiswife, gotmoneyforhisproperty,",,,,,,,
22475,"And kept back part of the price, his wife having knowledge of it, and took the rest and put it at the feet of the Apostles.",,,,,,,
22476,"But Peter said, Ananias, why has the Evil One put it into your heart to be false to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?",,,,,,,
22477,"While you had it, was it not your property? and after you had given it in exchange, was it not still in your power? how has this purpose come into your mind? you have been false, not to men, but to God.",,,,,,,
22478,"And at these words, Ananias went down on the earth, and his life went from him: and great fear came on all who were present.",,,,,,,
22479,"And the young men went and made ready his body, and took it out, and put it in the earth.",,,,,,,
22480,"And about three hours after, his wife, having no knowledge of what had taken place, came in.",,,,,,,
22481,"And Peter said to her, Give me an answer: was this amount of money the price of the land? And she said, Yes, it was.",,,,,,,
22482,"But Peter said to her, Why have you made an agreement together to be false to the Spirit of the Lord? See, the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth, are at the door, and they will take you out.",,,,,,,
22483,"And straight away she went down at his feet, and her life went from her: and the young men came in and saw her dead, and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband.",,,,,,,
22484,Then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things.,,,,,,,
22485,Now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles; and they were all together in Solomon's covered way.,,,,,,,
22486,"The others, in fear, kept back from joining them: but the people made much of them;",,,,,,,
22487,"And a great number of men and women had faith, and were joined to the Lord;",,,,,,,
22488,"And they even took into the streets people who were ill, and put them on beds, so that when Peter went by, some of them might be in his shade.",,,,,,,
22489,"And numbers of people came together from the towns round about Jerusalem, with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits: and they were all made well.",,,,,,,
22490,"But the high priest and those who were with him (the Sadducees) were full of envy,",,,,,,,
22491,And they took the Apostles and put them in the common prison.,,,,,,,
22492,"But in the night an angel of the Lord, opening the doors of the prison, took them out and said,",,,,,,,
22493,"Go, take your place in the Temple and give the people all the teaching about this Life.",,,,,,,
22494,"And hearing this, they went into the Temple at dawn, and were teaching. But the high priest and those who were with him got together the Sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to get them.",,,,,,,
22495,"But the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison, and came back with the news,",,,,,,,
22496,"Saying, The doors of the prison were safely shut, and the keepers were at the doors, but when they were open, there was nobody inside.",,,,,,,
22497,"Now, at these words, the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business.",,,,,,,
22498,"And someone came and said to them, The men, whom you put in prison, are in the Temple teaching the people.",,,,,,,
22499,"Then the captain and some of the police went and took them, but not violently, for fear that they might be stoned by the people.",,,,,,,
22500,"And they took them into the Sanhedrin, and the high priest said to them,",,,,,,,
22501,"We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name: and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching, and you are attempting to make us responsible for this man's death.",,,,,,,
22502,"But Peter and the Apostles, answering, said, We have to do the orders of God, not of man.",,,,,,,
22503,"The God of our fathers gave Jesus back to life, whom you had put to death, hanging him on a tree.",,,,,,,
22504,"Him God has put on high at his right hand, as a Ruler and a Saviour, to give to Israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins.",,,,,,,
22505,"And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep his laws.",,,,,,,
22506,"But when these words came to their ears, they were cut to the heart, and had a mind to put them to death.",,,,,,,
22507,"But one of the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a man of learning in the law, of whom all the people had a high opinion, got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time.",,,,,,,
22508,"And he said to them, Men of Israel, take care what you do about these men.",,,,,,,
22509,"For before this there was Theudas, who said he was someone important, to whom about four hundred men gave their support: he was put to death, and his band was broken up and came to nothing.",,,,,,,
22510,"After this man, there was Judas of Galilee, at the time of the numbering, and some of the people went after him: he was put to death, and all his supporters were put to flight.",,,,,,,
22511,"And now I say to you, Do nothing to these men, but let them be: for if this teaching or this work is of men, it will come to nothing:",,,,,,,
22512,"But if it is of God, you will not be able to overcome them, and you are in danger of fighting against God.",,,,,,,
22513,"And he seemed to them to be right: and they sent for the Apostles, and, after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of Jesus, they let them go.",,,,,,,
22514,"So they went away from the Sanhedrin, happy to undergo shame for the Name.",,,,,,,
22515,"And every day, in the Temple and privately, they went on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was increasing, protests were made by the Greek Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were no",taken care,f i,,he,istr,but,on of
22516,"And the Apostles sent for all the disciples and said, It is not right for us to give up preaching the word of God in order to make distribution of food.",,,,,,,
22517,"Take then from among you seven men of good name, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, to whom we may give control of this business.",,,,,,,
22518,Then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word.,,,,,,,
22519,"And this saying was pleasing to all of them: and they made selection of Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas of Antioch, who had become a Jew:",,,,,,,
22520,"These they took to the Apostles, who, after prayer, put their hands on them.",,,,,,,
22521,"And the word of God was increasing in power; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem became very great, and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith.",,,,,,,
22522,"And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.",,,,,,,
22523,"But some of those who were of the Synagogue named that of the Libertines, and some of the men of Cyrene and of Alexandria and those from Cilicia and Asia, had arguments with Stephen.",,,,,,,
22524,"But they were not able to get the better of him, for his words were full of wisdom and of the Spirit.",,,,,,,
22525,"Then they got men to say, He has said evil against Moses and against God, in our hearing.",,,,,,,
22526,"And the people, with the rulers and the scribes, were moved against him, and they came and took him before the Sanhedrin,",,,,,,,
22527,"And they got false witnesses who said, This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law:",,,,,,,
22528,For he has said in our hearing that this Jesus of Nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by Moses.,,,,,,,
22529,"And all those who were in the Sanhedrin, looking at him, saw that his face was like the face of an angel.Then the high priest said, Are these things true?",,,,,,,
22530,"And he said, My brothers and fathers, give hearing. The God of glory came to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he was living in Haran,",,,,,,,
22531,"And said to him, Go out of your land, and away from your family, and come into the land to which I will be your guide.",,,,,,,
22532,"Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and went into Haran; and from there, when his father was dead, he was guided by God into this land, where you are living now:",,,,,,,
22533,"And God gave him no heritage in it, not even enough to put his foot on: but he gave him an undertaking that he would give it to him and to his children after him, though he had no child at that time.",,,,,,,
22534,"And God said that his seed would be living in a strange land, and that they would make them servants, and be cruel to them for four hundred years.",,,,,,,
22535,"And I will be the judge, said God, of that nation which made them servants: and after that, they will come out and give me worship in this place.",,,,,,,
22536,"And he made with him the agreement of which circumcision was the sign. And so Abraham had a son, Isaac, and gave him circumcision on the eighth day; and Isaac had a son, Jacob, and Jacob was the father of the twelve heads of the families of Israel.",,,,,,,
22537,"And the brothers, moved with envy against Joseph, gave him to the Egyptians for money: but God was with him,",,,,,,,
22538,"And made him free from all his troubles, and gave him wisdom and the approval of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and all his house.",,,,,,,
22539,"Now there was no food to be had in all Egypt and Canaan, and there was great trouble: and our fathers were not able to get food.",,,,,,,
22540,"But Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, sent out our fathers the first time.",,,,,,,
22541,"And the second time his brothers had a meeting with Joseph, and Pharaoh had knowledge of Joseph's family.",,,,,,,
22542,"Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all his family, seventy-five persons.",,,,,,,
22543,"And Jacob went down to Egypt, and came to his end there, and so did our fathers;",,,,,,,
22544,"And they were taken over to Shechem, and put to rest in the place which Abraham got for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.",,,,,,,
22545,"But when the time was near for putting into effect the undertaking which God had given to Abraham, the people were increasing in Egypt,",,,,,,,
22546,"Till another king came to power, who had no knowledge of Joseph.",,,,,,,
22547,"He, having evil designs against our nation, was cruel to our fathers, and they were forced to put out their young children, so that they might not go on living.",,,,,,,
22548,"At which time Moses came to birth, and he was very beautiful; and he was kept for three months in his father's house:",,,,,,,
22549,"And when he was put out, Pharaoh's daughter took him and kept him as her son.",,,,,,,
22550,"And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of Egypt, and was great in his words and works.",,,,,,,
22551,"But when he was almost forty years old, it came into his heart to go and see his brothers, the children of Israel.",,,,,,,
22552,"And seeing one of them being attacked, he went to his help and gave the Egyptian a death-blow:",,,,,,,
22553,And he was hoping that his brothers would see that God had sent him to be their saviour; but they did not see.,,,,,,,
22554,"And the day after, he came to them, while they were having a fight, and would have made peace between them, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you do wrong to one another?",,,,,,,
22555,"But the man who was doing wrong to his neighbour, pushing him away, said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?",,,,,,,
22556,Will you put me to death as you did the Egyptian yesterday?,,,,,,,
22557,"And at these words, Moses went in flight to the land of Midian, and was living there for a time, and had two sons.",,,,,,,
22558,"At the end of forty years, an angel came to him in the waste land of Sinai, in the flame of a burning thorn-tree.",,,,,,,
22559,"And Moses, seeing it, was full of wonder, and when he came up to have a nearer view of it, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying,",,,,,,,
22560,"I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And Moses, shaking with fear, kept his eyes from looking at it.",,,,,,,
22561,"And the Lord said, Take off the shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy.",,,,,,,
22562,"Truly, I have seen the sorrows of my people in Egypt, and their cries have come to my ears, and I have come down to make them free: and now, come, I will send you to Egypt.",,,,,,,
22563,"This Moses, whom they would not have, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? him God sent to be a ruler and a saviour, by the hand of the angel whom he saw in the thorn-tree.",,,,,,,
22564,"This man took them out, having done wonders and signs in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the waste land, for forty years.",,,,,,,
22565,"This is the same Moses, who said to the children of Israel, God will give you a prophet from among your brothers, like me.",,,,,,,
22566,"This is the man who was in the church in the waste land with the angel who was talking to him in Sinai, and with our fathers; and to him were given the living words of God, so that he might give them to you.",,,,,,,
22567,"By whom our fathers would not be controlled; but they put him on one side, turning back in their hearts to Egypt,",,,,,,,
22568,"And saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: as for this Moses, who took us out of the land of Egypt, we have no idea what has become of him.",,,,,,,
22569,"And they made the image of a young ox in those days, and made an offering to it, and had joy in the work of their hands.",,,,,,,
22570,"But God was turned from them and let them give worship to the stars of heaven, as it says in the book of the prophets, Did you make offerings to me of sheep and oxen for forty years in the waste land, O house of Israel?",,,,,,,
22571,"And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, images which you made to give worship to them: and I will take you away, farther than Babylon.",,,,,,,
22572,"Our fathers had the Tent of witness in the waste land, as God gave orders to Moses to make it after the design which he had seen.",,,,,,,
22573,"Which our fathers, in their turn, took with them when, with Joshua, they came into the heritage of the nations whom God was driving out before the face of our fathers, till the time of David,",,,,,,,
22574,Who was pleasing to God; and he had a desire to make a holy tent for the God of Jacob.,,,,,,,
22575,But Solomon was the builder of his house.,,,,,,,
22576,"But still, the Most High has not his resting-place in houses made with hands, as the prophet says,",,,,,,,
22577,"Heaven is the seat of my power, and earth is a resting-place for my feet: what sort of house will you make for me, says the Lord, or what is my place of rest?",,,,,,,
22578,Did not my hand make all these things?,,,,,,,
22579,"You whose hearts are hard and whose ears are shut to me; you are ever working against the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.",,,,,,,
22580,Which of the prophets was not cruelly attacked by your fathers? and they put to death those who gave them the news of the coming of the Upright One; whom you have now given up and put to death;,,,,,,,
22581,"You, to whom the law was given as it was ordered by angels, and who have not kept it.",,,,,,,
22582,"Hearing these things, they were cut to the heart and moved with wrath against him.",,,,,,,
22583,"But he was full of the Holy Spirit, and looking up to heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus at the right hand of God.",,,,,,,
22584,"And he said, Now I see heaven open, and the Son of man at the right hand of God.",,,,,,,
22585,"But with loud cries, and stopping their ears, they made an attack on him all together,",,,,,,,
22586,Driving him out of the town and stoning him: and the witnesses put their clothing at the feet of a young man named Saul.,,,,,,,
22587,"And Stephen, while he was being stoned, made prayer to God, saying, Lord Jesus, take my spirit.",,,,,,,
22588,"And going down on his knees, he said in a loud voice, Lord, do not make them responsible for this sin. And when he had said this, he went to his rest.And Saul gave approval to his death. Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in",Jerusalem; a,d a,l,but,the,pos,les w
22589,"And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him.",,,,,,,
22590,"But Saul was burning with hate against the church, going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison.",,,,,,,
22591,But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word.,,,,,,,
22592,And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ.,,,,,,,
22593,"And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said, when they saw the signs which he did.",,,,,,,
22594,"For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well.",,,,,,,
22595,And there was much joy in that town.,,,,,,,
22596,"But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder- worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man:",,,,,,,
22597,"To whom they all gave attention, from the smallest to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is named Great.",,,,,,,
22598,"And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control.",,,,,,,
22599,"But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism.",,,,,,,
22600,"And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise.",,,,,,,
22601,"Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John;",,,,,,,
22602,"Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them:",,,,,,,
22603,For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus.,,,,,,,
22604,"Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them.",,,,,,,
22605,"Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles' hands, he made them an offering of money, saying,",,,,,,,
22606,"Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
22607,"But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price.",,,,,,,
22608,"You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God.",,,,,,,
22609,"Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts.",,,,,,,
22610,For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin.,,,,,,,
22611,"And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me.",,,,,,,
22612,"So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria.",,,,,,,
22613,"But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land.",,,,,,,
22614,"And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship;",,,,,,,
22615,"He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.",,,,,,,
22616,"And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage.",,,,,,,
22617,"And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you?",,,,,,,
22618,"And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side.",,,,,,,
22619,"Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound:",,,,,,,
22620,"Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth.",,,,,,,
22621,"And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other?",,,,,,,
22622,"So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus.",,,,,,,
22623,"And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism?",,,,,,,
22624,[],,,,,,,
22625,"And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism.",,,,,,,
22626,"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy.",,,,,,,
22627,"But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea.But Saul, still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,",,,,,,,
22628,"And made a request for letters from him to the Synagogues of Damascus, so that if there were any of the Way there, men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
22629,"And while he was journeying, he came near Damascus; and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him;",,,,,,,
22630,"And he went down on the earth, and a voice said to him, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly?",,,,,,,
22631,"And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are attacking:",,,,,,,
22632,"But get up, and go into the town, and it will be made clear to you what you have to do.",,,,,,,
22633,"And the men who were with him were not able to say anything; hearing the voice, but seeing no one.",,,,,,,
22634,"And Saul got up from the earth, and when his eyes were open, he saw nothing; and he was guided by the hand into Damascus.",,,,,,,
22635,"And for three days he was not able to see, and he took no food or drink.",,,,,,,
22636,"Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! and he said, Here I am, Lord.",,,,,,,
22637,"And the Lord said to him, Get up, and go to the street which is named Straight, and make search at the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus: for he is at prayer;",,,,,,,
22638,"And he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him, so that he may be able to see.",,,,,,,
22639,"But Ananias said, Lord, I have had accounts of this man from a number of people, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:",,,,,,,
22640,And here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name.,,,,,,,
22641,"But the Lord said, Go without fear: for he is a special vessel for me, to give to the Gentiles and kings and to the children of Israel the knowledge of my name:",,,,,,,
22642,For I will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me.,,,,,,,
22643,"And Ananias went out and came to the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, whom you saw when you were on your journey, has sent me, so that you may be able to see, and be full of the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
22644,"And straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes, and he was able to see; and he got up, and had baptism;",,,,,,,
22645,And when he had taken food his strength came back. And for some days he kept with the disciples who were in Damascus.,,,,,,,
22646,"And straight away, in the Synagogues, he was preaching Jesus as the Son of God.",,,,,,,
22647,"And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said, Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name? and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests.",,,,,,,
22648,"But Saul went on increasing in power, and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ.",,,,,,,
22649,"Then, after some days, the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death:",,,,,,,
22650,"But Saul got knowledge of their design. And they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town, so that they might put him to death:",,,,,,,
22651,But his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket.,,,,,,,
22652,"And when he came to Jerusalem, he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples, but they were all in fear of him, not taking him for a disciple.",,,,,,,
22653,"But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road, and had given hearing to his words, and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear.",,,,,,,
22654,"And he was with them, going in and out at Jerusalem,",,,,,,,
22655,Preaching in the name of the Lord without fear; and he had discussions with the Greek Jews; but they were working for his death.,,,,,,,
22656,"And when the brothers had knowledge of it, they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.",,,,,,,
22657,"And so the church through all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was made strong; and, living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was increased greatly.",,,,,,,
22658,And it came about that while Peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at Lydda.,,,,,,,
22659,"And there was a certain man there, named Aeneas, who for eight years had been in bed, without power of moving.",,,,,,,
22660,"And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you well: get up and make your bed. And straight away he got up.",,,,,,,
22661,"And all those living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and were turned to the Lord.",,,,,,,
22662,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, that is, Dorcas: this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times.",,,,,,,
22663,"And it came about, in those days, that she got ill and came to her death: and when she had been washed, they put her in a room which was high up.",,,,,,,
22664,"And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having knowledge that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to come to them straight away.",,,,,,,
22665,"And Peter went with them. And when he had come, they took him into the room: and all the widows were there, weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which Dorcas had made while she was with them.",,,,,,,
22666,"But Peter made them all go outside, and went down on his knees in prayer; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up. And, opening her eyes, she saw Peter and got up.",,,,,,,
22667,"And he took her hand, lifting her up; and, sending for the saints and widows, he gave her to them, living.",,,,,,,
22668,"And news of it went all through Joppa, and a number of people had faith in the Lord.",,,,,,,
22669,"And he was living in Joppa for some time with Simon, a leather-worker.Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, the captain of the Italian band of the army;",,,,,,,
22670,"A serious-minded man, fearing God with all his family; he gave much money to the poor, and made prayer to God at all times.",,,,,,,
22671,"He saw in a vision, clearly, at about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of the Lord coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius!",,,,,,,
22672,"And he, looking on him in fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your offerings have come up to God, and he has kept them in mind.",,,,,,,
22673,"Now send men to Joppa, and get one Simon, named Peter,",,,,,,,
22674,"Who is living with Simon, a leather-worker, whose house is by the sea.",,,,,,,
22675,"And when the angel who said these words to him had gone away, he sent for two of his house-servants, and a God-fearing man of the army, one of those who were waiting on him at all times;",,,,,,,
22676,"And having given them an account of everything, he sent them to Joppa.",,,,,,,
22677,"Now the day after, when they were on their journey and were near the town, Peter went up to the top of the house for prayer, about the sixth hour:",,,,,,,
22678,"And he was in need of food: but while they were getting it ready, a deep sleep came on him;",,,,,,,
22679,"And he saw the heavens opening, and a vessel coming down, like a great cloth let down on the earth,",,,,,,,
22680,In which were all sorts of beasts and birds.,,,,,,,
22681,"And a voice came to him, saying, Come, Peter; take them for food.",,,,,,,
22682,"But Peter said, No, Lord; for I have never taken food which is common or unclean.",,,,,,,
22683,"And the voice came to him a second time, What God has made clean, do not you make common.",,,,,,,
22684,And this was done three times: and then the vessel was taken back into heaven.,,,,,,,
22685,"Now while Peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made search for Simon's house, came to the door,",,,,,,,
22686,"To see if Simon, named Peter, was living there.",,,,,,,
22687,"And, while Peter was turning the vision over in his mind, the Spirit said to him, See, three men are looking for you.",,,,,,,
22688,"Go down, then, and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them.",,,,,,,
22689,"And Peter went down to the men, and said, I am the man you are looking for: why have you come?",,,,,,,
22690,"And they said, Cornelius, a captain, an upright and God-fearing man, respected by all the nation of the Jews, had word from God by an angel to send for you to his house, and to give hearing to your words.",,,,,,,
22691,"So he took them in for the night. And the day after, he went with them, taking some of the brothers from Joppa with him.",,,,,,,
22692,"And the day after that, they came to Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having got together his relations and his near friends.",,,,,,,
22693,"And when Peter came in, Cornelius came to him and, falling down at his feet, gave him worship.",,,,,,,
22694,"But Peter, lifting him up, said, Get up, for I am a man as you are.",,,,,,,
22695,"And saying these words, he went in, and saw that a great number of people had come together;",,,,,,,
22696,"And he said to them, You yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a Jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation; but God has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean:",,,,,,,
22697,"And so I came without question, when I was sent for. What then is your purpose in sending for me?",,,,,,,
22698,"And Cornelius said, Four days from now I was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour; and I saw before me a man in shining clothing,",,,,,,,
22699,"Who said, Cornelius, your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your offerings are kept in his memory.",,,,,,,
22700,"Send, then, to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you; he is living in the house of Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea.",,,,,,,
22701,"So, straight away, I sent for you; and you have done well to come. And now, we are all present before God, ready to give attention to all the things which the Lord has given you to say.",,,,,,,
22702,"Then Peter said, Truly, I see clearly that God is no respecter of persons:",,,,,,,
22703,"But in every nation, the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him.",,,,,,,
22704,"The word which he sent to the children of Israel, giving the good news of peace through Jesus Christ (who is Lord of all) —",,,,,,,
22705,"That word you yourselves have knowledge of, which was made public through all Judaea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism of which John was the preacher,",,,,,,,
22706,"About Jesus of Nazareth, how God gave the Holy Spirit to him, with power: and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits, for God was with him.",,,,,,,
22707,"And we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they put to death, hanging him on a tree.",,,,,,,
22708,"On the third day God gave him back to life, and let him be seen,",,,,,,,
22709,"Not by all the people, but by witnesses marked out before by God, even by us, who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead.",,,,,,,
22710,"And he gave us orders to give news of this to the people, and to give public witness that this is he whom God has made judge of the living and the dead.",,,,,,,
22711,"To him all the prophets give witness, that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins.",,,,,,,
22712,"While Peter was saying these words, the Holy Spirit came on all those who were hearing the word.",,,,,,,
22713,"And the Jews of the faith, who had come with Peter, were full of wonder, because the Holy Spirit was given to the Gentiles,",,,,,,,
22714,"And they were talking in tongues, and giving glory to God. Then Peter said,",,,,,,,
22715,Will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the Holy Spirit as we have?,,,,,,,
22716,And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they kept him with them for some days.Now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judaea had news that the word of God had been given to the Gentiles.,,,,,,,
22717,"And when Peter came to Jerusalem, those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him,",,,,,,,
22718,"Saying, You went to men without circumcision, and took food with them.",,,,,,,
22719,"But Peter gave them an account of it all in order, saying to them,",,,,,,,
22720,"I was in the town of Joppa, at prayer: and falling into a deep sleep, I saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven, and it came down to me:",,,,,,,
22721,And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds.,,,,,,,
22722,"And a voice came to my ears saying, Come, Peter; take them for food.",,,,,,,
22723,"But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth.",,,,,,,
22724,"But the voice, coming a second time from heaven, said, What God has made clean, do not you make common.",,,,,,,
22725,"And this was done three times, and they were all taken up again into heaven.",,,,,,,
22726,"And at that minute, three men, sent from Caesarea, came to the house where we were.",,,,,,,
22727,"And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers came with me; and we went into that man's house:",,,,,,,
22728,"And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house, saying, Send to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you;",,,,,,,
22729,Who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation.,,,,,,,
22730,"And, while I was talking to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, as on us at first.",,,,,,,
22731,"And the words of the Lord came into my mind, how he said, The baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
22732,"If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God?",,,,,,,
22733,"And hearing these things they said nothing more, but gave glory to God, saying, Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart, so that they may have life.",,,,,,,
22734,"Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus, preaching to the Jews only.",,,,,,,
22735,"But some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, when they came to Antioch, gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks.",,,,,,,
22736,"And the power of the Lord was with them, and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord.",,,,,,,
22737,And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch:,,,,,,,
22738,"Who, when he came and saw the grace of God, was glad; and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts:",,,,,,,
22739,For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a great number were joined to the Lord.,,,,,,,
22740,"Then he went on to Tarsus, looking for Saul;",,,,,,,
22741,"And when he had come across him, he took him to Antioch. And they were with the church there for a year, teaching the people; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch.",,,,,,,
22742,Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.,,,,,,,
22743,"And one of them, named Agabus, said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth: which came about in the time of Claudius.",,,,,,,
22744,"And the disciples, everyone as he was able, made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea:",,,,,,,
22745,"Which they did, sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.Now, about that time, Herod the king made cruel attacks on the Christians.",,,,,,,
22746,"And he put James, the brother of John, to death with the sword.",,,,,,,
22747,And when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he went on to take Peter in addition. This was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread.,,,,,,,
22748,"And having taken him, he put him in prison, with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him; his purpose being to take him out to the people after the Passover.",,,,,,,
22749,So Peter was kept in prison: but the church made strong prayer to God for him.,,,,,,,
22750,"And when Herod was about to take him out, the same night Peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men, and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison.",,,,,,,
22751,"And a great light was seen shining in the room, and an angel of the Lord came to Peter and, touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep, said, Get up quickly. And his chains came off his hands.",,,,,,,
22752,"Then the angel said, Put on your shoes and get ready to go. And he did so. And he said, Put your coat round you and come with me.",,,,,,,
22753,"And he went out after him; and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact, for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision.",,,,,,,
22754,"And when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town, which came open by itself: and they went out and down one street; and then the angel went away.",,,,,,,
22755,"And when Peter came to his senses he said, Now, truly, I am certain that the Lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of Herod, against all the hopes of the Jews.",,,,,,,
22756,"And when he became clear about this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John named Mark, where a number of them had come together for prayer.",,,,,,,
22757,"And he gave a blow on the door, and a young girl came to it, named Rhoda.",,,,,,,
22758,"And hearing the voice of Peter, in her joy she went running, without opening the door, to say that Peter was outside.",,,,,,,
22759,"And they said to her, You are off your head. But still she said, with decision, that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.",,,,,,,
22760,"But Peter went on giving blows on the door: and when it was open and they saw him, they were full of wonder.",,,,,,,
22761,"But he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet, and gave them an account of how the Lord had taken him out of prison. And he said, Give the news to James and the brothers. And then he went away.",,,,,,,
22762,"Now when it was day, the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter.",,,,,,,
22763,"And Herod, when he sent for him, and he was not there, after questioning the watchmen, gave orders that they were to be put to death. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea for a time.",,,,,,,
22764,"Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon: and they came to him, all together, and having made friends with Blastus, the controller of the king's house, they made a request for peace, because their country was dependent on the king's countr",for its foo,.,,,,,
22765,"And on the day which had been fixed, Herod, dressed in his robes and seated in his place, made a public statement to them.",,,,,,,
22766,"And the people, with loud cries, said, It is the voice of a god, not of a man.",,,,,,,
22767,"And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him, because he did not give the glory to God: and his flesh was wasted away by worms, and so he came to his end.",,,,,,,
22768,But the word of the Lord went on increasing.,,,,,,,
22769,"And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem, when their work was ended, taking with them John named Mark.Now there were at Antioch, in the church there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon who was named Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen,",a relation o,He,o,th,kin,", a",d Sau
22770,"And while they were doing the Lord's work, and going without food, the Holy Spirit said, Let Barnabas and Saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me.",,,,,,,
22771,"Then, after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them, and sent them away.",,,,,,,
22772,"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they went by ship to Cyprus.",,,,,,,
22773,"And at Salamis they were preaching the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews: and John was with them, helping them.",,,,,,,
22774,"And when they had gone through all the island to Paphos, they came across a certain wonder-worker and false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus;",,,,,,,
22775,"Who was with the ruler, Sergius Paulus, an able man. This man sent for Barnabas and Saul, desiring to have knowledge of the word of God.",,,,,,,
22776,"But Elymas, the wonder-worker (for that is the sense of his name), put himself against them, with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith.",,,,,,,
22777,"But Saul, whose other name is Paul, being full of the Holy Spirit, looking hard at him, said,",,,,,,,
22778,"O you, who are full of false tricks and evil ways, a son of the Evil One, hating all righteousness, will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord?",,,,,,,
22779,"And now, see, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time. And straight away a dark mist came down on him; and he went about looking for a guide.",,,,,,,
22780,"Then the ruler, when he saw what was done, had faith, being full of wonder at the teaching of the Lord.",,,,,,,
22781,Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
22782,"But they, going through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and they went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and were seated.",,,,,,,
22783,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent to them, saying, Brothers, if you have a word of comfort for the people, say on.",,,,,,,
22784,"And Paul, getting up and making a sign with his hand, said, Men of Israel, and you who have the fear of God, give ear.",,,,,,,
22785,"The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers, lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm took them out of it.",,,,,,,
22786,And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land.,,,,,,,
22787,"And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years.",,,,,,,
22788,"And after these things he gave them judges, till the time of Samuel the prophet.",,,,,,,
22789,"Then at their request for a king, God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the family of Benjamin, who was their king for forty years.",,,,,,,
22790,"And having put him on one side, he made David their king, to whom he gave witness, saying, I have taken David, the son of Jesse, a man dear to my heart, who will do all my pleasure.",,,,,,,
22791,"From this man's seed has God given to Israel a Saviour, even Jesus, as he gave his word;",,,,,,,
22792,For whose coming John made ready the way by preaching to all the people of Israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart.,,,,,,,
22793,"And when John was completing his work, he said, What do I seem to you to be? I am not he; but one is coming after me, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo.",,,,,,,
22794,"My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those among you who have the fear of God, to us the word of this salvation is sent.",,,,,,,
22795,"For the men of Jerusalem and their rulers, having no knowledge of him, or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every Sabbath day, gave effect to them by judging him.",,,,,,,
22796,"And though no cause of death was seen in him, they made a request to Pilate that he might be put to death.",,,,,,,
22797,"And when they had done all the things said in the Writings about him, they took him down from the tree, and put him in the place of the dead.",,,,,,,
22798,But God gave him back from the dead:,,,,,,,
22799,"And for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses before the people.",,,,,,,
22800,"And we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers,",,,,,,,
22801,"Which God has now put into effect for our children, by sending Jesus; as it says in the second Psalm, You are my Son; this day I have given you being.",,,,,,,
22802,"And about his coming back from the dead, never again to go to destruction, he has said these words, I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David.",,,,,,,
22803,"Because he says in another Psalm, You will not let your Holy One see destruction.",,,,,,,
22804,"Now David, having done God's work for his generation, went to sleep, and was put with his fathers, and his body came to destruction:",,,,,,,
22805,"But he, who was lifted up by God, did not see destruction.",,,,,,,
22806,"And so, let it be clear to you, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you:",,,,,,,
22807,"And through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things, from which the law of Moses was not able to make you free.",,,,,,,
22808,So take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you;,,,,,,,
22809,"See, you doubters, have wonder and come to your end; for I will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief, even if it is made clear to you.",,,,,,,
22810,"And when they went out, they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the Sabbath after.",,,,,,,
22811,"Now when the meeting was ended, a number of the Jews and of the God-fearing Gentiles who had become Jews, went after Paul and Barnabas: who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of God.",,,,,,,
22812,"And on the Sabbath after, almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of God.",,,,,,,
22813,"But when the Jews saw such a great number of people, they were full of envy and said evil words against Paul's preaching.",,,,,,,
22814,"Then Paul and Barnabas without fear said, It was necessary for the word of God to be given to you first; but because you will have nothing to do with it, and have no desire for eternal life, it will now be offered to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
22815,"For so the Lord has given us orders, saying, I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.",,,,,,,
22816,"And the Gentiles, hearing this, were glad and gave glory to the word of God: and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith.",,,,,,,
22817,And the word of the Lord went through all the country.,,,,,,,
22818,"But the Jews, working up the feelings of the God-fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town, got an attack started against Paul and Barnabas, driving them out of those parts.",,,,,,,
22819,"But they, shaking off the dust of that place from their feet, came to Iconium.",,,,,,,
22820,And the disciples were full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.Now in Iconium they went together to the Synagogue of the Jews and gave such teaching that a great number of Jews and Greeks had faith.,,,,,,,
22821,"But those Jews who had not the faith, made the minds of the Gentiles bitter against the brothers.",,,,,,,
22822,"So they kept there for a long time, taking heart in the Lord, who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands.",,,,,,,
22823,But there was a division among the people of the town; some were on the side of the Jews and some on the side of the Apostles.,,,,,,,
22824,"And when a violent attempt was made by the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, to make an attack on them and have them stoned,",,,,,,,
22825,"Having got news of it, they went in flight to the towns of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the country round about:",,,,,,,
22826,And went on preaching the good news there.,,,,,,,
22827,"And at Lystra there was a certain man, who from birth had been without the use of his feet, never having had the power of walking.",,,,,,,
22828,"This man was giving ear to the preaching of Paul, who, looking at him, and seeing that he had faith to be made well,",,,,,,,
22829,"Said in a loud voice, Get up on your feet. And, jumping up, he went walking about.",,,,,,,
22830,"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they said in a loud voice, in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the form of men.",,,,,,,
22831,"And they gave the name of Jupiter to Barnabas, and to Paul that of Mercury, because he was the chief talker.",,,,,,,
22832,"And the priest of the image of Jupiter, which was before the town, took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town, and was about to make an offering with the people.",,,,,,,
22833,"But when this came to the ears of the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, they went running out among the people, parting their clothing, and crying out,",,,,,,,
22834,"Good people, why are you doing these things? We are men with the same feelings as you, and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things",n them:,,,,,,
22835,Who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them.,,,,,,,
22836,"But he was not without witness, because he did good, and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit, making your hearts full of food and joy.",,,,,,,
22837,"And even with these words, it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them.",,,,,,,
22838,"But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium, and got control over the people; and after stoning Paul, they had him pulled out of the town, taking him for dead.",,,,,,,
22839,"But when the disciples came round him, he got up and went into the town: and the day after he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.",,,,,,,
22840,"And having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,",,,,,,,
22841,"Making strong the souls of the disciples, saying to them that they were to keep the faith, and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
22842,"And when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church, and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food, they put them into the care of the Lord in whom they had faith.",,,,,,,
22843,And they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.,,,,,,,
22844,"And, after preaching the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;",,,,,,,
22845,"And from there they went by ship to Antioch, where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done.",,,,,,,
22846,"And when they came there, and had got the church together, they gave them an account of all the things which God had done through them, and how he had made open a door of faith to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
22847,"And they were with the disciples there for a long time.Now certain men came down from Judaea, teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision, after the rule of Moses, there is no salvation.",,,,,,,
22848,"And after Paul and Barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them, the brothers made a decision to send Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem about this question.",,,,,,,
22849,"So they, being sent on their way by the church, went through Phoenicia and Samaria, giving news of the salvation of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the brothers.",,,,,,,
22850,"And when they came to Jerusalem, they had a meeting with the church and the Apostles and the rulers, and they gave an account of all the things which God had done through them.",,,,,,,
22851,"But some of the Pharisees, who were of the faith, got up and said, It is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of Moses.",,,,,,,
22852,And the Apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question.,,,,,,,
22853,"And when there had been much discussion, Peter got up and said to them, My brothers, you have knowledge that some time back it was God's pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the Gentiles so that they might have faith.",,,,,,,
22854,"And God, the searcher of hearts, was a witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit even as he did to us;",,,,,,,
22855,"Making no division between them and us, but making clean their hearts by faith.",,,,,,,
22856,"Why then are you testing God, by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it?",,,,,,,
22857,But we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they.,,,,,,,
22858,And all the people were quiet while Barnabas and Paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which God had done among the Gentiles by them.,,,,,,,
22859,"And when they had come to an end, James, answering, said, My brothers, give ear to me:",,,,,,,
22860,Symeon has given an account of how God was first pleased to take from among the Gentiles a people for himself.,,,,,,,
22861,"And this is in agreement with the words of the prophets, as it is said,",,,,,,,
22862,"After these things I will come back, and will put up the tent of David which has been broken down, building up again its broken parts and making it complete:",,,,,,,
22863,"So that the rest of men may make search for the Lord, and all the Gentiles on whom my name is named,",,,,,,,
22864,"Says the Lord, who has made these things clear from the earliest times.",,,,,,,
22865,"For this reason my decision is, that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God;",,,,,,,
22866,"But that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods, and from the evil desires of the body, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from blood.",,,,,,,
22867,"For Moses, from times long past, has his preachers in every town, reading his law in the Synagogues every Sabbath.",,,,,,,
22868,"Then it seemed good to the Apostles and the rulers and all the church, to send men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, named Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers:",,,,,,,
22869,"And they sent a letter by them, saying, The Apostles and the older brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, may joy be with you:",,,,,,,
22870,"Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words, putting your souls in doubt; to whom we gave no such order;",,,,,,,
22871,"It seemed good to us, having come to an agreement together, to send these men to you, with our well loved Barnabas and Paul,",,,,,,,
22872,Men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
22873,"And so we have sent Judas and Silas, who will say the same things to you themselves, by word of mouth.",,,,,,,
22874,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to put on you nothing more than these necessary things;",,,,,,,
22875,"To keep from things offered to false gods, and from blood, and from things put to death in ways which are against the law, and from the evil desires of the body; if you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. May you be happy.",,,,,,,
22876,"So they, being sent away, came down to Antioch, and having got the people together, they gave them the letter.",,,,,,,
22877,"And after reading it, they were glad of its comfort.",,,,,,,
22878,"And Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith.",,,,,,,
22879,"And when they had been there for some time, they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.",,,,,,,
22880,[],,,,,,,
22881,"But Paul and Barnabas kept on in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of God, with a number of others.",,,,,,,
22882,"And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of God, and see how they are.",,,,,,,
22883,"And Barnabas had a desire to take with them John, named Mark.",,,,,,,
22884,"But Paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with the work.",,,,,,,
22885,"And there was a sharp argument between them, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and went by ship to Cyprus;",,,,,,,
22886,But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers.,,,,,,,
22887,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches stronger in the faith.And he came to Derbe and Lystra: and there was a certain disciple there named Timothy, whose mother was one of the Jews of the faith, but his father was a Greek;",,,,,,,
22888,Of whom the brothers at Lystra and Iconium had a high opinion.,,,,,,,
22889,"Paul had a desire for him to go with him, and he gave him circumcision because of the Jews who were in those parts: for they all had knowledge that his father was a Greek.",,,,,,,
22890,"And on their way through the towns, they gave them the rules which had been made by the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem, so that they might keep them.",,,,,,,
22891,So the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day.,,,,,,,
22892,"And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia;",,,,,,,
22893,"And having come to Mysia, they made an attempt to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them;",,,,,,,
22894,"And going past Mysia, they came down to Troas.",,,,,,,
22895,"And Paul had a vision in the night; a man of Macedonia came, requesting him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia and give us help.",,,,,,,
22896,"And when he had seen the vision, straight away we made the decision to go into Macedonia, for it seemed certain to us that God had sent us to give the good news to them.",,,,,,,
22897,"So, from Troas we went straight by ship to Samothrace and the day after to Neapolis;",,,,,,,
22898,"And from there to Philippi, which is the most important town of Macedonia and a Roman colony: and we were there for some days.",,,,,,,
22899,"And on the Sabbath we went outside the town, by the river, where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer; and, being seated, we had talk with the women who had come together.",,,,,,,
22900,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a trader in purple cloth of the town of Thyatira, and a God-fearing woman, gave ear to us: whose heart the Lord made open to give attention to the things which Paul was saying.",,,,,,,
22901,"And when she and her family had had baptism, she made a request to us, saying, If it seems to you that I am true to the Lord, come into my house and be my guests. And she made us come.",,,,,,,
22902,"And when we were going to the place of prayer, we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future, whose masters made great profit from her power.",,,,,,,
22903,"She came after Paul and us, crying out and saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are giving you news of the way of salvation.",,,,,,,
22904,"And this she did on a number of days. But Paul was greatly troubled and, turning, said to the spirit, I give you orders in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.",,,,,,,
22905,"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they took Paul and Silas, pulling them into the market-place before the rulers;",,,,,,,
22906,"And when they had taken them before the authorities, they said, These men, who are Jews, are greatly troubling our town;",,,,,,,
22907,"Teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep, being Romans.",,,,,,,
22908,"And the people made an attack on them all together: and the authorities took their clothing off them, and gave orders for them to be whipped.",,,,,,,
22909,"And when they had given them a great number of blows, they put them in prison, giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely:",,,,,,,
22910,"And he, having such orders, put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet.",,,,,,,
22911,"But about the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were making prayers and songs to God in the hearing of the prisoners;",,,,,,,
22912,"And suddenly there was an earth-shock, so that the base of the prison was moved: and all the doors came open, and everyone's chains came off.",,,,,,,
22913,"And the keeper, coming out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, took his sword and was about to put himself to death, fearing that the prisoners had got away.",,,,,,,
22914,"But Paul said in a loud voice, Do yourself no damage, for we are all here.",,,,,,,
22915,"And he sent for lights and came rushing in and, shaking with fear, went down on his face before Paul and Silas,",,,,,,,
22916,"And took them out and said, Sirs, what have I to do to get salvation?",,,,,,,
22917,"And they said, Have faith in the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will have salvation.",,,,,,,
22918,And they gave the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.,,,,,,,
22919,"And that same hour of the night, he took them, and when he had given attention to their wounds, he and all his family had baptism straight away.",,,,,,,
22920,"And he took them into his house and gave them food, and he was full of joy, having faith in God with all his family.",,,,,,,
22921,"But when it was day, the authorities sent the police, saying, Let these men go.",,,,,,,
22922,"And the keeper said to Paul, The authorities have given orders to let you go: come out now, and go in peace.",,,,,,,
22923,"But Paul said to them, They have given us who are Romans a public whipping without judging us, and have put us in prison. Will they now send us out secretly? no, truly, let them come themselves and take us out.",,,,,,,
22924,"And the police gave an account of these words to the authorities, and they were full of fear on hearing that they were Romans;",,,,,,,
22925,"Then they came and made prayers to them, requesting them, when they had taken them out, to go away from the town.",,,,,,,
22926,"And they came out of the prison and went to the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away.Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessa- lonica, where there was a Synagogue of t",e Jews:,,,,,,
22927,"And Paul, as he generally did, went in to them, and on three Sabbath days had discussions with them from the holy Writings,",,,,,,,
22928,"Saying to them clearly and openly that Christ had to be put to death and come back to life again; and that this Jesus, whom, he said, I am preaching to you, is the Christ.",,,,,,,
22929,"And some of them had faith, and were joined to Paul and Silas; and a number of the God-fearing Greeks, and some of the chief women.",,,,,,,
22930,"But the Jews, being moved with envy, took with them certain low persons from among the common people, and getting together a great number of people, made an outcry in the town, attacking the house of Jason with the purpose of taking them out to the peopl",.,,,,,,
22931,"And when they were not able to get them, they took Jason and some of the brothers by force before the rulers of the town, crying, These men, who have made trouble all over the world have now come here;",,,,,,,
22932,"Whom Jason has taken into his house: and they are acting against the orders of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.",,,,,,,
22933,And hearing these things the people and the rulers of the town were troubled.,,,,,,,
22934,"And having made Jason and the others give an undertaking to keep the peace, they let them go.",,,,,,,
22935,"And the brothers straight away sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea: and they, when they came there, went to the Synagogue of the Jews.",,,,,,,
22936,"Now these were more noble than the Jews of Thessalonica, for they gave serious attention to the word, searching in the holy Writings every day, to see if these things were so.",,,,,,,
22937,"And a number of them had faith, and no small number of the Greek women of high position and of the men.",,,,,,,
22938,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had news that Paul was preaching the word at Beroea, they came there, troubling the people and working them up.",,,,,,,
22939,So the brothers sent Paul straight away to the sea: but Silas and Timothy kept there still.,,,,,,,
22940,"But those who went with Paul took him as far as Athens, and then went away, with orders from him to Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly.",,,,,,,
22941,"Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was troubled, for he saw all the town full of images of the gods.",,,,,,,
22942,"So he had discussions in the Synagogue with the Jews and God-fearing Gentiles, and every day in the market-place with those who were there.",,,,,,,
22943,"And some of those who were supporters of the theories of the Epicureans and the Stoics, had a meeting with him. And some said, What is this talker of foolish words saying? And others, He seems to be a preacher of strange gods: because he was preaching of",Jesus and hi,co,i,g b,ck f,om,he de
22944,"And they took him to Mars' Hill, saying, Will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours?",,,,,,,
22945,"For you seem to us to say strange things, and we have a desire to get the sense of them.",,,,,,,
22946,(Now all the Athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new.),,,,,,,
22947,"And Paul got to his feet on Mars' Hill and said, O men of Athens, I see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods.",,,,,,,
22948,"For when I came by, I was looking at the things to which you give worship, and I saw an altar with this writing on it, TO THE GOD OF WHOM THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE. Now, what you, without knowledge, give worship to, I make clear to you.",,,,,,,
22949,"The God who made the earth and everything in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, is not housed in buildings made with hands;",,,,,,,
22950,"And he is not dependent on the work of men's hands, as if he had need of anything, for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things;",,,,,,,
22951,"And he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth, ordering their times and the limits of their lands,",,,,,,,
22952,"So that they might make search for God, in order, if possible, to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him, though he is not far from every one of us:",,,,,,,
22953,"For in him we have life and motion and existence; as certain of your verse writers have said, For we are his offspring.",,,,,,,
22954,"If then we are the offspring of God, it is not right for us to have the idea that God is like gold or silver or stone, formed by the art or design of man.",,,,,,,
22955,Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God; but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart:,,,,,,,
22956,Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work; of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead.,,,,,,,
22957,"Now on hearing about the coming back from death, some of them made sport of it, but others said, Let us go more fully into this another time.",,,,,,,
22958,And so Paul went away from among them.,,,,,,,
22959,"But some men gave him their support: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.After these things, he went away from Athens, and came to Corinth.",,,,,,,
22960,"And there he came across a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by birth, who not long before had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had given orders that all Jews were to go away from Rome: and he came to them;",,,,,,,
22961,"And because he was of the same trade, he was living with them, and they did their work together; for by trade they were tent-makers.",,,,,,,
22962,"And every Sabbath he had discussions in the Synagogue, turning Jews and Greeks to the faith.",,,,,,,
22963,"And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was completely given up to the word, preaching to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.",,,,,,,
22964,"And when they put themselves against him, and said evil words, he said, shaking his clothing, Your blood be on your heads, I am clean: from now I will go to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
22965,"And moving from there, he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a God- fearing man, whose house was very near the Synagogue.",,,,,,,
22966,"And Crispus, the ruler of the Synagogue, with all his family, had faith in the Lord; and a great number of the people of Corinth, hearing the word, had faith and were given baptism.",,,,,,,
22967,"And the Lord said to Paul in the night, in a vision, Have no fear and go on preaching:",,,,,,,
22968,"For I am with you, and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage: for I have a number of people in this town.",,,,,,,
22969,"And he was there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.",,,,,,,
22970,"But when Gallio was ruler of Achaia, all the Jews together made an attack on Paul, and took him to the judge's seat,",,,,,,,
22971,"Saying, This man is teaching the people to give worship to God in a way which is against the law.",,,,,,,
22972,"But when Paul was about to say something, Gallio said to the Jews, If this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime, there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing:",,,,,,,
22973,"But if it is a question of words or names or of your law, see to it yourselves; I will not be a judge of such things.",,,,,,,
22974,And he sent them away from the judge's seat.,,,,,,,
22975,"And they all made an attack on Sosthenes, the ruler of the Synagogue, and gave him blows before the judge's seat; but Gallio gave no attention to these things.",,,,,,,
22976,"And Paul, after waiting some days, went away from the brothers and went by ship to Syria, Priscilla and Aquila being with him; and he had had his hair cut off in Cenchrea, for he had taken an oath.",,,,,,,
22977,And they came down to Ephesus and he left them there: and he himself went into the Synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.,,,,,,,
22978,"And being requested by them to be there for a longer time, he said, No;",,,,,,,
22979,"And went from them, saying, I will come back to you if God lets me; and he took ship from Ephesus.",,,,,,,
22980,"And when he had come to land at Caesarea, he went to see the church, and then went down to Antioch.",,,,,,,
22981,"And having been there for some time, he went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, making the disciples strong in the faith.",,,,,,,
22982,"Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, and a man of learning, came to Ephesus; and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings.",,,,,,,
22983,"This man had been trained in the way of the Lord; and burning in spirit, he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus, though he had knowledge only of John's baptism:",,,,,,,
22984,"And he was preaching in the Synagogue without fear. But Priscilla and Aquila, hearing his words, took him in, and gave him fuller teaching about the way of God.",,,,,,,
22985,"And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia, the brothers gave him help, and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them: and when he had come, he gave much help to those who had faith through grace:",,,,,,,
22986,"For he overcame the Jews in public discussion, making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus.And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having gone through the higher country, came to Ephesus, where there were certain disc",ples:,,,,,,
22987,"And he said to them, Did you get the Holy Spirit when you had faith? And they said to him, No, we have had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
22988,"And he said, What sort of baptism did you have? And they said, The baptism of John.",,,,,,,
22989,"And Paul said, John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart, saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.",,,,,,,
22990,"And hearing this, they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.",,,,,,,
22991,"And when Paul had put his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they had the power of talking in tongues, and acting like prophets.",,,,,,,
22992,And there were about twelve of these men.,,,,,,,
22993,"And he went into the Synagogue, and for three months he was preaching there without fear, reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
22994,"But because some of the people were hard-hearted and would not give hearing, saying evil words about the Way before the people, he went away from them, and kept the disciples separate, reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus.",,,,,,,
22995,"And this went on for two years, so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord, Greeks as well as Jews.",,,,,,,
22996,And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul:,,,,,,,
22997,"So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill, and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out.",,,,,,,
22998,"But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits, took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I give you orders, by Jesus, whom Paul is preaching.",,,,,,,
22999,"And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jew and a chief priest, who did this.",,,,,,,
23000,"And the evil spirit, answering, said to them, I have knowledge of Jesus, and of Paul, but who are you?",,,,,,,
23001,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was, jumping on them, was stronger than the two of them, and overcame them, so that they went running from that house, wounded and without their clothing.",,,,,,,
23002,"And this came to the ears of all those, Jews and Greeks, who were living at Ephesus; and fear came on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great.",,,,,,,
23003,And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts.,,,,,,,
23004,And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone: and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver.,,,,,,,
23005,So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power.,,,,,,,
23006,"Now after these things were ended, Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I have a desire to see Rome.",,,,,,,
23007,"And having sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself went on living in Asia for a time.",,,,,,,
23008,And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way.,,,,,,,
23009,"For there was a certain man named Demetrius, a silver-worker, who made silver boxes for the images of Diana, and gave no small profit to the workmen;",,,,,,,
23010,"Whom he got together, with other workmen of the same trade, and said to them, Men, it is clear that from this business we get our wealth.",,,,,,,
23011,"And you see, for it has come to your ears, that not only at Ephesus, but almost all through Asia, this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away, saying that those are not gods who are made by men's hands:",,,,,,,
23012,"And there is danger, not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men, but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured, and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship, will be put down from her high posi",ion.,,,,,,
23013,"And hearing this, they were very angry, crying out and saying, Great is Diana of Ephesus.",,,,,,,
23014,"And the town was full of noise and trouble, and they all came running into the theatre, having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul.",,,,,,,
23015,"And when Paul was about to go in to the people, the disciples did not let him.",,,,,,,
23016,"And some of the rulers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre.",,,,,,,
23017,"And some said one thing, and some another: for there was no order in the meeting; and most of them had no idea why they had come together.",,,,,,,
23018,"Then they took Alexander out from among the people, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander, making a sign with his hand, was about to make a statement to the people in answer:",,,,,,,
23019,"But when they saw that he was a Jew, all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus.",,,,,,,
23020,"And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet, he said, Men of Ephesus, is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana, who was sent down from Jupiter?",,,,,,,
23021,"So then, because these things may not be doubted, it would be better for you to be quiet, and do nothing unwise.",,,,,,,
23022,"For you have taken these men, who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess.",,,,,,,
23023,"If, then, Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man, the law is open to them, and there are judges; let them put up a cause at law against one another.",,,,,,,
23024,"But if any other business is in question, let it be taken up in the regular meeting.",,,,,,,
23025,"For, truly, we are in danger of being made responsible for this day's trouble, there being no cause for it: and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together.",,,,,,,
23026,"And when he had said this, he sent the meeting away.And after the noise had come to an end, Paul, having sent for the disciples and given them comfort, went away from them to Macedonia.",,,,,,,
23027,"And when he had gone through those parts and giventhem much teaching, he came into Greece.",,,,,,,
23028,"And when he had been there three months, because the Jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for Syria, he made a decision to go back through Macedonia.",,,,,,,
23029,"And Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia, went with him as far as Asia.",,,,,,,
23030,"But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.",,,,,,,
23031,"And we went away from Philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days; and we were there for seven days.",,,,,,,
23032,"And on the first day of the week, when we had come together for the holy meal, Paul gave them a talk, for it was his purpose to go away on the day after; and he went on talking till after the middle of the night.",,,,,,,
23033,And there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together.,,,,,,,
23034,"And a certain young man named Eutychus, who was seated in the window, went into a deep sleep; and while Paul went on talking, being overcome by sleep, he had a fall from the third floor, and was taken up dead.",,,,,,,
23035,"And Paul went down and, falling on him, took him in his arms and said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.",,,,,,,
23036,"And when he had gone up, and had taken the broken bread, he went on talking to them for a long time, even till dawn, and then he went away.",,,,,,,
23037,"And they took the boy in, living, and were greatly comforted.",,,,,,,
23038,"But we, going before him by ship, went to Assos with the purpose of taking Paul in there: for so he had given orders, because he himself was coming by land.",,,,,,,
23039,"And when he came up with us at Assos, we took him in the ship and went on to Mitylene.",,,,,,,
23040,"And going from there by sea, we came on the day after opposite Chios, and touching at Samos on the day after that, we came on the third day to Miletus.",,,,,,,
23041,"For Paul's purpose was to go past Ephesus, so that he might not be kept in Asia; for he was going quickly, in order, if possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.",,,,,,,
23042,And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the rulers of the church.,,,,,,,
23043,"And when they had come, he said to them, You yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when I first came into Asia,",,,,,,,
23044,"Doing the Lord's work without pride, through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the Jews:",,,,,,,
23045,"And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you, teaching you publicly and privately,",,,,,,,
23046,"Preaching to Jews and to Greeks the need for a turning of the heart to God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
23047,"And now, as you see, I am going to Jerusalem, a prisoner in spirit, having no knowledge of what will come to me there:",,,,,,,
23048,Only that the Holy Spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me.,,,,,,,
23049,"But I put no value on my life, if only at the end of it I may see the work complete which was given to me by the Lord Jesus, to be a witness of the good news of the grace of God.",,,,,,,
23050,"And now I am conscious that you, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom, will not see my face again.",,,,,,,
23051,And so I say to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men.,,,,,,,
23052,For I have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of God.,,,,,,,
23053,"Give attention to yourselves, and to all the flock which the Holy Spirit has given into your care, to give food to the church of God, for which he gave his blood.",,,,,,,
23054,"I am conscious that after I am gone, evil wolves will come in among you, doing damage to the flock;",,,,,,,
23055,"And from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching, turning away the disciples after them.",,,,,,,
23056,"So keep watch, having in mind that for three years without resting I was teaching every one of you, day and night, with weeping.",,,,,,,
23057,"And now, I give you into the care of God and the word of his grace, which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints.",,,,,,,
23058,I have had no desire for any man's silver or gold or clothing.,,,,,,,
23059,You yourselves have seen that with these hands I got what was necessary for me and those who were with me.,,,,,,,
23060,"In all things I was an example to you of how, in your lives, you are to give help to the feeble, and keep in memory the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, There is a greater blessing in giving than in getting.",,,,,,,
23061,"And having said these words, he went down on his knees in prayer with them all.",,,,,,,
23062,"And they were all weeping, falling on Paul's neck and kissing him,",,,,,,,
23063,"Being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again. And so they went with him to the ship.And after parting from them, we put out to sea and came straight to Cos, and the day after to Rhodes, and from there to Patara:",,,,,,,
23064,"And as there was a ship going to Phoenicia, we went in it.",,,,,,,
23065,"And when we had come in view of Cyprus, going past it on our left, we went on to Syria, and came to land at Tyre: for there the goods which were in the ship had to be taken out.",,,,,,,
23066,And meeting the disciples we were there for seven days: and they gave Paul orders through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
23067,"And when these days came to an end, we went on our journey; and they all, with their wives and children, came with us on our way till we were out of the town: and after going on our knees in prayer by the sea,",,,,,,,
23068,"We said our last words to one another, and got into the ship, and they went back to their houses.",,,,,,,
23069,And journeying by ship from Tyre we came to Ptolemais; and there we had talk with the brothers and were with them for one day.,,,,,,,
23070,"And on the day after, we went away and came to Caesarea, where we were guests in the house of Philip, the preacher, who was one of the seven.",,,,,,,
23071,"And he had four daughters, virgins, who were prophets.",,,,,,,
23072,"And while we were waiting there for some days, a certain prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judaea.",,,,,,,
23073,"And he came to us, and took the band of Paul's clothing, and putting it round his feet and hands, said, The Holy Spirit says these words, So will the Jews do to the man who is the owner of this band, and they will give him up into the hands of the Gentil",s.,,,,,,
23074,"And hearing these things, we and those who were living in that place made request to him not to go to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
23075,"Then Paul said, What are you doing, weeping and wounding my heart? for I am ready, not only to be a prisoner, but to be put to death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.",,,,,,,
23076,"And as he might not be moved we did no more, saying, Let the purpose of God be done.",,,,,,,
23077,And after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
23078,"And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, taking a certain Mnason of Cyprus, one of the early disciples, in whose house we were to be living.",,,,,,,
23079,"And when we came to Jerusalem, the brothers were pleased to see us.",,,,,,,
23080,"And on the day after, Paul went with us to James, and all the rulers of the church were present.",,,,,,,
23081,"And when he had said how glad he was to see them, he gave them a detailed account of the things which God had done through his work among the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
23082,"And hearing it, they gave praise to God; and they said to him, You see, brother, what thousands there are among the Jews, who have the faith; and they all have a great respect for the law:",,,,,,,
23083,"And they have had news of you, how you have been teaching all the Jews among the Gentiles to give up the law of Moses, and not to give circumcision to their children, and not to keep the old rules.",,,,,,,
23084,What then is the position? They will certainly get news that you have come.,,,,,,,
23085,"Do this, then, which we say to you: We have four men who have taken an oath;",,,,,,,
23086,"Go with these, and make yourself clean with them, and make the necessary payments for them, so that they may be free from their oath: and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true, but that you put yourself under rule, and keep th",law.,,,,,,
23087,"But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil de",ires of the,ody,,,,,
23088,"Then Paul took the men, and on the day after, making himself clean with them, he went into the Temple, giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete, till the offering was made for every one of them.",,,,,,,
23089,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the Temple, got the people together and put their hands on him,",,,,,,,
23090,"Crying out, Men of Israel, come to our help: this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place: and in addition, he has taken Greeks into the Temple, and made this holy place unclean.",,,,,,,
23091,"For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple.",,,,,,,
23092,"And all the town was moved, and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul, pulling him out of the Temple: and then the doors were shut.",,,,,,,
23093,"And while they were attempting to put him to death, news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control.",,,,,,,
23094,"And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them: and the Jews, seeing them, gave no more blows to Paul.",,,,,,,
23095,"Then the chief captain came near and took him, and gave orders for him to be put in chains, questioning them as to who he was and what he had done.",,,,,,,
23096,"And some said one thing and some another, among the people: and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise, he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building.",,,,,,,
23097,"And when he came on to the steps, he was lifted up by the armed men, because of the force of the people;",,,,,,,
23098,"For a great mass of people came after them, crying out, Away with him!",,,,,,,
23099,"And when Paul was about to be taken into the building, he said to the chief captain, May I say something to you? And he said, Have you a knowledge of Greek?",,,,,,,
23100,"Are you by chance the Egyptian who, before this, got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land?",,,,,,,
23101,"But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is not an unimportant town: I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people.",,,,,,,
23102,"And when he let him do so, Paul, from the steps, made a sign with his hand to the people, and when they were all quiet, he said to them in the Hebrew language,My brothers and fathers, give ear to the story of my life which I now put before you.",,,,,,,
23103,"And, hearing him talking in the Hebrew language, they became the more quiet, and he said,",,,,,,,
23104,"I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia by birth, but I had my education in this town at the feet of Gamaliel, being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers; given up to the cause of God with all my heart, as you are today.",,,,,,,
23105,"And I made attacks on this Way, even to death, taking men and women and putting them in prison.",,,,,,,
23106,"Of which the high priest will be a witness, and all the rulers, from whom I had letters to the brothers; and I went into Damascus, to take those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.",,,,,,,
23107,"And it came about that while I was on my journey, coming near to Damascus, about the middle of the day, suddenly I saw a great light from heaven shining round me.",,,,,,,
23108,"And when I went down on the earth, a voice came to my ears saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly?",,,,,,,
23109,"And I, answering, said, Who are you; Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are attacking.",,,,,,,
23110,"And those who were with me saw the light, but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears.",,,,,,,
23111,"And I said, What have I to do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Get up, and go into Damascus; and it will be made clear to you what you have to do.",,,,,,,
23112,"And because I was unable to see because of the glory of that light, those who were with me took me by the hand, and so I came to Damascus.",,,,,,,
23113,"And one Ananias, a God-fearing man, who kept the law, and of whom all the Jews in that place had a high opinion,",,,,,,,
23114,"Came to my side and said, Brother Saul, let your eyes be open. And in that very hour I was able to see him.",,,,,,,
23115,"And he said, You have been marked out by the God of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose, and to see the Upright One and to give ear to the words of his mouth.",,,,,,,
23116,For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears.,,,,,,,
23117,"And now, why are you waiting? get up, and have baptism, for the washing away of your sins, giving worship to his name.",,,,,,,
23118,"And it came about that when I had come back to Jerusalem, while I was at prayer in the Temple, my senses became more than naturally clear,",,,,,,,
23119,"And I saw him saying to me, Go out of Jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me.",,,,,,,
23120,"And I said, Lord, they themselves have knowledge that I went through the Synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you:",,,,,,,
23121,"And when Stephen your witness wasputtodeath, Iwasthere, givingapproval, andlookingaftertheclothingofthosewho put him to death.",,,,,,,
23122,"And he said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
23123,"And they gave him a hearing as far as this word; then with loud voices they said, Away with this man from the earth; it is not right for him to be living.",,,,,,,
23124,"And while they were crying out, and pulling off their clothing, and sending dust into the air,",,,,,,,
23125,"The chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building, saying that he would put him to the test by whipping, so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him.",,,,,,,
23126,"And when they had put leather bands round him, Paul said to the captain who was present, Is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a Roman and has not been judged?",,,,,,,
23127,"And hearing this, the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.",,,,,,,
23128,"And the chief captain came to him and said, Give me an answer, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.",,,,,,,
23129,"And the chief captain said, I got Roman rights for myself at a great price. And Paul said, But I had them by birth.",,,,,,,
23130,"Then those who were about to put him to the test went away: and the chief captain was in fear, seeing that he was a Roman, and that he had put chains on him.",,,,,,,
23131,"But on the day after, desiring to have certain knowledge of what the Jews had to say against him, he made him free, and gave orders for the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and he took Paul and put him before them.And Paul, looking f",xedly at the,San,e,rin,sai,", M",brot
23132,"And the high priest, Ananias, gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth.",,,,,,,
23133,"Then Paul said to him, God will give blows to you, you whitewashed wall: are you here to be my judge by law, and by your orders am I given blows against the law?",,,,,,,
23134,"And those who were near said, Do you say such words against God's high priest?",,,,,,,
23135,"And Paul said, Brother, I had no idea that he was the high priest: for it has been said, You may not say evil about the ruler of your people.",,,,,,,
23136,"But when Paul saw that half of them were Sadducees and the rest Pharisees, he said in the Sanhedrin, Brothers, I am a Pharisee, and the son of Pharisees: I am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead.",,,,,,,
23137,"And when he had said this, there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and a division in the meeting.",,,,,,,
23138,"For the Sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead, and no angels or spirits: but the Pharisees have belief in all these.",,,,,,,
23139,"And there was a great outcry: and some of the scribes on the side of the Pharisees got up and took part in the discussion, saying, We see no evil in this man: what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit?",,,,,,,
23140,"And when the argument became very violent, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be pulled in two by them, gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them, and take him into the army building.",,,,,,,
23141,"And the night after, the Lord came to his side and said, Be of good heart, for as you have been witnessing for me in Jerusalem, so will you be my witness in Rome.",,,,,,,
23142,"And when it was day, the Jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put Paul to death.",,,,,,,
23143,And more than forty of them took this oath.,,,,,,,
23144,"And they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said, We have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put Paul to death",,,,,,,
23145,"So now, will you and the Sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you, as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail; and we, before ever he gets to you, will be waiting to put him to death.",,,,,,,
23146,"But Paul's sister's son had word of their design, and he came into the army building and gave news of it to Paul.",,,,,,,
23147,"And Paul sent for a captain and said, Take this young man to your chief, for he has news for him.",,,,,,,
23148,"So he took him to the chief captain and said, Paul, the prisoner, made a request to me to take this young man to you, for he has something to say to you.",,,,,,,
23149,"And the chief took him by the hand and, going on one side, said to him privately, What is it you have to say to me?",,,,,,,
23150,"And he said, The Jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for Paul to be taken, on the day after this, into the Sanhedrin, to be questioned in greater detail.",,,,,,,
23151,"But do not give way to them, for more than forty of them are waiting for him, having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death: and now they are ready, waiting for your order.",,,,,,,
23152,"So the chief captain let the young man go, saying to him, Do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things.",,,,,,,
23153,"And he sent for two captains and said, Make ready two hundred men, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to go to Caesarea, at the third hour of the night:",,,,,,,
23154,"And get beasts so that they may put Paul on them, and take him safely to Felix, the ruler.",,,,,,,
23155,And he sent a letter in these words:,,,,,,,
23156,"Claudius Lysias, to the most noble ruler, Felix, peace be with you.",,,,,,,
23157,"This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be put to death by them, when I came on them with the army and took him out of danger, having knowledge that he was a Roman.",,,,,,,
23158,"And, desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him, I took him down to their Sanhedrin:",,,,,,,
23159,"Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law, and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death.",,,,,,,
23160,"And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man, I sent him straight away to you, giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you.",,,,,,,
23161,"So the armed men, as they were ordered, took Paul and came by night to Antipatris.",,,,,,,
23162,"But on the day after, they sent the horsemen on with him, and went back to their place:",,,,,,,
23163,"And they, when they came to Caesarea, gave the letter to the ruler, and took Paul before him.",,,,,,,
23164,"And after reading it, he said, What part of the country do you come from? And, hearing that he was from Cilicia,",,,,,,,
23165,"I will give hearing to your cause, he said, when those who are against you have come. And he gave orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.And after five days, the high priest, Ananias, came with certain of the rulers, and an expert talker, one Te",tullus; and,hey,m,de,sta,eme,t to
23166,"And when he had been sent for, Tertullus, starting his statement, said, Because by you we are living in peace, and through your wisdom wrongs are put right for this nation,",,,,,,,
23167,"In all things and in all places we are conscious of our great debt to you, most noble Felix.",,,,,,,
23168,"But, so that I may not make you tired, I make a request to you of your mercy, to give hearing to a short statement.",,,,,,,
23169,"For this man, in our opinion, is a cause of trouble, a maker of attacks on the government among Jews through all the empire, and a chief mover in the society of the Nazarenes:",,,,,,,
23170,"Who, in addition, was attempting to make the Temple unclean: whom we took,",,,,,,,
23171,[],,,,,,,
23172,"And from whom you will be able, by questioning him yourself, to get knowledge of all the things which we say against him.",,,,,,,
23173,"And the Jews were in agreement with his statement, saying that these things were so.",,,,,,,
23174,"Then when the ruler had given him a sign to make his answer, Paul said, Because I have knowledge that you have been a judge over this nation for a number of years, I am glad to make my answer:",,,,,,,
23175,Seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when I came up to Jerusalem for worship;,,,,,,,
23176,"And they have not seen me in argument with any man in the Temple, or working up the feelings of the people, in the Synagogues or in the town:",,,,,,,
23177,And they are not able to give facts in support of the things which they say against me now.,,,,,,,
23178,"But this I will say openly to you, that I do give worship to the God of our fathers after that Way, which to them is not the true religion: but I have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets:",,,,,,,
23179,"Hoping in God for that which they themselves are looking for, that there will be a coming back from the dead for upright men and wrongdoers.",,,,,,,
23180,"And in this, I do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before God or men.",,,,,,,
23181,Now after a number of years I came to give help and offerings to my nation:,,,,,,,
23182,"And having been made clean, I was in the Temple, but not with a great number of people, and not with noise: but there were certain Jews from Asia,",,,,,,,
23183,"And it would have been better if they had come here to make a statement, if they have anything against me.",,,,,,,
23184,"Or let these men here present say what wrongdoing was seen in me when I was before the Sanhedrin,",,,,,,,
23185,"But only this one thing which I said among them in a loud voice, I am this day being judged on the question of the coming back from the dead.",,,,,,,
23186,"But Felix, who had a more detailed knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, When Lysias, the chief captain, comes down, I will give attention to your business.",,,,,,,
23187,"And he gave orders to the captain to keep Paul under his control, and to let him have everything he had need of; and not to keep his friends from coming to see him.",,,,,,,
23188,"But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was of the Jews by birth, and sent for Paul, and gave hearing to him about faith in Christ Jesus.",,,,,,,
23189,"And while he was talking about righteousness and self-control and the judging which was to come, Felix had great fear and said, Go away for the present, and when the right time comes I will send for you.",,,,,,,
23190,For he was hoping that Paul would give him money: so he sent for him more frequently and had talk with him.,,,,,,,
23191,"But after two years Porcius Festus took the place of Felix, who, desiring to have the approval of the Jews, kept Paul in chains.So Festus, having come into that part of the country which was under his rule, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caes",rea.,,,,,,
23192,"And the chief priests and the chief men of the Jews made statements against Paul,",,,,,,,
23193,"Requesting Festus to give effect to their design against him, and send him to Jerusalem, when they would be waiting to put him to death on the way.",,,,,,,
23194,"But Festus, in answer, said that Paul was being kept in prison at Caesarea, and that in a short time he himself was going there.",,,,,,,
23195,"So, he said, let those who have authority among you go with me, and if there is any wrong in the man, let them make a statement against him.",,,,,,,
23196,"And when he had been with them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the day after, he took his place on the judge's seat, and sent for Paul.",,,,,,,
23197,"And when he came, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem came round him, and made all sorts of serious statements against him, which were not supported by the facts.",,,,,,,
23198,"Then Paul, in his answer to them, said, I have done no wrong against the law of the Jews, or against the Temple, or against Caesar.",,,,,,,
23199,"But Festus, desiring to get the approval of the Jews, said to Paul, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and be judged before me there in connection with these things?",,,,,,,
23200,"And Paul said, I am before the seat of Caesar's authority where it is right for me to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you are well able to see.",,,,,,,
23201,"If, then, I am a wrongdoer and there is a cause of death in me, I am ready for death: if it is not as they say against me, no man may give me up to them. Let my cause come before Caesar.",,,,,,,
23202,"Then Festus, having had a discussion with the Jews, made answer, You have said, Let my cause come before Caesar; to Caesar you will go.",,,,,,,
23203,"Now when some days had gone by, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea and went to see Festus.",,,,,,,
23204,"And as they were there for some days, Festus gave them Paul's story, saying, There is a certain man here who was put in prison by Felix:",,,,,,,
23205,"Against whom the chief priests and the rulers of the Jews made a statement when I was at Jerusalem, requesting me to give a decision against him.",,,,,,,
23206,"To whom I gave answer that it is not the Roman way to give a man up, till he has been face to face with those who are attacking him, and has had a chance to give an answer to the statements made against him.",,,,,,,
23207,"So, when they had come together here, straight away, on the day after, I took my place on the judge's seat and sent for the man.",,,,,,,
23208,But when they got up they said nothing about such crimes as I had in mind:,,,,,,,
23209,"But had certain questions against him in connection with their religion, and about one Jesus, now dead, who, Paul said, was living.",,,,,,,
23210,"And as I had not enough knowledge for the discussion of these things, I made the suggestion to him to go to Jerusalem and be judged there.",,,,,,,
23211,"But when Paul made a request that he might be judged by Caesar, I gave orders for him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.",,,,,,,
23212,"And Agrippa said to Festus, I have a desire to give the man a hearing myself. Tomorrow, he said, you may give him a hearing.",,,,,,,
23213,"So on the day after, when Agrippa and Bernice in great glory had come into the public place of hearing, with the chief of the army and the chief men of the town, at the order of Festus, Paul was sent for.",,,,,,,
23214,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those who are present here with us, you see this man, about whom all the Jews have made protests to me, at Jerusalem and in this place, saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer.",,,,,,,
23215,"But, in my opinion, there is no cause of death in him, and as he himself has made a request to be judged by Caesar, I have said that I would send him.",,,,,,,
23216,"But I have no certain account of him to send to Caesar. So I have sent for him to come before you, and specially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the business has been gone into, I may have something to put in writing.",,,,,,,
23217,"For it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him.And Agrippa said to Paul, You may put your cause before us. Then Paul, stretching out his hand, made his answer, saying:",,,,,,,
23218,"In my opinion I am happy, King Agrippa, to be able to give my answer before you today to all these things which the Jews say against me:",,,,,,,
23219,"The more so, because you are expert in all questions to do with the Jews and their ways: so I make my request to you to give me a hearing to the end.",,,,,,,
23220,"All the Jews have knowledge of my way of life from my early years, as it was from the start among my nation, and at Jerusalem;",,,,,,,
23221,"And they are able to say, if they would give witness, that I was living as a Pharisee, in that division of our religion which is most regular in the keeping of the law.",,,,,,,
23222,And now I am here to be judged because of the hope given by God's word to our fathers;,,,,,,,
23223,"For the effecting of which our twelve tribes have been working and waiting night and day with all their hearts. And in connection with this hope I am attacked by the Jews, O king!",,,,,,,
23224,"Why, in your opinion, is it outside belief for God to make the dead come to life again?",,,,,,,
23225,"For I, truly, was of the opinion that it was right for me to do a number of things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",,,,,,,
23226,"And this I did in Jerusalem: and numbers of the saints I put in prison, having had authority given to me from the chief priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my decision against them.",,,,,,,
23227,"And I gave them punishment frequently, in all the Synagogues, forcing them to say things against God; and burning with passion against them, I went after them even into far-away towns.",,,,,,,
23228,"Then, when I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests,",,,,,,,
23229,"In the middle of the day, on the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining round me and those who were journeying with me.",,,,,,,
23230,"And when we had all gone down on the earth, a voice came to me, saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly? It is hard for you to go against the impulse which is driving you.",,,,,,,
23231,"And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are attacking.",,,,,,,
23232,"But get up on your feet: for I have come to you for this purpose, to make you a servant and a witness of the things in which you have seen me, and of those in which you will see me;",,,,,,,
23233,"And I will keep you safe from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,",,,,,,,
23234,"To make their eyes open, turning them from the dark to the light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may have forgiveness of sins and a heritage among those who are made holy by faith in me.",,,,,,,
23235,"So, then, King Agrippa, I did not go against the vision from heaven;",,,,,,,
23236,"But I went about, first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, preaching a change of heart, so that they, being turned to God, might give, in their works, the fruits of a changed heart.",,,,,,,
23237,"For this reason, the Jews took me in the Temple, and made an attempt to put me to death.",,,,,,,
23238,"And so, by God's help, I am here today, witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come about;",,,,,,,
23239,"That the Christ would go through pain, and being the first to come back from the dead, would give light to the people and to the Gentiles.",,,,,,,
23240,"And when he made his answer in these words, Festus said in a loud voice, Paul, you are off your head; your great learning has made you unbalanced.",,,,,,,
23241,"Then Paul said, I am not off my head, most noble Festus, but my words are true and wise.",,,,,,,
23242,"For the king has knowledge of these things, to whom I am talking freely; being certain that all this is common knowledge to him; for it has not been done in secret.",,,,,,,
23243,"King Agrippa, have you faith in the prophets? I am certain that you have.",,,,,,,
23244,"And Agrippa said to Paul, A little more and you will be making me a Christian.",,,,,,,
23245,"And Paul said, It is my prayer to God that, in little or great measure, not only you, but all those hearing me today might be even as I am, but for these chains.",,,,,,,
23246,And the king and the ruler and Bernice and those who were seated with them got up;,,,,,,,
23247,"And when they had gone away they said to one another, This man has done nothing which might give cause for death or prison.",,,,,,,
23248,"And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been made free, if he had not put his cause before Caesar.And when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to Italy, they gave Paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named","ulius, of th",Au,u,tan,band,,
23249,"And we went to sea in a ship of Adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.",,,,,,,
23250,"And on the day after, we came to Sidon; and Julius was kind to Paul, and let him go to see his friends and take a rest.",,,,,,,
23251,"And sailing again from there, we went on under cover of Cyprus, because the wind was against us.",,,,,,,
23252,"And having gone across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra, in Lycia.",,,,,,,
23253,"And there the captain came across a ship of Alexandria, sailing for Italy, and put us in it.",,,,,,,
23254,"And when we had gone on slowly for a long time, and had had hard work getting across to Cnidus, for the wind was against us, we went under cover of Crete, in the direction of Salmone;",,,,,,,
23255,"And sailing down the side of it, as well as we were able, we came to a certain place named Fair Havens, near which was the town of Lasea.",,,,,,,
23256,"And as a long time had gone by, and the journey was now full of danger, because it was late in the year, Paul put the position before them,",,,,,,,
23257,"Saying, Friends, I see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss, not only to the goods and the ship, but to ourselves.",,,,,,,
23258,But the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.,,,,,,,
23259,"And as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter, the greater number of them were for going out to sea, in order, if possible, to put in for the winter at Phoenix, a harbour of Crete, looking to the north-east and south-east.",,,,,,,
23260,"And when the south wind came softly, being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected, they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of Crete, very near to the land.",,,,,,,
23261,"But after a little time, a very violent wind, named Euraquilo, came down from it with great force.",,,,,,,
23262,"And when the ship got into the grip of it, and was not able to make headway into the wind, we gave way, and went before it.",,,,,,,
23263,"And, sailing near the side of a small island named Cauda, we were able, though it was hard work, to make the ship's boat safe:",,,,,,,
23264,"And having got it up, they put cords under and round the ship; but fearing that they might be pushed on to the Syrtis, they let down the sails and so went running before the wind.",,,,,,,
23265,"And, still fighting the storm with all our strength, the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship;",,,,,,,
23266,"And on the third day, they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side.",,,,,,,
23267,"And as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time, and a great storm was on us, all hope of salvation was gone.",,,,,,,
23268,"And when they had been without food for a long time, Paul got up among them and said, Friends, it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from Crete, to undergo this damage and loss.",,,,,,,
23269,"But now, I say to you, be of good heart, for there will be no loss of life, but only of the ship.",,,,,,,
23270,"For this night there came to my side an angel of the God who is my Master and whose servant I am,",,,,,,,
23271,"Saying, Have no fear, Paul, for you will come before Caesar, and God has given to you all those who are sailing with you.",,,,,,,
23272,"And so, O men, be of good heart, for I have faith in God that it will be as he said to me.",,,,,,,
23273,But we will be sent on to a certain island.,,,,,,,
23274,"But when the fourteenth day came, while we were going here and there in the Adriatic sea, about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land;",,,,,,,
23275,"And they let down the lead, and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep; and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet.",,,,,,,
23276,"Then, fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks, they let down four hooks from the back of the ship, and made prayers for the coming of day.",,,,,,,
23277,"Then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship, letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship;",,,,,,,
23278,"But Paul said to the captain and his men, If you do not keep these men in the ship, you will not be safe.",,,,,,,
23279,"Then the armed men, cutting the cords of the boat, let her go.",,,,,,,
23280,"And when dawn was near, Paul gave them all orders to take food, saying, This is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food.",,,,,,,
23281,So I make request to you to take food; for this is for your salvation: not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction.,,,,,,,
23282,"And when he had said this and had taken bread, he gave praise to God before them all, and took a meal of the broken bread.",,,,,,,
23283,Then they all took heart and did the same.,,,,,,,
23284,"And we were, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six persons.",,,,,,,
23285,"And when they had had enough food, they made the weight of the ship less, turning the grain out into the sea.",,,,,,,
23286,"And when it was day, they had no knowledge of the land, but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand, and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible.",,,,,,,
23287,"So cutting away the hooks, and letting them go into the sea, and freeing the cords of the guiding-blades, and lifting up the sail to the wind, they went in the direction of the inlet.",,,,,,,
23288,"And coming to a point between two seas, they got the ship to land; and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved, but the back part was broken by the force of the waves.",,,,,,,
23289,"Then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death, so that no one would get away by swimming.",,,,,,,
23290,"But the captain, desiring to keep Paul safe, kept them from their purpose, and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land:",,,,,,,
23291,"And the rest, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so it came about that they all got safe to land.And when we were safe, we made the discovery that the island was named Melita.",,,,,,,
23292,"And the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us, for they made a fire for us, and took us in, because it was raining and cold.",,,,,,,
23293,"But when Paul had got some sticks together and put them on the fire, a snake came out, because of the heat, and gave him a bite on the hand.",,,,,,,
23294,"And when the people saw it hanging on his hand, they said to one another, Without doubt this man has put someone to death, and though he has got safely away from the sea, God will not let him go on living.",,,,,,,
23295,"But shaking off the beast into the fire, he got no damage.",,,,,,,
23296,"But they had the idea that they would see him becoming ill, or suddenly falling down dead; but after waiting a long time, and seeing that no damage came to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god.",,,,,,,
23297,"Now near that place there was some land, the property of the chief man of the island, who was named Publius; who very kindly took us into his house as his guests for three days.",,,,,,,
23298,"And the father of Publius was ill, with a disease of the stomach; to whom Paul went, and put his hands on him, with prayer, and made him well.",,,,,,,
23299,"And when this took place, all the others in the island who had diseases came and were made well.",,,,,,,
23300,"Then they gave us great honour, and, when we went away, they put into the ship whatever things we were in need of.",,,,,,,
23301,"And after three months we went to sea in a ship of Alexandria sailing under the sign of the Dioscuri, which had been at the island for the winter.",,,,,,,
23302,"And going into the harbour at Syracuse, we were waiting there for three days.",,,,,,,
23303,"And from there, going about in a curve, we came to Rhegium: and after one day a south wind came up and on the day after we came to Puteoli:",,,,,,,
23304,"Where we came across some of the brothers, who kept us with them for seven days; and so we came to Rome.",,,,,,,
23305,"And the brothers, when they had news of us, came out from town as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us: and Paul, seeing them, gave praise to God and took heart.",,,,,,,
23306,"And when we came into Rome, they let Paul have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him.",,,,,,,
23307,"Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews: and when they had come together, he said to them, My brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers, I was given, a prisoner from Jerusalem, into the hands of",the Romans.,,,,,,
23308,"Who, when they had put questions to me, were ready to let me go free, because there was no cause of death in me.",,,,,,,
23309,"But when the Jews made protest against it, I had to put my cause into Caesar's hands; not because I have anything to say against my nation.",,,,,,,
23310,"But for this reason I sent for you, to see and have talk with you: for because of the hope of Israel I am in these chains.",,,,,,,
23311,"And they said to him, We have not had letters from Judaea about you, and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you.",,,,,,,
23312,"But we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion: for as to this form of religion, we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked.",,,,,,,
23313,"And when a day had been fixed, they came to his house in great numbers; and he gave them teaching, giving witness to the kingdom of God, and having discussions with them about Jesus, from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.",,,,,,,
23314,"And some were in agreement with what he said, but some had doubts.",,,,,,,
23315,"And they went away, for there was a division among them after Paul had said this one thing: Well did the Holy Spirit say by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,",,,,,,,
23316,"Go to this people and say, Though you give ear, you will not get knowledge; and seeing, you will see, but the sense will not be clear to you:",,,,,,,
23317,"For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut; for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me, so that I mig",t make them,ell,,,,,
23318,"Be certain, then, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will give hearing.",,,,,,,
23319,[],,,,,,,
23320,"And for the space of two years, Paul was living in the house of which he had the use, and had talk with all those who went in to see him,",,,,,,,
23321,"Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ without fear, and no orders were given that he was not to do so.Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, an Apostle by the selection of God, given authority as a preacher of the good news,",,,,,,,
23322,"Of which God had given word before by his prophets in the holy Writings,",,,,,,,
23323,"About his Son who, in the flesh, came from the family of David,",,,,,,,
23324,"But was marked out as Son of God in power by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead; Jesus Christ our Lord,",,,,,,,
23325,"Through whom grace has been given to us, sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations, for his name:",,,,,,,
23326,Among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ:,,,,,,,
23327,"To all those who are in Rome, loved by God, marked out as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
23328,"First of all, I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because news of your faith has gone into all the world.",,,,,,,
23329,"For God is my witness, whose servant I am in spirit in the good news of his Son, that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers,",,,,,,,
23330,And that I am ever making prayers that God will give me a good journey to you.,,,,,,,
23331,"For I have a strong desire to see you, and to give you some grace of the spirit, so that you may be made strong;",,,,,,,
23332,"That is to say, that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me.",,,,,,,
23333,"You may be certain, my brothers, that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you (but till now I was kept from it), so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I have had it from the other nations.",,,,,,,
23334,I have a debt to Greeks and to the nations outside; to the wise and to those who have no learning.,,,,,,,
23335,"For which reason I have the desire, as far as I am able, to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in Rome.",,,,,,,
23336,"For I have no feeling of shame about the good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first, and then to the Greek.",,,,,,,
23337,"For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is said in the holy Writings, The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith.",,,,,,,
23338,For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing;,,,,,,,
23339,"Because the knowledge of God may be seen in them, God having made it clear to them.",,,,,,,
23340,"For from the first making of the world, those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, his eternal power and existence, are fully made clear, he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made, so that men have no re",son for wron,doi,g,,,,
23341,"Because, having the knowledge of God, they did not give glory to God as God, and did not give praise, but their minds were full of foolish things, and their hearts, being without sense, were made dark.",,,,,,,
23342,"Seeming to be wise, they were in fact foolish,",,,,,,,
23343,"And by them the glory of the eternal God was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal, and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth.",,,,,,,
23344,"For this reason God gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts, working shame in their bodies with one another:",,,,,,,
23345,"Because by them the true word of God was changed into that which is false, and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made, and not to him who made it, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it.",,,,,,,
23346,"For this reason God gave them up to evil passions, and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural:",,,,,,,
23347,"And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another, men doing shame with men, and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil-doing.",,,,,,,
23348,"And because they had not the mind to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an evil mind, to do those things which are not right;",,,,,,,
23349,"Being full of all wrongdoing, evil, desire for the goods of others, hate, envy, putting to death, fighting, deceit, cruel ways, evil talk, and false statements about others;",,,,,,,
23350,"Hated by God, full of pride, without respect, full of loud talk, given to evil inventions, not honouring father or mother,",,,,,,,
23351,"Without knowledge, not true to their undertakings, unkind, having no mercy:",,,,,,,
23352,"Who, though they have knowledge of the law of God, that the fate of those who do these things is death, not only go on doing these things themselves, but give approval to those who do them.So you have no reason, whoever you are, for judging: for in judgi",g another yo,ar,,udg,ng y,urs,"lf, f"
23353,And we are conscious that God is a true judge against those who do such things.,,,,,,,
23354,"But you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself, are you hoping that God's decision will not take effect against you?",,,,,,,
23355,"Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you, waiting and putting up with you for so long, not seeing that in his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart?",,,,,,,
23356,But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness;,,,,,,,
23357,Who will give to every man his right reward:,,,,,,,
23358,"To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal life:",,,,,,,
23359,"But to those who, from a love of competition, are not guided by what is true, will come the heat of his wrath,",,,,,,,
23360,"Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil, to the Jew first and then to the Greek;",,,,,,,
23361,"But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good, to the Jew first and then to the Greek:",,,,,,,
23362,For one man is not different from another before God.,,,,,,,
23363,All those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law: and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law;,,,,,,,
23364,"For it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before God, but only the doers:",,,,,,,
23365,"For when the Gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law, they are a law to themselves;",,,,,,,
23366,"Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts, their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it, while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval;",,,,,,,
23367,"In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men, as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher, through Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
23368,"But as for you who have the name of Jew, and are resting on the law, and take pride in God,",,,,,,,
23369,"And have knowledge of his desires, and are a judge of the things which are different, having the learning of the law,",,,,,,,
23370,"In the belief that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in the dark,",,,,,,,
23371,"A teacher of the foolish, having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true;",,,,,,,
23372,"You who give teaching to others, do you give it to yourself? you who say that a man may not take what is not his, do you take what is not yours?",,,,,,,
23373,"You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God?",,,,,,,
23374,"You who take pride in the law, are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law?",,,,,,,
23375,"For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings.",,,,,,,
23376,"It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law, but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not.",,,,,,,
23377,"If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law, will it not be credited to them as circumcision?",,,,,,,
23378,"And they, by their keeping of the law without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision.",,,,,,,
23379,"The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly, and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh:",,,,,,,
23380,"But he is a Jew who is a secret one, whose circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.How then is the Jew better off? or what profit is there in circumcision?",,,,,,,
23381,Much in every way: first of all because the words of God were given to them.,,,,,,,
23382,"And if some have no faith, will that make the faith of God without effect?",,,,,,,
23383,"In no way: but let God be true, though every man is seen to be untrue; as it is said in the Writings, That your words may be seen to be true, and you may be seen to be right when you are judged.",,,,,,,
23384,But if the righteousness of God is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said? is it wrong for God to be angry (as men may say)?,,,,,,,
23385,"In no way: because if it is so, how is God able to be the judge of all the world?",,,,,,,
23386,"But if, because I am untrue, God being seen to be true gets more glory, why am I to be judged as a sinner?",,,,,,,
23387,"Let us not do evil so that good may come (a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made), because such behaviour will have its right punishment.",,,,,,,
23388,What then? are we worse off than they? In no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin;,,,,,,,
23389,"As it is said in the holy Writings, There is not one who does righteousness;",,,,,,,
23390,"Not one who has the knowledge of what is right, not one who is a searcher after God;",,,,,,,
23391,"They have all gone out of the way, there is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much as one:",,,,,,,
23392,Their throat is like an open place of death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of snakes is under their lips:,,,,,,,
23393,Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words:,,,,,,,
23394,Their feet are quick in running after blood;,,,,,,,
23395,Destruction and trouble are in their ways;,,,,,,,
23396,And of the way of peace they have no knowledge:,,,,,,,
23397,There is no fear of God before their eyes.,,,,,,,
23398,"Now, we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all men may be judged by God:",,,,,,,
23399,"Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.",,,,,,,
23400,"But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the law and the prophets;",,,,,,,
23401,"That is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all those who have faith; and one man is not different from another,",,,,,,,
23402,For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God;,,,,,,,
23403,"And they may have righteousness put to their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus:",,,,,,,
23404,"Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment;",,,,,,,
23405,"And to make clear his righteousness now, so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus.",,,,,,,
23406,"What reason, then, is there for pride? It is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith.",,,,,,,
23407,"For this reason, then, a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law.",,,,,,,
23408,"Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles:",,,,,,,
23409,"If God is one; and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision, and through faith to those who have not circumcision.",,,,,,,
23410,"Do we, then, through faith make the law of no effect? in no way: but we make it clear that the law is important.What, then, may we say that Abraham, our father after the flesh, has got?",,,,,,,
23411,"For if Abraham got righteousness by works, he has reason for pride; but not before God.",,,,,,,
23412,"But what does it say in the holy Writings? And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.",,,,,,,
23413,"Now, the reward is credited to him who does works, not as of grace but as a debt.",,,,,,,
23414,"But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his account as righteousness.",,,,,,,
23415,"As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying,",,,,,,,
23416,"Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing, and whose sins are covered.",,,,,,,
23417,Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord.,,,,,,,
23418,"Is this blessing, then, for the circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness.",,,,,,,
23419,"How, then, was it judged? when he had circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did not have it:",,,,,,,
23420,"And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to th",ir account;,,,,,,
23421,"And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision.",,,,,,,
23422,"For God's word, that the earth would be his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.",,,,,,,
23423,"For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word of God has no power;",,,,,,,
23424,For the outcome of the law is wrath; but where there is no law it will not be broken.,,,,,,,
23425,"For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,",,,,,,,
23426,"(As it is said in the holy Writings, I have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things which are not are as if they were.",,,,,,,
23427,"Who without reason for hope, in faith went on hoping, so that he became the father of a number of nations, as it had been said, So will your seed be.",,,,,,,
23428,And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children:,,,,,,,
23429,"Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God,",,,,,,,
23430,And being certain that God was able to keep his word.,,,,,,,
23431,For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness.,,,,,,,
23432,"Now, it was not because of him only that this was said,",,,,,,,
23433,"But for us in addition, to whose account it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead,",,,,,,,
23434,"Who was put to death for our evil-doing, and came to life again so that we might have righteousness.For which reason, because we have righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;",,,,,,,
23435,"Through whom, in the same way, we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God.",,,,,,,
23436,"And not only so, but let us have joy in our troubles: in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting;",,,,,,,
23437,"And waiting gives experience; and experience, hope:",,,,,,,
23438,And hope does not put to shame; because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us.,,,,,,,
23439,"For when we were still without strength, at the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers.",,,,,,,
23440,"Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man, though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life.",,,,,,,
23441,"But God has made clear his love to us, in that, when we were still sinners, Christ gave his life for us.",,,,,,,
23442,"Much more, if we now have righteousness by his blood, will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him.",,,,,,,
23443,"For if, when we were haters of God, the death of his Son made us at peace with him, much more, now that we are his friends, will we have salvation through his life;",,,,,,,
23444,"And not only so, but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with God.",,,,,,,
23445,"For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil:",,,,,,,
23446,"Because, till the law came, sin was in existence, but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken.",,,,,,,
23447,"But still death had power from Adam till Moses, even over those who had not done wrong like Adam, who is a picture of him who was to come.",,,,,,,
23448,"But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man. For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men.",,,,,,,
23449,"And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for theeffectofoneman'ssinwaspunishmentbythedecisionofGod, butthefreegivinghad power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number.",,,,,,,
23450,"For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
23451,"So then, as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men.",,,,,,,
23452,"Because, as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man.",,,,,,,
23453,"And the law came in addition, to make wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more grace:",,,,,,,
23454,"That, as sin had power in death, so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.What may we say, then? are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace?",,,,,,,
23455,"In no way. How may we, who are dead to sin, be living in it any longer?",,,,,,,
23456,"Or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into Christ Jesus, had baptism into his death?",,,,,,,
23457,"We have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death: so that as Christ came again from the dead by the glory of the Father, we, in the same way, might be living in new life.",,,,,,,
23458,"For, if we have been made like him in his death, we will, in the same way, be like him in his coming to life again;",,,,,,,
23459,"Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away, and we might no longer be servants to sin.",,,,,,,
23460,Because he who is dead is free from sin.,,,,,,,
23461,"But if we are dead with Christ, we have faith that we will be living with him;",,,,,,,
23462,"Having knowledge that because Christ has come back from the dead, he will never again go down to the dead; death has no more power over him.",,,,,,,
23463,"For his death was a death to sin, but his life now is a life which he is living to God.",,,,,,,
23464,"Even so see yourselves as dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.",,,,,,,
23465,"For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death, so that you give way to its desires;",,,,,,,
23466,"And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God.",,,,,,,
23467,"For sin may not have rule over you: because you are not under law, but under grace.",,,,,,,
23468,What then? are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace? Let it not be so.,,,,,,,
23469,"Are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire? if to sin, the end being death, or if to do the desire of God, the end being righteousness.",,,,,,,
23470,"But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin, you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed;",,,,,,,
23471,And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness.,,,,,,,
23472,"I am using words in the way of men, because your flesh is feeble: as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean, and to evil to do evil, so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy.",,,,,,,
23473,When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness.,,,,,,,
23474,What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you? for the end of such things is death.,,,,,,,
23475,"But now, being free from sin, and having been made servants to God, you have your fruit in that which is holy, and the end is eternal life.",,,,,,,
23476,"For the reward of sin is death; but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.Is it not clear, my brothers (I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law), that the law has power over a man as long as he is living?",,,,,,,
23477,"For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living; but if her husband is dead, she is free from the law of the husband.",,,,,,,
23478,"So if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband: but if the husband is dead, she is free from the law, so that she is not untrue, even if she takes another man.",,,,,,,
23479,"In the same way, my brothers, you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, even to him who came again from the dead, so that we might give fruit to God.",,,,,,,
23480,"For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death.",,,,,,,
23481,"But now we are free from the law, having been made dead to that which had power over us; so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the letter.",,,,,,,
23482,"What then is to be said? is the law sin? in no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another's.",,,,,,,
23483,"But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead.",,,,,,,
23484,"And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death;",,,,,,,
23485,And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death:,,,,,,,
23486,"For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law.",,,,,,,
23487,"But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good.",,,,,,,
23488,"Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil.",,,,,,,
23489,"For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin.",,,,,,,
23490,"And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do.",,,,,,,
23491,"But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good.",,,,,,,
23492,"So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.",,,,,,,
23493,"For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right.",,,,,,,
23494,"For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do.",,,,,,,
23495,"But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.",,,,,,,
23496,"So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me.",,,,,,,
23497,"In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God,",,,,,,,
23498,"But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh.",,,,,,,
23499,How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death?,,,,,,,
23500,"I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin.For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners.",,,,,,,
23501,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.,,,,,,,
23502,"For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh:",,,,,,,
23503,"So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the way of the Spirit.",,,,,,,
23504,"For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh, but those who go in the way of the Spirit, to the things of the Spirit.",,,,,,,
23505,"For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:",,,,,,,
23506,"Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be:",,,,,,,
23507,So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God.,,,,,,,
23508,"You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his.",,,,,,,
23509,"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.",,,,,,,
23510,"But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death.",,,,,,,
23511,"So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh:",,,,,,,
23512,"For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life.",,,,,,,
23513,And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.,,,,,,,
23514,"For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to you, by which we say, Abba, Father.",,,,,,,
23515,The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God:,,,,,,,
23516,"And if we are children, we have a right to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way have a part in his glory.",,,,,,,
23517,I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future.,,,,,,,
23518,For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.,,,,,,,
23519,"For every living thing was put under the power of change, not by its desire, but by him who made it so, in hope",,,,,,,
23520,That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory.,,,,,,,
23521,For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now.,,,,,,,
23522,"And not only so, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we have sorrow in our minds, waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons, that is, the salvation of our bodies.",,,,,,,
23523,For our salvation is by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees?,,,,,,,
23524,"But if we have hope for that which we see not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it.",,,,,,,
23525,And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say;,,,,,,,
23526,"And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God.",,,,,,,
23527,"And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose.",,,,,,,
23528,"Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers:",,,,,,,
23529,"And those who were marked out by him were named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory.",,,,,,,
23530,"What may we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?",,,,,,,
23531,"He who did not keep back his only Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things?",,,,,,,
23532,Who will say anything against the saints of God? It is God who makes us clear from evil;,,,,,,,
23533,"Who will give a decision against us? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part.",,,,,,,
23534,"Who will come between us and the love of Christ? Will trouble, or pain, or cruel acts, or the need of food or of clothing, or danger, or the sword?",,,,,,,
23535,"As it is said in the holy Writings, Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready for destruction.",,,,,,,
23536,But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love.,,,,,,,
23537,"For I am certain that not death, or life, or angels, or rulers, or things present, or things to come, or powers,",,,,,,,
23538,"Or things on high, or things under the earth, or anything which is made, will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.I say what is true in Christ, and not what is false, my mind giving witness with me in the Holy","Spirit,",,,,,,
23539,That I am full of sorrow and pain without end.,,,,,,,
23540,"For I have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers, my family in the flesh:",,,,,,,
23541,"Who are Israelites: who have the place of sons, and the glory, and the agreements with God, and the giving of the law, and the worship, and the hope offered by God:",,,,,,,
23542,"Whose are the fathers, and of whom came Christ in the flesh, who is over all, God, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it.",,,,,,,
23543,"But it is not as if the word of God was without effect. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel:",,,,,,,
23544,"And they are not all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, In Isaac will your seed be named.",,,,,,,
23545,"That is, it is not the children of the flesh, but the children of God's undertaking, who are named as the seed.",,,,,,,
23546,"For this is the word of God's undertaking, At this time will I come, and Sarah will have a son.",,,,,,,
23547,"And not only so, but Rebecca being about to have a child by our father Isaac —",,,,,,,
23548,"Before the children had come into existence, or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose and his selection might be effected, not by works, but by him whose purpose it is,",,,,,,,
23549,"It was said to her, The older will be the servant of the younger.",,,,,,,
23550,"Even as it is said, I had love for Jacob, but for Esau I had hate.",,,,,,,
23551,What may we say then? is God not upright? let it not be said.,,,,,,,
23552,"For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and pity on whom I will have pity.",,,,,,,
23553,"So then, it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man, but by the mercy of God.",,,,,,,
23554,"For the holy Writings say to Pharaoh, For this same purpose did I put you on high, so that I might make my power seen in you, and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth.",,,,,,,
23555,"So then, at his pleasure he has mercy on a man, and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard.",,,,,,,
23556,"But you will say to me, Why does he still make us responsible? who is able to go against his purpose?",,,,,,,
23557,"But, O man, who are you, to make answer against God? May the thing which is made say to him who made it, Why did you make me so?",,,,,,,
23558,"Or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour, and out of another a vessel for shame?",,,,,,,
23559,"What if God, desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen, for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction:",,,,,,,
23560,"And to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy, which he had before made ready for glory,",,,,,,,
23561,"Even us, who were marked out by him, not only from the Jews, but from the Gentiles?",,,,,,,
23562,"As he says in Hosea, They will be named my people who were not my people, and she will be loved who was not loved.",,,,,,,
23563,"And in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there they will be named the sons of the living God.",,,,,,,
23564,"And Isaiah says about Israel, Even if the number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a small part will get salvation:",,,,,,,
23565,"For the Lord will give effect to his word on the earth, putting an end to it and cutting it short.",,,,,,,
23566,"And, as Isaiah had said before, If the Lord of armies had not given us a seed, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.",,,,,,,
23567,"What then may we say? That the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:",,,,,,,
23568,"But Israel, going after a law of righteousness, did not get it.",,,,,,,
23569,"Why? Because they were not searching for it by faith, but by works. They came up against the stone which was in the way;",,,,,,,
23570,"As it is said, See, I am putting in Zion a stone causing a fall, and a rock in the way: but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame.Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is, that they may get salvation.",,,,,,,
23571,"For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God, but not with knowledge.",,,,,,,
23572,"Because, not having knowledge of God's righteousness, and desiring to give effect to their righteousness, they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God.",,,,,,,
23573,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith.,,,,,,,
23574,For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it.,,,,,,,
23575,"But the righteousness which is of faith says these words, Say not in your heart, Who will go up to heaven? (that is, to make Christ come down:)",,,,,,,
23576,"Or, Who will go down into the deep? (that is, to make Christ come again from the dead:)",,,,,,,
23577,"But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of faith of which we are the preachers:",,,,,,,
23578,"Because, if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead, you will have salvation:",,,,,,,
23579,"For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation.",,,,,,,
23580,"Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed.",,,,,,,
23581,"And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name:",,,,,,,
23582,"Because, Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation.",,,,,,,
23583,But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith? and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news? and how will they have news without a preacher?,,,,,,,
23584,"And how will there be preachers if they are not sent? As it is said, How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things.",,,,,,,
23585,"But they have not all given ear to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has had faith in our word?",,,,,,,
23586,"So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.",,,,,,,
23587,"But I say, Did not the word come to their ears? Yes, certainly: Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.",,,,,,,
23588,"But I say, Had Israel no knowledge? First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry.",,,,,,,
23589,"And Isaiah says without fear, Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me; and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me.",,,,,,,
23590,"But about Israel he says; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away, and who put themselves against my word.So I say, Has God put his people on one side? Let there be no such thought. For I am of Israel, of th",seed of Abr,ham,,f t,e tr,be,f Ben
23591,"God has not put away the people of his selection. Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings? how he says words to God against Israel,",,,,,,,
23592,"Lord, they have put your prophets to death, and made waste your altars, and now I am the last, and they are searching for me to take away my life.",,,,,,,
23593,But what answer does God make to him? I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal.,,,,,,,
23594,"In the same way, there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace.",,,,,,,
23595,"But if it is of grace, then it is no longer of works: or grace would not be grace.",,,,,,,
23596,"What then? That which Israel was searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard.",,,,,,,
23597,"As it was said in the holy Writings, God gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which have no hearing, to this day.",,,,,,,
23598,"And David says, Let their table be made a net for taking them, and a stone in their way, and a punishment:",,,,,,,
23599,"Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see, and let their back be bent down at all times.",,,,,,,
23600,"So I say, Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall? In no way: but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that they might be moved to envy.",,,,,,,
23601,"Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will be the glory when they are made full?",,,,,,,
23602,"But I say to you, Gentiles, in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make much of my position:",,,,,,,
23603,"If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy, so that some of them may get salvation by me.",,,,,,,
23604,"For, if by their putting away, the rest of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back again be, but life from the dead?",,,,,,,
23605,"And if the first-fruit is holy, so is the mass: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.",,,,,,,
23606,"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile,",,,,,,,
23607,"Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it is by the root that you are supported.",,,,,,,
23608,"You will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be put in.",,,,,,,
23609,"Truly, because they had no faith they were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not be lifted up in pride, but have fear;",,,,,,,
23610,"For, if God did not have mercy on the natural branches, he will not have mercy on you.",,,,,,,
23611,"See then that God is good but his rules are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will be cut off as they were.",,,,,,,
23612,"And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again.",,,,,,,
23613,"For if you were cut out of a field olive-tree, and against the natural use were united to a good olive-tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be united again with the olive-tree which was theirs?",,,,,,,
23614,"For it is my desire, brothers, that this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles have come in;",,,,,,,
23615,"And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob:",,,,,,,
23616,"And this is my agreement with them, when I will take away their sins.",,,,,,,
23617,"As far as the good news is in question, they are cut off from God on account of you, but as far as the selection is in question, they are loved on account of the fathers.",,,,,,,
23618,Because God's selection and his mercies may not be changed.,,,,,,,
23619,"For as you, in time past, were not under the rule of God, but now have got mercy through their turning away,",,,,,,,
23620,"So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God, so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy.",,,,,,,
23621,"For God has let them all go against his orders, so that he might have mercy on them all.",,,,,,,
23622,"O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions, and his ways may not be searched out.",,,,,,,
23623,Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord? or who has taken part in his purposes?,,,,,,,
23624,"Or who has first given to him, and it will be given back to him again?",,,,,,,
23625,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it.For this reason I make request to you, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you will give your bodies as a living offering, holy, pleasing to God, which is t",e worship it,is,i,ht,or y,u t,give
23626,"And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God.",,,,,,,
23627,"But I say to every one of you, through the grace given to me, not to have an over-high opinion of himself, but to have wise thoughts, as God has given to every one a measure of faith.",,,,,,,
23628,"For, as we have a number of parts in one body, but all the parts have not the same use,",,,,,,,
23629,"So we, though we are a number of persons, are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another;",,,,,,,
23630,"And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith;",,,,,,,
23631,"Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it;",,,,,,,
23632,"He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy.",,,,,,,
23633,Let love be without deceit. Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good.,,,,,,,
23634,"Be kind to one another with a brother's love, putting others before yourselves in honour;",,,,,,,
23635,"Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord's servants;",,,,,,,
23636,"Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer,",,,,,,,
23637,"Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses.",,,,,,,
23638,Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you.,,,,,,,
23639,"Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing.",,,,,,,
23640,"Be in harmony with one another. Do not have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom.",,,,,,,
23641,Do not give evil for evil to any man. Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men.,,,,,,,
23642,As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men.,,,,,,,
23643,"Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
23644,"But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head.",,,,,,,
23645,"Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil by good.Let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers, because there is no power which is not of God, and all powers are ordered by God.",,,,,,,
23646,For which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God: and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves.,,,,,,,
23647,"For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil. If you would have no fear of the authority, do good and you will have praise;",,,,,,,
23648,"For he is the servant of God to you for good. But if you doevil, havefear; fortheswordisnotinhishandfornothing: heisGod'sservant, making God's punishment come on the evil-doer.",,,,,,,
23649,"So put yourselves under the authority, not for fear of wrath, but because you have the knowledge of what is right.",,,,,,,
23650,"For the same reason, make payment of taxes; because the authority is God's servant, to take care of such things at all times.",,,,,,,
23651,"Give to all what is their right: taxes to him whose they are, payment to him whose right it is, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour is to be given.",,,,,,,
23652,"Be in debt for nothing, but to have love for one another: for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law.",,,,,,,
23653,"And this, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not put to death, Do not take what is another's, Do not have desire for what is another's, and if there is any other order, it is covered by this word, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.",,,,,,,
23654,"Love does no wrong to his neighbour, so love makes the law complete.",,,,,,,
23655,See then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep: for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith.,,,,,,,
23656,"The night is far gone, and the day is near: so let us put off the works of the dark, arming ourselves with light,",,,,,,,
23657,"With right behaviour as in the day; not in pleasure-making and drinking, not in bad company and unclean behaviour, not in fighting and envy.",,,,,,,
23658,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires.Do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith, and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings.",,,,,,,
23659,One man has faith to take all things as food: another who is feeble in faith takes only green food.,,,,,,,
23660,Let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not: and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does; for he has God's approval.,,,,,,,
23661,"Who are you to make yourself a judge of another man's servant? it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad. Yes, his place will be safe, because the Lord is able to keep him from falling.",,,,,,,
23662,This man puts one day before another: to that man they are the same. Let every man be certain in his mind.,,,,,,,
23663,"He who keeps the day, keeps it to the Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it not, and gives praise to God.",,,,,,,
23664,For every man's life and every man's death has a relation to others as well as to himself.,,,,,,,
23665,"As long as we have life we are living to the Lord; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord; so if we are living, or if our life comes to an end, we are the Lord's.",,,,,,,
23666,"And for this purpose Christ went into death and came back again, that he might be the Lord of the dead and of the living.",,,,,,,
23667,"But you, why do you make yourself your brother's judge? or again, why have you no respect for your brother? because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge.",,,,,,,
23668,"For it is said in the holy Writings, By my life, says the Lord, to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue will give worship to God.",,,,,,,
23669,So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God.,,,,,,,
23670,"Then let us not be judges of one another any longer: but keep this in mind, that no man is to make it hard for his brother, or give him cause for doubting.",,,,,,,
23671,"I am conscious of this, and am certain in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean, for him it is unclean.",,,,,,,
23672,"And if because of food your brother is troubled, then you are no longer going on in the way of love. Do not let your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death.",,,,,,,
23673,Let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good:,,,,,,,
23674,"For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
23675,"And he who in these things is Christ's servant, is pleasing to God and has the approval of men.",,,,,,,
23676,"So then, let us go after the things which make peace, and the things by which we may be a help to one another.",,,,,,,
23677,Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food. All things are certainly clean; but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another.,,,,,,,
23678,It is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother.,,,,,,,
23679,"The faith which you have, have it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval.",,,,,,,
23680,"But he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food, because he does it not in faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.We who are strong have to be a support to the feeble, and not give pleasure to ourselves.",,,,,,,
23681,"Let every one of us give pleasure to his neighbour for his good, to make him strong.",,,,,,,
23682,"For Christ did not give pleasure to himself, but, as it is said, The bitter words of those who were angry with you came on me.",,,,,,,
23683,"Now those things which were put down in writing before our time were for our learning, so that through quiet waiting and through the comfort of the holy Writings we might have hope.",,,,,,,
23684,Now may the God who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with Christ Jesus:,,,,,,,
23685,So that with one mouth you may give glory to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
23686,"So then, take one another to your hearts, as Christ took us, to the glory of God.",,,,,,,
23687,"Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by God to the fathers,",,,,,,,
23688,"And so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercy; as it is said, For this reason I will give praise to you among the Gentiles, and I will make a song to your name.",,,,,,,
23689,"And again he says, Take part, you Gentiles, in the joy of his people.",,,,,,,
23690,"And again, Give praise to the Lord, all you Gentiles; and let all the nations give praise to him.",,,,,,,
23691,"And again Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, and he who comes to be the ruler over the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles put their hope.",,,,,,,
23692,"Now may the God of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith, so that all hope may be yours in the power of the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
23693,"And I myself am certain of you, brothers, that you are full of what is good, complete in all knowledge, able to give direction to one another.",,,,,,,
23694,"But I have, in some measure, less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again, because of the grace which was given to me by God,",,,,,,,
23695,"To be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, doing the work of a priest in the good news of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be pleasing to God, being made holy by the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
23696,So I have pride in Christ Jesus in the things which are God's.,,,,,,,
23697,"And I will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the Gentiles under his rule in word and in act,",,,,,,,
23698,"By signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have given all the good news of Christ;",,,,,,,
23699,"Making it my purpose not to take the good news where Christ was named, so that my work might not be resting on that of others;",,,,,,,
23700,"But as it is said in the holy Writings, They will see, to whom the news of him had not been given, and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge.",,,,,,,
23701,For which reason I was frequently kept from coming to you:,,,,,,,
23702,"But now, having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you,",,,,,,,
23703,"Whenever I go to Spain (for it is my hope to see you on my way, and to be sent on there by you, if first I may in some measure have been comforted by your company) —",,,,,,,
23704,"But now I go to Jerusalem, taking help for the saints.",,,,,,,
23705,For it has been the good pleasure of those of Macedonia and Achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.,,,,,,,
23706,"Yes, it has been their good pleasure; and they are in their debt. For if the Gentiles have had a part in the things of the Spirit which were theirs, it is right for them, in the same way, to give them help in the things of the flesh.",,,,,,,
23707,"So when I have done this, and have given them this fruit of love, I will go on by you into Spain.",,,,,,,
23708,"And I am certain that when I come, I will be full of the blessing of Christ.",,,,,,,
23709,"Now I make request to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you will be working together with me in your prayers to God for me;",,,,,,,
23710,"So that I may be kept safe from those in Judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of God, and that the help which I am taking for Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints;",,,,,,,
23711,"So that I may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of God, and have rest with you.",,,,,,,
23712,"Now may the God of peace be with you all. So be it.It is my desire to say a good word for Phoebe, who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae:",,,,,,,
23713,"That you will take her in kindly, after the way of the saints, as one who is the Lord's, and give her help in anything in which she may have need of you: because she has been a help to a great number and to myself.",,,,,,,
23714,"Give my love to Prisca and Aquila, workers with me in Christ Jesus,",,,,,,,
23715,Who for my life put their necks in danger; to whom not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are in debt:,,,,,,,
23716,"And say a kind word to the church which is in their house. Give my love to my dear Epaenetus, who is the first fruit of Asia to Christ.",,,,,,,
23717,"Give my love to Mary, who gave much care to you.",,,,,,,
23718,"Give my love to Andronicus and Junia, my relations, who were in prison with me, who are noted among the Apostles, and who were in Christ before me.",,,,,,,
23719,"Give my love to Ampliatus, who is dear to me in the Lord,",,,,,,,
23720,"Give my love to Urbanus, a worker in Christ with us, and to my dear Stachys.",,,,,,,
23721,"Give my love to Apelles, who has the approval of Christ. Say a kind word to those who are of the house of Aristobulus.",,,,,,,
23722,"Give my love to Herodion, my relation. Say a kind word to those of the house of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.",,,,,,,
23723,"Give my love to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Give my love to my dear Persis, who did much work in the Lord.",,,,,,,
23724,"Give my love to Rufus, one of the Lord's selection, and to his mother and mine.",,,,,,,
23725,"Give my love to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.",,,,,,,
23726,"Give my love to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.",,,,,,,
23727,Give one another a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their love to you.,,,,,,,
23728,"Now, it is my desire, brothers, that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you, quite against the teaching which was given to you: and keep away from them.",,,,,,,
23729,"For such people are not servants of the Lord Christ, but of their stomachs; and by their smooth and well-said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked.",,,,,,,
23730,"For all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered. For this reason I have joy in you, but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good, and without knowledge of evil.",,,,,,,
23731,And the God of peace will be crushing Satan under your feet before long. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.,,,,,,,
23732,"Timothy, who is working with me, sends his love to you, so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my relations.",,,,,,,
23733,"I, Tertius, who have done the writing of this letter, send love in the Lord.",,,,,,,
23734,"Gaius, with whom I am living, whose house is open to all the church, sends his love, so does Erastus, the manager of the accounts of the town, and Quartus, the brother.",,,,,,,
23735,[],,,,,,,
23736,"Now to him who is able to make you strong in agreement with the good news which I gave you and the preaching of Jesus Christ, in the light of the revelation of that secret which has been kept through times eternal,",,,,,,,
23737,"But is now made clear; and by the writings of the prophets, by the order of the eternal God, the knowledge of it has been given to all the nations, so that they may come under the rule of the faith;",,,,,,,
23738,"To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory for ever. So be it.Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Sosthenes the brother,",,,,,,,
23739,"To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been made holy in Christ Jesus, saints by the selection of God, with all those who in every place give honour to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:",,,,,,,
23740,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
23741,"I give praise to my God for you at all times, because of the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ Jesus;",,,,,,,
23742,"So that in him you have wealth in all things, in word and in knowledge of every sort;",,,,,,,
23743,Even as the witness of the Christ has been made certain among you:,,,,,,,
23744,So that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;,,,,,,,
23745,"Who will give you strength to the end, to be free from all sin in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
23746,"God is true, through whom you have been given a part with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",,,,,,,
23747,"Now I make request to you, my brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you will all say the same thing, and that there may be no divisions among you, so that you may be in complete agreement, in the same mind and in the same opinion.",,,,,,,
23748,"Because it has come to my knowledge, through those of the house of Chloe, that there are divisions among you, my brothers.",,,,,,,
23749,"That is, that some of you say, I am of Paul; some say, I am of Apollos; some say, I am of Cephas; and some say, I am Christ's.",,,,,,,
23750,Is there a division in Christ? was Paul nailed to the cross for you? or were you given baptism in the name of Paul?,,,,,,,
23751,"I give praise to God that not one of you had baptism from me, but Crispus and Gaius;",,,,,,,
23752,So that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name.,,,,,,,
23753,And I gave baptism to the house of Stephanas; but I am not certain that any others had baptism from me.,,,,,,,
23754,"For Christ sent me, not to give baptism, but to be a preacher of the good news: not with wise words, for fear that the cross of Christ might be made of no value.",,,,,,,
23755,For the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction; but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of God.,,,,,,,
23756,"As it says in the holy Writings, I will put an end to the wisdom of the wise, and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge.",,,,,,,
23757,Where is the wise? where is he who has knowledge of the law? where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?,,,,,,,
23758,"For because, by the purpose of God, the world, with all its wisdom, had not the knowledge of God, it was God's pleasure, by so foolish a thing as preaching, to give salvation to those who had faith in him.",,,,,,,
23759,"Seeing that the Jews make request for signs, and the Greeks are looking for knowledge:",,,,,,,
23760,"But we give the good news of Christ on the cross, a hard thing to the Jews, and a foolish thing to the Gentiles;",,,,,,,
23761,"But to those of God's selection, Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power and the wisdom of God.",,,,,,,
23762,Because what seems foolish in God is wiser than men; and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men.,,,,,,,
23763,"For you see God's design for you, my brothers, that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh, not the strong, not the noble:",,,,,,,
23764,But God made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame; and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong;,,,,,,,
23765,"And the low things of the world, and the things without honour, did God make selection of, yes, even the things which are not, so that he might make as nothing the things which are:",,,,,,,
23766,So that no flesh might have glory before God.,,,,,,,
23767,"But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus, through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation, and made us holy:",,,,,,,
23768,"So that, as it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord.And when I came to you, my brothers, I did not come with wise words of knowledge, putting before you the secret of God.",,,,,,,
23769,For I had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of Jesus Christ on the cross.,,,,,,,
23770,"And I was with you without strength, in fear and in doubt.",,,,,,,
23771,"And in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom, but I was dependent on the power of the Spirit to make it clear to you:",,,,,,,
23772,So that your faith might be based not on man's wisdom but on the power of God.,,,,,,,
23773,"But still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge, though not the wisdom of this world, and not of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing:",,,,,,,
23774,"But we give the news of the secret wisdom of God, which he had kept in store before the world came into existence, for our glory;",,,,,,,
23775,"Of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge: for if they had, they would not have put the Lord of glory on the cross:",,,,,,,
23776,"But as it says in the holy Writings, Things which the eye saw not, and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man, such things as God has made ready for those who have love for him.",,,,,,,
23777,"But God has given us the revelation of these things through his Spirit, for the Spirit makes search into all things, even the deep things of God.",,,,,,,
23778,"For who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him? in the same way, no one has knowledge of the things of God but the Spirit of God.",,,,,,,
23779,"But we have not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes from God, so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by God.",,,,,,,
23780,"And these are the things which we say, not in the language of man's wisdom, but in words given to us by the Spirit, judging the things of the spirit by the help of the Spirit.",,,,,,,
23781,"For the natural man is not able to take in the things of the Spirit of God: for they seem foolish to him, and he is not able to have knowledge of them, because such knowledge comes only through the Spirit.",,,,,,,
23782,"But he who has the Spirit, though judging all things, is himself judged by no one.",,,,,,,
23783,"For who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord, so as to be his teacher? But we have the mind of Christ.And the teaching I gave you, my brothers, was such as I was able to give, not to those who have the Spirit, but to those who are still in the flesh, ev",n to childre,in,C,ris,.,,
23784,"I gave you milk and not meat, because you were, then, unable to take it, and even now you are not able;",,,,,,,
23785,"Because you are still in the flesh: for when there is envy and division among you, are you not still walking after the way of the flesh, even as natural men?",,,,,,,
23786,"For when one says, I am of Paul; and another says, I am of Apollos; are you not talking like natural men?",,,,,,,
23787,What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them.,,,,,,,
23788,"I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave the increase.",,,,,,,
23789,"So then the planter is nothing, and the waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase.",,,,,,,
23790,Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end: but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work.,,,,,,,
23791,"For we are workers with God: you are God's planting, God's building.",,,,,,,
23792,"In the measure of the grace given to me, I, as a wise master-builder, have put the base in position, and another goes on building on it. But let every man take care what he puts on it.",,,,,,,
23793,"For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
23794,"But on the base a man may put gold, silver, stones of great price, wood, dry grass, cut stems;",,,,,,,
23795,"Every man's work will be made clear in that day, because it will be tested by fire; and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every man's work.",,,,,,,
23796,"If any man's work comes through the test, he will have a reward.",,,,,,,
23797,"If the fire puts an end to any man's work, it will be his loss: but he will get salvation himself, though as by fire.",,,,,,,
23798,"Do you not see that you are God's holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you?",,,,,,,
23799,"If anyone makes the house of God unclean, God will put an end to him; for the house of God is holy, and you are his house.",,,,,,,
23800,"Let no man have a false idea. If any man seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.",,,,,,,
23801,"For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God. As it is said in the holy Writings, He who takes the wise in their secret designs:",,,,,,,
23802,"And again, The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise, that they are nothing.",,,,,,,
23803,So let no one take pride in men. For all things are yours;,,,,,,,
23804,"Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;",,,,,,,
23805,"And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.Let us be judged as servants of Christ, and as those who are responsible for the secret things of God.",,,,,,,
23806,And it is right for such servants to be safe persons.,,,,,,,
23807,But it is a small thing to me that I am judged by you or by man's judging; I am not even a judge of myself.,,,,,,,
23808,"For I am not conscious of any wrong in myself; but this does not make me clear, for it is the Lord who is my judge.",,,,,,,
23809,"For this reason let there be no judging before the time, till the Lord comes, who will make clear the secret things of the dark, and the designs of the heart; and then will every man have his praise from God.",,,,,,,
23810,"My brothers, it is because of you that I have taken Apollos and myself as examples of these things, so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy Writings, so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brothe",.,,,,,,
23811,"For who made you better than your brother? or what have you that has not been given to you? but if it has been given to you, what cause have you for pride, as if it had not been given to you?",,,,,,,
23812,"For even now you are full, even now you have wealth, you have been made kings without us: truly, I would be glad if you were kings, so that we might be kings with you.",,,,,,,
23813,"For it seems to me that God has put us the Apostles last of all, as men whose fate is death: for we are put on view to the world, and to angels, and to men.",,,,,,,
23814,"We are made to seem foolish for Christ, but you are wise in Christ; we are feeble, but you are strong; you have glory, but we have shame.",,,,,,,
23815,"Even to this hour we are without food, drink, and clothing, we are given blows and have no certain resting-place;",,,,,,,
23816,"And with our hands we do the hardest work: when they give us curses we give blessings, when we undergo punishment we take it quietly;",,,,,,,
23817,"When evil things are said about us we give gentle answers: we are made as the unclean things of the world, as that for which no one has any use, even till now.",,,,,,,
23818,"I am not saying these things to put you to shame, but so that, as my dear children, you may see what is right.",,,,,,,
23819,"For even if you had ten thousand teachers in Christ, you have not more than one father: for in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news.",,,,,,,
23820,So my desire is that you take me as your example.,,,,,,,
23821,"For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and true child in the Lord; he will make clear to you my ways in Christ, even as I am teaching everywhere in every church.",,,,,,,
23822,"Now some are full of pride, as if I was not coming to you.",,,,,,,
23823,"But I will come to you in a short time, if it is pleasing to the Lord, and I will take note, not of the word of those who are full of pride, but of the power.",,,,,,,
23824,For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.,,,,,,,
23825,"What is your desire? is my coming to be with punishment, or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit?It is said, in fact, that there is among you a sin of the flesh, such as is not seen even among the Gentiles, that one of you has his father's wife.",,,,,,,
23826,"And in place of feeling sorrow, you are pleased with yourselves, so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you.",,,,,,,
23827,"For I myself, being present in spirit though not in body, have come to a decision about him who has done this thing;",,,,,,,
23828,"In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you have come together with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,",,,,,,,
23829,"That this man is to be handed over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the Lord Jesus.",,,,,,,
23830,This pride of yours is not good. Do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass?,,,,,,,
23831,"Take away, then, the old leaven, so that you may be a new mass, even as you are without leaven. For Christ has been put to death as our Passover.",,,,,,,
23832,"Let us then keep the feast, not with old leaven, and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts, but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings.",,,,,,,
23833,In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh;,,,,,,,
23834,"But I had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church, or those who have a desire for and take the property of others, or those who give worship to images; for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world complet",ly:,,,,,,
23835,"But the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh, or had the desire for other people's property, or was in the way of using violent language, or being the worse for drink, or took by force",what was not,his,,ou,ight,not,keep
23836,For it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside; but it is yours to be judging those who are among you;,,,,,,,
23837,"As for those who are outside, God is their judge. So put away the evil man from among you.How is it, that if any one of you has a cause at law against another, he takes it before a Gentile judge and not before the saints?",,,,,,,
23838,"Is it not certain that the saints will be the judges of the world? if then the world will be judged by you, are you unable to give a decision about the smallest things?",,,,,,,
23839,Is it not certain that we are to be the judges of angels? how much more then of the things of this life?,,,,,,,
23840,"If then there are questions to be judged in connection with the things of this life, why do you put them in the hands of those who have no position in the church?",,,,,,,
23841,I say this to put you to shame. Is there not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between his brothers?,,,,,,,
23842,But a brother who has a cause at law against another takes it before Gentile judges.,,,,,,,
23843,"More than this, it is not to your credit to have causes at law with one another at all. Why not put up with wrong? why not undergo loss?",,,,,,,
23844,"So far from doing this, you yourselves do wrong and take your brothers' property.",,,,,,,
23845,"Have you not knowledge that evil-doers will have no part in the kingdom of God? Have no false ideas about this: no one who goes after the desires of the flesh, or gives worship to images, or is untrue when married, or is less than a man, or makes a wrong","use of men,",,,,,,
23846,"Or is a thief, or the worse for drink, or makes use of strong language, or takes by force what is not his, will have any part in the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
23847,"And such were some of you; but you have been washed, you have been made holy, you have been given righteousness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.",,,,,,,
23848,I am free to do all things; but not all things are wise. I am free to do all things; but I will not let myself come under the power of any.,,,,,,,
23849,"Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will put an end to them together. But the body is not for the desires of the flesh, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:",,,,,,,
23850,And God who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power.,,,,,,,
23851,Do you not see that your bodies are part of the body of Christ? how then may I take what is a part of the body of Christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman? such a thing may not be.,,,,,,,
23852,"Or do you not see that he who is joined to a loose woman is one body with her? for God has said, The two of them will become one flesh.",,,,,,,
23853,But he who is united to the Lord is one spirit.,,,,,,,
23854,Keep away from the desires of the flesh. Every sin which a man does is outside of the body; but he who goes after the desires of the flesh does evil to his body.,,,,,,,
23855,"Or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the Holy Spirit which is in you, and which has been given to you by God? and you are not the owners of yourselves;",,,,,,,
23856,"For a payment has been made for you: let God be honoured in your body.Now, as to the things in your letter to me: It is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman.",,,,,,,
23857,"But because of the desires of the flesh, let every man have his wife, and every woman her husband.",,,,,,,
23858,Let the husband give to the wife what is right; and let the wife do the same to the husband.,,,,,,,
23859,"The wife has not power over her body, but the husband; and in the same way the husband has not power over his body, but the wife.",,,,,,,
23860,"Do not keep back from one another what is right, but only for a short time, and by agreement, so that you may give yourselves to prayer, and come together again; so that Satan may not get the better of you through your loss of self-control.",,,,,,,
23861,"But this I say as my opinion, and not as an order of the Lord.",,,,,,,
23862,"It is my desire that all men might be even as I am. But every man has the power of his special way of life given him by God, one in this way and one in that.",,,,,,,
23863,"But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them to be even as I am.",,,,,,,
23864,But if they have not self-control let them get married; for married life is better than the burning of desire.,,,,,,,
23865,"But to the married I give orders, though not I but the Lord, that the wife may not go away from her husband",,,,,,,
23866,"(Or if she goes away from him, let her keep unmarried, or be united to her husband again); and that the husband may not go away from his wife.",,,,,,,
23867,"But to the rest I say, and not the Lord; If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian, and it is her desire to go on living with him, let him not go away from her.",,,,,,,
23868,"And if a woman has a husband who is not a Christian, and it is his desire to go on living with her, let her not go away from her husband.",,,,,,,
23869,"For the husband who has not faith is made holy through his Christian wife, and the wife who is not a Christian is made holy through the brother: if not, your children would be unholy, but now are they holy.",,,,,,,
23870,"But if the one who is not a Christian has a desire to go away, let it be so: the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other: but it is God's pleasure that we may be at peace with one another.",,,,,,,
23871,"For how may you be certain, O wife, that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband? or you, O husband, that you may not do the same for your wife?",,,,,,,
23872,"Only, as the Lord has given to a man, and as is the purpose of God for him, so let him go on living. And these are my orders for all the churches.",,,,,,,
23873,"If any man who is a Christian has had circumcision, let him keep so; and if any man who is a Christian has not had circumcision, let him make no change.",,,,,,,
23874,"Circumcision is nothing, and its opposite is nothing, but only doing the orders of God is of value.",,,,,,,
23875,Let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by God.,,,,,,,
23876,"If you were a servant when you became a Christian, let it not be a grief to you; but if you have a chance to become free, make use of it.",,,,,,,
23877,For he who was a servant when he became a Christian is the Lord's free man; and he who was free when he became a Christian is the Lord's servant.,,,,,,,
23878,It is the Lord who has made payment for you: be not servants of men.,,,,,,,
23879,"My brothers, let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of God for him.",,,,,,,
23880,Now about virgins I have no orders from the Lord: but I give my opinion as one to whom the Lord has given mercy to be true to him.,,,,,,,
23881,"In my opinion then, because of the present trouble, it is good for a man to keep as he is.",,,,,,,
23882,"If you are married to a wife, make no attempt to get free from her: if you are free from a wife, do not take a wife.",,,,,,,
23883,If you get married it is not a sin; and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin. But those who do so will have trouble in the flesh. But I will not be hard on you.,,,,,,,
23884,"But I say this, my brothers, the time is short; and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not;",,,,,,,
23885,"And for those who are in sorrow, to give no signs of it; and for those who are glad, to give no signs of joy; and for those who are getting property, to be as if they had nothing;",,,,,,,
23886,"And for those who make use of the world, not to be using it fully; for this world's way of life will quickly come to an end.",,,,,,,
23887,"But it is my desire for you to be free from cares. The unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the Lord, how he may give pleasure to the Lord:",,,,,,,
23888,"But the married man gives his attention to the things of this world, how he may give pleasure to his wife.",,,,,,,
23889,"And the wife is not the same as the virgin. The virgin gives her mind to the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and in spirit: but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world, how she may give pleasure to her husband.",,,,,,,
23890,"Now I say this for your profit; not to make things hard for you, but because of what is right, and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord.",,,,,,,
23891,"But if, in any man's opinion, he is not doing what is right for his virgin, if she is past her best years, and there is need for it, let him do what seems right to him; it is no sin; let them be married.",,,,,,,
23892,"But the man who is strong in mind and purpose, who is not forced but has control over his desires, does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin.",,,,,,,
23893,"So then, he who gets married to his virgin does well, and he who keeps her unmarried does better.",,,,,,,
23894,"It is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living; but when her husband is dead, she is free to be married to another; but only to a Christian.",,,,,,,
23895,"But it will be better for her to keep as she is, in my opinion: and it seems to me that I have the Spirit of God.Now about things offered to images: we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge. Knowledge gives pride, but love gives true strength.",,,,,,,
23896,"If anyone seems to himself to have knowledge, so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything;",,,,,,,
23897,"But if anyone has love for God, God has knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
23898,"So, then, as to the question of taking food offered to images, we are certain that an image is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.",,,,,,,
23899,"For though there are those who have the name of gods, in heaven or on earth, as there are a number of gods and a number of lords,",,,,,,,
23900,"There is for us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we are for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we have our being through him.",,,,,,,
23901,"Still, all men have not that knowledge: but some, being used till now to the image, are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image; and because they are not strong in the faith, their minds are troubled.",,,,,,,
23902,But God's approval of us is not based on the food we take: if we do not take it we are no worse for it; and if we take it we are no better.,,,,,,,
23903,But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble.,,,,,,,
23904,"For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, taking food as a guest in the house of an image, will it not give him, if he is feeble, the idea that he may take food offered to images?",,,,,,,
23905,"And so, through your knowledge, you are the cause of destruction to your brother, for whom Christ underwent death.",,,,,,,
23906,"And in this way, doing evil to the brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are sinning against Christ.",,,,,,,
23907,"For this reason, if food is a cause of trouble to my brother, I will give up taking meat for ever, so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother.Am I not free? am I not an Apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are you not my work in the Lord?",,,,,,,
23908,"If to others I am not an Apostle, at least I am one to you: for the fact that you are Christians is the sign that I am an Apostle.",,,,,,,
23909,My answer to those who are judging me is this.,,,,,,,
23910,Have we no right to take food and drink?,,,,,,,
23911,"Have we no right to take about with us a Christian wife, like the rest of the Apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?",,,,,,,
23912,"Or I only and Barnabas, have we no right to take a rest from work?",,,,,,,
23913,Who ever goes to war without looking to someone to be responsible for his payment? who puts in vines and does not take the fruit of them? or who takes care of sheep without drinking of their milk?,,,,,,,
23914,Am I talking as a man? does not the law say the same?,,,,,,,
23915,"For it says in the law of Moses, It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it. Is it for the oxen that God is giving orders?",,,,,,,
23916,"Or has he us in mind? Yes, it was said for us; because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope, and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it.",,,,,,,
23917,"If we have been planting the things of the Spirit for you, does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world?",,,,,,,
23918,"If others have a part in this right over you, have we not even more? But we did not make use of our right, so that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of Christ.",,,,,,,
23919,"Do you not see that the servants of the holy things get their living from the Temple, and the servants of the altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar?",,,,,,,
23920,Even so did the Lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news.,,,,,,,
23921,"But I have not made use of any of these things: and I am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me: for it would be better for me to undergo death, than for any man to make this pride of mine of no effect.",,,,,,,
23922,"For if I am a preacher of the good news, I have no cause for pride in this; because I am forced to do so, for a curse is on me if I do not.",,,,,,,
23923,"But if I do it gladly, I have a reward; and if not, I am under orders to do it.",,,,,,,
23924,"What then is my reward? This, that when I am giving the good news, I may give it without payment, not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news.",,,,,,,
23925,"For though I was free from all men, I made myself a servant to all, so that more might have salvation.",,,,,,,
23926,"And to the Jews I was as a Jew, so that I might give the good news to them; to those under the law I was the same, not as being myself under the law, but so that I might give the good news to those under the law.",,,,,,,
23927,"To those without the law I was as one without the law, not as being without law to God, but as under law to Christ, so that I might give the good news to those without the law.",,,,,,,
23928,"To the feeble, I was as one who is feeble, so that they might have salvation: I have been all things to all men, so that some at least might have salvation.",,,,,,,
23929,"And I do all things for the cause of the good news, so that I may have a part in it.",,,,,,,
23930,"Do you not see that in a running competition all take part, but only one gets the reward? So let your minds be fixed on the reward.",,,,,,,
23931,"And every man who takes part in the sports has self-control in all things. Now they do it to get a crown which is of this world, but we for an eternal crown.",,,,,,,
23932,"So then I am running, not uncertainly; so I am fighting, not as one who gives blows in the air:",,,,,,,
23933,"But I give blows to my body, and keep it under control, for fear that, after having given the good news to others, I myself might not have God's approval.For it is my desire, my brothers, that you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud",and they al,we,t,thr,ugh,he,ea;
23934,And they all had baptism from Moses in the cloud and in the sea;,,,,,,,
23935,And they all took the same holy food;,,,,,,,
23936,And the same holy drink: for they all took of the water from the holy rock which came after them: and the rock was Christ.,,,,,,,
23937,But with most of them God was not pleased: for they came to their end in the waste land.,,,,,,,
23938,"Now these things were for an example to us, so that our hearts might not go after evil things, as they did.",,,,,,,
23939,"Then do not go after false gods, as some of them did; as it is said in the holy Writings, After resting and feasting, the people got up to take their pleasure.",,,,,,,
23940,"Again, let us not give way to the desires of the flesh, as some of them did, of whom twenty-three thousand came to their end in one day.",,,,,,,
23941,"And let us not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did, and came to their death by snakes.",,,,,,,
23942,"And do not say evil things against the Lord, as some of them did, and destruction overtook them.",,,,,,,
23943,"Now these things were done as an example; and were put down in writing for our teaching, on whom the last days have come.",,,,,,,
23944,So let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall.,,,,,,,
23945,"You have been put to no test but such as is common to man: and God is true, who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo; but he will make with the test a way out of it, so that you may be able to go through it.",,,,,,,
23946,"For this cause, my dear brothers, give no worship to false gods.",,,,,,,
23947,"What I am saying is for wise men, do you be the judges of it.",,,,,,,
23948,"The cup of blessing which we take, does it not give us a part in the blood of Christ? and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of Christ?",,,,,,,
23949,"Because we, being a number of persons, are one bread, we are one body: for we all take part in the one bread.",,,,,,,
23950,See Israel after the flesh: do not those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the altar?,,,,,,,
23951,"Do I say, then, that what is offered to images is anything, or that the image is anything?",,,,,,,
23952,What I say is that the things offered by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God; and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits.,,,,,,,
23953,"It is not possible for you, at the same time, to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits; you may not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits.",,,,,,,
23954,Or may we be the cause of envy to the Lord? are we stronger than he?,,,,,,,
23955,"We are free to do all things, but there are things which it is not wise to do. We are free to do all things, but not all things are for the common good.",,,,,,,
23956,"Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself, but equally to his neighbour's good.",,,,,,,
23957,"Whatever meat may be had at the public market, take as food without question of right or wrong;",,,,,,,
23958,For the earth is the Lord's and all things in it.,,,,,,,
23959,"If a Gentile makes a feast for you, and you are pleased to go as a guest, take whatever is put before you, without question of right or wrong.",,,,,,,
23960,"But if anyone says to you, This food has been used as an offering, do not take it, on account of him who said it, and on account of his sense of right and wrong:",,,,,,,
23961,"Right and wrong, I say, not for you, but for the other man; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another man's sense of right or wrong.",,,,,,,
23962,"But if I give praise to God for the food which I take, let no man say evil of me for that reason.",,,,,,,
23963,"So then, if it is a question of food or drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.",,,,,,,
23964,"Give no cause of trouble to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God.",,,,,,,
23965,"Even as I give way to all men in all things, not looking for profit for myself, but for the good of others, that they may get salvation.So take me for your example, even as I take Christ for mine.",,,,,,,
23966,"Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things, and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you.",,,,,,,
23967,"But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.",,,,,,,
23968,"Every man who takes part in prayer, or gives teaching as a prophet, with his head covered, puts shame on his head.",,,,,,,
23969,"But every woman who does so with her head unveiled, puts shame on her head: for it is the same as if her hair was cut off.",,,,,,,
23970,"For if a woman is not veiled, let her hair be cut off; but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off, let her be veiled.",,,,,,,
23971,"For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.",,,,,,,
23972,"For the man did not come from the woman, but the woman from the man.",,,,,,,
23973,"And the man was not made for the woman, but the woman for the man.",,,,,,,
23974,"For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.",,,,,,,
23975,"But the woman is not separate from the man, and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord.",,,,,,,
23976,"For as the woman is from the man, so the man is through the woman; but all things are from God.",,,,,,,
23977,Be judges yourselves of the question: does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled?,,,,,,,
23978,"Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair, it is a cause of shame to him?",,,,,,,
23979,"But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering.",,,,,,,
23980,"But if any man will not be ruled in this question, this is not our way of doing things, and it is not done in the churches of God.",,,,,,,
23981,"But in giving you this order, there is one thing about which I am not pleased: it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.",,,,,,,
23982,"For first of all, it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and I take the statement to be true in part.",,,,,,,
23983,"For divisions are necessary among you, in order that those who have God's approval may be clearly seen among you.",,,,,,,
23984,"But now, when you come together, it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord:",,,,,,,
23985,"For when you take your food, everyone takes his meal before the other; and one has not enough food, and another is the worse for drink.",,,,,,,
23986,"What? have you not houses to take your meals in? or have you no respect for the church of God, putting the poor to shame? What am I to say to you? am I to give you praise? certainly not.",,,,,,,
23987,"For it was handed down to me from the Lord, as I gave it to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when Judas was false to him, took bread,",,,,,,,
23988,"And when it had been broken with an act of praise, he said, This is my body which is for you: do this in memory of me.",,,,,,,
23989,"In the same way, with the cup, after the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this, whenever you take it, in memory of me.",,,,,,,
23990,For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes.,,,,,,,
23991,"If, then, anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord.",,,,,,,
23992,But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself.,,,,,,,
23993,"For a man puts himself in danger, if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lord's body.",,,,,,,
23994,"For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill, and a number are dead.",,,,,,,
23995,"But if we were true judges of ourselves, punishment would not come on us.",,,,,,,
23996,"But if punishment does come, it is sent by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged.",,,,,,,
23997,"So then, my brothers, when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one another.",,,,,,,
23998,"If any man is in need of food, let him take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come.But about the things of the spirit, my brothers, it is not right for you to be without teach",ng.,,,,,,
23999,"You are conscious that when you were Gentiles, in whatever way you were guided, you went after images without voice or power.",,,,,,,
24000,"So it is my desire for you to be clear about this; that no one is able to say by the Spirit of God that Jesus is cursed; and no one is able to say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.",,,,,,,
24001,"Now there are different qualities given to men, but the same Spirit.",,,,,,,
24002,"And there are different sorts of servants, but the same Lord.",,,,,,,
24003,"And there are different operations, but the same God, who is working all things in all.",,,,,,,
24004,But to every man some form of the Spirit's working is given for the common good.,,,,,,,
24005,For to one are given words of wisdom through the Spirit; and to another words of knowledge through the same Spirit:,,,,,,,
24006,"To another faith in the same Spirit; and to another the power of taking away disease, by the one Spirit;",,,,,,,
24007,And to another the power of working wonders; and to another the prophet's word; and to another the power of testing spirits; to another different sorts of tongues; and to another the power of making clear the sense of the tongues:,,,,,,,
24008,"But all these are the operations of the one and the same Spirit, giving to every man separately as his pleasure is.",,,,,,,
24009,"For as the body is one, and has a number of parts, and all the parts make one body, so is Christ.",,,,,,,
24010,"For through the baptism of the one Spirit we were all formed into one body, Jews or Greeks, servants or free men, and were all made full of the same Spirit.",,,,,,,
24011,"For the body is not one part, but a number of parts.",,,,,,,
24012,"If the foot says, Because I am not the hand, I am not a part of the body; it is no less a part of the body.",,,,,,,
24013,"And if the ear says, Because I am not the eye, I am not a part of the body; it is a part of the body all the same.",,,,,,,
24014,"If all the body was an eye, where would be the hearing? if all was hearing, where would be the smelling?",,,,,,,
24015,But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him.,,,,,,,
24016,"And if they were all one part, where would the body be?",,,,,,,
24017,"But now they are all different parts, but one body.",,,,,,,
24018,"And the eye may not say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.",,,,,,,
24019,"No, those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary;",,,,,,,
24020,And to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour; and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect;,,,,,,,
24021,But those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care: and so the body has been joined together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it;,,,,,,,
24022,So that there might be no division in the body; but all the parts might have the same care for one another.,,,,,,,
24023,"And if there is pain in one part of the body, all the parts will be feeling it; or if one part is honoured, all the parts will be glad.",,,,,,,
24024,"Now you are the body of Christ, and every one of you the separate parts of it.",,,,,,,
24025,"And God has put some in the church, first, Apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those with wonder- working powers, then those with the power of taking away disease, helpers, wise guides, users of strange tongues.",,,,,,,
24026,Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all the power of working wonders?,,,,,,,
24027,Are all able to take away disease? have all the power of tongues? are all able to give their sense?,,,,,,,
24028,"But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit. And now I am pointing out to you an even better way.If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am like sounding brass, or a loud-tongued bell.",,,,,,,
24029,"And if I have a prophet's power, and have knowledge of all secret things; and if I have all faith, by which mountains may be moved from their place, but have not love, I am nothing.",,,,,,,
24030,"And if I give all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it is of no profit to me.",,,,,,,
24031,"Love is never tired of waiting; love is kind; love has no envy; love has no high opinion of itself, love has no pride;",,,,,,,
24032,"Love's ways are ever fair, it takes no thought for itself; it is not quickly made angry, it takes no account of evil;",,,,,,,
24033,"It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, but has joy in what is true;",,,,,,,
24034,"Love has the power of undergoing all things, having faith in all things, hoping all things.",,,,,,,
24035,"Though the prophet's word may come to an end, tongues come to nothing, and knowledge have no more value, love has no end.",,,,,,,
24036,"For our knowledge is only in part, and the prophet's word gives only a part of what is true:",,,,,,,
24037,"But when that which is complete is come, then that which is in part will be no longer necessary.",,,,,,,
24038,"When I was a child, I made use of a child's language, I had a child's feelings and a child's thoughts: now that I am a man, I have put away the things of a child.",,,,,,,
24039,"For now we see things in a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now my knowledge is in part; then it will be complete, even as God's knowledge of me.",,,,,,,
24040,"But now we still have faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.Go after love; still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives, but most of all that you may have the prophet's power.",,,,,,,
24041,For he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to God; because no one has the sense of what he is saying; but in the Spirit he is talking of secret things.,,,,,,,
24042,But the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength.,,,,,,,
24043,He who makes use of tongues may do good to himself; but he who gives the prophet's word does good to the church.,,,,,,,
24044,"Now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues, it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophet's word from you; for this is a greater thing than using tongues, if the sense is not given at the same time, for the good of the",church.,,,,,,
24045,"But, now, my brothers, if I come to you using tongues, what profit will it be to you, if I do not give you a revelation, or knowledge, or the word of the prophet, or teaching?",,,,,,,
24046,"Even things without life, having a voice, such as a music-pipe or other instrument, if they do not give out different sounds, who may be certain what is being played?",,,,,,,
24047,"For if the war-horn gives out an uncertain note, who will get ready for the fight?",,,,,,,
24048,"So if you, in using a strange tongue, say words which have no sense, how will anyone take in what you are saying? for you will be talking to the air.",,,,,,,
24049,"There are, it may be, a number of different voices in the world, and no voice is without sense.",,,,,,,
24050,"But if the sense of the voice is not clear to me, I am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking, and he will be the same to me.",,,,,,,
24051,"So if you are desiring the things which the Spirit gives, let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church.",,,,,,,
24052,"For this reason, let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may, at the same time, be able to give the sense.",,,,,,,
24053,"For if I make use of tongues in my prayers, my spirit makes the prayer, but not my mind.",,,,,,,
24054,"What then? let my prayer be from the spirit, and equally from the mind; let my song be from the spirit, and equally from mind.",,,,,,,
24055,"For if you give a blessing with the spirit, how will the man who has no knowledge say, So be it, after your prayer, seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying?",,,,,,,
24056,"For your giving of the blessing is certainly well done, but of no profit to the man without knowledge.",,,,,,,
24057,I give praise to God that I am able to make use of tongues more than you all:,,,,,,,
24058,"But in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear, so that others might have profit, than ten thousand words in a strange tongue.",,,,,,,
24059,"My brothers, do not be children in mind: in evil be as little children, but in mind be of full growth.",,,,,,,
24060,"In the law it is said, By men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people; and not even so will they give ear to me, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
24061,"For this reason tongues are for a sign, not to those who have faith, but to those who have not: but the prophet's word is for those who have faith, and not for the rest who have not.",,,,,,,
24062,"If, then, the church has come together, and all are using tongues, and there come in men without knowledge or faith, will they not say that you are unbalanced?",,,,,,,
24063,"But if all are teaching as prophets, and a man without faith or knowledge comes in, he is tested by all, he is judged by all;",,,,,,,
24064,"The secrets of his heart are made clear; and he will go down on his face and give worship to God, saying that God is truly among you.",,,,,,,
24065,"What is it then, my brothers? when you come together everyone has a holy song, or a revelation, or a tongue, or is giving the sense of it. Let everything be done for the common good.",,,,,,,
24066,"If any man makes use of a tongue, let it not be more than two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let someone give the sense:",,,,,,,
24067,"But if there is no one to give the sense, let him keep quiet in the church; and let his words be to himself and to God.",,,,,,,
24068,"And let the prophets give their words, but not more than two or three, and let the others be judges of what they say.",,,,,,,
24069,"But if a revelation is given to another who is seated near, let the first be quiet.",,,,,,,
24070,For you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort;,,,,,,,
24071,And the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets;,,,,,,,
24072,"For God is not a God whose ways are without order, but a God of peace; as in all the churches of the saints.",,,,,,,
24073,"Let women keep quiet in the churches: for it is not right for them to be talking; but let them be under control, as it says in the law.",,,,,,,
24074,"And if they have a desire for knowledge about anything, let them put questions to their husbands privately: for talking in the church puts shame on a woman.",,,,,,,
24075,What? was it from you that the word of God went out? or did it only come in to you?,,,,,,,
24076,"If any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the Spirit, let him take note of the things which I am writing to you, as being the word of the Lord.",,,,,,,
24077,"But if any man is without knowledge, let him be so.",,,,,,,
24078,"So then, my brothers, let it be your chief desire to be prophets; but let no one be stopped from using tongues.",,,,,,,
24079,"Let all things be done in the right and ordered way.Now I am going to make clear to you, my brothers, what the good news was which I gave to you, and which you took, and on which your faith is based,",,,,,,,
24080,"By which you have salvation; that is to say, the form in which it was given to you, if it is fixed in your minds, and if your faith in it is not without effect.",,,,,,,
24081,"For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says in the Writings;",,,,,,,
24082,"And he was put in the place of the dead; and on the third day he came back from the dead, as it says in the Writings;",,,,,,,
24083,And he was seen by Cephas; then by the twelve;,,,,,,,
24084,"Then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, but some are sleeping;",,,,,,,
24085,Then he was seen by James; then by all the Apostles.,,,,,,,
24086,"And last of all, as by one whose birth was out of the right time, he was seen by me.",,,,,,,
24087,"For I am the least of the Apostles, having no right to be named an Apostle, because of my cruel attacks on the church of God.",,,,,,,
24088,"But by the grace of God, I am what I am: and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing; for I did more work than all of them; though not I, but the grace of God which was with me.",,,,,,,
24089,"If then it is I who am the preacher, or they, this is our word, and to this you have given your faith.",,,,,,,
24090,"Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead?",,,,,,,
24091,"But if there is no coming back from the dead, then Christ has not come back from the dead:",,,,,,,
24092,"And if Christ did not come again from the dead, then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect.",,,,,,,
24093,"Yes, and we are seen to be false witnesses of God; because we gave witness of God that by his power Christ came again from the dead: which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead.",,,,,,,
24094,"For if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again, then Christ has not come to life again:",,,,,,,
24095,"And if that is so, your faith is of no effect; you are still in your sins.",,,,,,,
24096,"And, in addition, the dead in Christ have gone to destruction.",,,,,,,
24097,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most unhappy.",,,,,,,
24098,"But now Christ has truly come back from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are sleeping.",,,,,,,
24099,"For as by man came death, so by man there is a coming back from the dead.",,,,,,,
24100,"For as in Adam death comes to all, so in Christ will all come back to life.",,,,,,,
24101,But every man in his right order: Christ the first-fruits; then those who are Christ's at his coming.,,,,,,,
24102,"Then comes the end, when he will give up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power.",,,,,,,
24103,For his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet.,,,,,,,
24104,The last power to come to an end is death.,,,,,,,
24105,"For, as it says, He has put all things under his feet. But when he says, All things are put under him, it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him.",,,,,,,
24106,"And when all things have been put under him, then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him, so that God may be all in all.",,,,,,,
24107,"Again, what will they do who are given baptism for the dead? if the dead do not come back at all, why are people given baptism for them?",,,,,,,
24108,And why are we in danger every hour?,,,,,,,
24109,"Yes, truly, by your pride in me, my brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord, my life is one long death.",,,,,,,
24110,"If, after the way of men, I was fighting with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not come to life again, let us take our pleasure in feasting, for tomorrow we come to an end.",,,,,,,
24111,Do not be tricked by false words: evil company does damage to good behaviour.,,,,,,,
24112,Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I say this to put you to shame.,,,,,,,
24113,"But someone will say, How do the dead come back? and with what sort of body do they come?",,,,,,,
24114,"Foolish man, it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again:",,,,,,,
24115,"And when you put it into the earth, you do not put in the body which it will be, but only the seed, of grain or some other sort of plant;",,,,,,,
24116,"But God gives it a body, as it is pleasing to him, and to every seed its special body.",,,,,,,
24117,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes.",,,,,,,
24118,"And there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth, but the glory of the one is different from that of the other.",,,,,,,
24119,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for the glory of one star is different from that of another.",,,,,,,
24120,So is it with the coming back from the dead. It is planted in death; it comes again in life:,,,,,,,
24121,"It is planted in shame; it comes again in glory: feeble when it is planted, it comes again in power:",,,,,,,
24122,"It is planted a natural body; it comes again as a body of the spirit. If there is a natural body, there is equally a body of the spirit.",,,,,,,
24123,"And so it is said, The first man Adam was a living soul. The last Adam is a life-giving spirit.",,,,,,,
24124,But that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit.,,,,,,,
24125,"The first man is from the earth, and of the earth: the second man is from heaven.",,,,,,,
24126,Those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth: and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven.,,,,,,,
24127,"And in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth, so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven.",,,,,,,
24128,"Now I say this, my brothers, that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God; and death may not have a part in life.",,,,,,,
24129,"See, I am giving you the revelation of a secret: we will not all come to the sleep of death, but we will all be changed.",,,,,,,
24130,"In a second, in the shutting of an eye, at the sound of the last horn: for at that sound the dead will come again, free for ever from the power of death, and we will be changed.",,,,,,,
24131,"For this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death, and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life.",,,,,,,
24132,"But when this has taken place, then that which was said in the Writings will come true, Death is overcome by life.",,,,,,,
24133,"O death, where is your power? O death, where are your pains?",,,,,,,
24134,The pain of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:,,,,,,,
24135,But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
24136,"For this cause, my dear brothers, be strong in purpose and unmoved, ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord, because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord.Now about the giving of money for the saints, as I gave orders to",the churches,of,a,ati,", so",do,ou.
24137,"On the first day of the week, let every one of you put by him in store, in measure as he has done well in business, so that it may not be necessary to get money together when I come.",,,,,,,
24138,"And when I come, I will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to Jerusalem.",,,,,,,
24139,"And if it is possible for me to go there, they will go with me.",,,,,,,
24140,"But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia, for that is my purpose;",,,,,,,
24141,"But I may be with you for a time, or even for the winter, so that you may see me on my way, wherever I go.",,,,,,,
24142,"For it is not my desire to see you now, on my way; because it is my hope to be with you for some time, if that is the Lord's pleasure.",,,,,,,
24143,But I will be at Ephesus till Pentecost;,,,,,,,
24144,"For a great and important door there is open to me, and there are a number of people against me.",,,,,,,
24145,"Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; because he is doing the Lord's work, even as I am:",,,,,,,
24146,"See then that he has the honour which is right. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me: for I am looking for him with the brothers.",,,,,,,
24147,"But as for Apollos, the brother, I had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not his pleasure to come now; but he will come when he has a chance.",,,,,,,
24148,"Be on the watch, unmoved in the faith, and be strong like men.",,,,,,,
24149,Let all you do be done in love.,,,,,,,
24150,"Now I make my request to you, my brothers, for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints,",,,,,,,
24151,"That you put yourselves under such, and under everyone who is helping the Lord's work.",,,,,,,
24152,And I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for they have done what was needed to make your work complete.,,,,,,,
24153,For they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours: for which cause give respect to such people.,,,,,,,
24154,"The churches of Asia send their love to you. So do Aquila and Prisca, with the church which is in their house.",,,,,,,
24155,All the brothers send their love to you. Give one another a holy kiss.,,,,,,,
24156,"I, Paul, send you these words of love in my writing.",,,,,,,
24157,"If any man has not love for the Lord, let him be cursed. Maran atha (our Lord comes).",,,,,,,
24158,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.,,,,,,,
24159,"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. So be it.Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:",,,,,,,
24160,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
24161,"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort;",,,,,,,
24162,"Who gives us comfort in all our troubles, so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.",,,,,,,
24163,"For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent, so through Christ does our comfort become greater.",,,,,,,
24164,"But if we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo:",,,,,,,
24165,"And our hope for you is certain; in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles, so you will take part in the comfort.",,,,,,,
24166,"For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia, that the weight of it was very great, more than our power, so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life:",,,,,,,
24167,"Yes, we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves, so that our hope might not be in ourselves, but in God who is able to give life to the dead:",,,,,,,
24168,Who gave us salvation from so great a death: on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation;,,,,,,,
24169,"You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us; so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons, praise may go up to God for us from all of them.",,,,,,,
24170,"For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God.",,,,,,,
24171,"For in our letters we say no other things to you, but those which you are reading, and to which you give agreement, and, it is my hope, will go on doing so to the end:",,,,,,,
24172,"Even as you have been ready, in part, to say that we are your glory, in the same way that you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.",,,,,,,
24173,"And being certain of this, it was my purpose to come to you before, so that you might have a second grace;",,,,,,,
24174,"And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia, and from there to come back again to you, so that you might send me on my way to Judaea.",,,,,,,
24175,"If then I had such a purpose, did I seem to be changing suddenly? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow?",,,,,,,
24176,"As God is true, our word to you is not Yes and No.",,,,,,,
24177,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we were preaching among you, even I and Silvanus and Timothy, was not Yes and No, but in him is Yes.",,,,,,,
24178,"For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us.",,,,,,,
24179,"Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God;",,,,,,,
24180,"And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory.",,,,,,,
24181,But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time.,,,,,,,
24182,"Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.But it was my decision for myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.",,,,,,,
24183,"For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me?",,,,,,,
24184,"And I said this very thing in my letter, for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy; being certain of this, that my joy is the joy of you all.",,,,,,,
24185,"For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you; not to give you sorrow, but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you.",,,,,,,
24186,"But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow, he has been so, not to me only, but in some measure to all of you (I say this that I may not be over-hard on you).",,,,,,,
24187,Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him;,,,,,,,
24188,"So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great.",,,,,,,
24189,For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts.,,,,,,,
24190,And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things.,,,,,,,
24191,"But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ;",,,,,,,
24192,So that Satan may not get the better of us: for we are not without knowledge of his designs.,,,,,,,
24193,"Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and there was an open door for me in the Lord,",,,,,,,
24194,"I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there: so I went away from them, and came into Macedonia.",,,,,,,
24195,"But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ, and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him.",,,,,,,
24196,For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction;,,,,,,,
24197,To the one it is a perfume of death to death; to the other a perfume of life to life. And who is enough for such things?,,,,,,,
24198,"For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ.Do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right? or have we need, as some have, of le",ters of appr,val,t,yo,or,rom,you?
24199,"You yourselves are our letter, whose writing is in our heart, open for every man's reading and knowledge;",,,,,,,
24200,"For you are clearly a letter of Christ, the fruit of our work, recorded not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in stone, but in hearts of flesh.",,,,,,,
24201,And this is the certain faith which we have in God through Christ:,,,,,,,
24202,Not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit; but our power comes from God;,,,,,,,
24203,"Who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter gives death, but the Spirit gives life.",,,,,,,
24204,"For if the operation of the law, giving death, recorded in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the eyes of the children of Israel had to be turned away from the face of Moses because of its glory, a glory which was only for a time:",,,,,,,
24205,Will not the operation of the Spirit have a much greater glory?,,,,,,,
24206,"For if the operation of the law, producing punishment, had its glory, how much greater will be the operation of the Spirit causing righteousness?",,,,,,,
24207,"For the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory, because of the greater glory of that which comes after.",,,,,,,
24208,"For if the order which was for a time had its glory, much more will the eternal order have its glory.",,,,,,,
24209,"Having then such a hope, we keep nothing back,",,,,,,,
24210,"And are not like Moses, who put a veil on his face, so that the children of Israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things:",,,,,,,
24211,But their minds were made hard: for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted; though it is taken away in Christ.,,,,,,,
24212,"But to this day, at the reading of the law of Moses, a veil is over their heart.",,,,,,,
24213,"But when it is turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away.",,,,,,,
24214,"Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there the heart is free.",,,,,,,
24215,"But we all, with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord who is the Spirit.For this reason, because we have been made servants of this new order, through th",mercy given,to,s,we,are,tro,g:
24216,"And we have given up the secret things of shame, not walking in false ways, and not making use of the word of God with deceit; but by the revelation of what is true, as before God, we have the approval of every man's sense of right and wrong.",,,,,,,
24217,"But if our good news is veiled, it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction:",,,,,,,
24218,"Because the god of this world has made blind the minds of those who have not faith, so that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not be shining on them.",,,,,,,
24219,"For our preaching is not about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants through Jesus.",,,,,,,
24220,"Seeing that it is God who said, Let light be shining out of the dark, who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
24221,"But we have this wealth in vessels of earth, so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from God;",,,,,,,
24222,"Troubles are round us on every side, but we are not shut in; things are hard for us, but we see a way out of them;",,,,,,,
24223,"We are cruelly attacked, but not without hope; we are made low, but we are not without help;",,,,,,,
24224,"In our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our bodies.",,,,,,,
24225,"For, while living, we are still being given up to death because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our flesh, though it is under the power of death.",,,,,,,
24226,"So then, death is working in us, but life in you.",,,,,,,
24227,"But having the same spirit of faith, as it is said in the Writings, The words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart; in the same way, our words are the outcome of our faith;",,,,,,,
24228,"Because we are certain that he who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead, will do the same for us, and will give us a place in his glory with you.",,,,,,,
24229,"For we go through all things on account of you, because the greater the number to whom the grace is given, the greater is the praise to the glory of God.",,,,,,,
24230,"For which cause we do not give way to weariness; but though our outer man is getting feebler, our inner man is made new day by day.",,,,,,,
24231,"For our present trouble, which is only for a short time, is working out for us a much greater weight of glory;",,,,,,,
24232,"While our minds are not on the things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are for a time; but the things which are not seen are eternal.For we are conscious that if this our tent of flesh is taken down, we",ave a buildi,g f,o,Go,", a",ous,not
24233,"For in this we are crying in weariness, greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven:",,,,,,,
24234,So that our spirits may not be unclothed.,,,,,,,
24235,"For truly, we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness, for the weight of care which is on us; not because we are desiring to be free from the body, but so that we may have our new body, and death may be overcome by life.",,,,,,,
24236,"Now he who has made us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a witness of what is to come.",,,,,,,
24237,"So, then, we are ever without fear, and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the Lord,",,,,,,,
24238,"(For we are walking by faith, not by seeing,)",,,,,,,
24239,"We are without fear, desiring to be free from the body, and to be with the Lord.",,,,,,,
24240,"For this reason we make it our purpose, in the body or away from it, to be well-pleasing to him.",,,,,,,
24241,"For we all have to come before Christ to be judged; so that every one of us may get his reward for the things done in the body, good or bad.",,,,,,,
24242,"Having in mind, then, the fear of the Lord, we put these things before men, but God sees our hearts; and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes.",,,,,,,
24243,"We are not again requesting your approval, but we are giving you the chance of taking pride in us, so that you may be able to give an answer to those whose glory is in seeming, and not in the heart.",,,,,,,
24244,"For if we are foolish, it is to God; or if we are serious, it is for you.",,,,,,,
24245,"For it is the love of Christ which is moving us; because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all, then all have undergone death;",,,,,,,
24246,"And that he underwent death for all, so that the living might no longer be living to themselves, but to him who underwent death for them and came back from the dead.",,,,,,,
24247,"For this reason, from this time forward we have knowledge of no man after the flesh: even if we have had knowledge of Christ after the flesh, we have no longer any such knowledge.",,,,,,,
24248,"So if any man is in Christ, he is in a new world: the old things have come to an end; they have truly become new.",,,,,,,
24249,"But all things are of God, who has made us at peace with himself through Christ, and has given to us the work of making peace;",,,,,,,
24250,"That is, that God was in Christ making peace between the world and himself, not putting their sins to their account, and having given to us the preaching of this news of peace.",,,,,,,
24251,"So we are the representatives of Christ, as if God was making a request to you through us: we make our request to you, in the name of Christ, be at peace with God.",,,,,,,
24252,"For him who had no knowledge of sin God made to be sin for us; so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.We then, working together with God, make our request to you not to take the grace of God to no purpose.",,,,,,,
24253,"(For he says, I have given ear to you at a good time, and I have been your helper in a day of salvation: see, now is the good time; now is the day of salvation):",,,,,,,
24254,"Giving no cause for trouble in anything, so that no one may be able to say anything against our work;",,,,,,,
24255,"But in everything making it clear that we are the servants of God, in quiet strength, in troubles, in need, in sorrow,",,,,,,,
24256,"In blows, in prisons, in attacks, in hard work, in watchings, in going without food;",,,,,,,
24257,"In a clean heart, in knowledge, in long waiting, in being kind, in the Holy Spirit, in true love,",,,,,,,
24258,"In the true word, in the power of God; with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,",,,,,,,
24259,"By glory and by shame, by an evil name and a good name; as untrue, and still true;",,,,,,,
24260,"Unnoted, but still kept fully in mind; as near to death, but still living; as undergoing punishment, but not put to death;",,,,,,,
24261,"As full of sorrow, but ever glad; as poor, but giving wealth to others; as having nothing, but still having all things.",,,,,,,
24262,"Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians, our heart is wide.",,,,,,,
24263,"It is not our feelings to you which are narrow, but yours to us.",,,,,,,
24264,"Now to give me back payment of the same sort (I am talking as to my children), let your hearts be wide open to me.",,,,,,,
24265,"Do not keep company with those who have not faith: for what is there in common between righteousness and evil, or between light and dark?",,,,,,,
24266,And what agreement is there between Christ and the Evil One? or what part has one who has faith with one who has not?,,,,,,,
24267,"And what agreement has the house of God with images? for we are a house of the living God; even as God has said, I will be living among them, and walking with them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.",,,,,,,
24268,"For which cause, Come out from among them, and be separate, says the Lord, and let no unclean thing come near you; and I will take you for myself,",,,,,,,
24269,"And will be a Father to you; and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord, the Ruler of all.Because God, then, will give us such rewards, dear brothers, let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit, and become completely holy in",he fear of G,d.,,,,,
24270,"Let your hearts be open to us: we have done no man wrong, no man has been damaged by us, we have made no profit out of any man,",,,,,,,
24271,It is not with the purpose of judging you that I say this: for I have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together.,,,,,,,
24272,"My words to you are without fear, I am full of pride on account of you: I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles.",,,,,,,
24273,"For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; there were fightings outside and fears inside.",,,,,,,
24274,But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus;,,,,,,,
24275,"And not by his coming only, but by the comfort which he had in you, while he gave us word of your desire, your sorrow, your care for me; so that I was still more glad.",,,,,,,
24276,"For though my letter gave you pain, I have no regret for it now, though I had before; for I see that the letter gave you pain, but only for a time.",,,,,,,
24277,"Now I am glad, not that you had sorrow, but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart; for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything.",,,,,,,
24278,"For the sorrow which God gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart, in which there is no reason for grief: but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death.",,,,,,,
24279,"For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God, what clearing of yourselves, what wrath against sin, what fear, what desire, what serious purpose, what punishment. In everything you have made it clear that you are free",rom sin in t,is,u,ine,s.,,
24280,"So though I sent you a letter, it was not only because of the man who did the wrong, or because of him to whom the wrong was done, but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God.",,,,,,,
24281,"So we have been comforted: and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, for his spirit had been made glad by you all.",,,,,,,
24282,"For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you; but as we said nothing to you but what was true, so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true.",,,,,,,
24283,"And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all, how you gave way to his authority, and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour.",,,,,,,
24284,"It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way.And now we give you news, brothers, about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia;",,,,,,,
24285,"How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble, and were in the greatest need, they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others.",,,,,,,
24286,"For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts,",,,,,,,
24287,Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints:,,,,,,,
24288,"And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God.",,,,,,,
24289,"So that we made a request to Titus that, as he had made a start before, so he might make this grace complete in you.",,,,,,,
24290,"And that as you are full of every good thing, of faith, of the word, of knowledge, of a ready mind, and of love to us, so you may be full of this grace in the same way.",,,,,,,
24291,"I am not giving you an order, but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love.",,,,,,,
24292,"For you see the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how though he had wealth, he became poor on your account, so that through his need you might have wealth.",,,,,,,
24293,"And in this I give my opinion: for it is to your profit, who were the first to make a start a year before, not only to do this, but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it.",,,,,,,
24294,"Then make the doing of it complete; so that as you had a ready mind, you may give effect to it as you are able.",,,,,,,
24295,"For if there is a ready mind, a man will have God's approval in the measure of what he has, and not of what he has not.",,,,,,,
24296,"And I am not saying this so that others may get off free, while the weight comes on you:",,,,,,,
24297,"But so that things may be equal; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped, and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way, making things equal.",,,,,,,
24298,"As it says in the Writings, He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough.",,,,,,,
24299,"But praise be to God, who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus.",,,,,,,
24300,"For while he gladly gave ear to our request, he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart.",,,,,,,
24301,And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches;,,,,,,,
24302,"And not only so, but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready:",,,,,,,
24303,And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands:,,,,,,,
24304,"For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval, not only of the Lord, but of men.",,,,,,,
24305,"And we have sent with them our brother, whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number, but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you.",,,,,,,
24306,"If any question comes up about Titus, he is my brother-worker, working with me for you; or about the others, they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ.",,,,,,,
24307,"Make clear then to them, as representatives of the churches, the quality of your love, and that the things which we have said about you are true.But there is no need for me to say anything in my letter about the giving to the saints:",,,,,,,
24308,"For I have before made clear to those of Macedonia my pride in your ready mind, saying to them that Achaia has been ready for a year back; and a great number have been moved to do the same by your example.",,,,,,,
24309,"But I have sent the brothers, so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true, and that, as I said, you may be ready:",,,,,,,
24310,"For fear that, if any from Macedonia come with me, and you are not ready, we (not to say, you) might be put to shame in this thing.",,,,,,,
24311,"So it seemed to me wise for the brothers to go before, and see that the amount which you had undertaken to give was ready, so that it might be a cause for praise, and not as if we were making profit out of you.",,,,,,,
24312,"But in the Writings it says, He who puts in only a small number of seeds, will get in the same; and he who puts them in from a full hand, will have produce in full measure from them.",,,,,,,
24313,"Let every man do after the purpose of his heart; not giving with grief, or by force: for God takes pleasure in a ready giver.",,,,,,,
24314,"And God is able to give you all grace in full measure; so that ever having enough of all things, you may be full of every good work:",,,,,,,
24315,"As it is said in the Writings, He has sent out far and wide, he has given to the poor; his righteousness is for ever.",,,,,,,
24316,"And he who gives seed for putting into the field and bread for food, will take care of the growth of your seed, at the same time increasing the fruits of your righteousness;",,,,,,,
24317,"Your wealth being increased in everything, with a simple mind, causing praise to God through us.",,,,,,,
24318,"For this work of giving not only takes care of the needs of the saints, but is the cause of much praise to God;",,,,,,,
24319,"For when, through this work of giving, they see what you are, they give glory to God for the way in which you have given yourselves to the good news of Christ, and for the wealth of your giving to them and to all;",,,,,,,
24320,"While their hearts go out to you in love and in prayer for you, because of the great grace of God which is in you.",,,,,,,
24321,"Praise be to God for what he has given, which words have no power to say.Now I, Paul, myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of Christ, I who am poor in spirit when with you, but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when I",am away from,you,,,,,
24322,"Yes, I make my request to you, so that when I am with you I may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh.",,,,,,,
24323,"For though we may be living in the flesh, we are not fighting after the way of the flesh",,,,,,,
24324,"(For the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh, but are strong before God for the destruction of high places);",,,,,,,
24325,"Putting an end to reasonings, and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of God, and causing every thought to come under the authority of Christ;",,,,,,,
24326,"Being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority, after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control.",,,,,,,
24327,"Give attention to the things which are before you. If any man seems to himself to be Christ's, let him keep in mind that we are as much Christ's as he is.",,,,,,,
24328,"For though I might take pride in our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for your destruction), it will not be a cause of shame to me:",,,,,,,
24329,That I may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters.,,,,,,,
24330,"For his letters, they say, have weight and are strong; but in body he is feeble, and his way of talking has little force.",,,,,,,
24331,"Let those who say this keep in mind that, what we are in word by letters when we are away, so will we be in act when we are present.",,,,,,,
24332,"For we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves: but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and making comparison of themselves with themselves, are not wise.",,,,,,,
24333,"We will not give glory to ourselves in over- great measure, but after the measure of the rule which God has given us, a measure which comes even to you.",,,,,,,
24334,"For we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are, as if our authority did not come as far as to you: for we came even as far as you with the good news of Christ:",,,,,,,
24335,"Not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business, that is, for the work of others; but having hope that, with the growth of your faith, we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work,",,,,,,,
24336,"So that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are, and not take credit for another man's work in making things ready to our hand.",,,,,,,
24337,"But whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord.",,,,,,,
24338,"For the Lord's approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself, but on the Lord's opinion of him.Put up with me if I am a little foolish: but, truly, you do put up with me.",,,,,,,
24339,"For I have a very great care for you: because you have been married by me to one husband, and it is my desire to give you completely holy to Christ.",,,,,,,
24340,"But I have a fear, that in some way, as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake, your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ.",,,,,,,
24341,"For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are, or if you have got a different spirit, or a different sort of good news from those which came to you, how well you put up with these things.",,,,,,,
24342,"For in my opinion, I am in no way less than the most important of the Apostles.",,,,,,,
24343,"But though I am rough in my way of talking, I am not so in knowledge, as we have made clear to all by our acts among you.",,,,,,,
24344,"Or did I do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up, because I gave you the good news of God without reward?",,,,,,,
24345,"I took money from other churches as payment for my work, so that I might be your servant;",,,,,,,
24346,"And when I was present with you, and was in need, I let no man be responsible for me; for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, gave me whatever was needed; and in everything I kept myself from being a trouble to you, and I will go on doing so.",,,,,,,
24347,"As the true word of Christ is in me, I will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of Achaia.",,,,,,,
24348,Why? because I have no love for you? let God be judge.,,,,,,,
24349,"But what I do, that I will go on doing, so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one; so that, in the cause of their pride, they may be seen to be the same as we are.",,,,,,,
24350,"For such men are false Apostles, workers of deceit, making themselves seem like Apostles of Christ.",,,,,,,
24351,And it is no wonder; for even Satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light.,,,,,,,
24352,So it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness; whose end will be the reward of their works.,,,,,,,
24353,"I say again, Let me not seem foolish to anyone; but if I do, put up with me as such, so that I may take a little glory to myself.",,,,,,,
24354,"What I am now saying is not by the order of the Lord, but as a foolish person, taking credit to myself, as it seems.",,,,,,,
24355,"Seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh, I will do the same.",,,,,,,
24356,"For you put up with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves.",,,,,,,
24357,"You put up with a man if he makes servants of you, if he makes profit out of you, if he makes you prisoners, if he puts himself in a high place, if he gives you blows on the face.",,,,,,,
24358,"I say this by way of shaming ourselves, as if we had been feeble. But if anyone puts himself forward (I am talking like a foolish person), I will do the same.",,,,,,,
24359,Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they of Israel? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.,,,,,,,
24360,"Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking foolishly) I am more so; I have had more experience of hard work, of prisons, of blows more than measure, of death.",,,,,,,
24361,Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one.,,,,,,,
24362,"Three times I was whipped with rods, once I was stoned, three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea, a night and a day I have been in the water;",,,,,,,
24363,"In frequent travels, in dangers on rivers, in dangers from outlaws, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the town, in dangers in the waste land, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers;",,,,,,,
24364,"In hard work and weariness, in frequent watchings, going without food and drink, cold and in need of clothing.",,,,,,,
24365,"In addition to all the other things, there is that which comes on me every day, the care of all the churches.",,,,,,,
24366,"Who is feeble and I am not feeble? who is in danger of falling, and I am not angry?",,,,,,,
24367,"If I have to take credit to myself, I will do so in the things in which I am feeble.",,,,,,,
24368,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be praise for ever, is witness that the things which I say are true.",,,,,,,
24369,"In Damascus, the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus, in order to take me:",,,,,,,
24370,"And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window, I got free from his hands.As it is necessary for me to take glory to myself, though it is not a good thing, I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.",,,,,,,
24371,"I have knowledge of a man in Christ, fourteen years back (if he was in the body, or out of the body, I am not able to say, but God only), who was taken up to the third heaven.",,,,,,,
24372,"And I have knowledge of such a man (if he was in the body, or out of the body, I am not able to say, but God only),",,,,,,,
24373,"How he was taken up into Paradise, and words came to his ears which may not be said, and which man is not able to say.",,,,,,,
24374,"On account of such a one I will have glory: for myself I will take no glory, but only in my feeble body.",,,,,,,
24375,"For if I had a desire to take credit to myself, it would not be foolish, for I would be saying what is true: but I will not, for fear that I might seem to any man more than he sees me to be, or has word from me that I am.",,,,,,,
24376,"And because the revelations were so very great, in order that I might not be overmuch lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, one sent from Satan to give me pain.",,,,,,,
24377,And about this thing I made request to the Lord three times that it might be taken away from me.,,,,,,,
24378,"And he said to me, My grace is enough for you, for my power is made complete in what is feeble. Most gladly, then, will I take pride in my feeble body, so that the power of Christ may be on me.",,,,,,,
24379,"So I take pleasure in being feeble, in unkind words, in needs, in cruel attacks, in troubles, on account of Christ: for when I am feeble, then am I strong.",,,,,,,
24380,"I have been forced by you to become foolish, though it was right for my praise to have come from you: for in no way was I less than the chief of the Apostles, though I am nothing.",,,,,,,
24381,"Truly the signs of an Apostle were done among you in quiet strength, with wonders and acts of power.",,,,,,,
24382,"For what is there in which you were made less than the other churches, but in the one thing that I was not a trouble to you? Let me have forgiveness for this wrong.",,,,,,,
24383,"This is now the third time that I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a trouble to you: my desire is for you, not for your property: for it is not the children's business to make store for their fathers, but the fathers for the children.",,,,,,,
24384,"And I will gladly give all I have for your souls. If I have the more love for you, am I to be loved the less?",,,,,,,
24385,"But let it be so, that I was not a trouble to you myself; but (someone may say) being false, I took you with deceit.",,,,,,,
24386,Did I make a profit out of you by any of those whom I sent to you?,,,,,,,
24387,"I gave orders to Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus make any profit out of you? were we not guided by the same Spirit, in the same ways?",,,,,,,
24388,"It may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right; but we are saying these things before God in Christ. For all things, dear brothers, are for your profit.",,,,,,,
24389,"For I have a fear that, when I come, you may not be answering to my desire, and that I may not be answering to yours; that there may be fighting, hate, angry feeling, divisions, evil talk about others, secrets, thoughts of pride, outbursts against author",ty;,,,,,,
24390,"And that when I come again, my God may put me to shame among you, and I may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways, and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way.This is the thir",time that I,am,o,ing,to y,u.,rom t
24391,"I said before, and still say it before I come, as being present for the second time, though I am still away from you, to those who have done wrong before, and to all the others, that if I come again I will not have pity;",,,,,,,
24392,"Seeing that you are looking for a sign of Christ giving out his word in me; who is not feeble in relation to you, but is strong in you:",,,,,,,
24393,"For he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross, but he is living by the power of God. And we are feeble in him, but we will be living with him through the power of God in relation to you.",,,,,,,
24394,"Make a test of yourselves, if you are in the faith; make certain of yourselves. Or are you not conscious in yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, if you are truly Christ's?",,,,,,,
24395,But it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly Christ's.,,,,,,,
24396,"Now our prayer to God is that you may do no evil; not in order that it may be put to our credit, but so that you may do what is right, whatever we may seem.",,,,,,,
24397,"Because we are able to do nothing against what is true, but only for it.",,,,,,,
24398,"For we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong: and this is our prayer, even that you may be made complete.",,,,,,,
24399,"For this cause I am writing these things while I am away, so that there may be need for me, when I am present, to make use of sharp measures, by the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for destruction.",,,,,,,
24400,"Let this be my last word, brothers; be glad; be complete; be comforted; be of the same mind; be at peace with one another: and the God of love and peace will be with you.",,,,,,,
24401,Give one another a holy kiss.,,,,,,,
24402,All the saints send their love to you.,,,,,,,
24403,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the harmony of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead),",,,,,,,
24404,"And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:",,,,,,,
24405,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,",,,,,,,
24406,"Who gave himself for our sins, so that he might make us free from this present evil world, after the purpose of our God and Father:",,,,,,,
24407,To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it.,,,,,,,
24408,"I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort;",,,,,,,
24409,"Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ.",,,,,,,
24410,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him.",,,,,,,
24411,"As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him.",,,,,,,
24412,"Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.",,,,,,,
24413,"Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's.",,,,,,,
24414,"For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
24415,"For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it:",,,,,,,
24416,"And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers.",,,,,,,
24417,"But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace,",,,,,,,
24418,"To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood,",,,,,,,
24419,"And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus.",,,,,,,
24420,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days.",,,,,,,
24421,"But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother.",,,,,,,
24422,Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true.,,,,,,,
24423,Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia.,,,,,,,
24424,And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person:,,,,,,,
24425,Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him;,,,,,,,
24426,"And they gave glory to God in me.Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me.",,,,,,,
24427,"And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect.",,,,,,,
24428,"But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision:",,,,,,,
24429,"And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us;",,,,,,,
24430,To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you.,,,,,,,
24431,But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man's person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me;,,,,,,,
24432,"But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision",,,,,,,
24433,(Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles);,,,,,,,
24434,"When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;",,,,,,,
24435,Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do.,,,,,,,
24436,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.",,,,,,,
24437,"For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision.",,,,,,,
24438,"And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways.",,,,,,,
24439,"But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same a",the Jews?,,,,,,
24440,"We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",,,,,,,
24441,"Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works o",the law wil,no,f,esh,get,igh,eousn
24442,"But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way!",,,,,,,
24443,"For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer.",,,,,,,
24444,"For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God.",,,,,,,
24445,"I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me.",,,,,,,
24446,"I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing.O foolish Galatians, by what strange powers have you been tricked, to whom it was made clear that Jesus Christ was put to d",ath on the c,oss,,,,,
24447,"Give me an answer to this one question, Did the Spirit come to you through the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",,,,,,,
24448,"Are you so foolish? having made a start in the Spirit, will you now be made complete in the flesh?",,,,,,,
24449,Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose? if it is in fact to no purpose.,,,,,,,
24450,"He who gives you the Spirit, and does works of power among you, is it by the works of law, or by the hearing of faith?",,,,,,,
24451,"Even as Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.",,,,,,,
24452,"Be certain, then, that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.",,,,,,,
24453,"And the holy Writings, seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith, gave the good news before to Abraham, saying, In you will all the nations have a blessing.",,,,,,,
24454,So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith.,,,,,,,
24455,"For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse: because it is said in the Writings, A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law.",,,,,,,
24456,"Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God, is clear; because, The upright will be living by faith.",,,,,,,
24457,"And the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will have life by them.",,,,,,,
24458,"Christ has made us free from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: because it is said in the Writings, A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree:",,,,,,,
24459,So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give.,,,,,,,
24460,"Brothers, as men would say, even a man's agreement, when it has been made certain, may not be put on one side, or have additions made to it.",,,,,,,
24461,"Now to Abraham were the undertakings given, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as of a great number; but as of one, he says, And to your seed, which is Christ.",,,,,,,
24462,"Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect.",,,,,,,
24463,"Because if the heritage is by the law, it is no longer dependent on the word of God; but God gave it to Abraham by his word.",,,,,,,
24464,"What then is the law? It was an addition made because of sin, till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between.",,,,,,,
24465,Now a go-between is not a go- between of one; but God is one.,,,,,,,
24466,"Is the law then against the words of God? in no way; because if there had been a law which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.",,,,,,,
24467,"However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith.",,,,,,,
24468,"But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come.",,,,,,,
24469,"So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith.",,,,,,,
24470,"But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant.",,,,,,,
24471,Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.,,,,,,,
24472,For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ.,,,,,,,
24473,"There is no Jew or Greek, servant or free, male or female: because you are all one in Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
24474,"And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and yours is the heritage by the right of God's undertaking given to Abraham.But I say that as long as the son is a child, he is in no way different from a servant, though he is lord of all;",,,,,,,
24475,But is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father.,,,,,,,
24476,"So we, when we were young, were kept under the first rules of the world;",,,,,,,
24477,"But when the time had come, God sent out his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,",,,,,,,
24478,"That he might make them free who were under the law, and that we might be given the place of sons.",,,,,,,
24479,"And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, saying, Abba, Father.",,,,,,,
24480,"So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours.",,,,,,,
24481,"But at that time, having no knowledge of God, you were servants to those who by right are no gods:",,,,,,,
24482,"But now that you have come to have knowledge of God, or more truly, God has knowledge of you, how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things, desiring to be servants to them again?",,,,,,,
24483,"You keep days, and months, and fixed times, and years.",,,,,,,
24484,"I am in fear of you, that I may have been working for you to no purpose.",,,,,,,
24485,"My desire for you, brothers, is that you may be as I am, because I am as you are. You have done me no wrong;",,,,,,,
24486,But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time;,,,,,,,
24487,"And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh, or put shame on it; but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",,,,,,,
24488,"Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me.",,,,,,,
24489,"So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words?",,,,,,,
24490,"Their interest in you is not good; but their desire is that you may be shut out, so that you may go after them.",,,,,,,
24491,"But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you.",,,,,,,
24492,"My children, of whom I am again in birth-pains till Christ is formed in you,",,,,,,,
24493,"Truly my desire is to be present with you now, using a changed voice; for I am troubled about you.",,,,,,,
24494,"Say, you whose desire it is to be under the law, do you not give ear to the law?",,,,,,,
24495,"Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant- woman, and one by the free woman.",,,,,,,
24496,Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God.,,,,,,,
24497,"Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar.",,,,,,,
24498,"Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children.",,,,,,,
24499,"But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother.",,,,,,,
24500,"For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband.",,,,,,,
24501,"Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God.",,,,,,,
24502,"But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit, even so it is now.",,,,,,,
24503,What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman.,,,,,,,
24504,"So, brothers, we are not children of the servant-woman, but of the free woman.Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again.",,,,,,,
24505,"See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you.",,,,,,,
24506,"Yes, I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision, that he will have to keep all the law.",,,,,,,
24507,"You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace.",,,,,,,
24508,For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.,,,,,,,
24509,"Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love.",,,,,,,
24510,You were going on well; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true?,,,,,,,
24511,This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his.,,,,,,,
24512,A little leaven makes a change in all the mass.,,,,,,,
24513,"I am certain about you in the Lord, that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment, whoever he is.",,,,,,,
24514,"But I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still attacked? then has the shame of the cross been taken away.",,,,,,,
24515,My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves.,,,,,,,
24516,"Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another.",,,,,,,
24517,"For all the law is made complete in one word, even in this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.",,,,,,,
24518,"But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another.",,,,,,,
24519,"But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh.",,,,,,,
24520,"For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; because these are opposite the one to the other; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do.",,,,,,,
24521,"But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",,,,,,,
24522,"Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses,",,,,,,,
24523,"Worship of images, use of strange powers, hates, fighting, desire for what another has, angry feelings, attempts to get the better of others, divisions, false teachings,",,,,,,,
24524,"Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God.",,,,,,,
24525,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kind acts, well-doing, faith,",,,,,,,
24526,"Gentle behaviour, control over desires: against such there is no law.",,,,,,,
24527,And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires.,,,,,,,
24528,"If we are living by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us be guided.",,,,,,,
24529,"Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another.Brothers, if a man is taken in any wrongdoing, you who are of the Spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love; keeping watch on yourself, for fear that you yo",rself may be,tes,e,.,,,
24530,"Take on yourselves one another's troubles, and so keep the law of Christ.",,,,,,,
24531,"For if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing, he is tricked by himself.",,,,,,,
24532,"But let every man make test of his work, and then will his cause for glory be in himself only, and not in his neighbour.",,,,,,,
24533,Because every man is responsible for his part of the work.,,,,,,,
24534,But let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher.,,,,,,,
24535,"Be not tricked; God is not made sport of: for whatever seed a man puts in, that will he get back as grain.",,,,,,,
24536,Because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death; but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will of the Spirit get the reward of eternal life.,,,,,,,
24537,"And let us not get tired of well-doing; for at the right time we will get in the grain, if we do not give way to weariness.",,,,,,,
24538,"So then, as we have the chance, let us do good to all men, and specially to those who are of the family of the faith.",,,,,,,
24539,See the size of the handwriting which I myself have made use of in writing to you.,,,,,,,
24540,"Those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh, put force on you to undergo circumcision; only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of Christ.",,,,,,,
24541,"Because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law; but they would have you undergo circumcision, so that they may have glory in your flesh.",,,,,,,
24542,"But far be it from me to have glory in anything, but only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me, and I for it.",,,,,,,
24543,"For having circumcision is nothing, and not having circumcision is nothing, but only a new order of existence.",,,,,,,
24544,"And on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy, and on the Israel of God.",,,,,,,
24545,From this time on let no man be a trouble to me; because my body is marked with the marks of Jesus.,,,,,,,
24546,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. So be it.Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the purpose of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and those who have faith in Christ Jesus:",,,,,,,
24547,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
24548,"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us every blessing of the Spirit in the heavens in Christ:",,,,,,,
24549,"Even as he made selection of us in him from the first, so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love:",,,,,,,
24550,"As we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself, through Jesus Christ, in the good pleasure of his purpose,",,,,,,,
24551,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely gave to us in the Loved One:",,,,,,,
24552,"In whom we have salvation through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, through the wealth of his grace,",,,,,,,
24553,Which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care;,,,,,,,
24554,"Having made clear to us the secret of his purpose, in agreement with the design which he had in mind, to put into his hands",,,,,,,
24555,"The ordering of the times when they are complete, so that all things might come to a head in Christ, the things in heaven and the things on the earth; in him, I say,",,,,,,,
24556,"In whom we have a heritage, being marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with his designs;",,,,,,,
24557,So that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in Christ:,,,,,,,
24558,"In whom you, having been given the true word, the good news of your salvation, and through your faith in him, were given the sign of the Holy Spirit of hope,",,,,,,,
24559,"Which is the first-fruit of our heritage, till God gets back that which is his, to the praise of his glory.",,,,,,,
24560,"For this cause I, having had news of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and which you make clear to all the saints,",,,,,,,
24561,"Give praise without end for you, keeping you in mind in my prayers;",,,,,,,
24562,"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;",,,,,,,
24563,"And that having the eyes of your heart full of light, you may have knowledge of what is the hope of his purpose, what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints,",,,,,,,
24564,"And how unlimited is his power to us who have faith, as is seen in the working of the strength of his power,",,,,,,,
24565,"By which he made Christ come back from the dead, and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven,",,,,,,,
24566,"Far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named, not only in the present order, but in that which is to come:",,,,,,,
24567,"And he has put all things under his feet, and has made him to be head over all things to the church,",,,,,,,
24568,"Which is his body, the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete.And to you did he give life, when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins,",,,,,,,
24569,"In which you were living in the past, after the ways of this present world, doing the pleasure of the lord of the power of the air, the spirit who is now working in those who go against the purpose of God;",,,,,,,
24570,"Among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh, giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and the punishment of God was waiting for us even as for the rest.",,,,,,,
24571,"But God, being full of mercy, through the great love which he had for us,",,,,,,,
24572,"Even when we were dead through our sins, gave us life together with Christ (by grace you have salvation),",,,,,,,
24573,"So that we came back from death with him, and are seated with him in the heavens, in Christ Jesus;",,,,,,,
24574,That in the time to come he might make clear the full wealth of his grace in his mercy to us in Christ Jesus:,,,,,,,
24575,Because by grace you have salvation through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is given by God:,,,,,,,
24576,"Not by works, so that no man may take glory to himself.",,,,,,,
24577,For by his act we were given existence in Christ Jesus to do those good works which God before made ready for us so that we might do them.,,,,,,,
24578,"For this reason keep it in mind that in the past you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are looked on as being outside the circumcision by those who have circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;",,,,,,,
24579,"That you were at that time without Christ, being cut off from any part in Israel's rights as a nation, having no part in God's agreement, having no hope, and without God in the world.",,,,,,,
24580,But now in Christ Jesus you who at one time were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.,,,,,,,
24581,"For he is our peace, who has made the two into one, and by whom the middle wall of division has been broken down,",,,,,,,
24582,"Having in his flesh put an end to that which made the division between us, even the law with its rules and orders, so that he might make in himself, of the two, one new man, so making peace;",,,,,,,
24583,"And that the two might come into agreement with God in one body through the cross, so putting an end to that division.",,,,,,,
24584,"And he came preaching peace to you who were far off, and to those who were near;",,,,,,,
24585,Because through him the two of us are able to come near in one Spirit to the Father.,,,,,,,
24586,"So then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of God, but you are numbered among the saints, and of the family of God,",,,,,,,
24587,"Resting on the base of the Apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief keystone,",,,,,,,
24588,"In whom all the building, rightly joined together, comes to be a holy house of God in the Lord;",,,,,,,
24589,"In whom you, with the rest, are united together as a living-place of God in the Spirit.For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles,",,,,,,,
24590,"If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge, which was given to me for you,",,,,,,,
24591,"How by revelation the secret was made clear to me, as I said before in a short letter,",,,,,,,
24592,By the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of Christ;,,,,,,,
24593,"Which in other generations was not given to the sons of men, but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit;",,,,,,,
24594,"Which is that the Gentiles have a part in the heritage, and in the same body, and in the same hope in Christ through the good news,",,,,,,,
24595,"Of which I was made a preacher, through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power.",,,,,,,
24596,"To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, was this grace given, so that I might make clear to the Gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of Christ:",,,,,,,
24597,And make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in God who made all things;,,,,,,,
24598,"So that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide-shining wisdom of God,",,,,,,,
24599,Which is seen in his eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord:,,,,,,,
24600,By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him.,,,,,,,
24601,"For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you, which are your glory.",,,,,,,
24602,"For this cause I go down on my knees before the Father,",,,,,,,
24603,"From whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,",,,,,,,
24604,That in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his Spirit in your hearts;,,,,,,,
24605,"So that Christ may have his place in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and based in love,",,,,,,,
24606,"May have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is,",,,,,,,
24607,"And to have knowledge of the love of Christ which is outside all knowledge, so that you may be made complete as God himself is complete.",,,,,,,
24608,"Now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts, through the power which is working in us,",,,,,,,
24609,"To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever. So be it.I then, the prisoner in the Lord, make this request from my heart, that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which God's purpose",as given you,,,,,,
24610,"With all gentle and quiet behaviour, taking whatever comes, putting up with one another in love;",,,,,,,
24611,Taking care to keep the harmony of the Spirit in the yoke of peace.,,,,,,,
24612,"There is one body and one Spirit, even as you have been marked out by God in the one hope of his purpose for you;",,,,,,,
24613,"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,",,,,,,,
24614,"One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.",,,,,,,
24615,But to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of Christ.,,,,,,,
24616,"For this reason he says, He went up on high, taking his prisoners with him, and gave freely to men.",,,,,,,
24617,"(Now this, He went up, what is it but that he first went down into the lower parts of the earth?",,,,,,,
24618,He who went down is the same who went up far over all the heavens so that he might make all things complete.),,,,,,,
24619,"And he gave some as Apostles, and some, prophets; and some, preachers of the good news; and some to give care and teaching;",,,,,,,
24620,"For the training of the saints as servants in the church, for the building up of the body of Christ:",,,,,,,
24621,"Till we all come to the harmony of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to full growth, to the full measure of Christ:",,,,,,,
24622,"So that we may be no longer children, sent this way and that, turned about by every wind of teaching, by the twisting and tricks of men, by the deceits of error;",,,,,,,
24623,"But saying true words in love, may come to full growth in him, who is the head, even Christ;",,,,,,,
24624,"Through whom all the body, being rightly formed and united together, by the full working of every part, is increased to the building up of itself in love.",,,,,,,
24625,"This I say, then, and give witness in the Lord, that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit,",,,,,,,
24626,"Whose thoughts are dark, to whom the life of God is strange because they are without knowledge, and their hearts have been made hard;",,,,,,,
24627,"Who having no more power of feeling, have given themselves up to evil passions, to do all unclean things with overmuch desire.",,,,,,,
24628,For this was not the teaching of Christ which was given to you;,,,,,,,
24629,"If in fact you gave ear to him, and were given teaching in him, even as what is true is made clear in Jesus:",,,,,,,
24630,"That you are to put away, in relation to your earlier way of life, the old man, which has become evil by love of deceit;",,,,,,,
24631,"And be made new in the spirit of your mind,",,,,,,,
24632,"And put on the new man, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way of living.",,,,,,,
24633,"And so, putting away false words, let everyone say what is true to his neighbour: for we are parts one of another.",,,,,,,
24634,Be angry without doing wrong; let not the sun go down on your wrath;,,,,,,,
24635,And do not give way to the Evil One.,,,,,,,
24636,"Let him who was a thief be so no longer, but let him do good work with his hands, so that he may have something to give to him who is in need.",,,,,,,
24637,"Let no evil talk come out of your mouth, but only what is good for giving necessary teaching, and for grace to those who give ear.",,,,,,,
24638,"And do not give grief to the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were marked for the day of salvation.",,,,,,,
24639,"Let all bitter, sharp and angry feeling, and noise, and evil words, be put away from you, with all unkind acts;",,,,,,,
24640,"And be kind to one another, full of pity, having forgiveness for one another, even as God in Christ had forgiveness for you.Let it then be your desire to be like God, as well-loved children;",,,,,,,
24641,"And be living in love, even as Christ had love for you, and gave himself up for us, an offering to God for a perfume of a sweet smell.",,,,,,,
24642,"But evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things, or desire for others' property, let it not even be named among you, as is right for saints;",,,,,,,
24643,"And let there be no low behaviour, or foolish talk, or words said in sport, which are not right, but in place of them the giving of praise.",,,,,,,
24644,"Being certain of this, that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh, no unclean person, or one who has desire for the property of others, or who gives worship to images, has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and God.",,,,,,,
24645,Do not be turned from the right way by foolish words; for because of these things the punishment of God comes on those who do not put themselves under him.,,,,,,,
24646,Have no part with such men;,,,,,,,
24647,"For you at one time were dark, but now are light in the Lord: let your behaviour be that of children of light",,,,,,,
24648,"(Because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true),",,,,,,,
24649,Testing by experience what is well-pleasing to the Lord;,,,,,,,
24650,"And have no company with the works of the dark, which give no fruit, but make their true quality clear;",,,,,,,
24651,For the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words.,,,,,,,
24652,"But all things, when their true quality is seen, are made clear by the light: because everything which is made clear is light.",,,,,,,
24653,"For this reason he says, Be awake, you who are sleeping, and come up from among the dead, and Christ will be your light.",,,,,,,
24654,"Take care then how you are living, not as unwise, but as wise;",,,,,,,
24655,"Making good use of the time, because the days are evil.",,,,,,,
24656,"For this reason, then, do not be foolish, but be conscious of the Lord's pleasure.",,,,,,,
24657,"And do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome, but be full of the Spirit;",,,,,,,
24658,"Joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the Spirit, using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the Lord;",,,,,,,
24659,"Giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;",,,,,,,
24660,Letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of Christ.,,,,,,,
24661,"Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as of the Lord.",,,,,,,
24662,"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.",,,,,,,
24663,"And as the church is under Christ's authority, so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things.",,,,,,,
24664,"Husbands, have love for your wives, even as Christ had love for the church, and gave himself for it;",,,,,,,
24665,"So that he might make it holy, having made it clean with the washing of water by the word,",,,,,,,
24666,"And might take it for himself, a church full of glory, not having one mark or fold or any such thing; but that it might be holy and complete.",,,,,,,
24667,Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies. He who has love for his wife has love for himself:,,,,,,,
24668,"For no man ever had hate for his flesh; but he gives it food and takes care of it, even as Christ does for the church;",,,,,,,
24669,Because we are parts of his body.,,,,,,,
24670,"For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.",,,,,,,
24671,This is a great secret: but my words are about Christ and the church.,,,,,,,

24890,"Because our good news came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit, so that you were completely certain of it; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you.",,,,,,,
24891,"And you took us and the Lord as your example, after the word had come to you in much trouble, with joy in the Holy Spirit;",,,,,,,
24892,So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia.,,,,,,,
24893,"For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God is made clear; so that we have no need to say anything.",,,,,,,
24894,"For they themselves give the news of how we came among you; and how you were turned from images to God, to the worship of a true and living God,",,,,,,,
24895,"Waiting for his Son from heaven, who came back from the dead, even Jesus, our Saviour from the wrath to come.For you yourselves, brothers, are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect:",,,,,,,
24896,"But after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw, at Philippi, by the help of God we gave you the good news without fear, though everything was against us.",,,,,,,
24897,For our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit:,,,,,,,
24898,"But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God, so we give it out; not as pleasing men, but God by whom our hearts are tested.",,,,,,,
24899,"For it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth- sounding false words, and God is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves,",,,,,,,
24900,"Or looking for glory from men, from you or from others, when we might have made ourselves a care to you as Apostles of Christ.",,,,,,,

24904,"You are witnesses, with God, how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith;",,,,,,,
24905,"Even as you saw how, like a father with his children, we were teaching and comforting you all, and giving witness,",,,,,,,
24906,"So that your lives might be pleasing to God, who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory.",,,,,,,
24907,"And for this cause we still give praise to God, that, when the word came to your ears through us, you took it, not as the word of man, but, as it truly is, the word of God, which has living power in you who have faith.",,,,,,,

24915,"We sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ, to give you strength and comfort in your faith;",,,,,,,
24916,So that no man might be moved by these troubles; because you see that these things are part of God's purpose for us.,,,,,,,
24917,"And when we were with you, we said to you that trouble was before us; and so it came about, as you see.",,,,,,,
24918,"For this reason, when I was no longer able to keep quiet, I sent to get news of your faith, fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing.",,,,,,,
24919,"But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has given us good news of your faith and love, and that you have happy memories of us, desiring greatly to see us, even as we do to see you;",,,,,,,
24920,"For this cause, brothers, in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith;",,,,,,,
24921,For it is life to us if you keep your faith in the Lord unchanged.,,,,,,,
24922,"For how great is the praise which we give to God for you, and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our God;",,,,,,,
24923,Night and day requesting God again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete.,,,,,,,
24924,Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you;,,,,,,,

24926,"So that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.And last of all, the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the Lord Jesus, is this: that as we",ade clear to,you,w,at,ort,f b,havio

24928,"For the purpose of God for you is this: that you may be holy, and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh;",,,,,,,
24929,So that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour;,,,,,,,
24930,"Not in the passion of evil desires, like the Gentiles, who have no knowledge of God;",,,,,,,
24931,"And that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business: for the Lord is the judge in all these things, as we said to you before and gave witness.",,,,,,,
24932,Because it is God's purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy.,,,,,,,
24933,"Whoever, then, goes against this word, goes against not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.",,,,,,,
24934,"But about loving the brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter: for you have the teaching of God that love for one another is right and necessary;",,,,,,,
24935,"And, truly, you are lovers of all the brothers in Macedonia; but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more;",,,,,,,
24936,"And that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business, working with your hands as we gave you orders;",,,,,,,
24937,"That you may be respected by those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.",,,,,,,
24938,"But it is our desire, brothers, that you may be certain about those who are sleeping; so that you may have no need for sorrow, as others have who are without hope.",,,,,,,
24939,"For if we have faith that Jesus underwent death and came back again, even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by God's power.",,,,,,,
24940,"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are still living at the coming of the Lord, will not go before those who are sleeping.",,,,,,,
24941,"Because the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority, with the voice of the chief angel, with the sound of a horn: and the dead in Christ will come to life first;",,,,,,,
24942,Then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the Lord in the air: and so will we be for ever with the Lord.,,,,,,,
24943,"So then, give comfort to one another with these words.But about the times and their order, my brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you.",,,,,,,
24944,For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.,,,,,,,
24945,"When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it.",,,,,,,
24946,"But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief:",,,,,,,
24947,For you are all sons of light and of the day: we are not of the night or of the dark.,,,,,,,
24948,"So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self- controlled and awake.",,,,,,,
24949,For those who are sleeping do so in the night; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night;,,,,,,,
24950,"But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation.",,,,,,,
24951,"For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,",,,,,,,
24952,"Who was put to death for us, so that, awake or sleeping, we may have a part in his life.",,,,,,,
24953,"So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing.",,,,,,,
24954,"But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you;",,,,,,,
24955,And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.,,,,,,,
24956,"And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all.",,,,,,,
24957,"Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all.",,,,,,,
24958,Have joy at all times.,,,,,,,
24959,Keep on with your prayers.,,,,,,,
24960,In everything give praise: for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you.,,,,,,,
24961,Do not put out the light of the Spirit;,,,,,,,
24962,Do not make little of the words of the prophets;,,,,,,,
24963,Let all things be tested; keep to what is good;,,,,,,,
24964,Keep from every form of evil.,,,,,,,
24965,And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
24966,"God, by whom you have been marked out in his purpose, is unchanging and will make it complete.",,,,,,,
24967,"Brothers, keep us in mind in your prayers.",,,,,,,
24968,Give all the brothers a holy kiss.,,,,,,,
24969,I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter.,,,,,,,
24970,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:",,,,,,,
24971,Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,,,,,,,
24972,"It is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you, brothers, because of the great increase of your faith, and the wealth of your love for one another;",,,,,,,
24973,So that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of God for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through;,,,,,,,
24974,"Which is a clear sign of the decision which God in his righteousness has made; to give you a part in his kingdom, for which you have undergone this pain;",,,,,,,
24975,"For it is an act of righteousness on God's part to give trouble as their reward to those who are troubling you,",,,,,,,
24976,"And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with the angels of his power in flames of fire,",,,,,,,
24977,"To give punishment to those who have no knowledge of God, and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our Lord Jesus:",,,,,,,
24978,"Whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his strength,",,,,,,,
24979,"At his coming, when he will have glory in his saints, and will be a cause of wonder in all those who had faith (because our witness among you had effect) in that day.",,,,,,,
24980,"For this reason, you are ever in our prayers, that you may seem to our God such as may have a part in his purpose and that by his power he will make all his good purpose, and the work of faith, complete;",,,,,,,
24981,"So that glory may be given to the name of our Lord Jesus through you, and you may have glory in him, by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.Now as to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and our meeting with him, it is our desire, my brothers,",,,,,,,
24982,"That you may not be moved in mind or troubled by a spirit, or by a word, or by a letter as from us, with the suggestion that the day of the Lord is even now come;",,,,,,,
24983,"Give no belief to false words: because there will first be a falling away from the faith, and the revelation of the man of sin, the son of destruction,",,,,,,,
24984,"Who puts himself against all authority, lifting himself up over all which is named God or is given worship; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God, putting himself forward as God.",,,,,,,
24985,"Have you no memory of what I said when I was with you, giving you word of these things?",,,,,,,
24986,And now it is clear to you what is keeping back his revelation till the time comes for him to be seen.,,,,,,,
24987,For the secret of evil is even now at work: but there is one who is keeping back the evil till he is taken out of the way.,,,,,,,
24988,"And then will come the revelation of that evil one, whom the Lord Jesus will put to death with the breath of his mouth, and give to destruction by the revelation of his coming;",,,,,,,
24989,"Even the one whose coming is marked by the working of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,",,,,,,,
24990,And with every deceit of wrongdoing among those whose fate is destruction; because they were quite without that love of the true faith by which they might have salvation.,,,,,,,
24991,"And for this cause, God will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false:",,,,,,,
24992,"So that they all may be judged, who had no faith in what is true, but took pleasure in evil.",,,,,,,
24993,"But it is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you, brothers, loved by the Lord, because it was the purpose of God from the first that you might have salvation, being made holy by the Spirit and by faith in what is true:",,,,,,,
24994,"And in this purpose he gave you a part through the good news of which we were the preachers, even that you might have part in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.",,,,,,,
24995,"So then, brothers, be strong in purpose, and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us.",,,,,,,
24996,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,",,,,,,,
24997,"Give you comfort and strength in every good work and word.For the rest, my brothers, let there be prayer for us that the word of the Lord may go forward with increasing glory, even as it does with you;",,,,,,,
24998,And that we may be made free from foolish and evil men; for not all have faith.,,,,,,,
24999,"But the Lord is true, who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil.",,,,,,,
25000,"And we have faith in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders.",,,,,,,
25001,And may your hearts be guided by the Lord into the love of God and quiet waiting for Christ.,,,,,,,
25002,"Now we give you orders, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us.",,,,,,,
25003,"For you yourselves are used to taking us as your example, because our life among you was ruled by order,",,,,,,,
25004,"And we did not take food from any man for nothing, but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you:",,,,,,,
25005,"Not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, so that you might do the same.",,,,,,,
25006,"For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, If any man does no work, let him not have food.",,,,,,,
25007,"For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled, who do no work at all, but are over-interested in the business of others.",,,,,,,
25008,"Now to such we give orders and make request in the Lord Jesus, that, working quietly, they get their living.",,,,,,,
25009,"And you, my brothers, do not get tired of well-doing.",,,,,,,
25010,"And if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter, take note of that man, and keep away from him, so that he may be shamed.",,,,,,,
25011,"Have no feeling of hate for him, but take him in hand seriously as a brother.",,,,,,,
25012,Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. May the Lord be with you all.,,,,,,,
25013,"These words of love to you at the end are in my writing, Paul's writing, and this is the mark of every letter from me.",,,,,,,

25017,"Or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations, from which come questionings and doubts, in place of God's ordered way of life which is in faith;",,,,,,,
25018,"But the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart, and a knowledge of what is right, and true faith:",,,,,,,
25019,"From which some have been turned away, giving themselves to foolish talking;",,,,,,,
25020,"Desiring to be teachers of the law, though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly.",,,,,,,
25021,"We are conscious that the law is good, if a man makes a right use of it,",,,,,,,
25022,"With the knowledge that the law is made, not for the upright man, but for those who have no respect for law and order, for evil men and sinners, for the unholy and those who have no religion, for those who put their fathers or mothers to death, for taker","of life,",,,,,,
25023,"For those who go after loose women, for those with unnatural desires, for those who take men prisoners, who make false statements and false oaths, and those who do any other things against the right teaching,",,,,,,,
25024,"Which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great God, which was given into my care.",,,,,,,
25025,"I give praise to him who gave me power, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he took me to be true, making me his servant,",,,,,,,
25026,"Though I had said violent words against God, and done cruel acts, causing great trouble: but I was given mercy, because I did it without knowledge, not having faith;",,,,,,,
25027,"And the grace of our Lord was very great, with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",,,,,,,
25028,"It is a true saying, in which all may put their faith, that Christ Jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners, of whom I am the chief:",,,,,,,
25029,"But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the chief of sinners, Jesus Christ might make clear all his mercy, as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life.",,,,,,,

25034,For kings and all those in authority; so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour.,,,,,,,
25035,This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour;,,,,,,,
25036,Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true.,,,,,,,
25037,"For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,",,,,,,,
25038,Who gave himself as an offering for all; witness of which was to be given at the right time;,,,,,,,
25039,"And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle (what I say is true, not false,) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith.",,,,,,,
25040,"It is my desire, then, that in every place men may give themselves to prayer, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or argument.",,,,,,,
25041,"And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price;",,,,,,,
25042,"But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God.",,,,,,,
25043,Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority.,,,,,,,
25044,"In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet.",,,,,,,
25045,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve;",,,,,,,
25046,"And Adam was not taken by deceit, but the woman, being tricked, became a wrongdoer.",,,,,,,

25058,"Let Deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their houses well.",,,,,,,
25059,For those who have done good work as Deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.,,,,,,,
25060,"I am writing these things to you, though I am hoping to come to you before long;",,,,,,,
25061,"But if I am long in coming, this will make clear to you what behaviour is right for men in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of what is true.",,,,,,,
25062,"And without argument, great is the secret of religion: He who was seen in the flesh, who was given God's approval in the spirit, was seen by the angels, of whom the good news was given among the nations, in whom the world had faith, who was taken up in g",ory.But the,pir,t,say,cle,rly,that

25286,"You made him a little lower than the angels; you gave him a crown of glory and honour, and made him ruler over all the works of your hands:",,,,,,,
25287,"You put all things under his feet. For in making man the ruler over all things, God did not put anything outside his authority; though we do not see everything under him now.",,,,,,,
25288,"But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men.",,,,,,,
25289,"Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain.",,,,,,,
25290,"For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers,",,,,,,,
25291,"Saying, I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers, I will make a song of praise to you before the church.",,,,,,,
25292,"And again he says, I will put my faith in him. And again, See, I am here, and the children which God has given to me.",,,,,,,
25293,"And because the children are flesh and blood, he took a body himself and became like them; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death, that is to say, the Evil One;",,,,,,,
25294,"And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death, go free.",,,,,,,
25295,"For, truly, he does not take on the life of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham.",,,,,,,
25296,"Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people.",,,,,,,
25297,"For having been put to the test himself, he is able to give help to others when they are tested.For this reason, holy brothers, marked out to have a part in heaven, give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith;",,,,,,,
25298,"Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house.",,,,,,,
25299,"And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses, even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house.",,,,,,,
25300,For every house has a builder; but the builder of all things is God.,,,,,,,
25301,"And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later;",,,,,,,
25302,"But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end.",,,,,,,
25303,"And so, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you let his voice come to your ears,",,,,,,,
25304,"Be not hard of heart, as when you made me angry, on the day of testing in the waste land,",,,,,,,
25305,"When your fathers put me to the test, and saw my works for forty years.",,,,,,,
25306,"So that I was angry with this generation, and I said, Their hearts are in error at all times, and they have no knowledge of my ways;",,,,,,,
25307,"And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest.",,,,,,,
25308,"My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God:",,,,,,,
25309,But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin:,,,,,,,
25310,"For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ;",,,,,,,
25311,"As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry.",,,,,,,
25312,Who made him angry when his voice came to them? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?,,,,,,,
25313,"And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land?",,,,,,,
25314,And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders?,,,,,,,
25315,"So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief.Let us then, though we still have God's word that we may come into his rest, go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so.",,,,,,,
25316,"And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers.",,,,,,,
25317,"For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world.",,,,,,,
25318,"For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day;",,,,,,,
25319,"And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest.",,,,,,,
25320,"So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders,",,,,,,,
25321,"After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart,",,,,,,,
25322,"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day.",,,,,,,
25323,So that there is still a Sabbath- keeping for the people of God.,,,,,,,
25324,"For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his.",,,,,,,
25325,"Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders.",,,,,,,
25326,"For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart.",,,,,,,
25327,"And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.",,,,,,,
25328,"Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith.",,,,,,,
25329,"For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin.",,,,,,,
25330,"Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need.Every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those",things which,hav,,o d,wit,Go,", so"
25331,"He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way, because he himself is feeble;",,,,,,,
25332,"And being feeble, he has to make sin-offerings for himself as well as for the people.",,,,,,,
25333,"And no man who is not given authority by God, as Aaron was, takes this honour for himself.",,,,,,,
25334,"In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest, but was given it by him who said, You are my Son, this day I have given you being:",,,,,,,
25335,"As he says in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.",,,,,,,
25336,"Who in the days of his flesh, having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death, had his prayer answered because of his fear of God.",,,,,,,
25337,"And though he was a Son, through the pain which he underwent, the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under God's orders;",,,,,,,
25338,"And when he had been made complete, he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders;",,,,,,,
25339,Being named by God a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.,,,,,,,
25340,"Of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear, because you are slow of hearing.",,,,,,,
25341,"And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers, you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of God's revelation; you have become like babies who have need of milk, and not of solid food.",,,,,,,
25342,For everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness: he is a child.,,,,,,,
25343,"But solid food is for men of full growth, even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil.For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth; not building again that on which it is based, th","t is, the tu",nin,,f t,e he,rt,rom d
25344,"The teaching of baptisms, and of the putting on of hands, and of the future life of the dead, and of the judging on the last day.",,,,,,,
25345,"Now we will do this, if God lets us.",,,,,,,
25346,"As for those who at one time saw the light, tasting the good things from heaven, and having their part in the Holy Spirit,",,,,,,,
25347,"With knowledge of the good word of God, and of the powers of the coming time,",,,,,,,
25348,"And then let themselves be turned away, it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time; because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again, openly shaming him.",,,,,,,
25349,"For a land, drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked, has a blessing from God:",,,,,,,
25350,"But if it sends up thorns and evil plants, it is of no use and is ready to be cursed; its only end is to be burned.",,,,,,,
25351,"But, my loved ones, though we say this, we are certain that you have better things in you, things which go with salvation;",,,,,,,
25352,"For God is true, and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name, in the help which you gave and still give to the saints.",,,,,,,
25353,And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end:,,,,,,,
25354,"So that you may not be slow in heart, but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage, because of their faith and their long waiting.",,,,,,,
25355,"For when God made his oath to Abraham, because there was no greater oath, he made it by himself,",,,,,,,
25356,"Saying, Be certain that I will give you my blessing, and make your numbers very great.",,,,,,,
25357,"And so, when he had been waiting calmly for a long time, God's word to him was put into effect.",,,,,,,
25358,For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater; and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath.,,,,,,,
25359,"So that when it was God's desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage, that his purpose was fixed, he made it more certain with an oath;",,,,,,,
25360,"So that we, who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us, may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things, in which it is not possible for God to be false;",,,,,,,
25361,"And this hope is like a strong band for our souls, fixed and certain, and going in to that which is inside the veil;",,,,,,,
25362,"Where Jesus has gone before us, as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, a priest of the Most High God, who gave Abraham his blessing, meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death",,,,,,,
25363,"And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had, being first named King of righteousness, and then in addition, King of Salem, that is to say, King of peace;",,,,,,,
25364,"Being without father or mother, or family, having no birth or end to his life, being made like the Son of God, is a priest for ever.",,,,,,,
25365,"Now see how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight.",,,,,,,
25366,"And it is true that by the law, those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the people's goods; that is to say, they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham.",,,,,,,
25367,"But this man, who was not of their family, took the tenth from Abraham, and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking.",,,,,,,
25368,But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater.,,,,,,,
25369,"Now at the present time, men over whom death has power take the tenth; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living.",,,,,,,
25370,"And we may say that in Abraham, even Levi, who has a right to take the tenth part, gave it;",,,,,,,
25371,Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him.,,,,,,,
25372,"Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi (for the law was given to the people in connection with them), what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order",f Aaron?,,,,,,
25373,"Because if the priests are changed, it is necessary to make a change in the law.",,,,,,,
25374,"For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe, of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar.",,,,,,,
25375,"Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe.",,,,,,,
25376,"And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek,",,,,,,,
25377,"That is to say, not made by a law based on the flesh, but by the power of a life without end:",,,,,,,
25378,"For it has been witnessed of him, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.",,,,,,,
25379,"So the law which went before is put on one side, because it was feeble and without profit.",,,,,,,
25380,"(Because the law made nothing complete), and in its place there is a better hope, through which we come near to God.",,,,,,,
25381,And as this is not without the taking of an oath,,,,,,,
25382,"(For those were made priests without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him, The Lord gave his oath, which he will not take back, that you are a priest for ever);",,,,,,,
25383,By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus.,,,,,,,
25384,"And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests, because death does not let them go on for ever;",,,,,,,
25385,"But this priest, because his life goes on for ever, is unchanging.",,,,,,,
25386,"So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him, because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them.",,,,,,,
25387,"It was right for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy and without evil, doing no wrong, having no part with sinners, and made higher than the heavens:",,,,,,,
25388,"Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day, like those high priests, first for himself, and then for the people; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself.",,,,,,,
25389,"The law makes high priests of men who are feeble; but the word of the oath, which was made after the law, gives that position to a Son, in whom all good is for ever complete.Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high pri","st, who has",ake,,is,lace,at,he ri
25390,"As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man.",,,,,,,
25391,"Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering.",,,,,,,
25392,"If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law;",,,,,,,
25393,"Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain.",,,,,,,
25394,"But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things.",,,,,,,
25395,"For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second.",,,,,,,
25396,"For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah;",,,,,,,
25397,"Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord.",,,,,,,
25398,"For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people:",,,,,,,
25399,"And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small.",,,,,,,
25400,"And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind.",,,,,,,
25401,"When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer.Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order.",,,,,,,
25402,"For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place.",,,,,,,
25403,And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies;,,,,,,,
25404,"Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron's rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement;",,,,,,,
25405,And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail.,,,,,,,
25406,"Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings.",,,,,,,
25407,"But only the high priest went into the second, once a year, not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people:",,,,,,,
25408,"The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open, while the first Tent was still in being;",,,,,,,
25409,"And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean,",,,,,,,
25410,"Because they are only rules of the flesh, of meats and drinks and washings, which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right.",,,,,,,
25411,"But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future, through this greater and better Tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this world,",,,,,,,
25412,"And has gone once and for ever into the holy place, having got eternal salvation, not through the blood of goats and young oxen, but through his blood.",,,,,,,
25413,"For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the dust from the burning of a young cow, being put on the unclean, make the flesh clean:",,,,,,,
25414,"How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God?",,,,,,,
25415,"And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage.",,,,,,,
25416,"Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it.",,,,,,,
25417,For a testament has effect after death; for what power has it while the man who made it is living?,,,,,,,
25418,So that even the first agreement was not made without blood.,,,,,,,
25419,"For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people, he took the blood of goats and young oxen, with water and red wool and hyssop, and put it on the book itself and on all the people,",,,,,,,
25420,"Saying, This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you.",,,,,,,
25421,And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way.,,,,,,,
25422,"And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood, and without blood there is no forgiveness.",,,,,,,
25423,For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these.,,,,,,,
25424,"For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men's hands as the copy of the true one; but he went into heaven itself, and now takes his place before the face of God for us.",,,,,,,
25425,"And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again, as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his;",,,,,,,
25426,"For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself.",,,,,,,
25427,"And because by God's law death comes to men once, and after that they are judged;",,,,,,,
25428,"So Christ, having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men, will be seen a second time, without sin, by those who are waiting for him, for their salvation.For the law, being only a poor copy of the future good things, and not the true image o",those thing,", i",,eve,abl,to,make
25429,"For if this had been possible, would there not have been an end of those offerings, because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins?",,,,,,,
25430,But year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings.,,,,,,,
25431,Because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins.,,,,,,,
25432,"So that when he comes into the world, he says, You had no desire for offerings, but you made a body ready for me;",,,,,,,
25433,You had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin.,,,,,,,
25434,"Then I said, See, I have come to do your pleasure, O God (as it is said of me in the roll of the book).",,,,,,,
25435,"After saying, You had no desire for offerings, for burned offerings or offerings for sin (which are made by the law) and you had no pleasure in them,",,,,,,,
25436,"Then he said, See, I have come to do your pleasure. He took away the old order, so that he might put the new order in its place.",,,,,,,
25437,"By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever.",,,,,,,
25438,"And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day, doing what is necessary, and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins.",,,,,,,
25439,"But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever, he took his place at the right hand of God;",,,,,,,
25440,"And has been waiting there from that time, till all who are against him are made a foot-rest for his feet.",,,,,,,
25441,Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy.,,,,,,,
25442,"And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us: for after he had said,",,,,,,,
25443,"This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, writing them in their minds; he said,",,,,,,,
25444,And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings.,,,,,,,
25445,"Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no more offering for sin.",,,,,,,
25446,"So then, my brothers, being able to go into the holy place without fear, because of the blood of Jesus,",,,,,,,
25447,"By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;",,,,,,,
25448,"And having a great priest over the house of God,",,,,,,,
25449,"Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water:",,,,,,,
25450,"Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking, for he is true who has given his word:",,,,,,,
25451,And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works;,,,,,,,
25452,"Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near.",,,,,,,
25453,"For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true, there is no more offering for sins,",,,,,,,
25454,"But only a great fear of being judged, and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God.",,,,,,,
25455,A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses:,,,,,,,
25456,"But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very",uch worse pu,ish,e,t?,,,
25457,"For we have had experience of him who says, Punishment is mine, I will give reward. And again, The Lord will be judge of his people.",,,,,,,
25458,We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God.,,,,,,,
25459,"But give thought to the days after you had seen the light, when you went through a great war of troubles;",,,,,,,
25460,"In part, in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts, before the eyes of everyone, and in part, in being united with those who were attacked in this way.",,,,,,,
25461,"For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever.",,,,,,,
25462,So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded.,,,,,,,
25463,"For, having done what was right in God's eyes, you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you.",,,,,,,
25464,In a very little time he who is coming will come; he will not be slow.,,,,,,,
25465,"But the upright man will be living by his faith; and if he goes back, my soul will have no pleasure in him.",,,,,,,
25466,"But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul.Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the sign that the things not seen are true.",,,,,,,
25467,For by it our fathers had God's approval.,,,,,,,
25468,"By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be.",,,,,,,
25469,"By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead.",,,,,,,
25470,"By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death; he was seen no longer, for God took him away: for before he was taken, witness had been given that he was well-pleasing to God:",,,,,,,
25471,"And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him, for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is, and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him.",,,,,,,
25472,"By faith Noah, being moved by the fear of God, made ready an ark for the salvation of his family, because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time; and through it the world was judged by him, and he got for his heritage the righte",usness which,is,y,fai,h.,,
25473,"By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage, and went out without knowledge of where he was going.",,,,,,,
25474,"By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement, as in a strange land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had a part with him in the same heritage:",,,,,,,
25475,"For he was looking for the strong town, whose builder and maker is God.",,,,,,,
25476,"And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth, when she was very old, because she had faith in him who gave his word;",,,,,,,
25477,"So that from one man, who was near to death, came children in number as the stars in heaven, or as the sand by the seaside, which may not be numbered.",,,,,,,
25478,"All these came to their end in faith, not having had the heritage; but having seen it with delight far away, they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth.",,,,,,,
25479,For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves.,,,,,,,
25480,"And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out, they would have had chances of turning back.",,,,,,,
25481,"But now their desire is for a better country, that is to say, for one in heaven; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God; for he has made ready a town for them.",,,,,,,
25482,"By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac, when he was tested: and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body,",,,,,,,
25483,"Of whom it had been said, From Isaac will your seed take their name:",,,,,,,
25484,Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead; and because of this he did get him back as if from death.,,,,,,,
25485,"By faith Isaac, blessing Jacob and Esau, gave news of things to come.",,,,,,,
25486,"By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph, when he was near to death; and gave God worship, supported by his stick.",,,,,,,
25487,"By faith Joseph, when his end was near, said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt; and gave orders about his bones.",,,,,,,
25488,"By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a fair child; and they had no fear of the king's orders.",,,,,,,
25489,"By faith Moses, when he became a man, had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter;",,,,,,,
25490,"Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God, than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin;",,,,,,,
25491,Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt; for he was looking forward to his reward.,,,,,,,
25492,"By faith he went out of Egypt, not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king; for he kept on his way, as seeing him who is unseen.",,,,,,,
25493,"By faith he kept the Passover, and put the sign of the blood on the houses, so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death.",,,,,,,
25494,"By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land, though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same.",,,,,,,
25495,"By faith the walls of Jericho came down, after they had been circled for seven days.",,,,,,,
25496,"By faith Rahab, the loose woman, was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders, because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land.",,,,,,,
25497,"What more am I to say? For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets:",,,,,,,
25498,"Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut,",,,,,,,
25499,"Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations.",,,,,,,
25500,"Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come;",,,,,,,
25501,"And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows, and even with chains and prisons:",,,,,,,
25502,"They were stoned, they were cut up with knives, they were tested, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked,",,,,,,,
25503,Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks; for whom the world was not good enough.,,,,,,,
25504,"And not one of these got the good things of the agreement, though they all had a good record through faith,",,,,,,,
25505,"Because God had kept some better thing for us, so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us.For this reason, as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses, putting off every weight, and the sin into which we come so readily, le",us keep on,unn,n,in,the,ay,hich

25507,"Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose.",,,,,,,
25508,Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin:,,,,,,,
25509,"And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord's punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him;",,,,,,,
25510,For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod.,,,,,,,
25511,It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father?,,,,,,,
25512,"But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part, then you are not true sons, but children of shame.",,,,,,,
25513,"And again, if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect, how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits, and have life?",,,,,,,
25514,"For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is.",,,,,,,
25515,"At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness.",,,,,,,
25516,"For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong,",,,,,,,
25517,"And make straight roads for your feet, so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way, but may be made strong.",,,,,,,
25518,"Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord;",,,,,,,
25519,"Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it;",,,,,,,
25520,"And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food.",,,,,,,
25521,"For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed.",,,,,,,
25522,"You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind,",,,,,,,
25523,"And to the sound of a horn, and the voice of words, the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them:",,,,,,,
25524,"For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them;",,,,,,,
25525,"And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said, I am shaking and full of fear.",,,,,,,
25526,"But you have come to the mountain of Zion, to the place of the living God, to the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and to an army of angels which may not be numbered,",,,,,,,
25527,"To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of good men made complete,",,,,,,,
25528,"And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man, and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel's blood.",,,,,,,
25529,"See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from hea",en?,,,,,,
25530,"Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth; but now he has made an oath, saying, There will be still one more shaking, not only of the earth, but of heaven.",,,,,,,
25531,"And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible.",,,,,,,
25532,"If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect:",,,,,,,
25533,For our God is an all-burning fire.Go on loving your brothers in the faith.,,,,,,,
25534,"Take care to keep open house: because in this way some have had angels as their guests, without being conscious of it.",,,,,,,
25535,"Keep in mind those who are in chains, as if you were chained with them, and those who are in trouble, as being yourselves in the body.",,,,,,,
25536,Let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean; for men untrue in married life will be judged by God.,,,,,,,
25537,"Be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have; for he himself has said, I will be with you at all times.",,,,,,,
25538,"So that we say with a good heart, The Lord is my helper; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me?",,,,,,,
25539,"Keep in mind those who were over you, and who gave you the word of God; seeing the outcome of their way of life, let your faith be like theirs.",,,,,,,
25540,Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.,,,,,,,
25541,"Do not be turned away by different strange teachings, because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace, and not by meats, which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them.",,,,,,,
25542,We have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the Tent may not take food.,,,,,,,
25543,For the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents.,,,,,,,
25544,"For this reason Jesus was put to death outside the walls, so that he might make the people holy by his blood.",,,,,,,
25545,"Let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents, taking his shame on ourselves.",,,,,,,
25546,"For here we have no fixed resting-place, but our search is for the one which is to come.",,,,,,,
25547,"Let us then make offerings of praise to God at all times through him, that is to say, the fruit of lips giving witness to his name.",,,,,,,
25548,"But go on doing good and giving to others, because God is well-pleased with such offerings.",,,,,,,
25549,"Give ear to those who are rulers over you, and do as they say: for they keep watch over your souls, ready to give an account of them; let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief, because that would be of no profit to you.",,,,,,,
25550,"Make prayers for us, for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin, desiring the right way of life in all things.",,,,,,,
25551,"I make this request more strongly, in the hope of coming back to you more quickly.",,,,,,,
25552,"Now may the God of peace, who made that great keeper of his flock, even our Lord Jesus, come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement,",,,,,,,
25553,"Make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires, working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through Jesus Christ; and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever. So be it.",,,,,,,
25554,"But, brothers, take kindly the words which I have said for your profit; for I have not sent you a long letter.",,,,,,,
25555,"Our brother Timothy has been let out of prison; and if he comes here in a short time, he and I will come to you together.",,,,,,,
25556,"Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you, and to all the saints. Those who are in Italy send you their love.",,,,,,,
25557,"May grace be with you all.James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth.",,,,,,,
25558,"Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when you undergo tests of every sort;",,,,,,,
25559,Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope;,,,,,,,
25560,"But let this power have its full effect, so that you may be made complete, needing nothing.",,,,,,,
25561,"But if any man among you is without wisdom, let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an unkind word, and it will be given to him.",,,,,,,
25562,"Let him make his request in faith, doubting nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea, which are troubled by the driving of the wind.",,,,,,,
25563,Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord;,,,,,,,
25564,"For there is a division in his mind, and he is uncertain in all his ways.",,,,,,,
25565,But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up;,,,,,,,
25566,"But the man of wealth, that he is made low; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end.",,,,,,,
25567,"For when the sun comes up with its burning heat, the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways.",,,,,,,
25568,"There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing; because, if he has God's approval, he will be given the crown of life, which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him.",,,,,,,
25569,"Let no man say when he is tested, I am tested by God; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil, and he himself puts no man to such a test:",,,,,,,
25570,But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire.,,,,,,,
25571,"Then when its time comes, desire gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is of full growth, gives birth to death.",,,,,,,
25572,"Do not be turned from the right way, dear brothers.",,,,,,,
25573,"Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven, coming from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning.",,,,,,,
25574,"Of his purpose he gave us being, by his true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the things which he had made.",,,,,,,
25575,"You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;",,,,,,,
25576,For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man.,,,,,,,
25577,"For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.",,,,,,,
25578,"But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.",,,,,,,
25579,"Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;",,,,,,,
25580,"For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.",,,,,,,
25581,"But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.",,,,,,,
25582,"If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.",,,,,,,
25583,"The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.My brothers, if you have the faith of our L",rd Jesus Chr,st,f,glo,"y, d",no,take
25584,"For if a man comes into your Synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring, and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing,",,,,,,,
25585,"And you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say, Come here and take this good place; and you say to the poor man, Take up your position there, or be seated at my feet;",,,,,,,
25586,Is there not a division in your minds? have you not become judges with evil thoughts?,,,,,,,
25587,"Give ear, my dear brothers; are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by God to have faith as their wealth, and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him?",,,,,,,
25588,But you have put the poor man to shame. Are not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force before their judges?,,,,,,,
25589,Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you?,,,,,,,
25590,"But if you keep the greatest law of all, as it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself, you do well:",,,,,,,
25591,"But if you take a man's position into account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law.",,,,,,,
25592,"For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all.",,,,,,,
25593,"For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken.",,,,,,,
25594,Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free.,,,,,,,
25595,"For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging.",,,,,,,
25596,"What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation?",,,,,,,
25597,"If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the day's food,",,,,,,,
25598,"And one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warm and full of food; but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need, what profit is there in this?",,,,,,,
25599,Even so faith without works is dead.,,,,,,,
25600,"But a man may say, You have faith and I have works; let me see your faith without your works, and I will make my faith clear to you by my works.",,,,,,,
25601,"You have the belief that God is one, and you do well: the evil spirits have the same belief, shaking with fear.",,,,,,,
25602,"Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith without works is of no use?",,,,,,,
25603,"Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works, when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar?",,,,,,,
25604,You see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them;,,,,,,,
25605,"And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.",,,,,,,
25606,You see that a man's righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only.,,,,,,,
25607,"And in the same way, was not the righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way?",,,,,,,
25608,"For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead.Do not all be teachers, my brothers, because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others.",,,,,,,
25609,"For we all go wrong in a number of things. If a man never makes a slip in his talk, then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control.",,,,,,,
25610,"Now if we put bits of iron into horses' mouths so that they may be guided by us, we have complete control of their bodies.",,,,,,,
25611,"And again ships, though they are so great and are moved by violent winds, are turned by a very small guiding-blade, at the impulse of the man who is using it.",,,,,,,
25612,"Even so the tongue is a small part of the body, but it takes credit for great things. How much wood may be lighted by a very little fire!",,,,,,,
25613,"And the tongue is a fire; it is the power of evil placed in our bodies, making all the body unclean, putting the wheel of life on fire, and getting its fire from hell.",,,,,,,
25614,For every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority;,,,,,,,
25615,"But the tongue may not be controlled by man; it is an unresting evil, it is full of the poison of death.",,,,,,,
25616,With it we give praise to our Lord and Father; and with it we put a curse on men who are made in God's image.,,,,,,,
25617,"Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right for these things to be so.",,,,,,,
25618,Does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water?,,,,,,,
25619,"Is a fig-tree able to give us olives, my brothers, or do we get figs from a vine, or sweet water from the salt sea?",,,,,,,
25620,Who has wisdom and good sense among you? let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom.,,,,,,,
25621,"But if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others, have no pride in this, talking falsely against what is true.",,,,,,,
25622,"This wisdom is not from heaven, but is of the earth and the flesh and the Evil One.",,,,,,,
25623,"For where envy is, and the desire to get the better of others, there is no order, but every sort of evil- doing.",,,,,,,
25624,"But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy, then gentle, readily giving way in argument, full of peace and mercy and good works, not doubting, not seeming other than it is.",,,,,,,
25625,And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace.What is the cause of wars and fighting among you? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies?,,,,,,,
25626,"You are burning with desire, and have not your desire, so you put men to death; you are full of envy, and you are not able to get your desire, so you are fighting and making war; you have not your desire, because you do not make request for it.",,,,,,,
25627,"You make your request but you do not get it, because your request has been wrongly made, desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure.",,,,,,,
25628,"O you who are false to God, do you not see that the friends of this world are not God's friends? Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God.",,,,,,,
25629,"Or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy Writings say, The spirit which God put into our hearts has a strong desire for us?",,,,,,,
25630,"But he gives more grace. So that the Writings say, God is against the men of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him.",,,,,,,
25631,For this cause be ruled by God; but make war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you.,,,,,,,
25632,"Come near to God and he will come near to you. Make your hands clean, you evil-doers; put away deceit from your hearts, you false in mind.",,,,,,,
25633,"Be troubled, with sorrow and weeping; let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief.",,,,,,,
25634,Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him.,,,,,,,
25635,"Do not say evil against one another, my brothers. He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brother's judge, says evil against the law and is judging the law: and in judging the law you become, not a doer of the law but a judge.",,,,,,,
25636,"There is only one judge and law-giver, even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction; but who are you to be your neighbour's judge?",,,,,,,
25637,"How foolish it is to say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this town, and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth:",,,,,,,
25638,"When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow. What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a little time and then is gone.",,,,,,,
25639,"But the right thing to say would be, If it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living, we will do this and that.",,,,,,,
25640,But now you go on glorying in your pride: and all such glorying is evil.,,,,,,,
25641,"The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.Come now, you men of wealth, give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you.",,,,,,,
25642,Your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing.,,,,,,,
25643,"Your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you, burning into your flesh. You have put by your store in the last days.",,,,,,,
25644,"See, the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field, is crying out against you; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies.",,,,,,,
25645,You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure; you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction.,,,,,,,
25646,You have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death. He puts up no fight against you.,,,,,,,
25647,"Go on waiting calmly, my brothers, till the coming of the Lord, like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come.",,,,,,,
25648,Be as calm in your waiting; let your hearts be strong: because the coming of the Lord is near.,,,,,,,
25649,"Say no hard things against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged; see, the judge is waiting at the doors.",,,,,,,
25650,"Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble, the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord.",,,,,,,
25651,We say that those men who have gone through pain are happy: you have the story of Job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and mercy in the end.,,,,,,,
25652,"But most of all, my brothers, do not take oaths, not by the heaven, or by the earth, or by any other thing: but let your Yes be Yes, and your No be No: so that you may not be judged.",,,,,,,
25653,Is anyone among you in trouble? let him say prayers. Is anyone glad? let him make a song of praise.,,,,,,,
25654,"Is anyone among you ill? let him send for the rulers of the church; and let them say prayers over him, putting oil on him in the name of the Lord.",,,,,,,
25655,"And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well, and he will be lifted up by the Lord, and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness.",,,,,,,
25656,"So then, make a statement of your sins to one another, and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well. The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working.",,,,,,,
25657,"Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are, and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain; and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months.",,,,,,,
25658,"And he made another prayer, and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit.",,,,,,,
25659,"My brothers, if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error,",,,,,,,
25660,"Be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way, keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number.Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the saints who are living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappad","cia, Asia, a",d B,t,yni,",",,
25661,"Who, through the purpose of God, have been made holy by the Spirit, disciples of Jesus, made clean by his blood: May you have grace and peace in full measure.",,,,,,,
25662,"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead,",,,,,,,
25663,"And a heritage fair, holy and for ever new, waiting in heaven for you,",,,,,,,
25664,"Who, by the power of God are kept, through faith, for that salvation, which will be seen at the last day.",,,,,,,
25665,"You have cause for great joy in this, though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time, being tested in all sorts of ways,",,,,,,,
25666,"So that the true metal of your faith, being of much greater value than gold (which, though it comes to an end, is tested by fire), may come to light in praise and glory and honour, at the revelation of Jesus Christ:",,,,,,,

25799,"For if, after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again taken in the net and overcome, their last condition is worse than their first.",,,,,,,

25895,"There is no fear in love: true love has no room for fear, because where fear is, there is pain; and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love.",,,,,,,
25896,"We have the power of loving, because he first had love for us.",,,,,,,
25897,"If a man says, I have love for God, and has hate for his brother, his words are false: for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen, able to have love for God whom he has not seen?",,,,,,,
