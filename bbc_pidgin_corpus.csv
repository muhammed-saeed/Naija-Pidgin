Di unusual circumstance show di kontri security issues and lack of democratic accountability. Di winner among di 39 candidates go also deal wit di impact of di ongoing drought wey di kontri dey experience. But di big task na to take control of much of Somalia from al-Shabab. Di al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militant group continue to dominate large parts of di kontri and carry out frequent attacks for di capital, Mogadishu and oda places. Di African Union dey back di federal goment fight against al-Shabab wit 18,000 troops. Di United Nations dey also back di kontri. Somalia neva get one-person-one-vote democratic election since 1969. Na coup, dictatorship and conflict wey involve clan militias and Islamist extremists follow di vote of 1969. Di instability na one of di reasons why Somalia never fit hold direct elections. Dis na even di third time di indirect election for president dey take place for Somalia. Na neighbouring Kenya and Djibouti dem hold di previous ones.

Indonesia ban export of palm oil: Wetin e mean for Africa wia Nigeria be largest producer	"Indonesia don ban export of any kind of palm oil wit immediate effect. So wetin e mean for Africa? Di Southeast Asian kontri dey account for more dan half of world palm oil supply, don sama ban on anykind Wetin cause di export ban be say Indonesia pipo don start protest against increase for di price of cooking oil. Di price increase don disturb dia local supply. So di question now be say wia Africa wey dey import oil wela go turn to next for supply. For 2021, Africa bin spend five billion dollars to import estimate of four million metric tonnes of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. One tonne of palm oil be about $1,850 for di commodity exchange for Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. E den add, anoda 150 to 200 US dollars for transport and handling costs, per tonne. Dis mean say, di real cost to deliver one tonne of palm oil anywhere on di continent be about $2,000. Wetin dey dia be say, di ban fit expose Africa largest producer of palm oil-Nigeria wey be former world largest producer for di 1960s. Nigeria bin dey produce one small 1.4m metric tonnes for 2021, compare to Indonesia 44.5 million metric tonnes. Di ban dey come just a month since global sunflower oil supply bin dey thrown off-balance. Na di Ukraine-Russia war, as dat one bin add pressure to household budgets. Indonesia restriction on exports, go now dey somehow for Africa pipo wey dey already struggle wit di effects of high fuel and food price sake of global supply chain wahala. Already, di price of product like soap and cooking oil don increase and di situation fit only get worse. Palm oil dey in use wella to manufacture vegetable oil. But e get plenti products wey dey comot from palm oil: Frying fats, cosmetics and cleaning products like soaps. Importers like India, Bangladesh and Pakistan go try buy more palm oil from Malaysia. But di world second-biggest palm oil producer no fit fill di gap wey Indonesia create sake of labour shortage. Indonesia mostly dey supply nearly half of India total palm oil import. While Pakistan and Bangladesh import nearly 80% of dia palm oil from Indonesia. Connie Magomu, di General Manager, National Oil Palm Project, for Uganda say di ban sef be opportunity. Magomu see am as good chance for Africa kontries to develop dia own palm oil sector. ""E dey very efficient for land use, as e dey produce more oil per unit area dan any oda crop wey we sabi (E dey give between four to 10 times more oil per unit area)."" ""E be also one good crop for poverty reduction sake of once e reach maturity for three and half years. ""E go dey harvested every 10 days for 20 to 25 years"", She add. Uganda don dey promote local production of palm and need at least 100,000 hectares to dey self-sufficient.

Roe v Wade: Politico leak suggest Justice Alito want SCOTUS to overturn abortion rights	"US Supreme Court fit dey about to overturn di nationwide legal right to abortion, leaked report suggest. Dis na according to one leaked draft opinion wey don make activists to enta streets of Washington. Politico, tori pipo, reports say Justice Samuel Alito don write di document say di landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision dey ""badly wrong"". If Politico reports dey verified, di leaking of di document fit be wetin never happun before inside di US Supreme Court modern history. Di justices dey expected to issue dia ruling on di case by early July. Neither di Supreme Court or di White House wish to comment on di leak on Monday night. ""Roe dey egregiously (badly) wrong from di start,"" di draft opinion reportedly tok. Di opinion add say: ""Time don reach to obey di Constitution and return di issue of abortion to di pipo elected representatives."" Justice Alito also reportedly write say Roe v Wade reasoning bin dey ""exceptionally weak"" and e don get ""damaging consequences"". ""Di conclusion wey dey difficult to notice na say a right to abortion no dey deeply rooted in di Nation's history and traditions,"" di conservative opinion reportedly tok. Speaker of di House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer - both Democrats - don issue a joint statement reacting to di leak. ""If di report dey accurate, di Supreme Court dey ready to inflict di greatest restriction of rights in di past 50 years"", di statement read. E add say di decision by ""Republican-appointed Justices"" go-go down as an ""abomination, one of di worst and most damaging decisions in modern history"". One of America main anti-abortion organisations, National Right to Life, say e go wait for di Supreme Court official opinion on di matter before speaking out. Anti-abortion activists and pro-abortion supporters don already take to di streets of Washington to demonstrate. Dis be after news say U.S. Supreme Court fit overturn di 1973 Roe v Wade ruling wey legalized abortion nationwide. A woman right to do an abortion through di first trimester of pregnancy na im dey protected nationally in 1973. E follow di Supreme Court landmark 7-2 ruling in Roe v. Wade case. If Supreme Court of United States [SCOTUS] do wetin dey di leaked Politico report, e mean say dat right of a woman don get K-leg. Immediately, sake of statutes wey already dey books and ""trigger"" laws wey dem design for such occasion - abortion go dey illegal in 22 states of USA. Now abortion rights supporters in Washington don call on Democrats inside Congress to take action to protect access to abortion. Experts say di leak of a U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion wey fit overturn di constitutional right to abortion na major breach of confidentiality. Reports say e don heightened di stakes ontop di already politically-charged case inside America. Plaintiff Jane Roe, wey later dey identified as Norma McCorvey na unmarried pregnant woman wey no fit an abortion under Texas law. Fo dia e dey illegal unless to save di life of di mother. Roe lawyers said she dey unable to travel out of di state to obtain an abortion and argue say di law no dey real and block on her constitutional rights. ""Pregnancy dey often come more than once to di same woman, and in di general population, if man go survive, e go always be with us."" Na so Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a Republican wey by President Richard Nixon nominate, write inside di sweeping majority opinion. SCOTUS decision rule say Texas law infringed on women right to privacy, e dey overly broad and violate di due process clause inside U.S. Constitution Fourteenth Amendment. ""Dis right of privacy...dey broad enough to encompass a woman decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. ""Di bad condition say di State go impose upon di pregnant woman by denying dis choice altogether dey clear. Five Republican-nominated judges dey among di majority. Di court rule say di state fit regulate di procedure during di second trimester and even ban am in most circumstances in di third. Justices Byron White, a Democratic appointee, and Republican-nominated William Rehnquist, later U.S. chief justice, no agree to di ruling alias dissented. Di decision provoke gbasgbos among social and judicial conservatives, wey for long don dey make move to revoke am. Assume for a moment say dis draft opinion become law of di land. Immediately, sake of statutes wey already dey books and ""trigger"" laws wey dem design for such occasion - abortion go dey illegal in 22 states of USA. Di illegality of di procedure go become battle during election year. Dis na di significance of wetin dey happun for Supreme Court. However, draft opinions na just draft opinions. And accounts of justices wey don shift dia views as di opinion-drafting process dey go on within di court chambers. Dis kind leak bypass all dat. For most of US history, di Supreme Court don operate like Mount Olympus as dem dey hand down opinions from high. Dis leaking wey dey spread don shatter dis kind tin. Pipo gass wait to see wetin e go mean for di legitimacy of di judicial process for US. But inside di institution, e no go dey wrong to say all trust between di judges don disappear. Inside era wey political customs don dey broken, anoda big piece don fall. Na Republican presidents appoint six of di nine current justices of di court. Na Democratic presidents pick di three odas. Politico report suggest say Justice Alito and four oda justices wey Republican appoint - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - support di move. E no dey clear how Chief Justice John Roberts go vote. Di three justices wey Democrat appoint - Stephen Brever, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - dey work on at least one opposition, Politico report. If dem issue am as a majority ruling, Justice Alito opinion go overturn di constitutional right to abortion for US. And dis go allow individual states to ban di procedure or place more restriction ontop am. Di American Civil Liberties Union tok say if dem confirm am, di decision ""go deprive half of di nation a fundamental, constitutional right wey millions of women don enjoy for ova 50 years"". Di case involve one challenge to Mississippi ban on abortion afta 15 weeks, wey di justices hear for December. According to di BBC US partner CBS News, di leak go cause plenty damage to one of di institutions wey pipo respect well well for US. Chief Justice Roberts fit order full-blown investigation wey go involve di FBI to uncover di sources, CBS report. Dis kind leak no even happun for di year 2000 US presidency between George W Bush and AI Gore. Rove v Wade in 1973 give women for US absolute right to abort pregnancy wey dey three months and limited right in di second trimester. In 1992, inside Planned Parenthood v Casey, di court rule say state no fit place ""undue burden"" on women wey dey seek abortion before foetus fit survive outside di womb, at about 24 weeks. Na about 630,000 reported abortion dey for di US in 2019, according to di US Centres for Disease Control. Dis na about 18% decrease if you compare am with 2010.

Under all emissions scenarios, di IPCC dey expect say one bllion more pipo go dey at risk from coastal specific climate hazards in di next few decades. If temperatures rise to between 1.7 and 1.8C above di 1850s level, half di human population go dey exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions wey go arise from heat and humidity. Diseases go likely spread more quickly in di coming decades, di pipo wey write di report tok.

""In de global financial market, nobody dey like uncertainty....some level of stability, certainty de predictability be helpful for de market"" Prof Bokpin reveal. So although bombs den gunfire dey reach Ghana, de panic de war dey create make people dey sit on dia money instead of investing sake of de market make unpredictable.

""If de performance of de cedi no be from structural reforms, den sustainability be issue"" Professor Bokpin reveal. A couple of years ago we borrow heavily to shore up wanna international reserves, but dis no be something govments go fit sustain. What central bank fit do he say dem go increase de short term interest rate to mop up liquidity from de market. Sake of de cedi dey depreciate, people dey convert dia monies into foreign currency. Sake of dis, more pressure dey on de dollars which dey make de cedi underperform even more. So if govment increase increase de short term interest rates, more people go now start dey release dia monies to de central bank. And dem for do dis immediately so say people no go interpret de high interest rate as investment as a way for govment to escape major problems."	AFRICA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-60662172

As she return from Tokyo, wia she became di first Namibia woman to win Olympic medal, her journey from airport reach di kontri capital Windhoek show her newfound status. Na so 45-kilometre journey take three hours sake of di number of pipo wey come out to welcome her. ""Pipo bin dey scream my name dey run pursue di car - e dey crazy and fun,"" Mboma, 18 years, tell BBC Sport Africa. But five years ago, her tori bin dey very different inside one village for north of Namibia wia her single-parent family bin dey poor, she bin share one bedroom wit her grandmother and sleep on bed without mattress. ""I grow up wit single mum,"" di BBC African Sports Personality of the Year nominee tok. ""At 13, my mama die and I gatz stay wit my uncle and grandmother. ""Everytin change and I lost many friends. Some pipo no like me because I be orphan."" To be orphan fit be bad experience sake of stigma wey connect to dia situation, as pipo dey see some of dem as financial burden while odas get superstitious believe say dem cari bad-luck. Her father actually still dey alive but afta im abandon her mama, wey bin dey disabled, wen Mboma dey six years, im no be part of her family life again. Na dis one make Mboma mature sharply-sharply as di responsibility fall on her to take care of her two siblings. ""Dem be my children now. Na hard life I bin dey live - stressing, and just thinking about my mama,"" she tok. ""I bin dey stress small, den I begin do sports."" Her athletic abilities don dey change her life, not just financially but also geographically, as now she dey live nearly 500km from home with her coach Henk Botha and im family.

In less dan one week, Mboma career turn upside down. On 30 June, she break di Under-20 world record for di 400m, her preferred event, for Poland - ""I bin shock, but happy"". Two days later, she learn say she no go fit compete over 400m because of her naturally-high testosterone levels - ""I bin dey shock, and sad."" ""E be bad news,"" she remember. Governing body World Athletics' rules say female athletes wey get over-high testosterone levels no go fit contest any race between 400m and di mile unless dem artificially reduce dia levels. ""I say I get one chance - di 200m,"" Mboma remember. ""If I bin dey tink about di 400m and all dat tin, I go lose focus and den I no go perform well for di Olympics."" Witin two months of switching distances, Mboma break African and World U20 record for di 200m four times, all of dem except di one wey bin dey come for Tokyo. ""Wen I reach di Olympic final, I bin dey very scared,"" di teenager wey tear rubber dis year on di athletics stage tok.

""I bin no tink about di race - I bin just dey run - and wen I [cross] di line, dem say I be second. I bin dey touch my face, [dey think] 'dis na real or abi I dey dream?'"" E no be dream but strong reality say Namibia, kontri of just 2.5 million pipo, don return to athletics top table for di first time since 1996, wen Frankie Fredericks win im fourth and last Olympic silver. Eighteen days later, Mboma win di World Under-20 title (for Kenya) before, for September, twice she do well for high-quality field for Diamond League - she win di final for Zurich to claim di annual title. Mboma say she no understand di complex World Athletics regulations wey concern athletes wey dem consider say dem get 'Difference of Sexual Development' (DSD). ""I no get idea,"" she confess. Her coach, meanwhile, say afta World Athletics tell am say Mboma and training partner Beatrice Masilingi no go fit contest di 400m due to DSD rules, im reject invitation to do more tests, sake of im no trust di organisation process. As long as World Athletics no amend im rules more to cover 200m, wey Botha get some concerns about, Mboma dey surely eye beta future. ""My aim na to improve my personal best and see wetin go happun."" Her best time, 21.78s, dat na 0.45s from di world record wey, if she fit significantly improve, she go grab am wit two hands. Also di Olympic gold, especially afta she don already get silver. ""Wen I take di medal and put am around my neck, tears bin dey my eyes.

Ethiopia Tigray conflict: Why di rest of di world dey worry	"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken dey travel to Kenya, where e go discuss di conflict for neighbouring Ethiopia. Dem don tell US and UK citizens to commot for Ethiopia "" Commercial flights dey readily available"", dis na di word of one British minister . Dis alarming advice, wit echoes of Kabul for August, dey land as one rebel force from di northern Tigray region look like e fit dey try make move for di capital, Addis Ababa. One year inside di civil war, wey don leave humanitarian crisis for im wake, di chorus of outside concern dey get louder. African and US diplomatic pressure dey increase sake of wetin happen for Ethiopia get big connect for di rest of di region and di wider world. Di numbers sef alone dey shock pesin. At least 400,000 pipo dey face hunger-like conditions for di north. 80% of essential medicine no dey available and more dan two million pipo don dey forced to comot from dia house. Di federal government bin don chop accuse say dem deliberate no allow aid to reach Tigray, but dem deny. Make we add, evidence of unlawful killings, torture and sexual violence dey committed by both side. But strategic interests also dey. Ethiopia, wit population of 110 million - di second largest for di continent, be one key, stable Western ally for volatile region. Concern dey say di current fight fight fit trigger wider violence for dis multi-ethnic nation wey fit even lead make e break up. If millions of pipo wan japa for dis big gbege, e no go dey easy for dia neighbours to cope. Landlock Ethiopia border six kontries, two of which already dey experience conflict - South Sudan and Somalia - plus one oda, Sudan, just see military takeover.

Troops from Eritrea dey already fight for Ethiopia and one long gbege fit affect oda neighbours. But kontries wey dey further wrong do dey reportedly drag. Last month, Reuters say Turkey don agree to sell Ethiopia military drones. Dis deal bin threaten Turkey relationship wit Egypt, wey get im own argument wit Ethiopia sake of one big dam wey dey di Nile, di report bin add. Ethiopia don also buy Chinese and Iranian weapons, and flights wey dey take off from di United Arab Emirates na im dey transport dem, di defence website Oryx report. From one US view, e don tey wey dem bin see Ethiopia as reliable ally, especially during di so-called War on Terror. Dem don fight against Islamist militants for Somalia for di frontline of dat conflict. And offer US to use dia airspace during di Iraq war. E be one of few African kontries to join di US' ""coalition of di willing"". Stable government for Ethiopia bin dey important to dat relationship. Di US don back dem up wit money,dem hand over $4.2bn ( 3.1bn) aid between 2016 and 2020. But di US envoy to di region, Jeffrey Feltman, never fear to criticise di federal government. E say di policies don result to mass starvation, and compare am to di Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. After plenti efforts by fighters for di Tigray Pipo Liberation Front (TPLF) along one main highway wey dey lead from di north to Addis Ababa, di tension crank up. Di US bin sama di evacuation call to im citizens and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announce state of emergency and ask for more military recruits. Di Addis Ababa authorities bin call pipo to register dia weapon. Another rebel group wey be padi to di TPLF say dem dey also get closer to di capital. Di multi-ethnic nature of di city also add to di tension there, some pipo dey accuse authorities say dem dey target Tigrayans for one series of arrests. But di Tigrayan force still dey like more dan 300km from di city - around di town of Kombolcha.

""Where di TPLF dey operate now, better resistance dey and e go be one bloody battle for Addis Ababa."" E belief say if to take di capital dey used as threat di same way dat nuclear power fit dey use di possibility to launch weapons. Di TPLF don tok say wetin dem really want be to allow aid supply to fit enter Tigray. ""We go continue to march [towards Addis Ababa] but e no dey too much about Addis Ababa aswetin we dey think to arm-twist Abiy to commot di blockade."" Na so tok tok pesin Getachew Reda tell BBC Focus on Africa. DI Ethiopian gomment don label di TPLF as terrorist organisation and di prime minister don swear to dey fight go.

Di worry now be say di conflict dey enter one new phase ande go become really difficult for any of di side to step back. Fear also dey say di fight fit spread across di kountri. Di TPLF don join bodi wit oda groups wey also no like di gomment for one new coalition wey dey seek end of oga Abiy premiership. Di African Union envoy to di region, former Nigeria President Olusegun Obasanjo, don tok about one small ""window of opportunity"". ""Time dey short for any intervention,"" e tell di UN security council after e tok to di two sides for one recent visit to Ethiopia. E dey call for tok-tok plus political solution, although e never describe how dem go fit achieve am. Di response by Ethiopia UN ambassador, Taye Atske Selassie, bin reason wahala wey wan settle di matter go face. E say e respect di call for tok tok but dem describe di TPLF as ""one criminal group"". TPLF tok tok pesin Oga Getachew, bin tweet say; Di ""most 'peace tok' dey mainly about to save [Prime Minister] Abiy, not about to address di most critical political challenges for di kountri"". Of course, tok tok to end di gbege by dia nature be enemy. One way to get di two side to sit down togeda go be for both di US and China, plus oda kontries likeTurkey, to act together, di former US diplomat Nagy argue. ""Abiy no go fit dey able to counter di US and China if dem say di same tin."" E say di first tin go be to get di fight to end and make sure aid fit dey delivered and den small small reason political options. For di root of di fight fight be one kasala between Prime Minister Abiy and di TPLF, wey for almost 27 years take over di whole kountri, no be just Tigray. Abiy Ahmed gbab power for 2018 on di back of one wave of protest by members of di Oromo ethnic group. Di Oromos - Ethiopia largest group - wey dey feel say dem dey marginalised since. Oga Abiy, imself wey be Oromo and part of di ruling coalition, dey seen as di man wey fit resolve di kasala. For one whirlwind of reform, where e bin loosen politics and make peace wit long-time enemy Eritrea, di TPLF dey sidelined. Di long time fight between di TPLF and Oga Abiy den burst into war 12 months ago.

Di OLA wey dey for Oromo region bin dey as enemies with di TPLF, wen dem bin get power for thirty years, but now dem don be allies and PM Abiy say di two groups be terrorists. All dis tins don make am hard to negotiate. As if dat one neva do, di Amhara regional force enta di fight as dem join national forces. Di reason na dem claim say Tigray rebels cut out of land wey dom dey Amhara region throughout history. So na for dat land, dem go tanda and di move don vex plenti Tigrayans wey include former officials of di Ethiopian Prime Minister. But di TPLF allied Tigray forces say dem no go stop to fight until Amhara forces comot from dia. So with all these pipo wey dey fight for different tins and don get historical beef, e go dey very difficult to find peace.

Dem also tok say Ethiopia goment forces don dey block humanitarian aid for di region Di goment claim na part of security measures, say di aid get weapons wey dem wan give TPLF but aid agencies say na lie.

However, di image she use no dey related to events wey follow di jailing of di former president, and look like na from one different set of protests last year. We don see one very similar picture for one media article dem publish on 25 September 2020 wia di same individuals and same vehicles dey for road. Dem take di foto during protests organised by one group wit a list of social and economic grievances dem want address. Although di shot na from one slightly different angle, di positions of vehicles, of di pipo wey dey lie down for road and di way dem dress look identical to di one Dudu Zuma-Sambudla use. One video show one confrontation between a group of black men and white men don attracted more than 300,000 views on Twitter, and appear to show part of di current unrest. Di tweet, dem post on 13 July, say: ""White farmers for #South Africa get whipped and dem tiff dia cars as di kontri descends into mass-looting frenzy"". DiTwitter account base for Poland, and e get handle associated wit online conspiracy theory activity, and posts anti-immigrant and white nationalist content. Also, di video in question bin dey circulate before di riot start around 9 July. E get reports online from 25 June wey feature di same video, which news stories on independent blogs and sites claim say e dey about a pay dispute, and e no dey related to di current unrest, but we don dey able to independently verify dis details. One widely-shared video wey falsely claim say those wey involve in di protests pull down fencing for di Hluhluwe Game Reserve for KwaZulu-Natal province, to let out lions and other animals. Di Twitter account post warn pipo to ""watch out for lions, etc"" and e receive a lot of comments, and dey widely liked and retweeted. But di post dey misleading because di video dey old. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, di government agency wey dey manage di game reserve, say dem take di video for mid-May during one unrelated protest wey get nothing to do wit di former president.

For neighbouring Gabon President Ali Bongo Ondimba na di son of Omar Bongo, wey rule from 1967 to 2009, while for Democratic Republic of Congo Joseph Kabila rule for 17 years after im takeover for 2001 when dem assassinate im papa Laurent-D sir as head of state. Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang - wey comot im own uncle Francisco Mac as Nguema as di kontri first head of state, for 1979 - don already appoint im son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, as vice-president, to make am easy for am to takeover. And after Chad President Idriss D by die last month - from wetin goment say na injury from war front - im son Mahamat, wey be four-star army general, don sharpaly rise to be di leader of di interim ruling military council. And now underground tok-tok don dey dey say Cameroon sef fit see dis kain family format. Dis na afta one anonymous ""citizens' movement"" campaign begin for Franck Biya, di son of di 88-year-old President Paul Biya wey never even reach middle of im new seven-year term. Sources wey dey close to Franck - even if im no dey chook hand for politics, as e prefer private sector business career - don torchlight say Franck no get anytin to do wit di campaign wey dey promote im name. But also, im never tell dem to stop, and e never comot public statement say im no get am for mind to succeed im papa. Of course, political dynasties no be new tin - see for example di Bush and Kennedy family for di US. And currently for Uganda, one social media campaign dey package General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, son of current head of state Yoweri Museveni, as di potential ruling party candidate for di next election in 2026. But dis pattern of leaders wey dey hand power to dia pikin dey common pass for west-central Africa economies wey depend on oil, as di money from oil dey ginger di politics dia. E dey also cause rivalries and and katakata inside di ruling dynasties. Rumours dey say inside di Obiang family fight-fight don dey happen, as tori be say some family members dey favour anoda son of di president, Oil Minister Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima. But di phenomenon dey particularly entrenched in west-central Africa's petro-economies, wia oil revenues often lubricate di networks of political patronage and empire-building. It dey also fuel rivalries and resentments within ruling dynasties and dia often complex webs of personal connection. Rumours of palace intrigue dey among di Obiangs, wit some family members said to dey favour alternative presidential son, Oil Minister Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima. But no be just about personal issues. Ali Bongo face former foreign minister and African Union Commission chief Jean Ping, inside di 2016 Gabonese election. Meanwhile Ping na di former partner to di president sister Pascaline, wey go make president Ali Bongo uncle to dia two children. Five years after di elections, Ping no gree for di defeat as serious kwesions comot about whether di polls dey free and fair. French justice don dey torchlight Equatorial Guinea regime for allegations say dem bring enter France family assets wey dem use corruption money buy. Di Bongo and di Nguesso na im French authorities dey targe: di 13 pipo wey dem open formal investigation ontop dia head also include one lawyer wey work for di President Omar. For 2015 French judges order say make dem seize two properties for Paris wey dem believe di real own na Sassou-Nguesso nephew Wilfrid Nguesso; not to mention 15 luxury cars dem seize join. Wilfrid dey under formal investigation. Then by middle of 2017 - one year after Nguesso say make France troway di case against am - French authorities put di president daughter Julienne and her husband Guy Johnson, anoda nephew, Edgar, and one former sister-in-law, Catherine Ignanga, under formal investigation. Di matter relate to $22.4m of money transfer dem allege say dey suspicious, wey happen between 2008-2009. But na Equatorial Guinean Vice-President, Teodoro, attract attention pass, with police wey don raid im luxury house since like 2012 and seize plenty cars, including two Bugatti Veyrons and one Rolls Royce Phantom. Dem later sentence Teodoro order am to pay 30m fine. Im goment International Court of Justice, wia dem argue say di Avenue Foch mansion, wey worth 107m, na dia embassy for France and so e get diplomatic immunity. But, last December the Court reject di argument. Even though for some countries di recent trend na for presidents to want put dia family members for power after dem don comot, e no dey clear whether dis pattern fit last. Dis na because African population dey young more and more and dia expections of dia goments don dey change. Paul Melly na Consulting Fellow with di Africa Programme for Chatham House in London."

Uganda elections 2021: Bobi Wine, di pop star wey wan unseat President Yoweri Museveni afta 35 years in power	"E neva get anytime wey peaceful handover of power don happun for Uganda, but pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine dey hope to change dat by unseating long-serving President Yoweri Museveni for Thursday's vote. BBC Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga take a look at di challenger. Few weeks before di general election and wetin fit be di biggest day of Bobi Wine life as he bring im presidential campaign to im family ancestral home. Di 38-year-old pop star, wey im real name na Robert Kyagulanyi, gain im popularity for di informal settlements of di capital, Kampala, but even in Kanoni, one sleepy rural town for central Uganda, dem dey support am. Hundreds of young pipo, mostly men dressed in red, seem to comot from di bushes and gardens and surround im motorcade. Bobi Wine, wey dem dey also call ""ghetto president"", climb through di sunroof of im white Toyota Landcruiser and wave at di crowds - and dey ansa. For one unlikely dressing move for a presidential candidate, he don start dey wear bullet-proof vest and protective helmet. For December, dem shoot one bullet through im car windscreen narrowly missing one passenger. Bobi Wine say im think say im life dey in danger. For Kanoni, as e don happun many times during campaign , he don run into police and military blockade- dem fire teargas and bullets- Authorities say dem dey try find and disperse crowds and enforce Covid-19 guidelines. But Bobi Wine believed dis na yet anoda sign of intimidation. He don consistently dey tok say dis no go happun as im feel say im be head of a mass movement. ""Pipo no just dey follow me. Pipo dey follow di ideal wey I represent,"" he tell BBC in 2019. ""I no start am and I no go end am. I be just one of di millions and millions of Ugandans wey want beta"" Di manifesto of im National Unity Platform (NUP) party dey geared towards basic needs like improving access to healthcare, education, clean water and justice. All of dis, di NUP tok say dem fit only do am, if dem remove President Museveni from power. Ova di last two decades Bobi Wine musical output don dey been filled wit songs about dis issues and e don inspire one ogbonge following. Twenty-three-year-old law student Marion Kirabo dey campaign to be local councillor and she be one of im supporters. ""Even before im political life he be pesin wey di the youth fit identify wit,"" she tok. ""Especially through im music, you fit clearly see say he understood di social issues wey young pipo dey face, especially young pipo wey come from ghetto."" Wen President Museveni came to power for 1986, Bobi Wine dey just about to turn four, and e dey live for Kanoni. Central Uganda don be di battleground of di bush war wey bring Oga Museveni rebel National Resistance Army, and im political wing, di National Resistance Movement (NRM), to power. Bobi Wine grandpapa, Yozefu Walakira, dey part of one different rebel contingent but from time to time during di conflict wey Oga Museveni host for im house. Walakira die during di civil war afta im wunjure wen dem bomb im house - an attack wey also kill three family members. Bobi Wine family later moved to Kampala, im mama Margaret Nalunkuuma, wey be nurse, na di main breadwinner and she buy land for di Kamwokya slum wia di musician live and build im world-famous recording studio. Some of im primary and secondary schools always dey within walking distance from Kamwokya. As a teenager he discover im passion for di arts, but wen he first attend di prestigious Makerere University he start to dey study for social sciences degree. After one semester he switch courses and begin music, dance and drama, wia im get diploma from di university for 2003. For 2017, di reggae star turn im hand to politics as he see am as di logical next step. ""You know, all through my musical career, I don dey sing about di challenges wey pipo dey go through,"" he tell BBC. ""So e look like say I don dey campaign all my musical career."" Im song Tuliyambala Engule (We Shall Wear di Victor's Crown) don become one of di campaign unofficial anthems. He win by-election to become MP for Kyaddondo-East, one constituency to di north of di capital and even though an independent he align himself with di opposition. for one series of by-elections he campaign for candidates wey defeat hopefuls from di NRM. E no get any sound of regret for Bobi Wine voice wen he reflect on im rival career inside one BBC interview for 2019. ""Why dat kain prized revolutionary decide to become one of di world's most despised dictators?"" he ask. ""But na also lesson to many of us, as we sabi say we dey tok wetin President Museveni dey tok wen e dey like us. And also to remember say na only di idea of building strong institutions fit save us from ourselves."" Di comparison between a younger Oga Museveni - wey dey charismatic, energetic and inspiring - wit today's Bobi Wine dey hard to escape. Di rebel commander be just 41 years old wen he seize power, dey promise Ugandans security, stronger economy and beta future. Some dey wonder whether im new challenger full of idealism and populist rhetoric fit make di same mistakes. Activist Siperia Mollie Saasirabo, 24, wey tok say she don dey ""political exile"" for Kenya, no to believe in Bobi Wine. For 2019, she become di face of student protests ova increase in school fees for Makerere University. For dat, dem abduct, beat and leave her barely conscious. At di end of dat year, she briefly join Bobi Wine party but later comot as she see say di party no get solid ideaology. ""Dem ask am about im economic system wen he boecome president,"" she tok, referring to one July 2020 interview Bobi Wine give to one local radio station. ""Dem ask if im dey on di left or right of di ideological setting, and im ansa na say im no dey for either right or di left and im go just use wetin go works and dis no make sense for me."" Apart from di large crowds wey gada to support him, like di one for Kanoni, e dey hard to tell how truly popular im dey and whether di cheers go turn to votes. Data on registered voters and dia voting patterns dey very limited. For dis context e get some wey don already dey question di validity of di vote. Bobi Wine, however, don encourage pipo to cast dia ballots and say make voters dey sure say rigging for polling stations no happun. "	AFRICA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55614853

Uganda elections 2021: Yoweri Museveni don dey office for 35 years	"Uganda pipo wey neva reach di age of 35 wey be more than half of di kontri population don only sabi one president; Yoweri Kaguta Tibuhaburwa Museveni AKA M7. Yoweri Museveni (for short) bin enta power afta one kasala [armed struggle] wey burst for 1986. And e don withstand alias do odeshi for all di badluck wey don befall long serving leaders like am. Di 76 year old time as oga at di top of Uganda don dey filled with a long period of peace and development wey pipo don give am hand for. But e don use personality cult, compromise of independent institutions and bouncing of opponents to maintain power since 1986. During di kontri last election, five years ago, im tok say ""how I go comot banana plantation wen wetin I plant don dey bear fruits?"" wen di issue of stepping aside bin come up. Di first time BBC tori pesin for Uganda, Patience Atuhaire bin hear im name na for school drama on how Idid Amin bin create kasala for di kontri and how oga Museveni National Resistance Army bin save di kontri for 1986 ending di senseless killings or di kontri. And na dat image many Ugandans don use grow up. But e also get di image of papa and grandpapa for di kontri. In fact many young Ugandans dey call am ""Sevo"" and im sef dey call dem bazuluku (wey mean grandpikin for Luganda language). But im no dey behave like di regular grandpapa, infact for di campaign wey im do for im sixth term, e bin dey go round di kontri dey launch factories, open roads and new markets. Even sef, e dey like show wetin e fit do with regards to exercise, sometin wey many pipo tink say na sake og im challenger 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine. Last April, im feem imself dey do exercise like press up for house to encourage exercise for lockdown come repeat am again in front of students for November. 25-year-old Museveni supporter, Angela Kirabo say she dey support am because ""in di next five years, wen we comot school, Sevo go make sure say we find work"". One of Museveni closest friend and advisors John Nageda don put di loyalty di president dey enjoy on di fact say im fit die for Uganda and be true Africanist. However, di original constitution for di kontri say Museveni no suppose fit contest for election again afta 2005. In fact, before 2005, im bin no entertain di idea say e wan stay power pass im tenure as im say e go rather go back im farm. Tori be say im bin take am as serious insult for dinner party rn pesin ask am dat question. But in 2004, im change im mind and im MPs vote to amend constitution and comot presidential term limits so im go fit stay power till im reach 75 years. Wen December 2017 come nko, dem comot di constitutional age limit for presidential candidates. Dat oe ne cause serious fight for parliament and police bin raid di building. Many dey see am as clear road so oga Museveni go fit be president for life, Dis na as most MPs owe dia positions to di president. Uganda na prime example of pipo wey no dey bite di hand wey dey feed dem. In short e dey easy to say Yoweri Kaguta Tibuhaburwa Museveni na di ""Kabaka wa Kabaka""(wey mean king of kings) of Uganda since 1986. E dey show for development programmes for women, market sellers and goment jobs. And for kontri wey get 15% young pipo unemployment and 21% of di kontri wey dey for poverty, if you collabo with di right party, e fit save your kontri from destruction. But Museveni supporters say di development of Uganda through peace and economic development na better reason to give am five more years. Although everybodi gree say joblessness na major palava. Even with these changes, im don weaken di independence of some key institutions for id kontri like di judiciary. Accuse dey say dem dey appoint ""cadre judges"" wey dey loyal with goment and if judges no do wetin goment want, e fit cause kasala. Like for 16 Demecember 2015, wen armed security personnel enta High Court for Kampala to re-arrest members of di suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, wey dem just acquit of treason. Even to challenge election results wey dem don cari go court, di courts ruleee say di irregularities of election no reach make dem cancel results. Di media sef don receive dia own gbas gbos, Daniel Kalinaki wey be di Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala tok say dem don det raid outlets and detain journalists as goment don dey thin skinned. Wen e start to show say Museveni no wan comot office, na so im former associates start to leave am. Former Museveni doctor, Kizza Besigye from di opposition, Forum for Democratic Change run against am for 2001. Dem arrest am and prosecute for cases of rape and treason but till now neva convict. Now wey Bobi Wine wey be singer whose real name na Robert Kyagulanyi dey run, e don dey face gbas gbos from security forces. Dem bin arrest di MP dor 2018 for treason but later drop di charges. For im campaign for dis election, policedon arrest am, and shoot at im supporters say dem no follow coronavirus restrictions on large groups.

Ghana Elections 2020 winner: Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo vs John Dramani Mahama - Four unique things about de polls	"On December 7, Ghanaians go pour out in dema numbers to make a choice on who go be dema next President. A total of 12 Presidential candidates dey contest in dis election with hopes say Ghanaians go give dem keys to de Jubilee House. But out of di 12, candidates of de two top parties, NPP's Nana Akufo-Addo den NDC's John Mahama be favourites. Dema participation in de election and some prevailing elements dey make dis 2020 election dey make am unique - dis be why. Ghana dey go de polls on December 7, despite say dis be new election - the reality be say dis be d j vu all over again between two candidates, Nana Akufo-Addo den John Mahama. Dis be de third consecutive time dis two candidates dey compete against each other for de highest office of de land, first contest be 2012, second 2016 and dis 2020 General Elections. What dey make dis third round even more interesting be say dis go be de last time dem ever go meet as presidential candidates. Whoever go win de 2020 elections go complete two terms, which mean say dem no go fit contest as President again. Both candidates win one round each, so whoever go win de 2020 election be the better candidate among de two. Sake of dis, de stakes be high! One Term Each Another key element in dis year's election be say both candidates serve Ghanaians one term each. Opposition leader, John Mahama after he win de 2012 elections serve Ghanaians for 4 years. But in 2016, Nana Akufo-Addo manage boot John Mahama and out of power - that NPP victory set record as de first time Ghanaian President lose power after just four years in power. In dis 2020 elections, opposition leader John Mahama dey hope say he go fit pay back Nana Addo by cutting short en Presidential ambitions after just one term. What be more interesting about dis whole thing be say Ghanaians dey judge de two top candidates by dema 4-year performance in power. Infrastructure vs Economy So now element number three which dey make Ghana elections exciting be say dis year, Ghanaians dey choose between govment which dey build infrastructure or govment wey dey strengthen economy. De opposition NDC John Mahama dey campaign on de grounds of en infrastructural achievement between 2012 - 2016. He build chaw top class hospitals, roads like circle interchange, new terminal for Ghana airport den stuff which more Ghanaians start dey appreciate after dem vote am out of power. Meanwhile, Prez Akufo-Addo too dey campaign on en record of economic transformation, growth in agriculture through planting for food and jobs, clean up of de banking sector, en handling of de COVID-19 pandemic den stuff. If Ghanaians vote give NDC, e mean say dem prefer physical infrastructure but if dem retain Prez Akufo-Addo, e mean say dem prefer say govment go build de economy. Myth behind US and Ghana Election Finally, de top top political parties dey align themselves to de top parties in US. Ruling govment NPP dey align to Republicans wey opposition NDC dey align plus Democrats. Sake of dis anytime Republican Party win for US, NPP usually get high hopes say dem also go win elections for Ghana. Wey NDC too dey feel the same whe Democrats win elections. Interestingly, de results of US Election dey reflect for Ghana elections. In 2008 when Democratic Party win elections with Obama as dema Prez Candidate, de NDC who dey align to democrats also win de elections for Ghana. Again in 2016 when Donald Trump win de elections for Republicans, NPP who be aligned to dem also win de 2016 election for Ghana. The interesting argument for Ghana be say now that Donald Trump and de Republican party lose de 2020 elections, some pundits who dey believe dis myth say dis be sign say de NDC too fit snatch power from NPP after just 4 years in power. You dey believe in myths like dis or de dynamics be very different dis time around? Anyways, December 7 go be de best judge on dis matter. In order for any party to win de 2020 elections, dem for win at least two out of de three battlegrounds - dis be Greater Accra, Central den Western Region. Historically, dis coastal regions who dey change dema voting pattern in every election - so all eyes dey on Accra, Central and Western ahead of de elections. In addition to winning these regions, de NPP and NDC get dema strongholds or what Ghanaians dey call - ""world bank."" De volume of votes from Ashanti Region dey determine how well NPP go perform. Wey volume of votes from Volta Region dey determine how opposition NDC go perform. In 2016 for instance, NDC record 115,000 less voter turnout for Volta Region compared to de 2012 turnout, contributing partly to dema loss. So on December 7, dis be de elements wey you for look out for if you want see who dey win or lose."	AFRICA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55112943
John Mahama vs Nana Akufo-Addo: Ghana elections 2020 economy and corruption score card	Ghana elections 2020 campaigns don end, now de 7 December polls proper be upon us. So for help Ghanaians get better understanding of de issues affecting Monday voting, BBC Pidgin torchlight de west African country economy and corruption scorecard since 2012. Ghana election 2020 na majorly between two candidates wey don once serve as President for Ghana within de last eight years. Former president John Dramani Mahama of de National Democratic Congress [NDC] and de incumbent president, Nana Akufo-Addo of de New Patriotic Party [NPP] be de main contestants for Ghana 2020 presidential race. Dis time de two candidates dey ask for four more years to make Ghana great again. Make we take a look at some key sectors, wetin dema promise versus wetin dem achieve for dia first term for office. NDC Manifesto promise for 2012 To focus im economic development priorities to better di lives of Ghanaians through investment and development policies Maintain single digit rate of inflation; Ensure exchange rate stability Reduce gbese significantly Maintain average annual growth rate of at least 8% NPP Manifesto promise for 2016 To build di most business-friendly and pipo friendly economy for Africa, wey go create jobs and prosperity for all Ghanaians. Achieve double digit GDP growth annually for four years Reduce di cost of doing business, maintain financial discipline, reduce government borrowing and reduce interest rates to encourage private businesses. Tori pipo for Fact check Ghana bin do research and dis na wetin dem find out as dem quote World Bank data to compare di monetray value and di GDP under di tenure of di Mahama-led NDC government and di incumbent Akufo-led NPP. From dis table, e show say under di Mahama-led NDC government, Ghana record GDP growth of 15.836 wey be average of 3.959% growth every year. Akufo-led government don record an accumulated growth of 21.784% wey translates to an average of 5.446%. Dis one mean say di GDP of Ghana don grow higher under di NPP goment than di NDC. NPP manifesto for 2016 promise; To commit to establish solid, efficient machinery for good governance, wey go make up of accountable goment and respect for di rule of law and human rights. One of di things wey dem promise to do na to establish, by Act of Parliament, di Office of di Special Prosecutor, wey go dey independent of di Executive, Di special prosecutor go investigate and prosecute certain categories of cases and allegations of corruption and other criminal wrongdoing. All dis to ensure transparency for goment. NDC manifesto for 2012 promise; To stand gidigba to fight political corruption and immorality For di manifesto, di party promise to use di 2008 party promise to run di 2012 political tenure. For 2008, di NDC goment promise to deepen political accountability and transparency, disclose budgets, public expenditure and procedures. How tins be? For one statement wey NPP release afta di resignation of di Special Prosecutor on Monday, 17th November, 2020, di party say di record of corruption under di NDC leadership dey worst. Di Flagbearer of di NDC, John Mahama, during dia manifesto launch on September 7 for di University of Professional Studies, Accra condemn NDC performance on corruption. From wetin we gather from di Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report wey Transparency Index dey release every year to give insight on di presence of corruption in public office under a particular goment. See di table wey Fact Check Ghana draw up from Transparency Index report. Even though di CPI report for 2020 neva comot, di worst CPI score (di highest corruption perception) under di Mahama goment beta pass di best CPI score (di lowest corruption perception) under di Akufo-Addo NPP goment. Dis one mean say di Mahama led NDC goment handle corruption pass di Akufo Addo NPP goment. So now element number three which dey make Ghana elections exciting be say dis year, Ghanaians dey choose between govment which dey build infrastructure or govment wey dey strengthen economy. De opposition NDC John Mahama dey campaign on de grounds of en infrastructural achievement between 2012 - 2016. He build chaw top class hospitals, roads like circle interchange, new terminal for Ghana airport den stuff which more Ghanaians start dey appreciate after dem vote am out of power. Meanwhile, Prez Akufo-Addo too dey campaign on en record of economic transformation, growth in agriculture through planting for food and jobs, clean up of de banking sector, en handling of de COVID-19 pandemic den stuff. If Ghanaians vote give NDC, e mean say dem prefer physical infrastructure but if dem retain Prez Akufo-Addo, e mean say dem prefer say govment go build de economy.

Out of de twelve, de two favourites who form government since de start of de Fourth Republic wey start in 1992 be de candidates of di ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), National Democratic Congress (NDC) who be de main opposition party. Apart from de presidential candidates, voters go elect 275 parliamentary candidates who go occupy de law-making institution alias Ghana paliament. So what type of voting system [How election dey conducted in Ghana] dey use in determining who go win elections on December 7? Since de inception of de Fourth Republic, Ghana dey practice voting system - First Past the Post alias Simple Majority.

Despite de 50 percent votes which dey determine who go win elections, Ghana electoral system make provision in case no candidate secure more than 50 percent of total votes cast. Per de 1992 Constitution of Ghana, if no candidate get over 50 percent votes, de electoral commission go hold second election between de two leading candidates within 21 days. So voters go once again queue to vote for de top two parties to determine who go win de election.

Once you be registered voter, dem go give you one ballot paper which you go take vote for presidential candidate of choice, drop am in de ballot box. Then officials go give de voter second ballot paper to vote for de preferred member of parliament. On December 7, 2020 de candidate who go emerge winner with over 50 percent of valid votes cast become President of Ghana on January 7, 2021 where per de constitution dem go swear am in. After dem swear de Prez in, he go appoint en Speaker of Parliament who now go convene new parliament of lawmakers for de country. Presidential elections hold for de first time in Ghana on 27 April 1960. De elections hold alongside a referendum on creating an executive presidency.

Nigeria vs Ghana 'trade war' plus harassment wey Ghanaians dey show Nigerian traders and wetin we know so far	Nigeria vs Ghana situation don enta 'delicate stage', na wetin Nigeria foreign minister Geoffrey Onyema tell BBC Pidgin ontop di trade relations wey don tour sour between di two west African nations. Now, House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, Nigeria number four man dey visit Ghana today inside di middle of di trade war. Gbajabiamila waka na one of di ways to find solution to di $1million levy wey Ghana sama Nigeria traders for dia kontri. Last week Nigeria para say dem no go accept how Ghana dey humiliate Nigeria. But Ghana authorities say no be so di mata be. Tori be say, both kontries never address di mata again for public, since afta Lai Mohammed, Nigeria information minister cut 'enough is enough' warning for Ghana and wen im colleague for di Gold Coast Kojo Oppong Nkrumah reply say President Nana Akufo-Addo go discuss wit Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari to solve di mata peacefully. But at di moment Nigeria vs Ghana situation don damage? Recently, Ghana authority close more than two hundred shops wey belong to Nigerians sake of say dem no follow dia trade regulation plus dem neva pay dia 1million dollars levy. Ghana say dem no want make foreigners enta into retail business as dem reserve dat sector for dia citizens but Nigeria say dat one dey against ecowas protocol. Since Ghana and Nigeria get dia independence, diplomatic relations between di two kontris always get gbege. Di two kontris dey always wan prove who beta pass in terms politics, economy, sports, and regional integration. Even citizens of di two kontris dey drag demselves on top who jallof rice sweet pass- dis wan show di kain rivalry wey don dey between di two kontris. However, di recent way wey some jaguda pipo demolish Nigrian embassy building for Ghana and di closing of Nigerian retail shops don cause high diplomatic tension between di two kontries. While di goment of both kontris still dey try find diplomatic solution to di mata, dis na di genesis of how Nigeria and Ghana fight -fight take start. Pre-colonial Era: Di first gbas gbos between Nigeria and Ghana start for 1931. During dis period, di number of Nigerians wey di live for Ghana reach like 20 percent of di kontri population. Many Nigerians dia bin di work as Cocoa farmers, business pipo, labourers and becos Ghana economy bin good, dia business bin dey boom. But later during di cocoa hold-up saga for Akyem Abuakwa area, di king and di traditional council bin ask di colonial goment make dem deport Nigerians wey be trouble makers. Independence Era: Ghana get im independence for 1957 and di head of gonment den be Kwame Nkrumah At dis time, di population of Nigerians and di business community don grow for Ghana. Even for dis era, Ghanaian pipo kontinu to mount pressure on top dia goment head to deport Nigerians wey dem refer to as alien. For August 23 1957, di Convention Peoples' Party (CPP) government passed the Deportation Act wey give goment right to deport those wey dem consider as threat to dia kontri During dis period some Nigerians chop deportation and goment describe dem say dem be opposition party members. Deportation act of 1969: Dis period mark di major deportation of aliens or foreigners dem from Ghana. Close to 200,000 pipo from Togo, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria bin pack dia kaya waka from di kontri. Sake of dis deportation, many African kontri begin target Ghanaian pipo dem for dia kontri and begin ask dem make dem leave. Ghana must go: During di period of 1986, Nigeria presido den, Shehu Shagari ask Ghanaians make dem pack dia load and leave di kontri. Many of dem bin dey Nigeria to find beta life sef come do dem back, as e ask Ghana pipo to also leave Nigeria. Di reason Ghana bin deport plenti pipo wey dem refer as alliens from dia kontri na to provide beta job opportunities for dia citizens. And to also allow dia pipo to get more involved for di kontri economy as foreigners dem bin get business ground for di kontri pass. Na from since 1931 na im Ghanaians dey try put pressure on dia goment to drive oda nationalities and today, di situation neva change as Ghana business pipo kontinu to ask dia goment to do dey needful Prof. Bola Akintehinwa wey be former DG of NIIA, say some Some Ghana business pipo dey vex on top how Nigerian traders dey sell dia kaya cheap wit chikili moni Some times di Nigerian traders dey even cari more quality goods. Sake of dis, dey business men dey always lobby different goment to put dowm laws wey go favour dem against Nigerians. Di kasala between Nigerian traders and di Ghana authority fit cause major k-leg for Nigeria/Ghana diplomatic relations. Since di gbege, mani Nigerians don call on di goment to also fine Ghanaians di same amount and close dia shops to teach Ghana lesson But oga Bola say why Ghana di try project dia National interest, Nigerian goment no dey do anything. And dat di best tin to do now na for di Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari to try call Ghana president and warn am against wetin e dey do And tell am say Nigeria also get power to retaliate. E say do-me -I do you approach no go epp for dis mata and dat both kontris gatz look for diplomatic way to resolve dia wahala.	AFRICA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-53994995

Wild Polio: Africa certification for eradication of poliovirus infectious disease don land - Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon dey free!	"One independent panel, wey World Health Organisation set up don declare say Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroonand di whole of Africa don dey free from wild polio. Di independent body, Africa Regional Certification Commission formally announce di eradication of poliovirus infectious disease from Africa on Tuesday. Polio usually dey affects children under five, sometimes e dey lead to irreversible paralysis. Death fit later happun wen breathing muscles dey affected. Twenty-five years ago, di virus paralyse thousands of children inside Africa. Now, di disease dey for only Afghanistan and Pakistan. No cure dey for di disease but di polio vaccine dey protect children for life. Nigeria na di last African kontri wey dem declare free from wild polio, afta dem bin account for more than half of all global cases less than ten years ago. Di vaccination campaign inside Nigeria involve huge effort to reach hidden and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers even die for di process. Polio na virus wey dey spreads from pesin to pesin, usually through contaminated water. E fit lead to paralysis by attacking di nervous system. Two out of three strains of wild polio virus na im don vamose from di world patapata. On Tuesday, dem declare Africa free of di last remaining strain of wild poliovirus. More than 95% of Africa's population don get immunisation. Dis na one of di conditions wey di Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring di continent free from wild polio. Now only di vaccine-derived polio virus remain for Africa with 177 cases wey dem don identify dis year. Dis na rare form of di virus wey dey change from di oral polio vaccine and fit then spread to under-immunised communities. World Health Organization (WHO) don identify some number of these cases inside Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Angola. Without any cure, dem develop one vaccine for 1952 and na Dr Jonas Salk develop am. Dis make pipo get hope say children fit dey protected from di disease. For 1961, Albert Sabin lead di oral polio vaccine wey dem don dey use for most national immunisation programmes around di world. For 1996 poliovirus paralyse more than 75,000 children across di continent - everi kontri dey affected. Dat year Nelson Mandela launch di ""Kick Polio Out of Africa"" programme, gada millions of health workers wey go village-to-village to hand-deliver vaccines. Pipo wey support dis program na Coalition of groups including Rotary International wey bin don spearhead di polio vaccination drive from 1980s. Since 199, billions of oral polio vaccines na don dey provided, and dis prevent about 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus. Di last communities wey dey at risk of polio dey live inside some of di most difficult places to deliver immunisation campaigns. Nigeria na di last kontri for Africa wey bin report case of wild polio - Dat na for Borno state inside North-east, Nigeria wey also be di epicentre of Boko Haram insurrection, for 2016. At dat time na frustrating set-back as di kontri don make huge progress and don go two years without any cases wey dem identify. Outside Nigeria, di last place wey dem don see case of polio na for Puntland region of Somalia for 2014. Conflict with di Islamist militant group Boko Haram don make parts of Nigeria difficult to reach, Borno state in particular. More than two million pipo don dey displace sake of di fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of dem women, manage to go areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities. Widespread rumours and misinformation about di vaccine don also slow down immunisation effort. For 2003, Kano and some oda northern states suspend immunisations afta reports by Muslim religious leaders wey say di vaccine dey contaminated with one anti-fertility agent as part of American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests wey Nigerian scientists find out di accusation no be true. Vaccine campaigns resume di following year, but di rumours still continue. For 2013 nine female polio vaccinators na im dem kill for two shootings weydem believe say na Boko Haram do am for one health centres inside Kano. E don take plenti years to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around di vaccine. Winning di trust of communities na im be di koko Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of di Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, say di role of survivors dey very important to persuade pipo to accept di campaign. ""Many reject di polio vaccine, but dem see how much we struggle to reach dem, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to dem. We ask dem: 'You no think say e dey important for you to protect your child not to be like us?'"" From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, huge coalition develop to defeat polio. Working togeda dem don travel go remote communities to immunise children. Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly dey affect children wey dey under five. First symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of di neck and pains inside di limbs. E dey also enta di nervous system and fit cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. One in 200 infections dey lead to irreversible paralysis. Among those wey dey paralyse, 5% to 10% of pipo die wen dia breathing muscles just dey one place and no move Polio na disease wey dey easy to import enta anoda kontri wey dey polio free and from dia e fit spread quick-quick among under-immunised populations. Dis happen for Angola, wey be say upon plenti years of civil war, defeat polio for 2001. Di kontri remain free from polio for four years until 2005 wey e be like some number of cases come from outside di kontri. WHO say e dey important for kontries to remain vigilant and avoid complacency until dem don pursue polio patapata from di world. If dem let down dia defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio fit once again begin to spread quickly. For all types of polio to comot patapata, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination effort go need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children make di disease no paralysed dem in future."

Nile River: Longest river in Africa 'Blue Nile River Dam' dey cause Egypt-Ethiopia kasala - Read wetin you need to know	"Three African kontris, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt don agree to resume tok-tok sake of di Grand Renaissance Dam reservoir on the Blue Nile, afat hold virtual meeting. Dis na di centre of kwanta between Ethiopia and Egypt on top di future of di giant hydropower project on to di Nile Riverwey begin in Ethiopia in 2011. Ethiopia dey hope say di dam go bring electricity to tens of millions of im pipo wey currently dey live without access to regular power but Egypt, wey dey get most of im fresh water from di Nile, dey worry say di move go threaten water supply for dia kontri. Wen dem complete, di Grand Renaissance Dam, wey Ethiopia dey build, e go be di Africa biggest hydroelectric power plant. Dem start di construction since 2011 on di Blue Nile tributary for di northern Ethiopia highlands, from wia 85% of di Nile water dey flow. The mega dam don cause gbas-gbos between Egypt and Ethiopia, and Sudan dey between, and some pipo dey fear say e fit lead to war, and di US don begin chook mouth for di mata. Part of wetin dey cause di fight na plans to fill up di mega dam and Egypt dey fear say di project go allow Ethiopia to control di flow of Africa longest river. Hydroelectric power stations no dey consume water, but di speed wey Ethiopia take fill up di reservoir of di dam go affect di flow of water downstream. Di longer e go take to fill up di reservoir, wey go big pass Greater London wit capacity of 74 billion cubic metres, di less impact e go get on di level of di river. Ethiopia wan do am in six years. ""We get plan to start di filling for di next rainy season, and we go start dey generate power wit two turbines for December 2020,"" Ethiopia Water Minister Seleshi Bekele tok for September last year. But Egypt don propose longer period - so dat di level of di river no go suddenly drop, especially for di first phase of filling di reservoir. Di tok-tok between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over how dem go operate di dam and fill don reservoir neva make progress since four years - and di US don dey try to settle di mata. Afta dia tok for January 2020, Oga Seleshi accuse Egypt say dem no get any plans to reach a deal. Egypt dey rely on River Nile for 90% of dia water. For history, to get stable flow of di Nile waters na mata of survival for kontri wia water dey scarce. One 1929 agreement alias treaty (and anoda one for 1959) give Egypt and Sudan rights to almost all di Nile waters. Di colonial-era document still give Egypt veto powers over any projects by upstream kontris wey fit affect im share of di water. Ethiopia don tok say dem no dey bound by di treaty - meaning di agreement no be must for dem to follow, so dem go ahead to start to build di dam in March 2011 without tok-tok wit Egypt. Dem quote Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi for September last year say if no be no be for di political gbege wey dey happun for im kontri, Ethiopia for no fit start to build di dam. Ethiopia say one of di previous preconditions wey Egypt bin put for di agreement na make dem connect am to Aswan dam. Ethiopia Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy, Seleshi Bekele tell BBC say im don explain to di Egyptians say e go ""dey hard to connect di two dams"". Egypt dey also fear say di dam fit stop dia already scarce supply of di Nile waters, wey be almost di only water source for im citizens. E fit also affect transport on di Nile for Egypt if id water level too low and e go affect di livelihood of farmers wey dey depend on di water for irrigation. Di $4bn ( 3bn) dam dey for di centre of Ethiopia manufacturing and industrial dreams. Wen dem complete di project, dem go fit generate a massive 6,000 megawatts of electricity. Ethiopia get plenti shortage of electricity, wit 65% of dia population no dey connected to di grid. Di energy wey dem wan generate go dey enough to connect dia citizens and sell di surplus power to oda neighbouring kontris. Di dam project no go rely on external funding but e go rely on goment bonds and private funds to pay for di project. Yes. Neighbouring African kontris plus Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Djibouti and Eritrea dey likely to benefit from di power wey dem go generate from di dam. Many of dis kontris no get beta power supply. For Sudan na added advantage say di flow of di river go dey regulated and e go reduce di flood wey di kontri dey suffer from around August and September evri year. Fears bin dey say if dem no resolve di kasala, di kontris dem fit begin fight. For 2013, e get reports of one secret recording wey show di Egyptian politicians dey propose different hostile acts against Ethiopia over di building of di dam. Dem don also quote President Sisi say im tok say Egypt go take all di necessary measures to protect dia rights to di Nile waters. For October last year, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tell MPs sya ""no force"" fit stop Ethiopia from building di dam. Di International Crisis Group warn last year say di kontris ""fit enta battle"" on top di dam. Di fact say di US don chook mouth for di mata show say e dey serious - and di need to break di deadlock. Egypt ask for di intervention of di US on di impasse, afta President Sisi ask President Trump to settle di conflict, and Ethiopia bin no wan accept. Conflict between di two states fit draw global interest as e go put millions of civilians at risk. E go also threaten di vital international trade route through di Suez Canal and along di Horn of Africa, according to analysis by di Washington Institute."

But plenti prominent politicians, and even Christian wey dey argument ontop wetin bible tok about homosexuals and Muslim leaders for Gabon, don vex for di decision, dem describe am as change to appease di foreign donors. Gabon no be di first African kontri to dey consider say homosexuality no be crime. Some oda kontris wey don decriminalise homosexuality for Africa na: South Africa na di first nation for di continent to decriminalize homosexuality for 1998, wen di Johannesburg High Court rule say di kontri sodomy law no follow di new adopted post-apartheid Constitution. In fact na di first kontri for di world to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and di fifth to legalize same-sex marriage. Since 2010, many Southern Africa kontris don decriminalise same-sex relations, For 2015, Mozambique revised di penal code wey say homosexuality na offence. For di revised code, dem drop one colonial-era clause wey dey outlaw ""vices against nature"". Di new law mean say authorities no go punish anybody wey dey engage in homosexual relationship.

Same-sex sexual acts between men and between women don always dey legal for Burkina Faso. Though di Constitution of Burkina Faso no authorize same-sex marriage, dem define marriage as union between one man and one woman. Homosexuality don always dey legal for Ivory Coast sake of say some parts of di kontri na former French colony and dem inherit sodomy laws from France like oda British colonies. But, same-sex couples and households no dey eligible for di same legal protections wey dey available to opposite-sex couples for di kontri.

Di Penal Code provides for prison sentence of two to five years and a fine of 2 to 10 million ariary (US$900 to US$4,500) for acts wey dey ""indecent or against nature"" with an individual of di same sex wey dey under di age of 21. Madagascar no recognise same-sex marriage or civil unions. Homosexuality dey legal for Niger but diage of consent no dey equal for same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activity. Same marriage no dey legal for di kontri and LGBT pesins dey face stigmatization among di bigger population. Private, adult, consensual and non-commercial homosexuality dey legal for Mali.

Although di kontri no criminalise same-sex relationship but same-sex marriage no follow law and protection no dey for against discrimination based on wetin sexual orientation be or im gender identity. Guinea Bissau change di penal code for 1993 to decriminalise homosexuality for di kontri. For December 2008, Guinea-Bissau become one of di 66 kontris to sign di ""United Nations Statement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity"", wey support decriminalization of homosexuality and transgender identity. Di law for 2011 only recognize heterosexual married couples as entitled to larger government housing. Same-sex sexual activity dey legal for di kontri. Age of consent dey equal, no mata di sex. However, di U.S. Department of State 2010 Human Rights Report find say di kontri dey prosecute any ""individuals wey dey engage in public displays of homosexuality under public decency provisions in the penal code and articles for di 2006 law on sexual violence. No legal recognition dey for smae-sex marriage. Even as LGBT pesins for di kontri dey face public stigmatization, same-sex union no be crime.

We no fit throw sand on di coffin as dem dey put am for grave. When pesin wey you love die, we wan cry, look for comfort and closure. But how yo go do dis kind tins wen you no dey dia? I bin vex. I no ever imagine say I go bury my loved one through social media. I no ever tink say I go want human contact that much. E bin dey like feem, except say I dey part of pipo wey act am. And sadly, di Facebook Live fail, due to a poor network connection. So I no fit even watch Chris final journey to di very end. I no see wen dem put e coffin down inside grave. For many African societies death and life are dey togeda. Many traditions see death as rite of passage - a transition to another form. Hence why ancestors dey important - dem be di pipo wey don die but kontinu to ""live"" for di community. Dis, in turn, mean say wen pipo die dem must receive perfect burial - complete with rituals wey dem don observe for generations. For di communities for western Kenya wia I come from, like di Luo and Luhya, wen dem born pesin die and wen di pesin die na two important events. Dem dey treat pesin wey die wit respect and death and burial process dey to follow, to ensure mistake no dey. First of all burials dem no dey rush burials, especially for old pesin. Pesin death na call for celebration, even though pipo dey mourn and cry. E dey take at least one week to bury adult pesin. Loud mourning and crying, go last for days. Pipo come togeda to help di family of di pesin wey die to mourn. Dem go light Bonfire and pipo go gather around dem, embrace, cry, and relive di life of di pesin wey die. To kill animal dey part of di ritual, and di preparation and serving of food and drinks to console mourners. Na show of unity amongst neighbours and family. Dem go bring di dead home a day or two before di burial. They lie in di compound, to show say dem accept and love dem, even in death. Di Luo, a Nilotic people from western Kenya, have among di most elaborate burial customs for Kenya. At least 10 rites dey involved from the announcement of death, to di removal of di shadow or spirit of di dead from di homestead, to di shaving of family members' hair, and finally di remembrance ceremonies for di dead. All dis occasions require pipo to gather and interact in huge numbers. But during dis pandemic, most of dis rituals are dey off-limits, whether di pesin die of Covid-19 or not. During di two days between Chris' death and e burial, dem forbid pipo for house to sing with loud voice for night, becos dem go attract di neighbours wey go want come cry wit di family. Dem no light any bonfires to sit around. And during di burial, even for grave site, no hugging, or touching, no handshakes or kisses dey allowed. Goment representatives bin dey dia to ensure say pipo follow di rules f social distancing. Forty days afta dem bury somebody, dem suppose hold memorial service - di final celebration of dia life. Again, we no go fit do dis for Chris. I get dis feeling say I don only partially cry for Chris. Dis no be how e for deserve make pipo mourn am. Maybe wen all dis end - when we fit hug again, and cry for each other arms - we go mourn am like we suppose. "	AFRICA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-52781527

Coronavirus domestic violence: Surviving lockdown wen you dey trapped with your abusive partner	"Di United Nations don describe violence against women during di coronavirus lockdown as ""shadow pandemic"". Across Africa, goments, police and activists report increase in attacks on women and girls wey trap for lockdown with abusive partner or relative. So wetin you fit do if you find yourself in dis kain of situation? We ask experts and one survivor of domestic abuse to share dia advice. ""Wen you dey for inside abusive relationship, you go notice one pattern,"" Esther* tell me, as she tink back to di three years she spend married to man wey she tok say bin dey abuse her regularly - physically and verbally. ""Weekends dey always worse, because everybody dey for house. Your partner get more time for dia hands and fit get bored too. So you go see say dem wan find trouble. Dem go set you up - say something wey go make you react and den hit you wen you react. ""If two days fit make pesin dey bored enough to make dem wan hit you, imagine wetin one month or so of lockdown don cause pipo. No be just boredom dis time, na stress, na fear."" Several years don pass now since Esther leave her husband. And even though, practically, e bin dey more easier to comot dan e go be today, e still take time and courage. ''I feel say I dey place wia get bars and I no fit comot because economically, emotionally, psychologically, e hard well well - and den my children dey too. Also, your mama dey happy say you don marry, so you dey reason - keep her happy. Stay.'' For women wey wan leave dia partner now during lockdown, di challenge dey even bigger. If dem try to leave, police fit challenge dem say dem break curfew and dem fit struggle to find public transport. Many kontries don set up helplines, dey offer advice and support to victims. Demand for dia services dey high. During di first week of lockdown for South Africa, police receive 2,320 reports of gender-based violence - 37% higher dan usual. For Zimbabwe, one helpline say di number of abuse cases dem document bin triple, while Nigerian gender advocate, Dorothy Njemanze, tell BBC News say she dey worried by di rise of abuse cases for her kontri: ""We fear say if e continue dis way, we fit record some deaths before di lockdown over.'' Some African states dey take practical steps to help women.

For some oda place dem, many shelters don manage to stay open and volunteers dey able to help women to escape. For Zimbabwe, di Roots One Stop Shelter dey currently house 21 adults and seven children. Di director, Beatrice Savadye, say dem dey manage to rescue women from dia homes and dey also get referrals from police. For Kenya also, social worker Dianah Kamande say shelters still dey able to house women and say her organisation don already rescue 17 women for Nairobi alone. For Nigeria, although most women shelters don close as part of di lockdown, volunteers still dey able to help women escape and move in with dia relatives, according to Titilayo Vivour, di coordinator for di Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team. But for Ghana main safe house, di Ark Shelter, director Nana Sunnu say dem dey unable to take in new clients because of di infection risk and lack of quarantine facilities. Esther, wey survive violent marriage and dey work with fellow survivors now, say make women still call di helpline even if dem dey for kontri wia di shelters dey closed. ""Try and reach out to activists wey dey for social media, activists wey you fit trust. Call dem, dem fit still do something even for dis lockdown situation.'' Make Communities also look out for neighbours wey dem tink say fit dey exposed to violence, according to South African psychologist Nthabiseng Ramothwala. She also advise women to seek help from di pipo around dem. ''Know police officers and emergency numbers you fit call,"" she tell BBC. ""Involve your neighbours as well, tell dem signs to look out for so you to know wen to help. Give dem numbers of close relatives wey fit come rescue you."" And for those wey really fit no escape, Esther get some final advice. ""You no need to stop your voice to make someone else feel better, but for dis situation, if dem tok something wey pain you, just ignore dem. If dem annoy you, go read book, do something else to take your mind away from dem. ''If you fit survive di next one or two or three months... den do whatever you need to do.

Coronavirus: Garlic, heat, ice cream dey among fake COVID-19 disease advice you need to ignore	"Coronavirus outbreak alias COVID-19 disease wey dey affect more and more kontries around di world don make some pipo dey give different heath advise online as e be say di disease neva get any cure. We wan torchlight some of di popular myths or fake claims wey pipo don share online about wetin fit cure di virus and explain wetin science tok concerning di claim. Plenti posts for facebook advice pipo say make dem dey chop garlic to prevent infection. World Health Organization (WHO) tok say while garlic na ""healthy food wey fit get some antimicrobial properties"", e no get any evidence or proof wey show say if pesin chop am, e fit protect dem from di new coronavirus. Also too much garlic fit sometimes cause harm to pesin bodi, for example, South China Morning Post report one tori of one woman wey dem rush go hospital for treatment sake of say her throat swell up afta she chop 1.5kg of raw garlic. We know, in general, say eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water dey good for staying healthy. But no evidence don show say some kian food fit help fight dis particular virus. Plenti advise don full social media wey say heat dey kill coronavirus, and so make pipo dey drink hot water, take hot baths, or use hairdryers. One fake post wey no truly come from Unicef but wey plenti pipo from different kontries copy and paste - claim say drinking hot water and exposure to sun go kill di virus, plus make pipo avoid ice cream Charlotte Gornitzka, wey dey for Unicef on coronavirus misinformation, tok say: ""Dat recent lie-lie online message... wey pipo claim say na Unicef post am, wey dey advise pipo to avoid ice cream and oda cold foods to help prevent di disease. no be true at all, na big lie."" We know say di flu virus no dey survive well outside di body during hot weather, but we neva get evidence wey prove how heat dey affect di new coronavirus. Gornitzka, tok One sabi pesin, Professor Sally Bloomfield say Trying to heat your body or expose yoursef to di sun - to prevent di virus - no dey work at all. Once di virus dey your body, e no get any way wey you fit take kill am- your body just need to fight am off. Outside di body, ""to actively kill di virus you need temperatures of around 60 degrees"", and dis dey far hotter than any bath or sauna. Professor Bloomfield tok. Washing bed linen or towels at 60 degrees na good idea, as dis fit kill any virus for di material. But no be good option for washing your skin. And bathing hot water or drinking hot liquids no go change your actual body temperature, wey remain stable unless you already dey sick. One post, wey plenti pipo for Facebook copy and paste quote one ""Japanese doctor"" wey recommend say make pipo dey drink water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus wey fit don enta di mouth. One version of dis post inside Arabic language don get more than 250,000 shares. Professor Bloomfield tok say no evidence don show say drinking water every 15 minutes go help. Airborne virus dey enta di body through di respiratory tract wen you breathe in. Some of dem fit go inside your mouth, and even drinking water no go prevent you from catching di virus. Anyway shall, drinking water and to stay hydrated na generally good medical advice. One YouTube pesin, Jordan Sather, wey get thousands of followers, claim say ""miracle mineral supplement"", wey dem dey call MMS, fit ""wipe out"" coronavirus. Di tin contain chlorine dioxide - bleaching agent. Sather and odas promote di substance even before di coronavirus outbreak, and for January e come tweet say, ""no be only say chlorine dioxide (aka MMS) dey strong for cancer cell killer, e fit wipe out coronavirus too"". Last year, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sama warning about di health danger wey dey if pesin drink MMS. Health authorities for oda kontries also bring out alerts about dis substance. Di FDA say ""dem no know of any research wey show say dis products dey safe or fit treat any illness"". Dem sama warning say drinking dis substance fit cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and symptoms of serious dehyrdation. Na for one American televangelist, Jim Bakker show dem promote di use of colloidal silver- wey be liquid wey contain tiny particles of silver. One guest for di show claim say di solution dey kill some strains of coronavirus within 12 hours (But e agree say dem neva test am on Covid-19). Pipo wey support colloidal silver treatment idea dey claim say e fit treat all kind of health conditions, act as antiseptic, and help di immune system. But US health authorities don give clear advice say no evidence don show say dis type of silver fit cure any health condition. Dem add say colloidal silver fit even cause serious side effect including kidney damage, seizures and argyria - dat na condition wey dey make pesin skin to turn blue. Di post of some of di pipo wey dey promote di use of colloidal silver inside social media don get one pop-up warning from Facebook fact-checking service.

Togo national football team attack: Survivors remember machine gun ambush, 10 years afta	"On 8 January 2010, di Africa Cup of Nations for Angola bin only remain few days before e start. I bin dey di province of Cabinda, dey prepare to cover Group B for di BBC World Service, and bin also dey in charge of handing ova di BBC African Footballer of the Year trophy to di newly-crowned winner, Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba. As di day waka dey go, unconfam reports of shooting, wey involve Togo national team, start to fly evriwia. Di detail bin no clear, but e clear say sometin serious don happun. How serious di tin be show wen I meet di squad as dem dey return to dia hotel for Cabinda city. I ask to speak to someone, dem immediately tell me say di team tok-tok pesin na dia best-known player - wey be Manchester City star Emmanuel Adebayor. Wen e siddon to tok, e give shocking details of di attack wey kill two members of di Togo delegation and result in life changing injuries to some odas. 10 years afta, dis na di tori from team members wey make global headlines and wetin happun afta. Togo squad bin dey in good spirits days before di 2010 Nations Cup. Dem just qualify back for di tournament afta dem miss out for 2008 and bin dey prepare to take on group wey feature some of di biggest names for African football - Drogba Ivory Coast and Michael Essien Ghana bin dey di same group. Before di tournament, Togo decide to camp for Pointe Noir for Republic of Congo, just over 100km from wia dem go play dia group games for Angola city of Cabinda. Cabinda dey separate from di rest of Angola, and instead of di Togo suad to fly from wia dem dey to di capital Luanda and den fly back north again, dem choose to drive. Dis decision later end with bad result. Afta di suqad relax in di evening, di night before - dem travel go di border. Players bin just dey laugh and joking amongst demselves for di bus. Angola security forces join dem for di border and suppose escort dem through di forest - wey be di base of one groups wey dey call for independence from Angola - to Cabinda city. Di squad no pay much attention to dia arrival. Dem no know say very soon dem go begin fight for di lives of everyone inside di Togo team bus. Di small convoy move from di border, to di road through di forest. Looking back 10 years, midfielder Junior Senaya recall di journey, and di moment everitin change. ""All of us bin dey enjoy, afta we don cross di border. Some of us bin dey busy dey listen to music. I remember afta 15 minutes wey we don dey drive we hear gunshot for di forest - we all laugh, make joke. Den serious shooting start."" Di first casualty happen before anybody even know wetin dey go on. Senaya remember Togo media officer, Stanislas Ocloo, bin stand to video dia arrival for Angola at di moment of di attack. Dem shoot kill am. Anoda player wey remember clearly those crazy moments na goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale. Im life change for just few seconds, as e realise say dem don shoot am too. ""I hear di sound of di machine gun,"" Im tok, ""and for dat very moment I bin want move go hide, e bin dey as if dem nail me to chair. ""Dat na wen I see myself - both my belle and my back begin bleed. Dat na wen I begin panic. I say: 'Dem don hit me, help me, help me, I want see my daughter, my son. I no wan die here.'"" Even as im dey handle e own injuries, and fear, Obilale bin dey able to remember and tok wetin happun dat day. Im remember as assistant coach Amelete Abalo shout say dem don shoot am - di 54-year-na one of di pipo wey die for di attack. E remember one team-mate wey get military training call for weapon, so dat e go fit fight back. Di team bin no dey able to escape from di shooting because di bus driver - Mario Adjoua - don also wunjure for di start of di attack. Di convoy by-force stop, and serious firefight brake out between di attackers and di security forces. Memories of how long e last dey different, but everyone agree say na at least 30 minutes e last. Adebayor tok about how serious di longest half hour of e life dey. ""No be like say one or two guys shoot one or two times on our bus,"" Adebayor tell me afta im don dey safe place for di team hotel few hours afta di attack. ""We don dey di middle of dat for 30 minutes or even more. Our bus bin don stop and pipo bin don dey shoot our bus for 30 minutes. Can you imagine? Honestly na one of di worst experiences I don eva get for my life. ""Without di security den I no go dey here dey tok you. Maybe na my dead body you fit dey tok to."" Accounts of how e all end different - Adebayor describe one fleet of 4x4 vehicles arrive to take di squad away even as dem still dey shoot from di forest, while Senaya remember silence. But eventually dem take all of dem to hospital for di outskirts of Cabinda City, wia those wey noting do help carry dia dead and colleagues wey wunjure inside. ""Those na di times wey you realise wetin dey happun really, wen I take one of di players inside di hospital,"" Adebayor tok. ""Wen I come out, I see all di players, and everyone bin dey cry, everyone bin dey tok about dia family, calling pipo, calling dia mama, dey cry for phone. ""I think dat na di worst moment of dis day, because you fit see pipo tell dia last words, because dem think say dem go die."" Shortly afta dat di squad security men leave di squad on dia own wit few local officials. Wit dead and injured friends and colleagues for hospital, dem later walk short distance to dia hotel compound, without any security whatsoever. Dat na wia I come across dem, and I walk wit di team as dem waka go back dia accommodation. All four teams for di group bin dey stay for di same compound and Kolo Toure and couple of oda Ivorians come to offer condolences and find out wetin happen - rumours bin done already spread. Di survivors den sidon to eat - e bin dey late for evening, by dis point dem neva chop anytin since. Throughout di meal, evriwia bin dey silent. Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex. Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly. Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s. Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery. Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team. If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort? And na di militarised escort cause di attack? None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next. For several days e no dey clear to those of us wey watch from di outside wetin go happen. Rumours suggest say split bin dey between those for camp wey want continue wit di tournament and those wey want go home. In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged ""government interference"" for football. Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave. But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault. Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale. Initially tori spread say im die too. Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery. Since den e don face eight major operations and don get to rebuild e life, physically and emotionally. ""I done do lot of tins, and I happy say I do dem. I go back to school, take exams, work and write book,"" im tok. For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work. Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body. On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas. Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support. Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010. Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack. Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day. ""E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down,"" na so im tok. ""I really no fit recover... I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked."" Now im dey study for e coaching badges. E last for half an hour, maybe a little more. Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute. But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.

For im office, across di street from di Senate building, hangs a T-shirt wit di slogan ""I stand wit Salvini"" - a sign of im support for im party leader, Matteo Salvini. Wen im bin dey goment, Mr Salvini famously turned away migrant boats, leaving hundreds stranded for di Mediterranean Sea last summer. But Mr Iwobi insists di League no be anti-immigration. ""We stand for legal migration. Anybody wey come through di right channel legally dey highly welcomed. We dey for refugees, but we dey against illegal immigration and death tunnel,"" na so Iwobi tok, as im dey refer to di thousands of immigrants wey don die as dem dey try to reach Europe. ""E dey against human dignity."" Like im party leader, Iwobi see di arrival of plenti African migrants, wey dey cross di desert and sea to land for Italy, as di result of failed migration policy. His view dey shared by anoda black Italian, Paolo Diop. Now 30, Diop land for Italy from Senegal wen e dey two years. Diop na immigration spokesman for far-right party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), wey get roots for Italy old fascist movement. ""I be di son of immigrants wey arrive Italy legally at a time wen Italy economy bin dey grow. Now no dey grow, so we no fit welcome economic migrants any longer."" Mr Diop say im neva experience discrimination, but for February 2018, for Macerata, di town wia im dey live, fellow right-wing activist Luca Traini shoot and wunjure six African migrants. Mr Diop bin know Traini, wey currently dey serve 12-year jail term. ""We bin dey di same political circles. Na good pesin im bin be. I no ever get any problems wit am. I no go ever want to inspire someone wey carry out such acts. Diop say African migrants for Italy need to learn trade den go home and ""make Africa great"". But so far di message no dey get through. Musician Tommy Kuti believe right-politicians dey exploit scenes like this. ""Dem like that situation of chaos,"" im tok, ""to scare Italian pipo and make am right for dem to push discriminatory laws."" Like Senator Iwobi, dem born Kuti for Nigeria - im move go Italy with im parents wen im small. Now a successful rapper, im music explores identity and politics and dey criticise di League. ""I tink Toni Iwobi na something wey dey really work against migrants for Italy for time wen we need pipo to fight for us to get us more rights."" Kuti tink say white Italians believe ""every black pesin na migrant"". For Angelica Pesarini, di roots of attitudes to race for Italy dey deep. She dey teach course for Black Italia for New York University in Florence. ""Italy colonial past - especially di fascist regime - don always dey very connected to ideas of race and whiteness and dis still dey visible nowadays. Becos to be Italian is to be white,"" she explains. Though born in Italy, Dr Pesarini's family come from Eritrea and Somalia, connection wey go back to Italy colonial adventure for di Horn of Africa. Pipo from Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea grow up learning Italian and absorbing di culture. Those wey move go Italy shock to discover how little Italians know about dem. And even today, many Italians dey ignorant about dia kontri colonial past, na so Dr Pesarini tok. ""I feel I gats to justify my Italian-ness a lot... People assume I no fit be Italian. And so even wen pipo ask me: ''Wia you I come from?' I go say: 'from Rome'. Den dem go ask: 'No, but wia I really come from?' I den realise how race and colonialism and whiteness dey connected to Italian identity today."" Activists want di goment to make am easier for second-generation immigrants, those born and raised in Italy, to claim Italian citizenship. Dia biggest opponents na Paolo Diop Brothers of Italy and Senator Iwobi party, di League. Mr Iwobi dismisses activists' concerns, as im claim say those wey dem den Italian citizenship no follow di regulations. As for those illegal immigrants wey still dey live for Italy, Senator Iwobi want di goment to help dem gain new skills to allow for wetin im call ""voluntary repatriation"". Rapper Tommy Kuti no agree wit di senator's ideas: ""I tink if im want migrants to stay in Africa, make im set good example and take e ass back to Africa.""

Yasuke: Di ogbonge African samurai	"Almost 500 years ago, one tall African man land for Japan. E go later become di first foreign-born man to achieve di status of samurai warrior, and e also be di subject of two feems wey Hollywood dey produce. Dem call am Yasuke, di man na warrior wey reach di rank of samurai under di rule of Oda Nobunaga - one powerful 16th Century Japanese lord wey be di first of di three pipo wey unify Japan. No be small tin im arrival for Kyoto, di capital at dat time for 1579, cause, sotay pipo bin climb over one anoda to see am, according to sabi pesin ontop history Lawrence Winkler, some pipo die afta dem crush dem to death as dem dey hustle to see im face. Inside one year, Yasuke shaparly join di upper warrior class of Japan, di samurai. E no too tey too before im sabi speak Japanese well-well, dey ride with Nobunaga for battle. ""Im height be 6 shaku 2 sun (roughly 6 feet, 2 inches (1.88m)... e black, and im skin be like charcoal,"" im fellow samurai, Matsudaira Ietada, bin describe am for im diary for 1579. Di average height of Japanese man dat time for 1900 na 157.9m (5 feet 2 inches) so Yasuke go don tall pass most of di Japanese pipo for di 16th Century, time wen pipo dey generally shorter because of bad nutrition. Records of Yasuke date or di kontri wia dem born am no dey. Most historians say im come from Mozambique but some don suggest oda kontries like Ethiopia or Nigeria. Wetin pipo sabi na say, Yasuke land Japan with one Italian Jesuit, Alessandro Valignano, to do one inspection tour, im appear for history wey dem record only between 1579 and 1582. Some sabi pipo say im be slave, but e dey hard to conclude. Floyd Webb and Deborah DeSnoo, filmmakers wey dey do di documentary on im life, believe say tok say im be slave na just tok-tok. ""E for dey impossible for Yasuke to rise to di rank of samurai in just one year without warrior background,"" Ms DeSnoo tok. Samurais dey most time start dia training from childhood. E no too tey wen Yasuke land Japan wen e meet Nobunaga and im generate interest for am, di feem makers dem say dis wan happun as a result of im conversation skills. Yasuke bin don already sabi speak small Japanese and di two men flow well-well, according to sabi pesin Thomas Lockey, wey don write book ontop Yasuke.

Yasuke totori French-Ivorian writer Serge Bile sotay im write book about di warrior. ""Na part of di mystery wey surround am. Na why e dey totori me,"" e tell BBC. Nobunaga begin like Yasuke, like am sotay im treat am like family - di African dey among selected group of pipo wey im allow to siddon chop with am. ""Nobunaga hail Yasuke strength and stature, e describe im might like dat of 10 men,"" Ms DeSnoo says. Wen Nobunaga make Yasuke samurai, dem bin never tink am say pesin wey no come from Japan fit become samurai. Later, oda foreigners too go begin collect di title. As di first foreign-born samurai, Yasuke fight important battles togeda with Oda Nobunaga. Yasuke also dey dia on dat fateful night wey one of Nobunaga generals, Akechi Mitsuhide, betray and put fire for di warlord palace , trap Nobunaga inside one of di rooms. Nobunaga take im own life through di performance of seppuku, wey be suicide ritual. Before e kill imself, e ask Yasuke to comot im head and take im head and sword to im son, according to historian Thomas Lockley. Dis na sign of great trust. Di legend of Yasuke end small time afta dis event, for 1582. Di fall of Nobunaga for di hands of di disloyal general lead to di banishment of di first black samurai, maybe back to im Jesuit mission for Kyoto. Although im fate and di last years of im life no clear, Yasuke continue to dey live on for di mind of many Japanese wey grow up with di award-winning children tori book Kuro-suke (kuro wey mean ""black"" for Japanese) wey Kurusu Yoshio write.
