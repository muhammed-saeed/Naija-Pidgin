English as a Second Language Curriculum Framework for Adults
Technical Assistance Paper
 


Introduction

The mission of the Curriculum Practitioners’ Task Force is to develop a Michigan model for adult education using state and national curriculum standards.

In order to provide consistent delivery of English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction throughout the State of Michigan, adult educators need program area performance standards and curriculum that will enable them to meet their students’ needs. Thus, the Practitioners’ Task Force Committee for Curriculum and Instruction developed content standards for English as a Second Language programs that reflect real-world English language proficiency needs of students.

Purpose
The purpose of this curriculum is to provide guidelines for English language instruction for limited English proficient adults that will increase their ability to communicate in English.
The content is compatible with principles of language acquisition for adult learners of English and includes skills useful in community, workplace, and academic applications. Skills are integrated into reading, writing, speaking, and listening strands.


Terminology

Content Standards
The content standards identify core elements of second language learning that are important, yet general enough to relate to adult education contexts throughout the State of Michigan. The primary strands, Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing, permeate all language learning contexts. These are guidelines. They are not lesson plans and are not intended to be all inclusive. Providers will need to develop curricula based on their own population needs.
Strands
Strands are sub-divisions of the content standards. They are more specific to the skills and knowledge a learner needs to have in order to master the more broadly stated content standard. The ESL primary strands are listening, speaking, reading, and writing.
Benchmarks
Benchmarks describe what skills students at specific levels should know or be able to accomplish for a given standard. The specific levels are based on the NRS “Measures and Methods for the National Reporting System for Adult Education.” There may be multiple benchmarks for each level under a content standard.
Applications
Applications indicate examples of how or where a student may demonstrate attainment of a benchmark. These applications represent only examples of attainment and are not exhaustive or mandatory.
Numbering
The benchmarks have been numbered to help identify specific information. The numbers indicate the following:
 The first number indicates the Educational Functioning Level The second number indicates the strand The third number indicates the benchmark. 

For example:
 - 1.2.1 is translated as Beginning ESL Literacy, Speaking Strand, and the first benchmark. - 4.3.2. is translated as Low Intermediate ESL, Reading Strand, and the second benchmark. 

Educational Functioning Levels
The National Reporting System (NRS) in cooperation with the US Department of Education - Division of Adult Education and Literacy revised a system (Effective July 1, 2006) that identifies ESL student performance at six Educational Functioning Levels (EFLs). Any movement up the Educational Functioning Level scale is considered an educational gain. (See Appendix A.)
 Beginning ESL Literacy Low Beginning ESL High Beginning ESL Low Intermediate ESL High Intermediate ESL Advanced ESL 


Learners in the Beginning ESL Literacy Level fall into one of three categories:
 Low first language literacy and low speaking ability Low first language literacy and high speaking ability First language literacy but a different alphabet or learned English by ear 

Summary
The ESL Curriculum and Instruction Standards represent a common framework that teachers and programs may use to link curriculum and instruction, along with assessment and evaluation, to achievement of real-life skills.
