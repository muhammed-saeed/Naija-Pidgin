When I was 16, I started growing a goatee, and a lot of people said I looked like Jesus. I was playing a multi game of Descent, and my friend, who plays as Rinesin, said something to the effect of&quot;Uh oh, here comes Jesus Christ to beat the crap out of us sinners!&quot;so I logged on as CHRYSt (the lowercase -t- in descent looked a bit like a cross) and it&apos;s stuck since.

It&apos;s what people always used to call me for some strange reason when I was over in Croatia (where my mum&apos;s from).

Last year when I got Tiberian Sun, I needed a name for Westwood Online. Zac was already taken. I was trying to think of variations on the name when the Asterix series crossed my mind. I tried Zaccix and it worked. So I&apos;ve used it everywhere ever since /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

I was also chatting to a friend on MSN Messenger at the time, and he wanted me to try ProZac just for fun, so I did, it worked and I&apos;m on WO as that too hehehe.

nguid:167703 Axel 31st Jan 2000, 02:20 AM Well heres how it happened when i 1st went on the internet i had to set up an e-mail account (remember that guys)as my name is alex i tried that but it was already claimed duh!!! so then i tried Alex with any number and thought of 40 but that was claimed as well, started to piss me off now so i mixed up Alex and got Axel,clever stuff huh?so now i stuck with it for a few years and its just grown on me. el Gato 31st Jan 2000, 02:40 AM &apos;el Gato&apos; is Spanish for &apos;the cat&apos;. It was the nickname of Eddie Elgeuria, a badass skateboarder from the 80&apos;s. Back then, concrete sk8parks and pools were the $hit, and he ruled both. People called him &apos;the cat&apos; because he was smooth and sly. He was totally underated and almost unknown. Plus, he had lots of killer tatoos. Nuf said.

so i decided to create my own name. being relatively new to the net in general, i tried to pick a ghostly/scary name kinda thing, and also i had a thing for 1 syllable names. i tried Void but it was of course taken. Voyd worked tho. i played even better under my own name, and it stuck ever since.

And, being, the newbie I was, I was dying a lot and missing a lot. Never quite in the negative scores, but close /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif.

Anyhow, we have a saying where I come from,&quot;Scrag him!&quot;, which basically means beat the crap out of someone. Since that was happening to me a lot, I went for the past tense of&quot;to scrag&quot;and pretty much got attached to it. &apos;Course, I&apos;m still in the realm of average so it still applies on some servers.

I thought the word&quot;Celeron&quot;was quite cool so I swapped the C for my first initial, and replaced the N with an X cos it looked good.

I listened to that crazy computer talking in the prison ship and thought to myself,&quot;That&apos;s kind of like &apos;hal&apos; the computer in 2001&quot;. You know,&quot;Good morning, Dave.&quot;. When I finished the game, I couldn&apos;t wait to try it online (that was initially dissappointing) and I needed a sci-fi kind of name. My real name is Dave, and I new that wouldn&apos;t work...so I became the computer famous for saying my name!

hal{PuF} Rooster 31st Jan 2000, 08:24 AM Rooster: What some call a sniper, made famous by the group Alice in Chains, by song of the same name.

I&apos;m finding it&apos;s not as unique as it was when I started using it a few years ago.

I may change names later to: Micronaut

Micronaut: When I worked at Micron (Technologies), we worked long hours (12 hour shifts, 3/4 days a week - which made for a great schedule actually - except when you had to work /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif) and frequented a bar at 6:30am on the weekends after work. One of the first times to the bar, a friend of mine introduced me as&quot;a fellow Micronaut&quot;. When working in the FAB&apos;s (a cleanroom environment) we had to wear the bunny suits, so it tended to make us look a little like astronauts. I suppose Micronaut would be more unique and certainly has more history too it, but I like Rooster. /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

I downloaded the demo and, being a huge Doom fan, I hated Quake because it was not Doom. But, sadly, I became addicted to the online play. Feeling like a traitor, I hit upon the idea of a veteran member of the Doom space marines kicking *** in a new world of Quake. After all, the old ways were better in my mind. I found a Doom marine skin on the Internet and have been a Doom Trooper ever since. Neo[PuF] 31st Jan 2000, 10:30 AM As you can see from my sig (and previous posts), I have a lack of: humour/wit/talent/creativity/spelling/etc.

I saw the film &apos;The Matrix&apos; the night before!
Its that easy, did you get it?

I suppose its easy for people to type in-game too. I hate long names!

http://www.planetunreal.com/images/bullet2.gif
Insert witty signature here. Malsar 31st Jan 2000, 11:38 AM Malsar is just a cool sounding name (at least I think so). I first used it in an RPG playing a wizard who was one of the few characters I ever played that would consistanly kick butt. So I have a rather positive feeling about the name.

Subjugator is my First Person Shooter name. I first used it as a starship name for a very effective cruiser in Master of Orion. After repeatedly kicking butt with it in MOO (and MOO 2), I thought it would be great for FPS. So when I first started playing Jedi Knight online, I used it. Later when I was a part time Quaker (Quake II actually, I hated the first one), I went back to Malsar. Now playing UT online, I like Subjugator again. I keep switching. However, I like humorous names more than I used to. I am thinking of going under a new name soon...one which no one will every forget...

Probably won&apos;t be anytime soon that I get my revenge but, hey, nothing wrong with a little wishful thinking ty_Fortune 31st Jan 2000, 11:47 AM My name is Eric and my older brother used to always call me E-Money back in the day. For the longest I used that as my online gaming name and it still is my ICQ alias. In November of &apos;98 I joined Clan Beanie Babies (http://www.clanbeaniebabies.org) with some of my online friends. I had to choose the name of a beanie to stick with the theme. I chose Fortune the Panda because it goes along with E-Money(Ching Ching!!). Come to find out it&apos;s Fortune as in fortune cookie(Pandas are from China), not fortune meaning rich. I still like the name though.
My clanmates call me Fort or 40.

Larry Norman is widely considered to be the godfather of Christian rock (and is still an outsider to this day, tho the accident on the plane may have more to do with that than anything, but I digress). He had a dog named Phydeaux (pronounced Fido) and I thought it was clever in the early 70&apos;s when I first saw it printed in the liner notes of an album; it&apos;s been floating around in my head ever since. /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

LOL) got sick of it, stole a name from someone else I saw which brought me to Homicide. Used Homicide when I first got UT. Then I decided to start a clan, my friend and I said Angels Clan sounds cool if you make your name go with the tag, so I chose something that had to do with Angels, chose Fallen|Angel| and kept it for a while now.

nguid:167703 Malkavin[AgL] 31st Jan 2000, 03:38 PM When I used to live in Dallas, they built this place off of Greenville Ave. called Virtual World. It was really cool and I spent alot of my free time there on weekends(it was also coupled with a UA theatre). The first time I went, they had these BattleTech type games that you could play for like $5 a pop. And they had you make up a&quot;pilots&quot;name.

Since I had just bought Vampire the Masqurade(roleplaying game), they had some real killer artwork by this guy named Tim BradStreet. One pic was of these two vampires named Malkavin and Thrall.

Since I had to make a choice on my pilots name at Virtual World, I thought of that pic, named myself Malkavin, and it&apos;s stuck ever since. Although I have flirted with changing it, I can&apos;t seem to do it. Gotta stick with the name that is bound in nerd tradition.

I&apos;ve been using this as an in game (any kind) for umm.... geeze over 15 years now?!

I started using it with Sierra&apos;s Hero&apos;s Quest (now name Quest for Glory). I needed an adventurers name and I was just out of ideas. My brother had a program for our TRS-80 called Alien Names or something like that. It was essentially a random word generator. I plugged in a couple of variables and from the list that popped out tykeal just kinda jumped out at me.

Funny thing is that I&apos;ve been using it so long now that I will answer to it like my own name *grin*. Of course I was really happy when an issue of Dragon Magazine several months back had an elvish name generator in it and the sylables of my name kinda fell together as meaning something like Crystal Music or something funky like that /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

Unfortunately someone claimed my name before I could use it for UT so I went by my voodooextreme name&quot;Mr Z&quot;for awhile until someone started using it as well. I tried using&quot;Ubel ein&quot;which is German for&quot;Evil one&quot;but it didn&apos;t quite fit. So here I was nameless and lost. Then out of nowhere I remembered an old Miller commercial where there was this Beaver that was running around terrorizing these outdoor people and there was this cheesy Spinal Tap butt-rock metal playing in the background...it was a great commercial. And from there boys and girls the Evil_Beaver was born.

I hate how difficult it is to get an original name these days! Even very obscure words are popular now.. hmmph!

Anyway, Zeitgeist is German.. literally it means&quot;timeghost&quot;but it&apos;s been adopted into the english language..
In english it means&quot;spirit of the times&quot;which sounds pretty cool to me. Besides, it sounds harsh and I like the German language, so I&apos;ll probably stick with this nickname for a while yet /~unreal/ubb/html/wink.gif

Quake was the only game that would run (sometimes) on my old Cyrix 6x86 system, but I did have @Home cable. Since @Home endorses Heat.net, I decided to sign up. Well, I decided to choose the name &apos;HAWS&apos; because it was my email address spelled backwards-swah@home.com. However, some twisted individual had already taken the name, so I decided to switch the letters around-HWAS. I thought I could remember it better that way (I was a newbie, ya know http://route89.com/~wacko99/smile/roll.gif ). phishedNET 31st Jan 2000, 07:51 PM I hear ya on the finding a unique name these days..

hal{PuF} UF-DustPuppy 1st Feb 2000, 09:04 AM I&apos;ve used DustPuppy for about 3 weeks. I only use it for this board, and some UT games. My real nick is BoDyCoUnT.

5 Years ago, in college, I was infatuated with Body Count the album for some reasons. When I was introduced to Mirc at first, I used most song_names as a nick. I was Evil_Dick, BornDead, Cop_Killer (All for no reasons as I was the skinny geek who thinks himself a badass online /~unreal/ubb/html/wink.gif) I finally settled on BoDyCoUnT and it&apos;s been mine for 4 years now. I have only seen one other person with the nick, and it was on UT.

A little note, my first ever nick, on a local bbs, before the BC craze was Vassago (From the Hideaway book/movie by Dean R. Koonts, which represents a servant of the prince of darkness). I LOVE that nick, then someday someone came and told me to get rid of it, and never use it again if I did not want to be&quot;mail-bombed&quot;? Innocent as I was then, I listened. Apparently, Vassago, was one of the biggest Hackers, responsible for many viruses. I&apos;m still not sure if that was true or not, but that&apos;s my story.

BC Stamp 1st Feb 2000, 09:26 AM Well I&apos;m just as boring as bowls. I kept the same nick from packman days, which was KZZ and was quite well known by it. About 5 years ago I decided to change it and then started changing it for each game and sometimes more often. My usual method is to cast my eye around the desk or room and see what it bumps into. Thus, postage Stamp.

Once it was a note from a friend, &apos;gone_fishing&apos; but that was copied 2 or 3 weeks later. So I changed it, this time the first thing I saw was my friends (not the same one) leg, so BartSleg. and so on ...

http://www.planetunreal.com/images/bullet2.gif
Fair is Fun. LordNor 1st Feb 2000, 10:27 AM The way I got my nic was kind of cool. I used to use all different kinds of stupid names. A close friend of mine and I used to&quot;Duke it out.&quot;(Duke Nukem 3D) all the time. It was about the time when the New adventures of superman were on and the episode where Clarks alien parents came to earth. My fiend and I played a game and he used Superman&apos;s name givin to him by his parents. (Kal&apos;el) He enemy at the time was Lord Nor so as a joke I used that next time we played and it just stuck.
There ya go. LordKhaine 1st Feb 2000, 01:22 PM Ive stuck with variations of my name for years. It started as Kain. Dont ask me why. (And no it wasnt from Command and Conquer). I then changed it to Khaine. (As in the dark Elf god of Murder, or the eldar god of War). And then I added Lord to it because it made me sound like a good player /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif. And thats what I call my self now, and probably always will. If any one wants a kool sounding name try:

Malice
Hatred
Anthrax
Kharn
Retribution


A nice themed selection I think youll agree.
/~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif CoRKSKReW 1st Feb 2000, 01:38 PM I used to go by the name Arbitrator when Halflife first came out, before then I had got Music for my playstation, and &apos;Stuart Myers&apos; wouldn&apos;t fit in the artist box, so. being inspired by CoLD SToRaGe I opted for CoRKSKReW, as in rollercoaster sideways loop. Not the &apos;other Skrewing&apos;

Suprisingly, CoRKSKReW has not been found anywhere else. And my TFC logo has the KReW in backwards - korn style to meake it reflect over the S.. Or summit, here is a pic of my [SAS]CoRKSKReW logo to show.

I had a stack load of Micronauts stuff when I was a kid. I can still fondly remember the Force Commander and his arch-enemy, Baron Somebody-or-other (OK, maybe I don&apos;t remember that well). They each had a horse that you could take the head off, take their legs off and join them together to make them centaurs (no, I&apos;ve not been smoking anything). Happy days. I can still remember getting a right telling off for soaking the carpet with the Terraphant&apos;s Acid Trunk Spray (read: water).

Time for the dried frog pills, I think

Finsternis is an uncommon german translation for&quot;Darkness&quot;. I think it sounds very cool. But it&apos;s quite long so online i am adressed as Fin or Fins which is fine with me.
haven&apos;t seen anybody using that name except myself so far. :-)

Quake is not the answer. Quake is the question. NO is the answer. Indiscriminate 2nd Feb 2000, 08:50 PM The first name I had was CptBligg. My friends actually named my first computer, a zippy P-75, 8mb ram. How they came up with Bligg is still a wonder to me, but I was its&quot;captain&quot;hence the joining of the two, to CptBligg. I&apos;ve built another since then, much nicer, but the name no longer applies. I was off FPSs for awhile and right before I started playing again I watched Interview with a Vampire. I really liked *grins evilly* a line in it (see sig) I think it suits me well.

Indiscriminate
=========================
&quot;God kills indiscriminately, and so shall we... Temporary Account 2nd Feb 2000, 09:19 PM I&apos;ve gone by a few online nicks, but this is my longest one, and the only I&apos;ve used in FPS&apos;s. It comes from the fact that I&apos;m tall, hairy, and hate camera&apos;s /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif And everyone always calls one of my friends an Ozark Yeti(don&apos;t ask), so he&apos;s a yeti, and I&apos;m a Sasquatch.

Before Sasquatch I was FreeJacker, somewhat after the movie Freejack. Before that Static, but it was too common. Before that Cerberus after the comic.

And as for why I chose&quot;Temporary Account&quot;for my handle here...Sasquatch was taken, and I was in the process of starting up a clan (Cosmic Monsters, Inc. www.cosmicmonstersinc.com (http://www.cosmicmonstersinc.com)) and I hadn&apos;t decided what my clan name would be(Soul-Crusher). I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d be hanging around here, and I was going to change it to my new clan handle, so I put in Temporary Account...but I kinda like it /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

And for those of you who think Soul-Crusher is presumptuous, I agree with you, but the clan has a theme. If you figure out what it is, you&apos;ll understand. The other members are Spiderbaby, Ressurection_Joe and Knuckleduster.

Anyways...that&apos;s my story.

But as of today to coincide with my new DSL connect my on-line name will be Sloat...as in Morgan Sloat in the Stephen King\Peter Straub book&quot;The Talisman&quot;. SONICMAN2[PuF] 15th Mar 2000, 05:43 PM Well, Ive had this nickname for awhile now while I&apos;ve been playing LinksLS for the last 5-6 years or so.

When I 1st started playing UT online I 1st tried to pick a&quot;cool&quot;name that fit the game, hence the name Gongin(dont ask..just sounded like UT LOL). But after awhile to keep things simple and in case I bumped into anyone from Links, I have kept it SONICMAN2.

So now, WHY SONICMAN2??? No, I dont like the Seattle Suppersonics as how most people think. I own a SONIC Drive-In(fast food restaurant) in Lafatte Ga. Been doing this for 20+ years. For those that have never seen 1, we are a 50&apos;s style theme with carhop service(where you drive up and order from the car and we bring it out 2 ya!)

Thats all! 8-)

He&apos;s not dead, He&apos;s electroencephalographically challenged. Psychomoggiebagpuss 15th Mar 2000, 06:02 PM I first used this nickname about 4 years ago when I first started playing quakeworld. (We stuck three copies of QW server on the main file server at work /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif 1 DM, 1 CTF and one using the painkeep mod (I loved the gravity well /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif) It&apos;s great having administrator rights on the network - you lock the server and the only way to get back on it is to,
A) either log back on as yourself, or
B) log back on as somebody else with administrator rights. When this happens it shuts down the programs running b4 the other person gets to see them /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif).

Where did the nickname actually came from? I was being particulary creative that day (this was back when I had a fondness for the waccy baccy). My younger sister goes by the handle Satanic_Carebear /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

Then I said to my buddy,&quot;it would be so cool if they made some sorta machine like that,but when you put in somethin,it turns into some really good hash!You could call it the Hash Weasel!!&quot;

&quot;All my life I&apos;ve wanted to be someone. I guess I should have been more specific.&quot; GreenMeat 16th Mar 2000, 01:15 AM nice thread...some interestin&apos; stuff.

I&apos;m in the army. Eons ago, when i finished training and reported to my first unit, my squaddies called me&quot;greenmeat&quot;, since i was brand new and basically clueless.

Coming into UT for the first time, i had a strong sense of Deja Vu, so..... Skumboy 16th Mar 2000, 05:07 AM I have absolutly no idea where my name came from I was playing Quake 2 last year and I couldnt for the life of me think of a good handle and then out of nowhere Scum Boy popped into my head, but I thought it looked a bit wierd so I changed the c to a k and voila Skum Boy.

&quot;The&apos;re out ta get me, they won&apos;t catch me I&apos;m f*cking innocent&quot;--Out Ta get me, Guns n Roses BitchSmack 16th Mar 2000, 08:05 AM Well, since the origin of&quot;BitchSmack&quot;is profound and unexplainable, I think I will start with the following.

I first started playing as Mr.Frost (based on an old movie that starred Jeff Goldblum as the devil himself..good flick..but very different.) This nick stuck with me in the days of Forsaken and was pushed aside when my IRC nick took over.

This was Ha|fBr33d (halfbreed).

I used that nick for about a year and got bored with it...so...
I decided to switch to Carnage. I used Carnage and Ha|fBr33d through most of my UNREAL days and decided again, HEY, I needed a change.

That&apos;s when BITCHSMACK was developed and it was sort of a combination of Prodigy&apos;s song&quot;Smack my bitch up&quot;and several suggestions of some hot sh|t Unreal players.
That name has probably stuck with me the longest and is fairly known with some of the veterans here. hehe

Finally, someone told me my nick was too offensive (DUH!!!) and I thought that if I was going to be competing on a fairly professional level and producing web pages, visual eye-candy, etc..i needed something a bit different. THEREFORE, I thought about it and thought about it and thought about it some more and came up with Frostbyte. I just liked the sound of it and it has stuck with me ever since.

&quot;Sit! Roll Over! Play dead! Stay that way!&quot;- BitchSmack BaronSamedi 16th Mar 2000, 08:22 AM Well the nmae says it all don&apos;t it. It&apos;s been with me since my goldeneye days. We had mass competitions with people from our school and people from around the city. People became aware of my character as i was feared in the game (don&apos;t know why). The name came with me over to the land of the PC and now Baron Samedi is in training at the moment.....so if you see him, show me what you&apos;ve got coz thats how i learn.

If i don&apos;t see you kill me...it&apos;ll serve me right.

Seven is the answer and the answer is seven!!...........................................Im not mad..im just a bit strange?! Vortex 16th Mar 2000, 08:33 AM I was looking through the models for UT and when I got to the War Machines (those really fast robot type people u face at the end?) I thought their names were very cool sounding and I wanted a name like that for online play. So I thought Vortex sounded like a name a War Macine might have so that&apos;s why I picked it. Comprehend? There&apos;s nothing wrong with picking a name from the Matrix, Neo as that&apos;s the greatest film ever and they all had such cool names. I thought that guy Cypher&apos;s name was the best so it was annoying when he got killed in the film. JESUS CHRIST 16th Mar 2000, 08:38 AM Well I changed my name when I got my cable modem. I was kicking so much *** that my opponents were like Jesus F&apos;in Christ, you fragged the christ out of me. Hence my name. The second coming is now!!!!! hehe

ngid 620147 KingKobra|PuF 16th Mar 2000, 08:38 AM well, when i started my first hotmail account I wanted a really cool name. So i thought... i want it to sound powerful (king) and i need a really powerful beast or something. So i thought KingKong, but that wasn&apos;t original. So i thought hmmm... what else is a king? well, a KingCobra is! so just to make it cooler i made King_Kobra_22@hotmail.com. this was a very long time ago and i used the name in diablo, starcraft, half-life, tiberian sun, Sim city 3000, populous: the beginning, Starwars: episode 1 racer, Starcraft: broodwar, Midtown Madnessand finally... Unreal Tournament! You can also see that computer games are my life! i&apos;m now limiting myself to 3 games a year so i don&apos;t go bankrupt from spending 50 bucks(more like 70 here in Canada) everytime i see something remotly good!

-What happens when you are scared half to death twice? SSSHAD 16th Mar 2000, 08:40 AM Fun thread - i read it all the way /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif

About my nick: about 1/2 yeah ago i started to play Q2 DM. As all newbies, i though i&apos;d be a great sniper, so i started thinking of a sneaky/stealthy name - like shadow. Of course it was taken already and i cut it to SHAD. SS were added when i was setting up my hotmail account, &apos;cause they already had SHAD registed. Ford Prefect 16th Mar 2000, 08:53 AM My nickname comes from the great trilogy&quot;Hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy&quot;, written by Douglas Addams. Ford Prefect is an alien who was supposed to infiltrate in human society for a few weeks, but ended up living 15 years on earth because he missed his ride home.
In UT i use the name&quot;Caenor&quot;, it sounds cool though it actually is the first part of the name of a nematode (Caenorhabditis Elegans).

Orthos is the name of an asteroid whose orbital path crosses the earth&apos;s. Hence, it has the potential to destroy the earth - like me /~unreal/ubb/html/smile.gif [PuF]Firestorm 16th Mar 2000, 01:49 PM Ok ok here&apos;s my 0.02:

Well, I saw this film in the local video store called &apos;Firestorm&apos; (forgot who was in it tho but that don&apos;t matter). Anyway I thought it sounded cool so I just kinda used it for my online-game name.
I used to be called Stryke, for no particular reason, guess it just popped into my mind.

-Xiphias WAnk 17th Mar 2000, 04:36 AM welllllllll, the origins of the WAnk nickname go way back to my high school days. my pals thought it was a pretty funny idea to tell everyone i like masturbation. it was pretty funny, so i played along and walked around and said wank and stuff. it was a grand time for all. so, come quake 2, my first fps, i needed a nickname. i was really confused at the time as to why i needed a nickname, but i realized everyone else would try to be clever or scary with theirs so i decided to make fun of them. I chose POOP! at first, but got bored of it and went to WANK!!!! anyways, now i am just WAnk because i got lazy one day and forgot to make the last two letters capital. pretty exciting huh

http://www.planetunreal.com/images/bullet2.gif
ummmm WAnk?? spyder913 17th Mar 2000, 04:49 AM For me my name was orignally Spyder on BBSs, but when I started doing ansi art (haha) i liked it better all lowercase. I chose spyder cause my friend hated spiders, and I thought it would be funny.. the Y was cause it&apos;s just cooler than an I /~unreal/ubb/html/wink.gif

The 913 comes from the originalty problem -- too many damn Spyders out there who suck, so I added my 2 lucky numbers, 9 and 13 to the end of my name.

someday I might change it to spyder9:13 but we&apos;ll see /~unreal/ubb/html/wink.gif

darkness loomed ...

Then, some ****head HAD to remind me that the name was from the uniformly crappy&quot;Wheel of Time&quot;series, and what was even worse ... It was the name of a PLACE !
But ... I&apos;ve pulled through.

[This message has been edited by Rooster (edited 03-17-2000).] ATP 17th Mar 2000, 09:26 AM Poor Shadar,
That you are somehow connected to that lousy and irritating series must be a great pain for you. You should be lucky you picked the name of a place, instead that of a character!

Well, I guess it&apos;s good for at least one thing: You can your get rid of your frustrations every time you play UT ;-)

I am a history buff and started playing Quakeworld while I was in college. I tried a variety of nicknames but none were as simple and symbolic as the one that I have now. Sulla was known for his tenacity, genius and downright cruelty. A somewhat decent account of him can be found in Colleen McColough&apos;s First Man in Rome/The Grass Crown, etc.... ATP 17th Mar 2000, 10:39 AM Ok Rooster, you&apos;re obviously a fan.

I can respect Jordan&apos;s work for what it is, but the story just doesn&apos;t lead anywhere...I mean, nothing much has been happening in the last four books, and how many more will it take to finally put a cork in it once and for all?

I must admit his style is very addictive, that&apos;s why I&apos;ve read all volumes even though I don&apos;t like &apos;em ;-)

But take writers like Heinlein or Zelasny. Now they KNOW how to keep a story interesting and they don&apos;t need 8 volumes to make a point....

Shadar Logoth is a very scary place. So the name&apos;s cool.
What&apos;s Jordan doing coming out with a conan novel instead of&quot;corking&quot;the dang WoT series first!
I used to use Callan online, (my mom&apos;s maiden name) until I named my daughter that (a year and a half ago). So I went to Morety. My last name&apos;s Moreton. Wow, eh?

Slachter is something like &apos;butcher&apos; or slasher. But with the terminatorskin in UT I had to add something, hence the Unit3000. :)

Note the Edit line, it looks like a remainder of the ubbf0&apos;s.

The More-tician at your service. Judas!{CBR} 8th Aug 2000, 10:34 PM It was my Navy (not the US NAVY) friend who introduced me to online gaming. I&apos;m a Chinese and my family name is Neo (yes and I was geninuely surprised that Keanu Reeves&apos; character in The Matrix shares my name :D). Back in the Navy, pple call me by my family name.

Initially I intend to use Neo but many pple likes The Matrix too much and there are Neos here and there (no offense to PuF&apos;ers who use it). My friend uses Judah (sound something out of the Bible) so I thought I remembered some name out of the Bible. Later I check with my other friends (christians and catholics) and they verify Judas Iscariot is the one who sold out Jesus Christ for 30 silver pieces.

Hey I&apos;m a fan of Robert Jordan&apos;s Wheel of Time series!!! :D Lord_Dragon[FB] 9th Aug 2000, 01:21 AM alright, alright. so i&apos;m at the beginning of lord of chaos right now and am making my way through the WoT. obvious enough isn&apos;t it? just wish i could play as good as my name implies...

who knows if i&apos;ll stay with the name. maybe i&apos;ll name myself&quot;man in the box&quot;to have an alice in chains song name like rooster. haha, probably not.

some history if you would like.
my first nickname (i have not used it in UT yet) was orthancstone. i needed an original name for my yahoo account. i, to this day, have never seen anyone use it. it&apos;s from Tolkien&apos;s The Two Towers; the nickname of a certain palantir (that name was taken already).

then i modified the name of a rob zombie song, spookshow baby, to a new name: Spookshow_Psycho (creative, huh...yeah, right)

i&apos;ve used spooky_psycho in starcraft (to fit in space for battlenet).

right now i like LD though. it may not be too original, but i&apos;m the only one i&apos;ve seen with [FB] on the end.
as to what FB stands for: well, before my roommate decided to get taken by NBK (starting when we get back to school in a couple of weeks), we started our own clan called FatBoys. i just like the name for myself now. i like thinking of myself as a&quot;FatBoy&quot;. so i guess you can say i&apos;m Lord_Dragon the FatBoy.

oh, and not trashing Jordan here, but c&apos;mon, although i love his writing, these books go nowhere a lot. Shadow Rising was mostly wasted space imo. clambert 9th Aug 2000, 04:21 AM Let&apos;s see... about three years ago, I made the jump and bought a barebones &apos;puter system for myself. The motherboard on the system was named&quot;Stallion&quot;, and that&apos;s the name I used to identify the computer on our LAN. When signing up for email, and all that good stuff, I just used the same name -- and have been stuck with it ever since.

http://www.baber.com/baber/411/mtechm668.htm&lt;-- the specs which started it all! ;-) Darkie 9th Aug 2000, 04:30 AM lemme make it easy:
HUGE starWars fan....
DarkForce - Darky - Darkie

&apos;ey! darklite 9th Aug 2000, 04:39 AM I&apos;ve been using the internet for probably six or seven years, but I&apos;ve only been using IRC and stuff I&apos;d actually need nicknames for probably around four. I had probably around 10+ nicknames for the first two years of my&quot;IRC life&quot;([jimi] was my first and I really don&apos;t wanna get into how I got that, `Hellion- was my second that actually stuck for a while, and then |[dOoM]| was the next one that stuck for a while; though I had lots of nicks between them: ^aRkAniA^ and more I can&apos;t remember). then I think I was just bored of my current nick, |[dOoM]|, so I was just trying out different nicks.. and somehow this nick stuck.
darklite is actually supposed to be an oxymoron, as in dark light, not a new drink by pepsi; Dark Lite. :) it just looks cooler to spell it&quot;lite&quot;than&quot;light&quot;..
I&apos;ve actually tried to change nicks after that (condenser, not sure exactly but I think it was a song title, and morphix, name of a character on the ghetto fighting game Dark Rift, that I can remember), but somehow this nick has stuck to me for atleast 1.5 years.. probably longer. Bozo 9th Aug 2000, 04:49 AM Well, Ever since I was really young everyones always said that I clown around alot. Like, I was always the class clown, and the guy to make people laugh at every party. So when I started playing computer games online the choice was a natural one. No, NOT Ronald McDonald, you dufus, Bozo!

So now I&apos;ve used Bozo for 6 years, and I feel it&apos;s a suitable name for me and my playing style. It also really cracks me up when someone in the game says&quot;You f*****g clown...&quot;when I&apos;ve fragged &apos;im!

I also use Bozo=MD=, since that&apos;s my clan.

If y&apos;all see me online, give me a holler, and I&apos;ll give ya a laugh or two! :) Bozo=MD= 9th Aug 2000, 04:52 AM Me and myself wanted to concur...

I totally agree with my other self (see above). :) Madmartican 9th Aug 2000, 05:19 AM I use Madmartican because it is my real name. (Well One Of My Middle Names). [ACE]Revenant 9th Aug 2000, 05:51 AM There was another thread with the same topic yesterday......

Revenant means:Someone who came back from the dead........
(With my respawn rate,quite fitting)

-Revenant LogicBomb 9th Aug 2000, 05:52 AM I&apos;ve used many....ranging from Ash(with or without numbers....which had meanings) to FongSaiYuk....but I&apos;ve stuck with LogicBomb, from a particularly obscure song, from a particulalry obscure band....which no one has heard of. Stosh 9th Aug 2000, 06:29 AM It&apos;s actually a polish nick for Stanislau or Stanley. Funny, my names not Stanley, though I am Polish. It&apos;s not commonly used. 8-4-7-2 9th Aug 2000, 06:54 AM My nick is from Star Trek: Voyager. Species 8-4-7-2 is the coolest race in entire Star Trek.

http://members.tripod.de/mainborg/images/spec8472.jpg SpiritOFtheNight 9th Aug 2000, 10:59 AM I got mine from a MTG card. I don&apos;t play much but the name has stuck with me on the bbs. My online name is (when I play at a friend&apos;s house) is Darkside. On TFC its -=ES=-Darkside. Don&apos;t know where I got that I just thought it looked cool when you type it out in symbols.

Ixari = Cyclus of Life and Death : WebSlinger 9th Aug 2000, 11:41 AM When I was hired to work here, they set me up to play Quake 1 on their LAN. Since I was the web developer, they tried to set me up as Spidey, but I changed it. It was either that, or the following

Godunov

Colline

Anyone know what all those names have in common???? Terror 9th Aug 2000, 11:58 AM Mine is &apos;T&apos;error~UTM.

:redeemer: Boom Harm|PuF 9th Aug 2000, 01:25 PM Well, my name probably doesn&apos;t need much explaining.

I used to be NakedChaos in QuakeII since I ran around in the male nude skin :) and on certain bad days I&apos;d use the smiley face skin (had a big smiley face for a head and a jacket with a smiley on it, the front was smileing the back was frowning with a bullet through its head) and went by shuvitsdwys.

But I wanted something more professional sounding in UT and well in all truth they didn&apos;t have a damn naked male skin...otherwise NakedChaos would be here and I wouldn&apos;t :).

NakedChaos will most likely find a new home in the future where nudity prevails! Until then I, Harm, will remain. The Dopefish 9th Aug 2000, 01:29 PM Mine was THOROUGHLY (sp?) explained on one of the first pages. :)

...or at least I thought it was...maybe another thread? FROM_ THE_ HEAVENS 9th Aug 2000, 01:36 PM When i was 15 i was asking my dad to help me buy my first car..(he believed in hard work...etc.etc...)
i remember him saying something to the effect when money falls out of the sky...he would.
well about 2 days later we were leaving the house out the front door on the way to my Baseball game, when a 20$ bill gently floated out from above in the middle of the yard...

we both just looked at each other like WTF...
then i looked at him like...&quot;i would like a convertable&quot;
3 weeks later my dad held true to his&quot;promise&quot;and got me a Miata.
end of story
I also go by BIGFISHE.....
seeing as how my last name is Fishe. Jammer|PuF 9th Aug 2000, 02:04 PM My initials are J.A.M. and when I was playing basketball in H.S. (many years ago :)), those initials got transformed into the nickname, Jammer. Years later when I first got hooked on flight&amp;space combat sims that required callsigns, I decided to use that old b-ball nickname. It has stuck ever since.

]LoL[Jammer|PuF ~Cobra~ 9th Aug 2000, 02:12 PM i played starcraft under the name st0rmshadow.. i loved g.i. joe :D then i came to UT and used storm for first month then i changed it to Cobra... the ~&apos;s kinda go with the snake-likeness of the name.. :D i&apos;m so imaginative Morety 23rd Nov 2000, 02:32 PM Nice bump cobra.

And yes, those little ~~~~ are very snakelike. You really are imaginative. :) Morety 23rd Nov 2000, 02:34 PM So after reading through this again, I realized that there were the following p00p names:

MrPoopyPants: Evil_Beaver
Poop: WAnk
I_Pooped_My_Pants: Boom

Um, this forum seems to attract them, doesn&apos;t it? Icebat 23rd Nov 2000, 03:03 PM I got my name Icebat from the two things I love best....ice hockey and bats.
when I play UT I usually play as Caiden Lomax, who was one of my best Dungeons&amp;Dragons characters! Fuzzpilz 23rd Nov 2000, 04:31 PM One or two years ago, something slipped into my mind during a very very stupid and easy English task to use the name Cnocke. This became my nickname, but my younger brother stole it and started to call himself Cnocko. So I needed something new and began using Mr. Fuzzy, Fuzzmaster and more variations of the name. When I actually started playing online, I needed a fixed name and came up with Fuzzpilz. This is a cross-language pun: Fupilz is the German word for what my dictionary calls&quot;athlete&apos;s foot&quot;. Somehow I thought of combining this with my favorite syllable, and there was my nickname. I&apos;m used to it now, even though some may consider the pun tactless, stupid or whatever adjective they can think of. JuiceEggsMcKenna 23rd Nov 2000, 04:50 PM Originally posted by LogicBomb

Alright, I know who Ash and FongSaiYuk are... and I can also vaguley recall a song called&quot;Logic Bomb&quot;. Refresh my memory LB - who made that song??? L_S 23rd Nov 2000, 05:39 PM Nickname? We&apos;re supposed to pick a nickname? Ah well shoot, LiquiD_SiN is actually my birth name.

OHHHHHH DUHHHHH Phalanx 24th Nov 2000, 09:28 AM Well let&apos;s see I have been playing as Phalanx across mechwarrior2, mechcommander, Unreal tourney and rainbow six. Original I choose the name Cause I usaully play in the supporting role. I.E. Phalanx in the roman army. It is also a cool On-ship point defense weapons system in the navy. Ask people who play assualt how many times I have turned and covered someone Instead of blindly running to finish the match. That Is why I am could Phalanx. Rear guard thingy going on here. 8P Merlin|BuF 24th Nov 2000, 10:39 AM Think Aruthur of Camelot
then think Merlin of Camelot
then take a wild geuss at where I got this name from :p

hehehe Alopex 24th Nov 2000, 10:56 AM My closest friends call me&quot;hxan&quot;= swe. for&quot;the witch&quot;but since the letter&quot;&quot;isn&apos;t in the eng. alphabet it eventually became an e. Also&quot;hexan&quot;= swe. for hexane, and since I&apos;m into engineering chemistry it&apos;s a pretty suiting nick as well! Claude_Ballz 24th Nov 2000, 11:10 AM Jeez .... Do I really Have To Say ?

:redeemer: BloodRain 24th Nov 2000, 02:17 PM hmmmm Felt like it at the time :) Had to be a little dark in nature.. and I suppose it describes whats left of you after I find you.. Nothing more then blood showering down on my face!! WhahahhahhAHhhhh.. *ahem*... sorry -_-&apos; Hetemti 24th Nov 2000, 05:00 PM Hetemti is an ancient name with an obscure meaning. So far only two people have figured out it&apos;s meaning.

Online, I sometimes play as&quot;The Force of Nature&quot;(A M:tG card name) using the Skarjj model; and if I start lagging out, sometimes I switch to&quot;I Hate My Ping&quot;
__________
http://www.frognet.net/~gunn/images/betaforce.JPG Looks remotly Skarjj-like. o0pIumM 24th Nov 2000, 05:02 PM For the record, the name is o0pIumM. Like opium, the drug that comes from poppies.

Not o0pLumM as in a purple squishy fruity thing with a giant Pit.

I made the name up one night after I had smoked a bunch of the afore-mentioned thingy, and when I was getting ready to play Quake2 for the first time (way back when :D). Was that really 2 christmases ago? I&apos;ve used it ever since ! LLLola 24th Nov 2000, 05:49 PM LLLola, &apos;cause I figured Lolita might be pushing the bounds of good taste. &apos;sides, the Kinks did a song about Lola.

Therein lies the pun. Dr. Device 24th Nov 2000, 06:07 PM Dr. Device is a name of a weapon in the book Ender&apos;s Game, by Orson Scott Card. It is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and a book all serious UT players should read....it is very, very relevant to this game. But anyway, Dr. Device is also called the Little Doctor, it is a bomb that feeds on mass, so if you fired it at one ship and there were 5 more in the general area, it would keep expanding and destroying ships till it ran out of mass. It is capable of destroying a planet. Read the book!
Anyway, I just adopted the name and it&apos;s stuck. Milambyr 24th Nov 2000, 06:45 PM Milambyr is from the Raymond Feists&apos; Magician series, after Pug became powerful he called himself Milamber, but since Milamber is taken most of the time i put in the &apos;y&apos;, interesting eh? oh yeah...i bet all of you know that anyway, unless yer youngbucks. Go Star Blazers! PopeT 25th Nov 2000, 03:28 PM /me shrugs
