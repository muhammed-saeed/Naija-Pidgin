 I want to get a kitchen job in Australia, do I have to hold a food hygiene certificate or anything else? 
 Thanks every expert and friend. I want to get a part-time kitchen job in Epworth hospital in Melbourne, do I have to get a a food hygiene certificate. I eager this job very much now. I found out some information on the NMIT website, where there are 2 courses about Food Safety Package. One is Food Hygiene for Food Handlers, the other is Food Safety Supervisors. I only want to get a part-time job in the kitchen in Epworth hosopital, rather than being a supervisor in a kitchen. Do I have to have the course, Food Safety Supervisors? If i finish the Food Hygiene for Food Handlers, legally, dose it mean I am qualified to work in a kitchen? Could I have a food hygiene course online to get the certificate? Thank you, every expert and friend. 1 answer - Asked By: - 9/13/2011

 USAJOBS.GOV resume: Should I include previous jobs unrelated to the position I&apos;m applying for? 
 I&apos;m applying for a position as a store associate at a Commissary on USAJOBS.GOV. I&apos;ve worked at a Commissary before, and so I already know how to perform all of the job duties of the position I&apos;m applying for. My question is, since I&apos;ve had this exact job before, should I just submit a resume that focuses on my Commissary experience exclusively, or should I add previous jobs as well? I&apos;ve also worked as a school Kitchen Supervisor , a Custodian, and a Teacher&apos;s Assistant.

I&apos;d prefer answers from people who have experience with USAJOBS.GOV, please. Thanks! 1 answer - Asked By: The Ho1iest of Thieves - 3/25/2012 
 How can I improve my overall working speed? 
 At work, my kitchen boss is thinking about moving to another state ( and thus quitting ). This action would bring my kitchen supervisor to his position. However, we would be down a worker. My job is dishwasher for a 3 star ( they say ) hotel and I find myself helping the cooks every now and again with thier duties. Besides movement speed, what exercises can I do to improve my hand speed, reaction speed, etc. So I can help out more until another guy is hired. 2 answers - Asked By: - 12/22/2007 
 Is Austin a good city to relocate to in terms of employment? ? 
 I am thinking of relocating to Austin to pursue a film making career. I have experience in kitchen/deli jobs, I&apos;ve been a stocker and I currently work as a Supervisor in customer relations for a bank. So my skill set is open. What would you recommend? I currently live in Tulsa, Ok where the unemployment is pretty low compared to the rest of the country. Also, I was born and raised in San Antonio until about the age of 13 so I am no stranger to Texas. 2 answers - Asked By: 1lessniceguy - 12/28/2011 
 How many years does it take to get promoted from crew to supervisor in a fast food restaurant?

sorry about the wrong section but the other section wasn&apos;t answering.

 What is the hiring process for a basic Hospital Job? 
 Last Tuesday, I went in for interview for a basic job at the hospital. I talked to the head supervisor and she told me what I need to know about the position. It is a PRN from 7am to 7pm. 

Me being, never worked in hospital enviroment or never worked for a company on PRN basis. Just has high school diploma applying to work in Kitchen of the hospital.

Supervisor say it is a process that HR has to go through. But, didn&apos;t give me much of clue besides, have to pass a background check/drug test and that I will have do two days of orientation sometimes in first week of Aug. 

HR did call and say in a confused way that &quot;hey, my name, I would like to offer you the job, but all go well with background check, you will have it&quot;. What does this mean? So, yesterday I went and filled out 1 sheet to release my information over to background checking company or over to the hospital since they don&apos;t have my signature just electronic application on file.

Does this mean I have the job or what? 1 answer - Asked By: LeteshaSC - 7/18/2007 
 Frustrated about a supervisor with less experience.? 
 I am 17 years old and have been working in a Kitchen for almost two years. I mostly do dishwashing but some prep work. There are these kids that work in a child and youth program at the centre I work at and then they come into the Kitchen in August. The leader of that program then becomes the supervisor, no matter what the experience they have. Even though I have been at the workplace for a length of time and have my food safe and work safe, this girl is over me. She has never worked in a Kitchen before, and does not have her food or work safe. As the supervisor she mostly gets prep jobs and does not do dishes or floor mopping. She is always in charge of me even though I know what I am doing, and once tried to get me to lift heavy objects even though I knew it would hurt me. I talked to my head boss, the chef about this and he said that it has to be that way, and she is in charge of me and should tell me what to do. I am very frusterated by this but want to keep my job, since this is only a one month a year thing...what should I do?
I am also a year round worker, and she only works in the summer. 2 answers - Asked By: Brittany - 8/24/2009 
 I need some advise on applying for jobs that want experience workers but I lack the experience, that they want? 
 I been a dishwasher for 2 1/2. I want to find another job, maybe another job in a kitchen or some sort. But everywhere I want to apply, i cant because they are looking for people that are experience. How can I work around that and convince the person that I am the right person for the job, even though I lack the experience? I didn&apos;t only wash dishes, I also helped cut food, make deserts, help set up tables and chairs for banquets, clean the kitchen (mop, sweep, take out trash, etc), and a tons of different tasks that the supervisor wanted me to do.
Sorry didnt really finish my second sentence. It should of said or some sort of job that relates to a kitchen environment.
So many advertisements. 2 answers - Asked By: Matt M - 7/12/2009 
 What other fake jobs are there out there for everett wa? whats yours? heres mine...? 
 Question: What&apos;s your fake job? here&apos;s mine...

 First my statement, then my question.... 


STATEMENT: I&apos;ve had 2 of what I like to call fake jobs. At one job as a debt collector. At another as a cook. Debt collector: definatly one of the easist/fake jobs in the world. I got paid to do nothing but sit in a cubicle and let an automated system call people, then when they answer I would tell them&quot;either pay this bill, or recieve negative credit...end of story period, if they tried to dispute/claim bankruptsy, or anything that would not result in a payment, I just hang up on them and go the next person. then I clock out and go home. A job where there really is no real work....(well as a technicallity I lost this job because I left on a voicemail that my call was an emergency) so theres one fake job gone... cook: I&apos;m a cook at a bar, as some few know...being a cook at a bar is a fake job, you get a fancy title that the club dj anounces as &quot;and working hard in the back kitchen for you is chef (myname)....lets all raise our glasses and make some noise for him/her...but in reality were not chefs, were barely cooks, we can barely bake cookies without them burning. the only thing we can cook is whats on the menu. which we learned from a recipe book. not to mention because it&apos;s a bar theres only about 1 order per hour and each order takes 10 min at the most. and if it gets busy we help barback and get tipped out even more. So as I&apos;m thinking about this, I&apos;m watching the show on tv &quot;factory&quot; and in a scene for the season finale one guy says &quot; you know we don&apos;t really do anywork, we go through the training, then we sit and do nothing, then when the boss comes we rush to pretend like were working.&quot;&quot;then one guy says I know isn&apos;t it great,&quot; (then they high five) then I thought about the simpsons where homer does nothing and gets paid for it. Then I thought about my ex boss at the debt collection agency, when a caller asked to speak to a supervisor and when we told her/him, he/she said &quot;thats what your hear to do,&quot; So he/she have a fake job too. 


Question: What&apos;s your fake job? What fake jobs are there out there that are hiring? Is there a list of fake jobs we can come up with or is already around? Is there a site for this? Are there forums for people who have jobs like this? (btw I also get to eat all the free food I want, and drink all the free beer I want too as a bar chef) 1 answer - Asked By: danny m - 8/13/2008 
 29 Years Old, No Good Jobs and I FEEL LIKE A LOSER! Do you? 
 Ok, so I&apos;m a 29 year old, pretty good looking blonde haired, blue eyed, athletic female who just got married last year in August. I&apos;m well educated and always seem to get people saying to me, 
&quot;You are so smart, why are you wasting your time doing this job?&quot;
or
&quot;You are so talented why can&apos;t you find a good job and stick to it?&quot;

So, I am well educated, but I always feel like I could keep learning,
I&apos;ve gone to college and graduated in 2001 in Food Service Management, wasn&apos;t really my passion but after my 2 first years in Culinary school I figured I&apos;d finish in business instead of in the kitchen.
It didn&apos;t get me far. I&apos;ve been a waitress, cocktail waitress, banquet server, bartender, line cook, pastry chef, Food Service Supervisor, Operations Manager for several food outlets, and recenlty a Chef Manager. I ABSOLUTELY HATE the kitchen and the only part I&apos;d stay in might be the Bakery, but only cuz I LOVE CHOCOLATE. However I don&apos;t have the hardcore &quot;Chocolatier&quot; experience you see on the FOOD NETWORK, nor do I have any more funds to go back to school.

I did become a Licensed Massage Therapist in 2003, and now all I&apos;m seeing is graduates getting out of massage school offering Happy Endings to make money and increase their competition. 
So, that industry feels ruined to me. 

So with the Economy in its current state, what is there to do?
I feel lost in my career, crazy in debt and without passion for any career. 

I feel like a LOSER! Anyone feel the same?
Have any suggestions?
Are there CAREER PSYCHOLOGISTS? I haven&apos;t found my University to be any help what so ever, which sucks, due to all the cash I paid them. What are the options?

Anyone know? 12 answers - Asked By: kld726 - 2/7/2009 
 My husband got fired... I think its wrong... opinion? 
 My husband has been working with a retierment home since he graduated from cullanary school in the kitchen. He worked there for about 7 months before things started getting crazy. He would come home telling me about how CNA&apos;s were getting fired and sued due to physicaly abusing the elderly and for neglect. Then the demotions started. All the head people were demoted a position. We got worried when this started as anyone would about their own jobs. Now this is 7 months after his hire date and then the kitchen supervisor writes him up for having his MP3 player. Granted... he had been listening to this everyday since he was hired, now he is writen up for it?! We decided to be cautious at this time knowing if they popped up with another write up out of the blue then they were probably looking for a way to get rid of him. Then sure enough he was writen up and suspended for forgeting to clock out. Now this isnt something they had to remind him of before or anything, he did not even remember not clocking out (of course) then he goes into work today and they have a 3rd write up and say ok we have to let you go because the dietary aid who worked with you last week forgot to clean up their mess. WHAT are you serious??? Tell me thats not crazy. He is not a manager, supervisor, or anything in high ranks. What should we do? Oh and he was about to take his PTO week for our beach trip. Is he still intitled to that? We live in North Carolina if anyone knows the law. Thank You for reading I know it was long. We just really would like someone elses opinion. 2 answers - Asked By: DeborahUlloa - 7/6/2009 
 Is it right for my supervisor to yell at me in front of other co-workers? 
 Im a waitress and i&apos;ve only been working at this job for about three months now. I had Very little experience before this job, so i&apos;m still trying to get the hang of it. but the chief/my supervisor seems to think i should already be as fast as the other waitresses who have been working there for years now. my supervisor seems to always pick on me. i came in one day with jeans and he said &quot; WHY YOU WEARING THOSE!.. ITS BLACK SLACKS AL WAYS!..GO HOME AND CHANGE!&quot; i explained why i had the jeans on and told him i had no ride to go home real quick and change and he yelled &quot;THATS NOT MY PROBLEM!&quot; this happened in the kitchen in front of all the staff. it seems like everyday i work with him hes yelling only at me. one other chief said to him one day &quot;so your not yelling at her today huh&quot; as in a joke. its embarressing and sometimes it even makes me wanna walk off and cry. 1 answer - Asked By: mysweetserenity - 8/1/2009 
 My supervisor is harrassing me can anything be done? 
 I have been working at a bowling alley since july of 2008 to now. Over that time the owners son has put me down and starts asking questions such as how many jobs have you had? How many of them were $20 an hour jobs? How many of them were full time jobs? Do you even have a savings account? one time I called in because I had no transportation. He said &quot;Im sorry but that&apos;s not a good excuse. h*************u? (21) and you still don&apos;t have a DL? (no) ...To my opinion I feel that being talked to like that was not cool and uncalled for. Tonight dec.3rd of 09 I go to work upset because the new guy has four days next week and I have two??? The owners son calls me up to the counter and says do you know why you only have two days next week? ( I recently passed out at counter I was sick. I know that&apos;s unprofessional) I said yes and apologized for my actions but I was sick and had asked to go home and there was two working that night and it was very slow in kitchen but he said no so I went back to work and accidentally passed out....anyway he said &quot;I don&apos;t give a sh*t&quot; I said &quot;can you talk to me like that&quot;? He said &quot;I can talk to you any way I want.&quot; I said &quot;are you sure about that&quot;? He said &quot;are you challenging me&quot; and I said &quot;maybe I am&quot; and he said &quot;just go home&quot;.
Sorry for long storry but is he aloud to be that way with me can anything be done about that?
Or am I just being dramatic?
I work in Phoenix Arizona.

dec. 6th now
Ok so I quit! But I still feel what they did was wrong. On top of what was said above I had asked to talk to owner in office I told him the issue and the owner said that he does not understand why I would get mad about that because I always curse (I do not) The owner said I drop the F bomb in my interview like 5 times? (WHAT) He said that I said fudge as in WTfudge and that it was a curse word????? He also said that Sh*t is not a curse word and I am being dramatic!
The day I complained about hours I had clocked in and went straight to one of the upper managements there (not Jason) any way The owner wanted to write me up for stealing company money...(how) for clocking in and not going straight to work even though many employees clock in and then use the restroom but on top of him wanting to write me up...I had bought a bowling ball that I left in our employee clock in room where the owner took my ball dug out my name and put Glenfair!!!! And he wants to write me up 4what? 6 answers - Asked By: - 12/3/2009 
 Yelled at supervisor? Now what???????????????????? 
 Okey, me and my co-worker went into work when I wasnt supposed to fill in for an employee who didnt show. I am bad sick with bronchitus right now and can barely talk right now, but I went in and all day and night we have busted our butts off washing hundreds of dishes for college students. Well the superivsor who was demoted to only being in charge of those who work in the kitchen (which is not us dishwashers) decided to order us to do the rest of the cafe as well, when we&apos;re not supposed to take her orders in the first place, because of her demotion, and second because it was not our responsibilities. Well we did the favors anyway, all night busting our butts more than anyone else in that building! and so when we stop to catch our breathes and wait for the remaining dishes to get to us so we can get them done and go home, she comes in and starts mouthing off for us not doing work outside of the dishroom, called us lazy, complained that she was doing everything herself( when she was hardly doing anything, it was us!) and finally I couldnt take her hollering anymore and I start shouting back, while my co worker was dissolved to tears. We shouted bad at each other and the other supervisor just told us to go, and that she would take us for us when the one who was shouting at us &quot;reported me&quot; to the big boss. This is Sodexo, by the way, at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. So have I screwed my job up now? Was I wrong for defending me and my co worker? Can I be fired for this? 2 answers - Asked By: Gron Hatchat - 1/31/2011
