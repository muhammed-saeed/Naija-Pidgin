Cooking vegetarian food is no more complicated than cooking non-vegan dishes. With a few kitchen tips, preparing a vegan meal with fresh, organic, simple ingredients will cook with ease.

A vegetarian cookbook authored by an expert in vegetarian cooking is a necessity in any vegan kitchen. Having access to a cooking conversion table and cooking terminology will help in cooking recipes from other countries.

Organization and preparation is the key to cooking any meal efficiently. Planning is a major tool to being organized. Make a list of all ingredients needed to prepare more than one meal. This will encourage budget friendly shopping and having ingredients on hand will save preparation and cooking time.

Cooking fruits and vegetables when they are in season, locally grown, and organic will have higher nutritional value. Visit year around farmers markets, as the variety and uniqueness of in season produce will introduce new foods to the vegetarian menu.

Beans are a staple food to most vegans. Knowing how to cook and prepare beans is essential, as there are many non-vegan recipes that can substitute meat with beans. There are many different types of beans and knowing the nutritional value of each type is important in creating a healthy balanced diet.

Tofu is a popular meat substitute with vegans. Tofu is made from soybeans, rich in protein, and at times called soybean cheese. It is easily purchased at the grocery store, but can also be made at home.

Experiment with various herbs and spices to create unique flavours for tried and true recipes. Always try to cook with fresh herbs, for they bring out more flavour than dried varieties.

Cooking vegetarian meals at home is a rewarding experience for all vegans and their families. Knowing a few cooking tips to simplify the process will help in creating vegan dishes, simply as well as efficiently.
   
 What to Do on a Night out…

Planning a fun night out around town whether it is with close friends, family members, or a romantic couple’s night out always involves choosing the perfect restaurant to fit the specific occasion. If you are planning activities with children such as going out to the cinema, a simple meal at a fast food restaurant or sit down family oriented establishment always works well. However if you would like the dining experience to be a little more sophisticated, you may want to choose a more popular fine dining restaurant or perhaps even a bar and grill or night club that offers entrees and appetizers.

There is a very wide range of fast food restaurants; you can basically find one on every corner in even the most rural areas. These days this type of fast eating offers everything from juicy hamburgers to tacos, pizzas, fried chicken salads and an assortment of desserts and creative ice creams or iced drinks to suit your taste. Most of these well-known establishments have been around for many years and offer affordable meal prices. This makes fast food restaurants the ideal stop for large families.

Sit down restaurants, also known as fine dining establishments, take the time to add a little more class to their facilities. As you take a seat you may be surrounded by anything from large aquariums filled with exotic fish to antique art, water fountains, chandeliers and candlelight to strike a romantic mood. These businesses are typically privately owned and operated locally and the entrees have a special unique touch and flavour that cannot be found anywhere else.

Many large bars and night clubs also offer an area for their customers to sit down and have either a snack or regular meal depending on the type of business. While most of them operate a full bar serving various mixed drinks and alcoholic beverages, many of these facilities will also serve burgers and fries, steaks, chicken tenders and more.

One of my personal favourite is the Goan delicacy of Chicken Vindaloo. Goa is one of my personal favourites and whenever I happen to be in this place tasting the authentic and titillating dish of Goan Chicken Vindaloo is one of my favourite time outs. In fact if you are cooking at home and looking for some exciting new cooking tips, try out this dish to surprise not only yourself but also your friends. This is one of the surprisingly easy recipes to cook and mesmerizing in taste and should appeal to most non-veggies.

The ingredients required are:
12 kg chicken pieces
12 large onions
6 cloves garlic
6 cloves
2 teaspoons of ground powdery cumin
2 tablespoons of white vinegar
1 teaspoon of ground mustard
1 teaspoon of ground turmeric
1 tablespoon of brown sugar
1 teaspoon of ground ginger
1 crumbled cinnamon stick
About 100 grams mustard oil
Chili powder as per taste

Start with the onions and chop them up in medium pieces. Next put them in a mixer-grinder with mustard, cloves, garlic, sugar, cinnamon, chili, turmeric, cumin powder, vinegar, sugar and ginger. Ensure that the blending is uniform and the result is smooth as a paste. Next mix the chicken with the spice paste and let it marinate for about four hours. Preferably you are going to prepare the dish in the morning let it marinate overnight so that the spices get into the tender chicken meat.

Start the cooking process by pouring some mustard oil on to preheated pan and then adding the remaining onion in slices on to the heated oil. Let it sit for about 2 minutes and then add the marinated chicken. Let it cook for about 45 minutes over a slow fire. Cover the lid. Make sure you stir it from time to time so that the cooking is uniform. Garnish with some cumin leaves and serve hot!

 A Healthy Diet Nutrition Advice

Health organizations recommend that the average person should be eating four portions of fruit and vegetables every day in order to maintain good health. If you are not used to including fruit and vegetables in your diet, this may seem like a tall order. However, getting your four a day doesn’t have to be difficult. Here are some simple ways to get your five a day.

1. Fresh fruit juice
A glass of fresh fruit juice, such as orange, apple, or grape juice, counts as one portion of your five a day. Make sure that the drink is 100% fresh fruit juice, rather than cordial or other sweetened juices. Better still, buy a fruit press or juicer to make your own fruit juice.

2. Cereal toppings
Instead of sprinkling sugar onto your breakfast cereal, sweeten your morning cereal with a handful of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or sliced banana. Alternatively, add a handful of dried fruit such as sultanas, currants, dried apple, or coconut flakes.

3. Cooked breakfast extras
If you prefer to eat a cooked breakfast in the morning, add a portion of grilled tomatoes to your breakfast. Mushrooms also count as a portion of your five a day. Add a generous portion of grilled tomatoes and mushrooms to your cooked breakfast for a healthy start to the day.

4. Smoothies
A smoothie can provide two portions of your five a day. Make your own smoothie at home by adding 2 handfuls of soft fruit to a glass of milk. Mix the fruit and milk together in a blender or food processor until the mixture is smooth. Add a dollop of plain yogurt for an extra thick smoothie, or a teaspoon of honey for extra sweetness.

Health experts recommend that we should be eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. For most people, this can seem like a difficult task. But getting your four a day is easier than you might think.
