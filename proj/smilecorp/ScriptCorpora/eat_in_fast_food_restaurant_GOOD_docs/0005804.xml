		McDonalds Seniors Restaurant 

   

 Patty Maloney is manager of a McDonalds restaurant in a
city with many seniors. She has
noticed that some senior citizens have become not just regular patrons but
patrons who come for breakfast and stay on until about 3 PM . Many of these older customers were attracted initially by a monthly breakfast
special for people aged 55 and older. The meal costs $1.99, and refills of coffee are free. Every fourth Monday, between 100 and 150
seniors jam Pattys McDonalds for the special offer. But now almost as many of them are coming
every day turning the fast-food restaurant into a meeting place. They sit for hours with a cup of coffee,
chatting with friends. On most days, as many as 100 will stay from one to four hours. 

   

 Pattys
employees have been very friendly to the seniors, calling them by their first
names and visiting with them each day. In fact, Pattys McDonalds is a happy place with her employees
developing close relationships with the seniors. Some employees have even visited customers
who have been hospitalized. You know,
Patty says, I really get attached to the customers. Theyre like my family. I really care about these people. They are all friends and being friendly
with the customers is a part of McDonalds corporate philosophy. 

   

 These older
customers are an orderly group and very friendly to anyone who comes in. Further, they are neater than most customers,
and carefully clean up their tables when they leave. Nevertheless, Patty is beginning to wonder if
anything should be done about her growing nonfast -food
clientele. Theres no crowding problem
yet, during the time when the seniors like to come. But if the size of the senior group continues
to grow, crowding could become a problem. Further, Patty is concerned that her restaurant might come to be known
as an old peoples restaurant which might discourage some younger
customers. And if customers felt the
restaurant was crowded, some might feel that they wouldnt get fast service. On the other hand, a place that seems busy
might be seen as a good place to go and a friendly place. 

   

 Patty also
worries about the image she is projecting. McDonalds is a fast-food restaurant, and normally customers are expected
to eat and run. Will allowing people to
stay and visit change the whole concept? In the extreme, Pattys McDonalds might become more like a
European-style restaurant where the customers are never rushed and feel very
comfortable about lingering over coffee for an hour or two! Patty knows that the amount her senior
customers spend is similar to the average customers purchase but the seniors
do use the facilities for a much longer time. However, most of the older customers leave McDonalds by 11:30 before the noon crowd comes in. 

   

 Patty is
also concerned about another possibility. If catering to seniors is OK, then should she do even more with this age
group? In particular, she is considering
offering bingo games during the slow morning hours 9 AM to 11 AM . Bingo is popular with some seniors, and this could be a new revenue
source beyond the extra food and drink purchases that probably would
result. She figures she could charge $5
per person for the two-hour period and run it with two underutilized
employees. The prizes would be coupons
for purchases at her store (to keep it legal) and would amount to about
two-thirds of the bingo receipts (at retail prices). The party room area of her McDonalds would
be perfect for this use and could hold up to 150 persons.
