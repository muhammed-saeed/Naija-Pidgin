The real test of a McDonald’s crew member is mastering the art of the often-temperamental soft-serve frozen-yogurt machine.

Maine South football coach John Manchester was fairly confident he had.

“We’ve done it all so far,” Manchester said from his spot behind the counter of the Park Ridge McDonald’s at 1032 N. Northwest Highway. “Shakes, sundaes, McFlurries, everything.”

Manchester was one of about 30 coaches and teachers from Maine South, Maine East and Maine West high schools who volunteered three hours of their time on Dec. 7 to work alongside McDonald’s employees and raise money for Maine Township High School District 207’s School-Based Health Center.

Maine South staff members worked the counter and drive-thru at the Park Ridge McDonald’s, Maine East was represented at 8460 W. Dempster St., in Niles, and Maine West staff served up treats at 1101 Oakton St., in Des Plaines.

The fundraiser, which took place between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., was organized by the Maine Teachers Association to help support the Health Center, which is at Maine East, but available to all District 207 students.

“This is our first (fundraiser) and we’re hoping it’s something that will continue,” said Bernie Lewis, a teacher of French and Spanish at Maine East and chairman of the MTA’s social committee.

For each “McTeacher’s Night” coupon redeemed during the event, 15 percent of the purchase was donated to the Health Center. Tip jars were also set up next to each register for people who wished to give an additional donation.

The MTA decided to partner with McDonald’s after hearing about other McTeacher’s Night events involving suburban school districts, Lewis said. Teachers representing each of the District 207 schools were competing to see which school would ultimately raise the most dollars for the Health Center.

Proceeds from the event were still being calculated this week.

District 207’s School-Based Health Center provides medical and mental-health services for students who may not have access to such care. It is funded through a state grant and private donations.

Manchester, who had never before worked in a fast-food restaurant, described the experience as “a lot of fun,” as did some of his fellow coaches.

“They had me working at the drive-through, handling the food, greeting at the front door, and back here making the shakes, drinks and things like that,” volunteer Matt Pater said.

Pater, who believes it is “always important to get involved and help out good causes,” said he enjoyed interacting with customers and McDonald’s staff.

“You get a better understanding of what they do behind the counter here, the pride they have in their job,” he said.

Jason Kacprowski, another member of the Maine South coaching staff, acknowledged that training for his new position was brief, but he caught on quickly.

“It’s pretty hectic back here,” he said. “It’s a fast-paced world behind the counter.”

Julie Travers, a McDonald’s spokeswoman, noted: “The teachers are having a blast. That’s the fun thing.”

Many students, McTeacher’s Night coupons in hand, turned out at the various McDonald’s locations to support the fundraiser. At the Niles McDonald’s, lines were out the door at one point during the evening as Maine East’s Demon Strings played Christmas music in the dining area. The school’s Blue Demon mascot also made an appearance, while Ronald McDonald made the rounds at each of the three participating restaurants.

Teachers, coaches and staff members who volunteered as food servers and greeters included Tomas Cintado, Michael Harper, Dori Ceisel, Gabe Corey, Greg Reuhs, Natalie Bourn, Eileen Murphy, Jamie Kumiega, Chris Magnuson, Gary Zielinski, and Pat Baldwin from Maine East; and Eric Novak, Anthony Colletti, Jason Kacprowski, John Manchester, Patrick Manning, Tom Mendez, Charlie Bliss, Matt Pater, Kevin Stock, Maureen Kudlik and Emma Visee from Maine South.
