 Westhoughton. It is believed
that a stray firework, probably from a nearby New Year&apos;s celebration, had landed
in the gutter of the house in Stanley Close, and set fire to felt on the roof.
The blaze spread quickly and filled the house with smoke. The roof of a
neighbouring house was also damaged by the blaze and firefighters spent nearly
six hours at the scene. The remains of the rocket were found in the guttering.

 Shieldfield,
Newcastle .
Christopher Graham is today behind bars for a firework attack on his
ex-girlfriend&apos;s home. When he thought his girlfriend was having an affair, he
hurled a firework through her letter box, causing a small fire. Newcastle Crown
Court heard August 5, 2010, that Graham launched his attack on April 12 at the
flat at Clarence House, a block of around 30 flats in Shieldfield, Newcastle,
where his on-off girlfriend lives with her two daughters (17, 6). Fortunately,
she was awake and able to extinguish the flames. The judge jailed Graham for
seven years and said it was simply luck that the woman and others in the block
of flats were not killed.

 A
neighbour (52) came to the rescue after neighbours spooted &apos;lights&apos; coming
from the ground floor flat of a woman (20) and her three-year-old daughter in
Harn Drive at 6 p.m. The &apos;lights&apos; turned out to be a lit firework that had
been rammed in the letterbox. As flames licked up the back of the door towards
gas pipes above, the man pulled out the burning firework and smothered the
flames with his hands. - Fire crews said if it wasn&apos;t for the man&apos;s quick actions
the whole house would have gone up due to the gas pipes above the door.   30.10.2008

A firework prank left a woman homeless and the village without a dental
practice after shops went up in flames. It is believed a firework was lit and
thrown into the street bin causing a fire, which quickly melted a gas pipe
leading to the dental practice and blazed through the business. Nineteen fire
officers spent more than an hour battling the fire on Margaret Street.

 Bolton,
Greater Manchester. At
a wedding party in Belmont Road, Astley Bridge, a man (27) was lighting an industrial firework but there was a fault and it went off before
it should have done and exploded in his face, causing severe facial burns and
damage to his eyes. Luckily the man was wearing glasses and his eyes were
protected from the full force of the explosion but it is not yet clear if the
blast has robbed the man of his eye sight.  

 The
firework should have been set off electronically from a safe distance but the
man used a cigarette lighter instead. 9.11.2007

 Marley
Farm (near the village of Ringmer and near Halland), in Shortgate, East Sussex,
Southern England. 

 Tons
of explosives went up in Britain&apos;s biggest-ever fireworks blaze. At its height,
it was tackled by 60 firemen aided by 50 police- and 14 ambulancemen. Two fire
crew members were killed and at least 12 other people, including two members of
the public, nine fire officers and a police officer, have been injured, some
seriously, during the incident. An area the size of four football pitches was
wiped out. 

 The
firemen had been called to a relatively small blaze at a fireworks store. Two fire crew
members, Brian Wembridge (63) and Geoff Wicker (49) were killed in
a large explosion about an hour after the fire began. Mr Wicker was a firefighter watch commander in charge of part-time staff. Mr
Wembridge was a brigade photographer responsible for giving the press details
about blazes. He would attend major fires to take official pictures. 

 The
blasts shook nearby houses and sent debris flying through the air. With
fireworks still shooting from the blaze more than five hours later, the
emergency services were forced to retreat from the scene, leaving the flames and
explosions to wreck the depot and a nearby house. Witnesses
said the blast could be heard up to ten miles away. 

 The
factory owner and his family had managed to get out of the building safely, but
their house, just 50 yards away from the depot, was destroyed. 

 It
is believed a team of employees were working a Sunday shift when the initial
explosion happened, just before 2pm. 

 Residents
in the area have been evacuated and a 200 metre exclusion zone put in place. 

 The
fire is being left to burn because of fears acetylene gas canisters on the site
may explode. 3.12.2006

Marley Farm (in
 der Nhe von Ringmer)/Sdosten England. Bei einer Explosion in einer
 Feuerwerksfabrik kamen zwei Menschen ums Leben und 12 Menschen, darunter neun
 Feuerwehrmnner und ein Polizist, wurden zum Teil schwer verletzt. Bei den
 beiden Toten handelte es sich um Feuerwehrleute (49 und 63 J.) der Feuerwehr

 Fabrik alarmiert worden. Danach schossen stundenlang Feuerwerkskrper in den
 Himmel. Die heftigste Explosion gab es rund eine Stunde nach Beginn des
 Feuers, dabei kamen die zwei Feuerwehrmnner um. Das Gelnde um die Firma
 wurde weitrumig abgesperrt, die Anwohner evakuiert. Noch Stunden nach
 Ausbruch des Feuers gab es immer wieder Explosionen. Ueber der Fabrik stieg
 eine dicke Rauchwolke auf, die kilometerweit zu sehen war.

Das nahegelegene
 Wohnhaus des Besitzers der Feuerwerksfabrik wurde ebenfalls zerstrt, weitere
 Gebude durch Dachziegel und Glassplitter beschdigt. 3.12.2006

 A
study commissioned by Churchill Home Insurance found almost two million Britons
 3.3 per cent of the population had reported damage to their home or car
due to fireworks going astray. More than four
million Britons claim to have been hurt or have a family member who has been
hurt by a firework in the past, Churchill found. 

 Last
autumn, nearly 1,160 people across the country were treated for firework-related
injuries, according to the Department of Trade and Industry, most of which were
caused by rockets (283), sparklers (149) and roman candles or air bombs (121).
More than half (590) of all injuries occurred at family or private parties. 

 47%
of Britons planning to stage their own fireworks display admittet to storing   the explosives in their house or an out-building. 

 31%
did not take any precautions and left fireworks in the cardboard box they came
in. 

 Firework
trauma costs up to 1.6 million in vet fees, Sainsbury&apos;s Bank has warned.
Around 5.000 animals could be treated for firework-related injuries and distress
this year.

 Guy
Fawkes could have changed the face of London if his 1605 plot had not been
foiled, explosion experts have said. His 2&apos;500 kg of gunpowder could have caused
chaos and devastation over a 490-metre radius, they have calculated. Fawkes&apos;
planned blast was powerful enough to destroy Westminster Hall and the Abbey,
with streets as far as Whitehall suffering damage, they say. Another expert has

destroy Parliament. 5.11.2003

 &lt;&lt;The National Campaign for Firework Reform says the deregulation of fireworks in the last
decade means individuals can store tons of explosives in private dwellings, and the laws
need to be tightened up. 
But firework manufacturers and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
(RoSPA) say the regulations on the storage of fireworks are already very tight, and they are
confident that under the current legislation, a similar disaster would not happen in the UK.  

 The director of the National Campaign for
Firework Reform, Noel Tobin disagrees:&quot;We have been very lucky so far that we haven&apos;t
had a similar disaster.&quot; Mr Tobin now wants a new law to cover the licensing, training and handling of
fireworks, along with limits on the amount of explosives being stored in any one location, and the
timing of sales to the public.
