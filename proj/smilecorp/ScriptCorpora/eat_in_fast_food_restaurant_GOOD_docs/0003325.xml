South Beach Diet Phase One Recipes Round-Up: April 2008
 Add this recipe to ZipList! Photo of Pesto Fish with a Side of Green Beans by Gluten-Free Mommy 
 I do consider Kalyn&apos;s Kitchen to be more of a food blog than a diet blog, but I see from my stats reports that a lot of people come here looking for South Beach Diet recipes. Last month I decided to start doing an end-of-month round-up of tasty phase one recipes I&apos;ve posted on Kalyn&apos;s Kitchen or found on other food blogs during each month. Now you can find the South Beach Diet Phase One Monthly Recipe Round-Ups on their own page in the recipe archives. I hope this will be useful for people who might be starting the South Beach Diet and looking for good things to eat for phase one, but even if you&apos;re not a dieter, you&apos;ll find some delicious offerings here. 
 Sometimes I find a good recipe that could be South Beach friendly with just a tiny change to the recipe, so I&apos;ll note those changes after the recipe link. I do assume that South Beach Dieters know to ignore things like croutons, potatoes, or rice but I&apos;ll try to remind you if the recipe includes something like that which isn&apos;t South Beach friendly (especially for phase one.) Here are the tasty phase one offerings I found this month, enjoy! 
 Phase One Appetizers and Condiments: 
 Double Dill South Beach Diet Friendly Tartar Sauce from Kalyn&apos;s Kitchen
 Chipotle Lime Deviled Eggs from Kalyn&apos;s Kitchen
 Ricotta and Herb Stuffed Mushrooms from Eggs on Sunday
 Spring Cheese Spread from Palachinka

 Phase One Soups, Stews, and Chilis: 
 Pea and Spinach Soup from Souvlaki for the Soul (skip the croutons)
 Mediterranean Eggplant Soup from Bleeding Espresso
 Zero Points Asian Soup from A Veggie Venture (a Weight Watchers recipe which also works perfectly for phase one)

What a great idea--thanks, Kalyn. I&apos;m sure South Beachers appreciate the list, but so do us &quot;other&quot; dieters--I&apos;m looking forward to trying out some of those salads and veggies! So glad to be included in this group.

I think I just found my menu for next month... and I&apos;m not even on SBD. Everything sounds soooo good!

Ah, you are such a dear! Using my pic like that...I am blushing. Great roundup! I come here almost daily for ideas! I appreciate all the hard work you put into these roundups.

What an awesome idea Kalyn! And yes, even for us non-dieters, it&apos;s good to have a place to find a bunch of healthy recipes that we *know* are delicious :)

And thanks for the mention!

I love all these recipes, they don&apos;t sound like diet recipes at all! Thanks for including me.

You put so much effort into these round-ups Kalyn, they are so useful. I&apos;m not a south beach dieter but I do watch my weight and it&apos;s just nice to see a collection like this even if you aren&apos;t on a diet. Thanks for including my pork chop, you are definitely right about trimming that fat off!

I don&apos;t do the South Beach Diet, but I love your round-ups! Everything sounds so good! You&apos;ve done all the work of gathering all these wonderful recipes, and thanks for the link!

I&apos;m so happy to know that people like this idea, thanks for the nice feedback everyone.

Too funny, I saw this last night and thought &quot;Bummer, I haven&apos;t done enough healthy stuff for Kalyn this month!&quot; and when I looked again saw my lentil link! I love that you do this, although I don&apos;t focus on all healthy recipes, I love eating healthy things and need to make some changes...I will have to look over this more this weekend. Thanks!

Great round-up indeed! I&apos;ve decided I need to watch my diet over the next few months, as I&apos;m keen to lose couple of kilos, so healthy recipes are very much appreciated..
 May 1, 2008 11:58 PM Julie said... 
Kalyn, all these recipes sound wonderful I can&apos;t wait to start preparing some of them.
