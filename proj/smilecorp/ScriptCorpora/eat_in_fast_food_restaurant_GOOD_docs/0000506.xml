I have been here a few times, and each time, I like it more. I like that they never let it get crazy crowded, and the fact they really keep up the &quot;speak easy&quot; theme. I mean, come on, you enter through a phone booth in an unassuming hot dog restaurant!  It is just cool.

This is a great place to take a date, or a friend.  It is fun, and different from your every day bar. I also like taking visitors here, it is an &quot;only in New York&quot; experience.  This is probably not the best place for a loud big group.

Drinks are a bit pricey ($15 per cocktail), but delicious and strong. It is nice to sit at the bar and watch the mixologist do his thing.

Rumor has it, you can call at 3:00pm to make a reservation. I have tried this multiple times, with no luck (just a busy signal).  So my recommendation is stop by before dinner/drinks, walk into the phone booth, and get on the list. They will take your phone number and call you when your up.

700+ reviews so this might (unfortunately) get lost in the mix; however, I hope someone sees this and succeeds in accomplishing something that I never could. here&apos;s the task:

1) ask a girl on a date (first date preferable, but not necessary)
2) tell her to dress nice (set expectations)
3) make a reservation at PDT (call at 3pm on the dot kids!)
4) walk her into Crif Dogs 20 minutes before your res,
5) order cans of PBR and tell her she can have any hot dog she wants
6) (assuming she passes the test described below) act like you&apos;re walking out, walk into PDT, and bask in your sneakiness / the awesome atmosphere of taxidermy and finely-constructed cocktails.

if done correctly, I think this could be a great litmus test for a first date, right? if the girl loves the hot dog (they are amazing) and doesn&apos;t feel let down by the fact that you told her to dress up and took her to a hole-in-the-wall (or at least doesn&apos;t show it), she&apos;s a keeper. if she starts complaining... let her go and give up the res at PDT (preferably to someone walking in).

if anyone successfully completes this, please message me and let me know how it goes. good luck!

(for the opposite first-date test, see my eerily similar review for burger joint)

LOVE this place!  i can&apos;t believe i didn&apos;t come hear earlier although i&apos;ve known about it for years.  I&apos;ve been to other speakeasies in NY but like PDT because you can make reservations here, has an amazing selection of drinks and their dogs were top notch.  Atmosphere was trendy, classy and perfect for a first/second date since its quiet enough to have a conversation but not uncomfortably quiet.

I had the Mezcal Mule with the Italian Dog!  I highly recommend both!

I called around 3pm on the day of (they only take same day resos) and got resos within 10 minutes for a Thursday night.

Def will be coming back to try some of the other drink selections!

Love this place. My friend suggested it as we wandered around the neighborhood, but warned we&apos;d probably have to wait even though we arrived very early in the evening. &quot;Go in, pick up the phone and give them your number,&quot; she told me. I charged through a (rather obnoxious) party of four standing outside the phone booth doors and was immediately greeted by the hostess, didn&apos;t even have to pick up the phone.

&quot;You have a reservation?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;How many?&quot;
&quot;Two.&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re both here?&quot;
&quot;Yep.&quot;
&quot;Right this way.&quot;

I was floored as she led us to two bar seats (next to two other empty bar seats -- maybe it pays to act with some discretion when you arrrive at the mystical phone booth, because we&apos;re certainly not The Beautiful People, just two ladies with good manners, apparently wonderful luck and good timing).

Drinks were excellent -- a bit of a splurge at $14-$15 a glass, but most definitely worth every penny, especially when you watch the mixologist pull everything together. So artful and amazing. I can&apos;t really add much to what the other reviewers have said. If you like a good cocktail this is the place.

I had the Paddington, which was complex -- fruity, but dry, and also tart. And I also tried the Corps Reviver, a twist on the Corpse Reviver. Also delicious. Absolutely no complaints.

I&apos;d love to come back on a return trip to the city, and while I&apos;m sure the experience would be every bit as excellent, I&apos;m not sure I would have such good luck breezing in again! Definitely worth giving it a shot and definitely worth a wait if you have to.

PDT is part of Crif Dogs, Inc. (so you aren&apos;t surprised when you see this showing up on your bill).

They say reservations are very difficult so I had someone manning the phone starting at noon on the day of and we still couldn&apos;t get it because they were all booked.  So we did it the wrong-but-still-acceptable way.

We had already planned a trip to Crif Dogs though so we were still in the area.  Upon arrival at Crif Dogs, my sister stuck her head in the booth and &quot;rang &apos;em up&quot; by using the pay phone (which serves as a doorbell for them) and asked if they were able to accommodate a party of 7.  Thankfully, they had a cancellation at 7pm (it was 6pm at the time) so we put our name down right away.

PDT isn&apos;t very large and it was a low-key experience.  There aren&apos;t any drunken folks causing a ruckus and it is just a good time to catch up with everyone in your party.  Not the type of place where you have to yell to get your point across at all.  The drinks are all very unique and my party&apos;s agreement is that they were awesome in flavor and creativity.  I ordered the Mesclun Mule (sans alcohol) and it had a slight kick to it and wasn&apos;t overbearingly sweet.  I will for sure be ordering this once again next time I come here.

The customer service isn&apos;t top-notch, but still friendly.  Our server was quite the looker (and impressively memorized all the drink orders w/o needing to write anything down), but seemed to be in a tiffy mood.  The guy at the front was really kind and helpful though!

I love it!  Discreetly hidden behind a cute, old school phone booth in Crif Dogs is PDT.  The two establishments couldn&apos;t be different!

Dark, dim and decorated with stuffed animals (not the kind little kids collect), PDT is a really cool place to chill and try some unique libations.

I had the Benton&apos;s old fashioned.  Although I&apos;m not a bourbon fan, I can&apos;t resist anything that is infused with my favorite pork product.  Oh man was that sucker potent!  Luckily, it had the hugest ice cube I&apos;ve ever seen and as that slowly melted, the bourbon became more subtle and the drink was enjoyable.  Really good smoky bacon aftertaste.

My bud got the Summer blues and sunburn...more on the girly side of the drink menu and delicious!

They also have food items on the menu from Crif Dogs that you can only order exclusively at PDT.

No reservations allowed for parties of two.  Just gotta suck it up and put your name down as soon as you arrive.  We were told to come as early as 6pm on a Thursday.  Arrived at 6:45pm and waited almost an hour and a half to get in.  So be prepared to wait!

My favorite of the speakeasies I&apos;ve been to from coast to coast thus far.

You know..I was expecting it to be a little more upscale for some reason. You know why? because no one hell knows. Its low-key, underground, so I didn&apos;t know what to expect. I think I dressed up a little too much, and was not prepared to let loose or loosen up thinking its an all exclusive hush hush upscale bar with no room to falter off my mascara. But I was wrong. Its hush hush and all about the science of the martini. I liked that. I liked that I was wrong.

The secret of having to find your way, be let in, be on a reserved list the day of no more no less, was interesting enough to keep me on edge the whole day waiting in anticipation. I would if given the chance work on the seating and lighting a little better

The mixologist---intense. The crowd----easy. The night---just getting started.

This place will fulfill your every dream of what a speakeasy is/was like back in the prohibition days - enter a narrow, hole-in-the-wall hot dog shop.... the shop in itself is a bit of a destination with a huge menu of dogs all ways (bacon-wrapped, etc..) old-school video games like Galaga and Double Dragon at the entrance and if you look to your left, an unassuming little phone booth....

Step inside and pick up the phone, a moment later you may jump out of your skin when the &quot;wall&quot; (door) beside you pops open and a bearded man greets you asking for your reservation!
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

Inside, it is a bar with booths, an area just as narrow as the dog shop beside it and a cocktail menu just as creative as the decor and hot dog creations.  Bacon infused bourbon, I tried some blue drink with frangelico that was amazing... Honestly, it&apos;s all about the thrill of finding something &quot;hidden&quot;.

A MUST-DO!  Where else will you get such an experience?!  If anything, go to play the vintage video games cause, as their sign says, they&apos;re like 84 years old in video game years, antique!

Impromptu any things are always my favorite; which is why I adore PDT.  For some reason, I never really plan to be here, it just kinda happens.  Likes most amazing things in [my] life.

Call it what it is, yes it is a speakeasy...yes you do need to go in the phone booth, at crif dogs on st. marks...you know the drill.  But aside from all of that, the drinks are pretty spectacular.  I&apos;m always amazed at the long columnar looking ice &quot;columns&quot; (not cubes, duh).

Was able to get an table last Thursday night; the crowd was pretty chill.  Some locals, and some not so local who have heard of this place...even though it&apos;s called Please Don&apos;t Tell.  It seems as if everyone has been telling...I meaaaaannnn.  We waited about an hour for an opening; but it wasn&apos;t so bad since we managed to wait while devouring a crif dog and some pretty damn good cheese tator tots.  I digress... So an hour later, and 2 blocks away, we got a call that our table was available.  We finished our drinks at another bar that remains nameless (not memorable), and b-lined our way back.  (it&apos;s that serious)

So if you&apos;d like to impress some out of towners on your speakeasyness, bring them here.  Or just do an impromptu drink date with some friends.  Whatever you like, come to PDT!

I&apos;ve been here twice.  The first time, it was relatively easy to make a reservation for a Tuesday night.  We sat at the bar and had a good time watching the people on camera in the phone booth.  But the drinks were just ok.

This time, it was more of a pain to make reservations, for a Monday night mind you.  At one point, we got through and then the person on the other end just hung up on us.  But we did manage to score reservations after calling about 100 times each.  Ugh.

It&apos;s pretty cramped in there and the ceilings are low.  Not for the claustrophobic.  But I dig the weird taxidermy scattered about the place.  Check out the jackalope by the bathrooms!  Speaking of bathrooms, the doors slide.  They don&apos;t pull out.  That messed me up for a second.  Why do the doors have handles on them if they slide?!?  And the bathrooms were tiny and nasty.

I like the unique menu that you can only get in PDT but it wasn&apos;t worth all the anticipation and hype.  We tried the Chang dog and Wylie dog.  The Chang dog is pretty good.  The kimchi was tasty.  But the fried mayo on the Wylie dog just did not work.  It was kind of gross.  And I love wd-50!  We also tried some tater tot concoction which was ok but the puddle of oil at the bottom of the container was disgusting.

Once again, the drinks were just ok.  Plus don&apos;t rely on the clientele being civilized.  A large table next to us was calling out for shots and being generally obnoxious.  You could tell the bar staff was annoyed but they didn&apos;t do anything about it either.

The unique entrance through the phone booth was fun but it&apos;s like the weird twist in a movie.  Once you know about it, it is just not much fun anymore.

I&apos;ve tried to come here numerous times before finally making it.  Last time the hostess told me an hour&amp;a half so I put down my name&amp;number for a party of 2&amp;went to the bar across the street, but never got a call back even after 2 hours.  Came back again on a Thursday night around 8 PM and had more luck...I&apos;d recommend putting your name down before dinner&amp;then grabbing something close by like yakitori or dessert!

The drinks are really unique&amp;strong as hell (coming from a petite Asian).  I liked this green jade one&amp;another one I had called the shark, which was a pretty aqua blue/grey w/ a cute beach umbrella.  Excited to come back to try more!

It&apos;s my last night in New York, a windy Monday, and meeting up an old friend. He tried setting us up with a reso at this place called...PDT?  Apparently you can try calling around 3:30pm each day to try and reserve a table. Unfortunately by the time he had free time at 4:00 all the tables were already scooped up. Guess we were out of luck.

Then again, it was just him, my girlfriend and I. Apparently you can sit at the bar with a party of 3 or fewer. Worth a shot...

We walked into a popping restaurant called Crif Dogs and checked in with the phone booth. Even though we couldn&apos;t get a table, we were seated at the bar inside after about half an hour.

Few things to know about Please Don&apos;t Tell:

1) Yes, walking into a secret wall behind a phone booth is pretty much the coolest thing in the world.

2) Expect it to be crowded. We couldn&apos;t get a reservation, then waited half an hour on a Monday. I shudder to think the wait times on a weekend.

3) Ok, there are some house rules, but this is pretty common at speakeasies. When we went though it wasn&apos;t so packed and they didn&apos;t care as much.

4) You can order food from Crif Dogs - and it&apos;s not half bad! In fact, they serve up some of the best cheese fries I&apos;ve ever had. Not a bad pairing with my $15 drink.

Yeah, the drinks are pricey, but that&apos;s to be expected. The drinks are delicately crafted and the ones we tried were delicious - and strong. Maybe we shouldn&apos;t have spent our half hour waiting at a different bar drinking.

If you get a chance, go. PDT may be my favorite bar in NYC, and one of the highlights of my trip - even if just for one drink.

Let me save you time: Stop reading reviews now, get dolled up, and go here!

The experience amazing, the atmosphere is superb, and the drinks are some of the best I have had in NYC.

I had the Sunburn which was a perfectly balanced drink. Also tried some of my friends&apos; drinks which included the Momofuku cereal milk inspired deliciousness and the Wicked Witch. All were perfectly made.

Still not sold? To get in you have the find the secret phone booth and dial 1. Where else can you do that?

I love that you enter the place through a phone booth inside a hot dog establishment...kinda makes you feel like James Bond.

The drinks are classic, the atmosphere is that of a laid back lounge. A great place to go with a few friends and catch up.

Spending a Saturday afternoon calling PDT 90 (yes, 90) times is absolutely worth it for the AHMAZING cocktails, Torres Tots, and a Crif Dog with Momofuku kimchi...  Absolute heaven.  And the cute bartenders wearing suspenders and bow ties just tops off your experience.

A must for anyone living or visiting New York City.

This is the place to go to find out how cocktails should be made and presented.

While waiting to get in, we tried the hot dog, well that what a great hotdog.

The entry from the phone booth is an experience. I was so expecting to drop down in the floor &quot;Maxwell Smart&quot; style, but as the back wall of the booth opens you are presented with an fantastic bar which is just right.

Being a fan of a old-fashion cocktails, I was not disappointed. The large cube block of ice the cocktail was built on was crystal clear, the bourbon mixed just right and so easy to drink.

The service is right too, its fells like your the only one there. The house rule is no phone calls inside, no disturbing other guests and take your hat off.

This is a must for a NYC visit, make a booking, and don&apos;t be late.

We were lucky enough to skip the reservation rigmarole thanks to a friend who had to back out of hers at the last minute.

The novelty of stepping in the phone booth, dialing the rotary phone, and watching the tufted black door swing open is pretty cool the first time. But then you&apos;re greeted by the progeny of Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga, aka the hostess who sincerely believes she has the most difficult job in the world and &quot;Jeez, just hold on a minute, I&apos;m cleaning your table!&quot;

Inside, you&apos;ll find a lot of decorative taxidermy. One particular bear at the end of the bar provides the perfect dramatic backdrop for the more theatrically inclined.

I seriously considered the bacon infused bourbon (described as having a smoky aftertaste) but was glad I went with the Rosemary Society recommended by our suspenders-wearing waiter.

Don&apos;t use the bathroom unless you really need to go. There&apos;s barely enough room to get your business done.

I stumbled here on a drunken Sunday evening in the fall and had no issue getting in. My friend, who is English, was the one that picked up the phone and after about 5 minutes we were walked in. The drinks are very interesting and I like the decor of the place.

I don&apos;t like being told where to sit though in an empty place. Bar siting is reserved for mingling and people watching but you basically have to sit facing forward as there is very little room between stool. The prices were extremely reasonable for a place like this because they were creative and very strong.

The downside: I&apos;m well over 21 yrs old, please don&apos;t given me &apos;rules&apos;. I&apos;m out to spend money and have a good time with my friends. If I want to send someone a quick text, let me. If my phone rings and I pick it up...big deal. The rules posted on the bathroom walls threw me back and I was hoping to receive a phone call while there!

Ahhh PDT. I&apos;d go back but maybe with a slightly large group so that we could get seated in a booth.

This place is tiny and very hard to get into.

Like many others, we had to call about 40 times right after the clock turned 3pm on the day that we wanted to visit (you can only make reservation on the same day). When we finally got hold of someone to answer the phone and was told that the only available reservation for that night was 8pm - a bit early for a speakeasy but we took it anyway as we are foodies and despite our ambition to drink the night away, food is a very important part of the overall experience.

Despite of having the 8pm reservation, we still had to wait about 20 mins before somenoe let us through the mysterious phone booth door. Once inside, we immediately started ordering rounds and rounds of hot dogs and drinks.

To be honest, the bacon wrapped hot dogs and bacon infused burbon were bit disappointing. But this is still a cool place that anyone should visit at least once. Also, don&apos;t forget to try the corn dog, which was the highlight of the evening for us.

This place is amazing. From its alluring atmosphere and tastefully strong mixed drinks, this place has got me hooked. I came in to the unassuming hot dog restaurant where my friend led me to a phone booth. As I pondered why the heck we were standing next to this phone booth he gets inside and makes a call. Suddenly, I realized that this phone booth is no oridinary phone booth, but it opens up on the other side allowing people to enter and exit from the bar. One girl in the hot dog restaurant was absolutely confused as she saw people leaving from the telephone booth! I absolutely loved the concept, and it&apos;s just one of those places where you have to experience it for yourself. The dim interior created a romantic, yet mysterious atmosphere where we ordered our craftily made drinks. Despite the appearance of a mixed drink, I was taken aback at how smooth it was, give most of the drinks range from $15-18 a pop. However, one or two drinks will sure to get you buzzed/tipsy from the way they make it at this bar.

We ordered the tater tots, which were absolutely delicious! Especially when you&apos;re drinking. I guess everything tastes a better when you&apos;re enjoying drinks and eating. However, these tater tots were crispy to very end! I was very impressed at how they managed to make it so delicious despite the fact that they were only tater tots. The crif dog was quite savory and paired wonderfully with our evening at the bar. Loved this place, and I highly suggest it for those seeking to venture out and try something different than the usual bar/lounge.

I had always wanted to try out this place, and Friday night I finally got my chance.  Three of us went with a friend who had been once before. She had called right at 3PM and got us a reservation for 10PM.

When we stepped into Crif Dogs, there was a line of people to the phone booth.  My friend kept telling us to look away so the secret would not be spoiled, but annoyingly there were too many people without reservations trying to get in that there was no way not to notice.  At one point the girl in front of us had a 5-minute long discussion with the guy in PDT with the door in the phone booth wide open.  So there goes the surprise.  I still wanted to try the phone call thing, but as soon as we picked up the phone, the guy opened door letting us in.

The atmosphere was cool - I can definitely see it straight out of the Prohibition Era.  The servers and bartenders were all dressed the part too.  Definitely not the type of place you&apos;d mingle; more of a place to just enjoy your own company.

We were put in the back booth, which seemed nice and secluded until we realized we were right next to the two bathrooms.  I&apos;m not sure, but I swear at least 20 people used the bathroom during our one hour there.  The place barely held 30 people, so it&apos;s like everyone decided to go to the bathroom right after we arrived.  A couple of oblivious folks even left the bathroom door wide open.

I ordered the Mezcal Mule.  I liked it.  It had so many different flavors and was not too spicy.  My friends enjoyed their drinks too (Jade Fizz and Paddington?).  It seems like a place for a true drink connessieur, but since I am not, the $15 did seem pricey.  For a speakeasy with more of a &quot;mingling&quot; sort of atmosphere, I&apos;d go to the Back Room.

Shhhhhh please don&apos;t tell... it&apos;s a secret............

Hidden location inside (Crif Dogs), the phone booth is the secret passage, the red
phone plays the roll of a doorbell alerting the host there are people outside. My initial thoughts??? wow so mysterious. Reservations are suggested, you can&apos;t just pick up the phone and say &quot;party of two&quot; without waiting inside the hot dog shop. BTW, while waiting outside the phone booth, the lingering scent of delectable hot dogs and fries are running through your system. DAM!! I&apos;m hungry Ma! LOL

I can&apos;t say this is a dive bar, because it was more of an intimate place of bonding. PDT hidden lair slakes the city&apos;s thirst for impeccable made cocktails and prohibition-era intrigue. Can everyone sing &quot;I like the barrrrrtendarrrrr&quot;... the drinks are very strong as these mixologist know what they are doing.

I&apos;m not going to spoil the place for you, because SHHHH it&apos;s a secret. LOL

Sorely disappointed. Came into this place with high expectations, given its rising (already risen?) status with regards to speakeasy lounges. This might be a review for a particular bartender, but my two friends and I ordered three drinks, and were unhappy (read: disgusted) with all of them. As a starving, poor New Yorker, I will damn well finish off all food and drinks given to me, but I almost didn&apos;t finish my drink. However, I got clever and started to &quot;share&quot; with my compatriots, forcing them to have more of my drink.

As to be expected, as well, it is pricey ($15 for a drink) and has a long line. Also, to be expected, it is dark and classy looking inside.

How to get in: Walk into the Crif Dogs, go to the phone booth, and hit one. Wait. Put your name on the list. Peace until called.

Please Don&apos;t Tell might be more appropriately named Please Don&apos;t $hell.  I&apos;m not saying I wasn&apos;t delighted when I stepped into the phone booth and was then whisked promptly into a 21+ land consisting of leather seats and speakeasy-cozy decor with its lack of windows and lighting.

I just think Angel&apos;s Share and Death&amp;Co have more dimension in their better constructed drinks, especially considering all three establishments serve drinks priced at $15. Of the drinks we had at PDT, Tom Collins was by far the favorite, Cereal Milk was overwhelmingly sweet given that the main ingredient was Momofuku Cereal Milk soft serve (which is overwhelmingly sweet in itself), Shark was less sweet and came with a cocktail umbrella (obviously a WIN), and Jade Fizz was a bitter matcha drink.  They were solid cocktails, but nothing stood out.

If there were a few changes I wish I could see at the other lounges, it would be that Angel&apos;s Share accept parties larger than 4 and that Death&amp;Co accept reservations, so thanks PDT- I do appreciate the ease of making reservations at 3 pm for a party of 5 at 7 pm, but no I will not be enticed by your Narnia like charm.  Even if the experience comes with a cocktail umbrella.

After having a celebratory engagement dinner at Yakotori Taisho, we go to PDT to keep the good times rolling. Once again, PDT doesn&apos;t disappoint.

Told the future wife to pick up the phone in the booth and they let us right in, I mean who&apos;s really going to say no to us tonight... A low-key, chill vibe on this Sunday night, which fit the mood perfectly. We were seated at the bar. We told the bartender what we wanted in our cocktails and he whipped us up a few concoctions. Of course, all the drinks were good and went down smoothly. Spent the rest of the night, soaking up the vibe and having good conversations with the wife and bartender at PDT. Great night.

After getting engaged and dinner, we didn&apos;t  want to go to bed just yet. Didn&apos;t necessarily wanted to go to a rowdy club. We wanted to go to a intimate, chill establishment with chill people and that&apos;s what PDT provided perfectly. Always a worthwhile destination.

This is my Number One spot to bring out of town guests

Not being one to doll myself up just to go out for drinks, i love the laidback take they have on the speakeasy.

the drinks are on the pricey side, but these are thoughtfully crafted drinks with interesting and original ingredients.

they keep it quiet in there, making it a rare great spot for conversation

sure it&apos;s hard to get in, but if it wasn&apos;t it would be the same shit-show that so many other bars in this area are

the waitstaff is attentive and happy to make up delightful new cocktail creations that align with your tastes. The service is maybe a little more spicy than sweet, and i appreciate that.

the food is unpretentious, dolled up hot dogs and waffle fries. The drinks are the stars here.

As I sat in the bathroom I thought to myself.

Christ[opher]!  I&apos;m in a bathroom in a bar in a payphone in a hotdog stand.

My mind was blown.

Then I went back out and took another sip of my sweet and salty or whatever it&apos;s called.  I dunno. its the best cocktail I&apos;ve ever had, it&apos;s garnished with a piece of saltwater taffy, and I can&apos;t for the life of me tell you what&apos;s in it or what its called.

Hopefully, that should give you some indication of how awesome this place was, how happy I was to order more drinks, and how drunk I got at the bar in the phone booth in the hotdog stand.

Please Don&apos;t Tell is one of the most sought after reservations for a cocktail lounge in NYC.  They only take reservations the day of and start taking calls at 3:00PM sharp.  My cousin and I were both madly dialing their number in hopes of landing a reservation while having lunch with the family at Eleven Madison Park.  It took us about 30 minutes to get a midnight reservation a weekday but it was well worth it.

Walking in through the payphone at Criff Dogs is pretty cool and amusing at the same time.  A few people couldn&apos;t figure out how to work the phone and the bouncer had to open the door and explain it to them, which takes the fun out of the process.  Drinks are well made and there is a special menu of dogs and bar bites that seems different from the Criff Dogs menu.  The house rules are posted in the bathroom by the sink, check it out while you are there.  I would come again if I can get a reservation.

The cat&apos;s out of the bag. The beans have been spilled. You&apos;ve heard it through the grapevine. Everyone seems to know about this amazing place that is indeed hidden behind the phone booth in Crif Dogs. How freakin&apos; charming is that?

Perhaps not as charming as the bouncer and the friendly bartenders who are clearly in love with their fancy mixology professions. They make their drinks strong and provide you with quality ingredients to sip on. Cocktails are about $15 each, and considering the quaint and not-so-hidden gem that PDT is, this is quite a deal for amazing drinks.

A word of advice about the bathrooms: the doors slide open. As in, don&apos;t push the door. It slides. Don&apos;t get stuck. Now have yourself an awesome PDT time.

PDT is your speakeasy prototype, a hidden cocktail lounge through a phone booth in a hot dog shop (Crif Dogs).  It&apos;s as equally hard to find as it is to get in, but once inside it&apos;s a great place to sit and hang out for an hour or two sipping on amazing unique cocktails. As expected with any speakeasy, the cocktails aren&apos;t cheap, but they&apos;re definitely worth it.  The waitresses are super knowledgeable, if you&apos;re having some trouble picking from the large cocktail menu just tell them what type of liquor or taste you&apos;re in the mood for and they&apos;ll bring you exactly what you&apos;re looking for. PDT is the perfect spot for a different/fun date, whether it be 1 on 1 or a group date, as well as a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends or take some clients.  Awesome snacks are also available from Crif Dogs next door, if you haven&apos;t already eaten some hot dogs while waiting for your table.  We suggest getting a reservation on Thursday-Saturday or you&apos;ll be waiting forever, you&apos;ll have more luck just walking in on off nights.

Had high hopes for this place... and it let me down.

It was a lot of fun making the reservation, going to Criff dogs and ringing the phone. Such anticipation on my end until a door swung open and a super rude excuse for a hostess opened the door. Glad I had a reservation. We were seated in a cute table for two. Would have preferred to be at the bar. Our waitress was sweet, however, the drinks left me disappointed. They were not bad per se, but at $15 a pop (or whatever they were) I would much rather go to Angel share. Probably will not return unless I have some out of towners visiting. I am sure they will get a kick out of it.

Such a cool little place I was introduced to last weekend. Everyone says that this place is super crowded, but I didn&apos;t get that feeling. We (3 of us) got there around 11:30 on a Saturday, called in, and were seated within 20-30 min. Not bad!
We were seated at the bar, which we preferred. It was cool to see the bartender make all the drinks...skilled.  The place was pretty quiet and I got yelled at for having flash on my camera within 10 min of being there. But it&apos;s so dark you can&apos;t get any pics without flash! But the bartender was nice and turned the other way when I snuck in a couple more. ;-)  I later went to the bathroom and saw the whole list of rule(..ohhh)!
The drink menu was very unique. All these liquors that I have never heard of and interesting combinations. The drinks were not on the weak side either! The only names I remember were the Mezcule Mule and The Gold Coast. The Mule was a lil more of a girlie drink; think Mojito, and good! The Gold Coast was manly and strong! I had another tall, pepper rimmed drink that I just couldn&apos;t drink. I felt bad &apos;cause it seemed like there were 20 steps to making it, but again, the bartender was nice enough to exchange it for me.
We just came from dinner, so we didn&apos;t get the chance to try any of the food, but we started talking to some girls next to us (quietly..haha), and they said the dogs and tater tots are amaze-balls! Must go back to try some more of the cool drinks and food.
This is definitely not a good place for a group; 2-3 is good. Cute lil date spot too &apos;cause you can actually have a conversation and hear each other. Will be back!

Started calling for a reservation on a Tuesday night at 3pm the day-of. Called for 20min straight, finally got through, and the guy said they were booked. That is ridiculous! So we do a walk-in sort of thing, had to wait over an hour to get in at 10pm (just two of us). After all of that, we decide on two cocktails, not really knowing was we were getting, and neither of us liked them. BUT I totally understand that&apos;s our fault. There&apos;s no way you could like every single option and we definitely picked the wrong ones. The Shark that someone else ordered looked delicious so we were regretting not ordering that. And unfortunately I wasn&apos;t hungry so I couldn&apos;t try any of the special hot dogs. So sad. I will have to go back and have a new experience here.

This place is great! Yes, it&apos;s small, and yes, I suppose it&apos;s &quot;exclusive&quot;, but that&apos;s the whole allure. My boyfriend and I called (many, many times) to get reservations for a Friday night, but it was totally worth it.

We had our name down for 10:30 and showed up about 5-10 min early. The hostess let us in with no problem, and she was really friendly. Granted, I&apos;ve only been here once, but I was shocked at how nice and warm the staff was. Our waiter was great and very helpful, as well as attentive. The hostess was smiling all night, and considering the amount of complaining people and other bullshit she probably has to deal with, I would say it&apos;s impressive that she maintains a positive outgoing demeanor.

The drinks are fantastic and unlike drinks you&apos;ll get anywhere else. Again, that&apos;s what makes this place special and worth the hassle to try it. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a matter of the place being snobby, it&apos;s a matter of demand, and lots of people want in. I&apos;d say swallow your pride some night, and make it happen, the experience is worth it.

Me and my friends first speakeasy lounge and it was quite fun. I won&apos;t get into the details as to how we got in since I am sure everyone who uses yelp is smart enough to figure that out. In a way I am honoring its name.

What is great about this place is that if you don&apos;t have reservations you can&apos;t get in, so there is a limited amount of people that can enter. Everyone gets a seat/table and it does not get crowded with people standing around everywhere. It makes this place much more engaging and enjoyable. We get to relax, have some drinks, and have a conversation without any crowds and loud noise.

Drinks were pricey, but worth it. I tip my hat to the master mixologist. Each drink had some great deep flavors. Bacon bourbon and butter infused bourbon? Only a drink genius can make those taste good. And they did.

The food was great too! Apparently they have a special menu that is not available at Crif Dogs next door. The cheesy tots were bomb! That&apos;s some damn good bar food. The Chang Dog was amazing! Momofuku Kimchi is just better then regular kimchi and I don&apos;t even like regular kimchi that much.

Overall a really great lounge. If you are going to your first speakeasy then this is a good place to start.

I&apos;ve been here twice now and both times were with folks from out of town. The first time I came I was very excited to go through the mystery telephone booth. After the first time though it quickly loses it&apos;s novelty.

Place is teeny teeny tiny but guess it comes with the overall true speakeasiness feel. The first time I sat at a table meant for two (there were three of us), and the second time was at the bar. Drinks were also really good but also super pricey at around $15 each.

It&apos;s definitely a unique spot, but I think I cannot love this place just b/c of all the headache surrounding the effort it takes to get in here. On the Saturday that I went, I called right at 3PM, which is when they start taking reservations. If it&apos;s a busy day like Saturday, you better pray your phone somehow beats someone elses right at 3PM because right when the clock strikes three, you&apos;re immediately hit with a busy signal. I literally kept re-dialing the number for a half hour straight and finally managed to get through and make a res. If you&apos;re into mixology you will love it but drinks are also pricey. This is a place that I&apos;ll probably continue to bring friends from out of town just to show them something unique, but you most likely won&apos;t find me here otherwise.

**Spoiler Alert! This review is down and dirty and doesn&apos;t leave anything to chance. Don&apos;t read it if you want a surprise. But seriously. After 600 reviews, a million bar-blog posts and a spot on the Travel Channel, what&apos;s really left to be surprised about?

I know you&apos;re not reading this review to decide whether you actually should go to PDT or not. You already have your mind made up there.

So why don&apos;t I spend my time giving you the information that you&apos;re likely looking for.

Do you really need to call ahead? Does it really take 20 minutes for the phone to pick up? Do you really need to wait an hour to get in? Are the hot dogs that good? How about the drinks? And the price? All that and more to be revealed, in...the....least.......ground-breaking...........­.....Yelp....................review...in history!

1. Yes. You need to call ahead at 3 pm the day you plan on going. Not the day before. Not a week before. Not an hour before. But at 3 pm, the DAY you want to go.

2. Yes. It will take about 20 minutes (or upwards of 50 dial-in attempts) to actually get through. Don&apos;t give up! Keep trying! And another hint: even once the phone connected and started ringing through (I must have looked like an idiot walking down 10th avenue jumping up and down like I just won the lottery) it took a good 10-15 rings before they finally picked up with a simple, inconspicuous: &quot;PDT&quot;.

3. Make sure you know how many people will be in your group and what time you want a table. If you want bar seating, request it. Otherwise, they fit you in wherever a table opens around your reservation time. And because of the one-in, one-out style exchange, every seat is accounted for, and there is no changing of situations once you arrive. We found that out the hard way. More later.

4. No, it doesn&apos;t take an hour to get in - when you have a reservation. If you simply decide to walk in, on a whim, then yes, you likely will need to wait, anywhere from 15 minutes to upwards of a few hours, depending on how busy it is and how many reservations are already made for that evening. We went at 1 am on a Friday night in February - translation: minimal tourists and people. There was absolutely no line. Nada. Zilch. Zippo. Non-existent! I could imagine, however, that at 11 pm on a Saturday in June, you might have a completely different experience.

5. The hot dogs were good, but they didn&apos;t blow my mind. It could have been that I was drunk. It could have been that I don&apos;t think I like kimchi, and I ordered the Chang Dog. I couldn&apos;t tell you. But I&apos;d say they&apos;re worth trying, especially if you&apos;re already there, silly!

6. Drinks - outstanding. I wish I had more money (and wasn&apos;t already so deep in) when we were there - I would have sampled one of everything! Highly recommend going if you enjoy mixed drinks. A must do. Please don&apos;t go here and order a beer or wine. Please. Unless you must. But don&apos;t. Really. Don&apos;t. Okay, okay! Order a beer, dammit! I&apos;m not going to stop you. But I&apos;ll have my cocktail, and drink it, too!

7. Bring the credit card. They both accept it, and you&apos;ll need it. $15 a pop for the cocktaily-confections. Laid down a $100 bill with four drinks, four dogs and a side of cheese tots. That&apos;s before tip, mind you.

8. How to get in? Walk into Crif Dogs. Immediately on the left hand side in a door. Yup, that one. Open it. Step in. Pick up the phone. Dial a number. ONCE. Hang up. Wait for them to slide the door open and proceed.

9. Last thoughts: plan ahead, unless you&apos;re flying solo. In that case, you&apos;re likely to get in rather quickly, as evidenced by our single friend who decided to join us. We had a reservation for three, she had nothing. She hopped in line and dialed in after us, and ended up only having to wait about 10 minutes before she was seated at the bar. Then, the host was nice enough to switch us to larger table to accommodate all four in our group. But not without chastising me for not giving them a heads up. Hence, plan ahead and call if there are changes. They really do have the seating thing down to a T.

I would definitely go back again with a group of friends who haven&apos;t been yet. I would definitely bring out of towners or someone you&apos;re looking to impress or &quot;wow&quot; with an off-the-beaten path kind of experience. Worth doing at least once!

10. For good measure. Had to have a 10. I&apos;ll leave the decor, music and overall ambiance to you to experience. Sometimes, it&apos;s nice to be surprised by at least something!

Ring a &quot;1 on adjacent hipster hot dog hangout Crif Dogs&apos; rotary-style telephone and a hostess on the other side of the wall will ask if you have a reservation and if not, your party number. If you&apos;re lucky or you planned ahead, you&apos;ll be ushered into the plush, dark, low-ceilinged interior of this underground speakeasy and sat at one of several U-shaped leather booths for larger parties, or at the bar on a first-come first-served basis. Beer and wine are decently priced, but PDT is all about cocktails. The generous list has thoughtful descriptions for each cocktail and seasonal offerings, and two of the four cocktails we ordered delivered the goods. The Sixth Street, a gin-based reddish cocktail made with ginger and an egg white was frothy and delicious-on par with Apotheke&apos;s supreme creations, if with a bit less fire to it. Doug&apos;s Kansai Kick, made with Yamazaki 12 (all the rage these days), lemon and ginger, was spot-on too, while the Shark and Twenty Butt [something] were more miss than hit.  The Shark was beat blue and too chock full of Curacao, and the scotch in the Twenty Butt [something] was hardly tamed, unlike in the Penicillin, one of our favorite cocktails. You may have noticed, but we&apos;ve been spoiled with regards to premium cocktails these days, and two out of four &apos;ain&apos;t bad-but when you&apos;re paying $15 a drink, each one needs to deliver.

Six different hot dogs are served from the kitchen next door through a (hilarious) tiny square hole in the wall behind the bar at $6 a pop, and the crunchy Jersey-style dogs actually pair surprisingly well with the bold ingredients in these designer cocktails. Sunglassed (?) taxidermy and plenty of young, beautiful people provide visual fodder, and the bartender and hostess were both efficient and friendly. If you like hot dogs and haute cocktails, or if you&apos;re in the East Village and need to impress some people, PDT might be the perfect spot. Just take the whole experience with a grain of salt. This is, after all, a speakeasy cocktail bar affixed to a f*cking hot dog shop by a faux phone booth. And it&apos;s called &quot;Please Don&apos;t Tell&quot; but they have a f*cking website. C&apos;mon, people.
