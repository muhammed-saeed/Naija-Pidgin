1- Birthdays Of Girls
_______________________

Each of the girls listed in this section you can marry.
When you giive a gift
to a girl on their birthday they will like it a lot.
Gifts that a girl likes
normaly will typically raise her one heart level on her birthday.
I recomend
you date advantage of these dates.

If your birthday is the same as the birthday of a girl on here
then her
birthday will become the secondary birthday that is listed.

Elli:
Birthday; Spring 16
Secondary Birthday; Spring 20
Likes; Toy Flowers, Pink Cat Grass.

Ann:
Birthday; Summer 17
Secondary Birthday; Summer 22
Likes; Spa-Boiled Eggs

Karen:
Birthday; Fall 15
Secondary Birthday; Fall 23
Likes; Popcorn, Wine

Popuri:
Birthday; Summer 3
Secondary Birthday; Summer 10
Likes; Any kind of flowers

Mary:
Birthday; Winter 20
Secondary Birthday; Winter 25
Likes; Mushrooms, Yellow/Green Grass

The Harvest Goddess:
Birthday; Spring 8
Secondary Birthday; Spring 9
Likes; Anything That You&apos;ve Grown On Your Farm
(her favorite is pinaples),
Winning The Harvest
Goddes Quiz, Getting Steps On Your Pedometer
(Wrapping the Harvest Goddess&apos;s
Gifts will NEVER
make a difference, so don&apos;t bother),
and lastly she also likes the flowers that
grow around her
pond in summer.






2-The Birthdays Of The Harvest Sprites
______________________________________


If you give gifts to a Harvest Sprite then they will begin to like you. If they
like you a lot then they will help out on your farm. This can be very, VERY,
usefull. The Harvest Sprites like flowers that are the same color as they are.
Different Harvest Sprites will respond differently to questions and answers.
Wrapping a gift for a Harvest Sprite makes a BIG difference. The Harvest
Sprites are listed in the order that their beds are in their house (from the
far left bed to the far right bed).

Chef, Red: Fall 14

Nappy, Orange: Winter 22

Hoggy, Yellow: Fall 10

Timid, Green: Summer 16

Staid, Blue: Spring 15

Bold, Purple: Spring 4

Aqua, Aquamarine: Spring 26

 lolo_240 08-02-2008, 06:20 AM Harvest Moon: Friend Of Mineral Town
Character Guide :smailes20:

There are six young ladies who you can marry in the game.
Each of them has different attitudes and tastes such as one of
them is a tomboy, a drunk, a free caring person, a spoiled child, a shy
intellectual kid and a goddess. Despite all of their personalities,
they&apos;re all babes may I add. ;D
Unfortunately, those females aren&apos;t instanly yours.
There are also other boys than you who has a close eye on them. So you&apos;ll
have no choice but to assert your love in a quick and brutal way.

When talking to one of the girls whom you can marry, you&apos;ll come across
a heart icon which is showed in the breast area. This shows you their
affection towards you; the color of the hearts specifically designs
how far your relationship with her is going well, and will change
eventually if you being nice to her.
When starting the game, the girls will start with a black/grey heart,
so it is up to you to change it into another color which are the
following:

Gray =&gt;Purple =&gt;Blue =&gt;Green =&gt;Yellow =&gt;Orange =&gt;Red

In order to raise the heart color, you&apos;ll have to give them gifts or
do any kind of method which will raise her affection towards you.

There are something called&quot;heart events&quot;which you&apos;ll probably encounter
when the wives are in Gray, Purple, Blue and Yellow heart colors. Those
special cutscenes which will hold you and her spending romantic
times together. This&quot;heart events&quot;can only be triggered in a specific
day, time and place. You might as well encounter other events which
involves you and your girl but there are no considered as heart events
but simply personal events.

After the girl is at Red Heart, an item called a blue feather will appear
at the supermarket. This will allow you to propose one girl her hand in
marriage. However, there are few conditions which you must have done
before she will accept you. You must have:

- The big bed
- Have seen all her heart events
- Have the kitchen and all utensils
- Have at least above 100,000G of money
- Being friendly with her family (not required but increase odds)

*NOTE*

-All Cutscenes will not occur if you are holding an item over your head
when walking in the area.
-If you made the same birth date as the girls, then her usual birthday
will become the alternate one.

-----

APPEARANCE: A blonde girl with deep shining green eyes, wearing a
purple blouse.

HOW TO WOO KAREN FOR BEGINNERS UNTIL AT PURPLE HEART:
During Spring, give her Bamboo shoot which can be found
in Mother&apos;s Hill. Before giving her the gift, talk to her first and
thereafter, give it to her. Then, at least buy one item at her store.
Repeat the same method at least for 15 days, her heart might turn
Purple. If not, continue the routine repetitively until it does.
Also, try giving her various item else than bamboo shoot such as
Wine which can be purchased at the Winery between 10AM and 12PM.

If you started wooing her at Summer, well, there isn&apos;t much to do
since mother nature doesn&apos;t provides what Karen is fond about like in
Spring. So you&apos;ll have no but little choice to spend money on Wine.
Just give her the Wine and buy anything items at her stores.
If you have already the kitchen, then make her Tempura, Tempura Rice
or Sashimi. Don&apos;t forget to talk to her before giving her the present.
Repeat the same routine for 15 days and her heart might turn Purple.
If not, repeat the routine until it does.

If you started wooing her in Fall, then do the same routine
like in Summer. If you have already the kitchen, then make her
Tempura, Tempura Rice or Sashimi. Don&apos;t forget to give her
various gifts and buy at least one item everyday.

If you started wooing her in Winter, either give her Wines, make
her Tempura, Tempura Rice or Sashima (if have kitchen) or go into
the Winter mine to search for Diamonds and Pink Diamonds as present.
After giving her one of the those options of present above, buy at
least an item at her store. Repeat the same technique for 10 days
or even more until her heart turns Purple.

OTHER INFORMATIONS:
When playing the first time the game, and would for the first time
meet Karen, most people would shout&quot;Holy crap! She&apos;s damn gorgeous!&quot;
Indeed, Karen might the hottest girl of the game but beauty doesn&apos;t
make her the perfect angel because unfortunately, she is an alcoholic.
If you decide to marry her, then good luck on a&quot;drunkie&quot;future!
She lives at the grocery store with her parents Jeff and Sasha.
She doesn&apos;t really help around the store though. She only wandering
around in her room, and occasionally near the paper wrap.

Karen is a damn bad cooker. As a matter of fact, she doesn&apos;t even
notice herself. She isn&apos;t really aware that when she cooks for others,
they&apos;ll start acting weird because of bad food indigestion. No one seems
to bother to tell her that her meals are despicable...

For this girl, your rival is none other than Rick aka Popuri&apos;s brother.

| KAREN&apos;S EVENTS |
\______________/


BLACK HEART EVENT
-----------------

*Requirement for the event to occur*
- Need an empty tool slot

Head to Jeff&apos;s Store on Wednesday or Friday between 10AM and 1PM.
You need to have an empty slot for the event to occur.
When you&apos;ll walk in, she&apos;ll warmly greet you into town. Since
you just started being an farmer, she thought you might need help to
start up the farm. And so, she ask you if you need any hint.
If you picked the&quot;need help&quot;option then she&apos;ll give you a bag of grass
seeds. If not, then you&apos;ll get nothing. So what is good for hospitaly
if you don&apos;t accept it eh? ;D


PURPLE HEART EVENT
------------------

*Requirement for the event to occur*
- Karen must be at Purple heart or higher

On any day, head to the store from 10AM and 1PM.
You will find inside Sasha and Karen having a disagreement over what type
of seeds to send to one of her family&apos;s member who unfortunately got sick
recently. Now, Sasha and Karen wants your opinion to see which one should
be best to send. If you chose Sasha over Karen, then you&apos;ll increase Sasha&apos;s
affection towards you. However, Karen&apos;s love points will decrease.
If you chose the opposite, then Karen&apos;s affection will raise towards you
and Sasha&apos;s affection will still remains the same. So I guess you better
choose Karen over her mother.


BLUE HEART EVENT
----------------

*Requirements to trigger the event*
- Karen must be at Blue heart or higher
- Have an empty item slot
- Have the last version of the rucksack


Head to the Grocery Store between 10AM and 1PM on a Friday.

Apparently, Duke made a Wine only dedicated to Karen when she was still
a child. It was some sort of birth present. Karen, being excited,
decides to go get it at Duke&apos;s. Jeff then notices you and
invites you to go to Duke&apos;s place with Karen to pick up the special Wine.
At the end of the event, Karen will offer you one of her special wines
that she kept preciously with her. I guess she also wants you to become
an alcoholic.&gt;_&gt;;


YELLOW HEART EVENT
------------------

*Requirements for the event to occur*
- Karen must be at Yellow heart or higher
- Have the last version of the rucksack

Head to the Supermarket on Monday, Thursday, or Saturday between 10AM and
1PM. Once inside, you&apos;ll be known as Jeff and Sasha&apos;s life saver. Because
at the moment you butt in, Karen made a despicable meal for her parents.
Jeff and Sasha will whisper to each other that they will both be doomed if
they don&apos;t avoid this horrible situation. Fortunately for them,
they&apos;ll soon notice you and ask Karen why won&apos;t she ask you instead to
inhale her meal. If you&apos;re a merciful person, then you&apos;ll choose the&quot;yes&quot;
option to save the asses of Jeff and Sasha, but you&apos;ll have to pay the
consequence. After eating the homemade meal of Karen&apos;s and having a bad
indigestion, you&apos;ll end up awaken in the hospital with Karen besides
you. She will wonder what made you sick.


WINE DUEL
---------

*Requirements to trigger the event*
- Have Karen&apos;s heart color at Green or higher
- Be really friendly with Duke

Go to the Inn on a Sunday during 7:30PM and 10PM.
While inside, you&apos;ll see Karen and Duke challenging each other to a wine
battle. The goal of this challenge is to drink as much wine as possible
until one is over-saturated. They&apos;re both going to wager something which
is Karen has to lay off the debt that Duke owe to Jeff if he wins.
If the opposite, Duke have to pay all the debt he owed to the
supermarket. Karen will suddenly ask you if you&apos;d like to supervise the
duel. It doesn&apos;t matter which options you&apos;ll choose, the event won&apos;t end
When the duel begins, Karen will go wild and win. Therefore,
Duke will have to pay the bill. Doug will then ask to take
Duke at home since he is so inebriated to do it himself.
Once at Duke&apos;s, Manna will be shocked and angry at Duke for being such
a dumbass. Then a long dispute occurs.
After this troublesome night, you&apos;ll be outside their house at
11PM able to control your character again.


BEAUTY AS PAYMENT
-----------------

*Requirement for the event to occur*
- Can only be triggered after Won&apos;s arrival in town

Go to Zack&apos;s place between 11AM and 3PM. Zack and Won will warmly greet you.
Suddenly, the beautiful Karen will come by and ask about the new store
that just opened few days ago. Won who unfortunately been charmed by
Karen&apos;s sexiness, will tell her that today is a special day which
she can choose any merchandise of his store for free.
When Karen chose her item and leave, Zack will start wondering what item
he should pick. Unfortunately, Won will say that today&apos;s free item choice
is over, so he&apos;ll demand both of you to pay up. Humph...damn bastard!&gt;_&lt;

[AN6]---------------------------- Ann ------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
BIRTHDAY: Summer 17 | HOME: Inn
SECONDARY BIRTHDAY: Summer 22 | RIVAL: Cliff
FATHER: Doug | NATURE: Tomboy
| PROFESSION: House Cleaner
|
MADLY FOND ABOUT: | MOSTLY LIKES:
Cheese fondue, Truffle rice, pancakes | Cake, Sandwich, Savory pancake,
and Queen of night | Spa-Boiled Egg, Perfume, Ice Cream
| Cheese cake, chocolate cake,
EXTRA LOVE POINTS: | Strawberry milk, Pudding,
Buy any meals at the Inn excluding |
the glass of water |
-----

APPEARANCE: She is thin, dressed like a farmer. She has orange hair
with an ponytail hairdo.

HOW TO WOO ANN FOR BEGINNERS UNTIL AT PURPLE HEART:
During Spring, go purchase a chicken at the poultry farm.
After it layed an egg, turn the egg into a spa-boiled egg by
throwing the actual egg into the hot-spring. Give it to Ann
after talking to her once. Afterwards, buy any meals as long as
you aren&apos;t buying the glass of water. Otherwise, the extra loving point
won&apos;t count. Just keep the same method each day until her heart turns
purple. This could take approximately 15 days.

If you started wooing her in Summer, do the same method as in Spring
since mother nature doesn&apos;t provide any stuff that Ann likes nor as
what your farm provides. Just use an egg to turn it into a spa-boiled egg.
Remember to do the extra love points which is to buy any meals from the
Inn except the glass of water. Keep the same method each day until her
heart turns purple. This should take an period of 15 days until she gets
to purple heart level.

If you started wooing her in Fall, use the spa-boiled egg method again.
If you have the kitchen and the necessary utensils to do certain recipes
listed above in Ann database, offer it instead of spa-boiled egg.
Don&apos;t forget, try giving her various gifts each day and don&apos;t
forget the extra love points. Just keep this up for approximately
15 days until her heart turns purple.

If started in Winter, either doing the spa-boiled egg method, the
recipes method or go into the winter mine to get diamonds and pink
diamonds to use it as a present for her. After giving her the present,
buy any meals excluding water. Do this routine for 15 days or until
her hearts turns purple.

OTHER INFORMATIONS:
Ah yes, the beautiful Ann who doesn&apos;t act very much feminine. In fact,
she doesn&apos;t even wears feminine clothing nor make-up, just half male and
female outfit such as now, she is wearing like a farmer.
So giving her dresses as present isn&apos;t really a good idea.
As hobby, she loves to clean her properties and then take a long and very
exciting hot bath. ;D Well, she&apos;ll eventually say this reply to you when
talking to her in the second floor of the Inn if you don&apos;t believe me.
Besides that, she runs the Inn with her dad Doug. Like her father,
she has great talents at cooking. As for her mother,
she died long ago when she was still little in the 5th of Winter.
Despite her mother being dead, she was able to move on and live
a happy live. Although, her father doesn&apos;t seemed to deal the death f
her wife as easy as her daughter...

Your rivalry partner for Ann is Cliff, the shy foreigner.

KEY TO HAVE ANN ONLY FOR YOURSELF:
On the 14th of Fall (first year), Duke will come by at your farm and ask
you if you&apos;re free to help him out tomorrow morning. Just say Yes,
then he will suggest you to find another person in town to aid you.
Don&apos;t ask Cliff! If you do, then he will stay in town forever until he dies!
If you don&apos;t ask him, well, congratulation! You&apos;ve just won Ann for
yourself!&lt;insert dr.evil&apos;s laugh/&gt;At the end of the year, at Mineral beach,
you&apos;ll see Cliff standing in the wooden port, gazing at the sea with a sad
look. Doug will be there, asking him what would he do now and in the near
future. His destiny is still unknown, and perhaps living at Mineral Town
for awhile was wrong, by replying to Doug. He thought possibly there were
something meant to him in Mineral Town...apparently no. Since, he&apos;ll
soon be broke, he&apos;ll have no choice but to leave the place and never seek
to come back.

But her effort fell in vain. She will then ask you to do something about this
matter. Just help her out even though it is wiser to stay away from a fight.
When butting in, Doug and Duke will shout at you for barging in their

along. And, if Cliff doesn&apos;t like it then too bad for him, she&apos;ll say angrily.
The only way that Cliff found to resolve the problem was to accept
the person and nature of who she is.

talk to the doctor to get examined. Also, go talk to Ellen and Stu and
you might as well give them a random gifts, as long as they like it.
Do the same routine for 15 days and her heart might go purple.

If you started wooing her in Summer, you can again give

Orichalcs and then ask Saibara to make womens accessories.
Either way, do the extra love points and repeat the same coordination

If started wooing her in Fall, do the mining and milks method.
If you have already the kitchen with the necessary utensils, do
the hot milk recipe or an egg recipe. Then after giving her a gift from

15 days.

If started wooing her in Winter, go find Diamonds in the mines or once

use the white grasses which can be found behind Carter&apos;s church by
taking the right door. Then afterwards giving her a present,
do the extra loving points which is being analyzed by the doctor
for 10G and befriend with Ellen and Stu. Thereby you can get to Elli&apos;s
purple heart approximately 15 days.

OTHER INFORMATIONS:
Elli works at the hospital with the doctor as a nurse.
All she does is selling remedes against falling stamina and
fatigue. Her goals in life, is to become a great nurse which
is capable of helping her family at full potential because in her
childhood, her grandmother Ellen has lost her two legs and being this
way until now. Elli feels guilty for being powerless when one of
the member of her family desperately needs helps. Also, her
parents were missing and due to this matter, Elli had but little choice
taking care of Stu, her little brother, with all cost. Otherwise, she
wouldn&apos;t had any reasons to live since her little squirt and grandmother
is all she has...for now, until you butt in or the doctor comes in.

Your Rival for her in hand marriage is obviously the doctor.

brought the medecine, the doctor said it was the wrong one and ask to
get the right one this time. So Elli goes off get it with a begging
for forgiveness. At the end of the event, Elli will ask you if

belittleling herself, Ellen will ask you a favor if you could go seach
for little brother Stu. If you go with&quot;going search for Stu&quot;, you&apos;ll
increase both female&apos;s affection points. Okay, Stu will be at the church
since Carter is the third person who Stu cares the most. Don&apos;t worry,
you&apos;ll automatically get there without breaking a sweat. Once over there,
Stu will admit that worrying her sister was a bad thing. So he&apos;ll decide
to go back home. Once you brought Stu back at his shelter, Elli and Ellen
will thanks you for being such helpless. So she&apos;ll give you a pressed flower

family used to go to the beach Vacation Villa every
year. Today she&apos;s thinking about her brother Stu. She
asks if you like his practical jokes and if she should
step in and stop him. Elli wonders if she&apos;s raising
him the same way her mother might have. When she asks
for your opinion, tell her not to worry about it
(option 2). She&apos;ll thank you for giving her a little
boost of confidence, and then leaves to go play with

(Thanks to Master Man for this info)


STU IS SICK?
------------

*Requirements to trigger the event*
-Be friend with Stu

Head to Ellen&apos;s place at 9AM-10AM on a Wednesday.
Today, the whole family seems to be suspicious over Stu because he seemed

bigger. After Elli&apos;s gauge is filled, she thought she should bring
Stu see the doctor for taking more precaution. Stu say to her sister
and her grandmother that he&apos;s perfectly fine, but either of them won&apos;t
listen. So Ellen will ask you if you would like to go along will Elli
and Stu to see the doctor. Once there, the doctor will say that Stu
is fine. So false alert...


THE SECRET LETTER
-----------------

*Requirement for the event to occur*
- You must be friend with Ellen

On Wednesday between 9AM and 1PM, head to Ellen&apos;s house.
Elli will search amongs the bookshelf the book which she has rent it

return it to his rightful owner. However, instead of finding what she
was looking for, she found something more precious and valuable.
Apparently, it&apos;s a love letter written by her grandfather dedicated to
his wife Ellen. Stu and Elli are both shocked of finding a piece of their
family&apos;s sacred past. After Ellen reads it, she&apos;ll say that she will
treasure it forever and ever until she dies.


STU&apos;S DESIRE TO PLAY

On Wednesday, head to Ellen&apos;s house.
Inside, you&apos;ll see Stu wanting to play with somebody. After
he noticed you, he&apos;d like to play with you. Elli soon say to the little one
that you might not have the time since you are busy with your farm and such.
Once again, Stu will ask the same question again hoping that you might
accept it. There will be two options available. If you chose not to play
with him, you&apos;ll make him cry, plus decreasing his affection for you.
If choosing the playing option, you&apos;ll raise both Stu and Elli affection.
However, playing with him will leave you at 6PM outside their house.
So, choose wisely. lolo_240 08-02-2008, 06:43 AM

-----

APPEARANCE: Pink haired girl wearing a black/white dress.

HOW TO WOO POPURI FOR BEGINNERS UNTIL AT PURPLE HEART:
During Spring, go at the supermarket to buy chocolates.
After talking to her once, offer her a chocolate and you&apos;ll be all done
for the day at wooing Popuri. Also, you can offer her strawberries if you
managed to ship 100 of every Spring crops which can be purchased at the
supermarket. After then the stawberry seeds will become available.
If you have a huge amount of money and lumbers, ask Gotz to extent your
chicken house. After Gotz doing so, get yourself eight chickens/chicks
to unlock the extra affection points. Anyhow, do the chocolate method
at least 20 days or until her heart turn into purple.

If you started wooing her in Summer, do the same thing as I written
above, except for the strawberries part since it doesn&apos;t grow in Summer.
Well, Popuri is the hardest girl to woo due to her taste. The only way
to woo her with excellent technique is to have a kitchen since most of
her favorite items is done by cooking. If you haven&apos;t done her extra
love points, just do it now. This coordination can take about 20 days
until her hearts turns purple.

If started wooing her in Fall, give her some apples which can be found
under the tree at your farm. Apparently, she likes one of those. You
should thanks mother nature since wooing Popuri is very hard. You can
also do the chocolate method. Either way, just suit yourself. If you
haven&apos;t done the extra love points thingie, do it now. This routine can
take about 20 days or so if you are doing this perfectly.

If started wooing her in Winter, go into the Lake mine and dig for
diamonds and pink diamonds. If you have the whole complete sets of
utensils for cooking, do a sweet recipes such as ******s, chocolate cakes,
and all sweets recipes you&apos;ve gathered so far. Especially, do her eggs
recipes since she is most fond about eggs. Either way, suit yourself. You
can still go back at the chocolates method. If you haven&apos;t extent your
chicken house yet, may I suggest you to do it now? This routine
should take 15 days until her heart turns into purple.

OTHER INFORMATIONS:
Popuri lives at the poultry farm with her brother Rick and her mother
Lillia. Sometimes, she acts like a childish person but then again,
she&apos;s very respectful and kind towards everybody in town. In the morning,
she spends her time at the Goddess hot spring with Ann only in sunny days.
Afterwards, she spends all her time at the poultry farm.
She occasionnaly goes to Rose square or at the church.
As hobby, she loves taking care of chickens. Also, she
devotes her time at caring the health of her mother Lillia since she
caught an illness long ago which apparently haven&apos;t been cured yet.
Her dad left the house a ages ago, to find a medicine for his sick
wife, but he hasn&apos;t returned yet. Throughout the game, you might
find some clues of his whereabout (*SPOILER*). Heed my words, if
you are determined to marry her, then embrace yourself for an expend
future!

For her hand in marriage, you must fight Kai, the guy who lives at the
beach restaurant next to Zack&apos;s house.
While Kai&apos;s gone during the other seasons (Fall, Winter and Spring)
take the advantage of the situation! Fill Popuri with gifts!

plenty of customers to please Kai. Kai is amazed, but he also seems
troubled since it will be a real pain in the ass to serve all those
people. So he&apos;ll ask you if you can aid him with this heavy affair.
You&apos;ll automatically accept even though you don&apos;t want to. After the day,

coming up very soon which is the 19th of Spring, so she ordered

to purchase a chicken or chicken food, you&apos;ll have to wait tomorrow.
Anyhow, Rick then rushed in, bringing along with him some medicine.
Right afterward, Popuri too, comes in with plenty of medicine along with
her. Lillia&apos;s children were very worried about their mother, therefore,
they had to take precaution in any case. Lillia ended smiling for the fact
that her children are actually thoughtful [/COLOR]and worried. lolo_240 08-02-2008, 06:48 AM

HOW TO WOO MARY FOR BEGINNERS UNTIL AT PURPLE HEART:
In Spring, mother nature will provide you something called a Blue grass.
You&apos;ll find one of those near Gotz&apos;s property and the hotspring area.
Offer it as a present after talking to her once when she is at the
library. Afterwards, allocate the extra love points technique which
is heading yourself at the second stage of the library and read a
random book. If you are a person who likes to spend money, you could
buy grape juices which can be bought at the Winery. Also, you can
also buy Turbojolt at the Clinic since Mary seems to like it.
Remember, the first gift given is the one who actually affect the
love points of the person. Keep this routine for 15 days or so until
her heart turns purple.

If you started wooing her in Summer, again, use those blue grasses
which are found at the exact same area as Spring. You can also
purchase Grape juices at the Winery or Turbojolt at the clinic.
Just choose whatever option of present to give. Remember to
do the extra love points thingie. Otherwise raising her to Purple will
take longer than 20 days.

If you started wooing her in Fall, instead of giving her a certain color
of grasses listed in her&quot;mostly likes&quot;list, you can offer those red
mushrooms which by the way are called poisonious mushrooms. Or you can still
stick with the old method which is giving her Grape juices and Turbojolt.
After talking to her once, give her a gift and after, do the extra love
points to increase some more affection toward you. This routine should
take approximately 15 days.

If started wooing her in Winter, you can offer her white grasses which
can be found either behind Carter&apos;s church or behind a tree in the
dead-end near the woodcutter&apos;s house. If you have the cheese milker, give
her cheese for an period of 15 days. Don&apos;t forget to do the extra love
points technique.

OTHER INFORMATION:
Mary spends most of her time at the library. After all,
she&apos;s the proud owner of the property. She lives next door of the
establishment with her parents Basil and Anna. Her father is an naturalist
who also likes to read books. So meaning Mary got her gene after her daddy.
Unlike the other wives in town, she doesn&apos;t have the visage to compete with
them. However, her qualities and personalities does. A dude named Gray who is
by the way your rival for this young lady in marriage, will fall in love with
her not because of her beauty, but instead her beauty inside aka personality.
As hobby, she loves to read books and create some. She likes eventful days.
In conclusion, she is really an fascinating women to explore.

around here. Inside your main character&apos;s mind, you&apos;ll be asked if

her out if you wish to raise her affection. So after accepting her
request, you&apos;ll automatically be searching amongs the book in the
second bookshelf. After a bit, Mary will question you if you found it
yet. Replying with an negative answer, you&apos;ll still be searching for

MADLY FOND ABOUT: |
Everything that grows in your | MOSTLY LIKES:

-----

APPEARANCE: Green haired girl, wearing a tight white dress.

OTHER INFORMATION:
As you can figure it out for yourself, she is the goddess of harvest.
And yes, marrying a god is possible, as well as making a baby
with enormous god power. The purpose for her being available as a wife
is to give more challenge for those who are skilled at Harvest Moon
series and for those who missed their chances at marrying one of the
other available girls in the game. You might also notice that no heart
icon appears in the breast area. Her heart icon is invisible as the town
residents. Meaning, she doesn&apos;t have any heart events.
You&apos;ll usually find her in the Spring pond at the hotspring area. In
order to summon her, you&apos;ll need to throw an object into the pond.
There is no technique to woo this female. You can only do certain
tasks to raise her affection. Giving her goodies won&apos;t do any good.

To have the right to marry her, you must accomplish certain tasks
which are the following:
- Ask Carter if you can marry the goddess during confesionnal time.
- Have the big bed from the T.V shopping network.
- Have shipped all shippable items of the game.
- Have fished all types of fish including the legendary fish king.
- Have fished one thousand of small fish and average fish.
- Have shipped one thousand times certain crops.
- Have walked 100,1000,10000 steps while carrying the pedometer with you.
- Have collected all Harvest Goddess jewels and received the goddess gem.
- Have digged at level 255 of both mines.

Also, there are other tasks which can help raise the goddess affection but
it is not needed to marry her. The point of these requirements is to make
sure that the goddess won&apos;t decline your proposal or perhaps even not to
have accomplish all the request listed above.
- Have the Mathematic book by winning the Goddess game show (100x)
- Have threw into her pond at least one of every crops of your farm.
- Have acquired 100,000,000 Golds.
- Have all power berries throughout the game.

After doing all those tasks, wait five years because you can only marry
her in this circumstance. Go purchase a blue feather which serves as purpose
to propose a person her hand in marriage. Toss it into her pond and you&apos;ll
be engaged with her. You&apos;ll only have to wait for seven days until the big
day. However, after getting married to her, she will leave you aside and goes
back to her work...meaning, she will abandon you.
---------_____________________--------------------- lolo_240 08-02-2008, 07:00 AM 
You aren&apos;t the only one to chase after the ladies. You&apos;ll have to fight
them in order to get the right to marry them. You better watch out,
because they&apos;re talented seducers. In anyhow, don&apos;t ever see their Orange
heart event, otherwise there&apos;s nothing you can&apos;t do to prevent the marriage
to occur in seven days later with their respective females. Fortunately, you
can only see them in your fourth year of playing the game only.
So you have plenty of time to react. Although, you can be friend with them
if you like to. There is no harm worshipping the enemies. If you become
enough friend with them, they might do something good in return for
your kindness such as giving you cooking recipes, invites you at
their marriage and etcetera.

Unlike the girls, their heart events can occurs anytime which are
Black, Blue, Green and Orange heart. Once again, you might encounter
other events which are not heart events.
There is no secondary anniversary for them even if you chose the
same birth date.

One more thing, do not underestimate them, just try to drive them off
in the hard way. So good luck dealing with them either by destroying
or becoming friends with them. lolo_240 08-02-2008, 07:09 AM -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

basically around 8PM. When entering the 2nd floor, you&apos;ll see Ann walking
to meet up with Cliff. They both soon enter a subject about Cliff&apos;s past,
but for some reason, Cliff doesn&apos;t want to talk about it. So Ann decides
to end the&quot;chit-chat&quot;and leaves the room for work and hope Cliff
would one day face his past and open his heart for others. This is the
exact same moment that Cliff will think about Ann. DUN DUN DUUUNNNN!!!


PURPLE HEART EVENT
------------------

*Requirement to trigger the event*
- Only available on Spring, Summer and Winter.

Walk into the church between 11AM to 3PM. When inside, you&apos;ll see
Carter and Cliff having a little conversation over having friendship
contact with the Mineral town residents. Naturally, Cliff says that he can&apos;t.
He can barely talk to people. All of sudden, Ann walks in and Carter greets
her with kindness. Thereafter, an brilliant idea occured to Carter. He ask
Ann if she could possibly show Cliff around Mineral Town to meet some gentle
folks. Ann gladly accept the offer and she says that she&apos;ll show him around
another day since she has work to be done.


GREEN HEART EVENT
-----------------

*Requirement to trigger the event*

ORANGE HEART EVENT
------------------

~Requirement to trigger the event~

Head to the Winery&apos;s wine storage after 10AM. You&apos;ll see Cliff working
very hard as usual. After awhile, Ann will come meeting up with Cliff
bringing along with her a lunch to give it to this last.
Duke suddenly bumps in, looking by the way happy, and welcomes Ann.
Apparently, he isn&apos;t really aware that he has prevented an romantic
reunion between them. Without any hesitation, he said that both of them
make a great couple. Ann becomes very embarrassed meanwhile Cliff, well,
he reacts in a terrible way. Then Ann run off back home and Duke wasn&apos;t
really aware that he hit her in the sensitive part (in a psychological way).
Duke ask Cliff when is he going to tell what he feels about her.
Cliff, still paralyzed by this emotional scene, stays mute.


CLIFF&apos;S DESTINY
---------------

For this event, you&apos;re the one who shall decide Cliff&apos;s destiny.
There are two options available which can decide Cliff&apos;s fate.

On the 14th day of Fall on your first year, Duke will come by at your farm
and ask you a little favor. He would like you to help him harvest some
grapes all day. Just accept his request, it&apos;ll result increasing his
friendship point. Receiving an positive answer, he&apos;ll say to come by
tomorrow at 10AM and then suggest you to find a PARTNER which will assist
you, otherwise, you&apos;ll find the day very long and your stamina will be
wasted quickly.
Now, this is where you have Cliff&apos;s fate in your hand.

If you want Cliff to stay in Mineral town forever then go ask him the job.
However, it also means that he&apos;ll probably go between you and Ann if you
chose her as your wife. If you don&apos;t ask Cliff to aid you, then
this last will leave town forever and never seek to come back. In someway,
this will aid you get Ann without any obstacle ahead if you ever chose her
as your wife. So basically, you automatically won Ann. Anyway, let&apos;s go
back to our little event.

(OPTION N1)

By asking Cliff to join you, he said he&apos;ll come by tomorrow.

On the 15th of Fall, head to the Winery at 10AM. Manna will say if
both of you are ready to commence the project. When it begins, both of you
will harvest grapes all day. At the end of the day, Duke is very impressed
by Cliff is way of working. So Duke propose Cliff to work here as a full
part-time job. Cliff gladly accept the offer and thanks you for creating
a new path of journey for happiness for him.
So basically, you&apos;ve created a life for Cliff and a strong bond of
friendship between you two. Even though that you might lose Ann, you
made yourself a good friend. In other words, do not take this badly.

(OPTION N2)

By not asking Cliff, the same sequence will still happen but without Cliff
on your side. Cliff will leave town after the end of the year forever.

Before the last day of Winter, head to Mineral beach.
You&apos;ll see Cliff having a conversation with Doug. Cliff tells him to
thanks everybody in town for their sympathy. Apparently, the poor guy
is going away and probably never coming back. He thought there were
something meant for him here, so at then end, he concluded it was all
an simple illusion all this time. His ambition was shattered like his
low money which is still getting lower. He soon walks away and
look at the sea for the last time then catch a boat.

This will be the last time you&apos;ll ever see him again...


ANN NOT BEING FEMININE ENOUGH
-----------------------------

*Requirements to trigger the event*
- Must be in a rainy day
- Cliff and Ann must be married


Go to the Inn in the morning during 6AM and 8AM.
Cliff has a problem dealing with the fact that Ann doesn&apos;t act feminine
enough. He thinks that all female genders should act feminine and not half
male and female. Ann replied that all she was doing was been herself all
along. And, if Cliff doesn&apos;t like it then too bad for him, she&apos;ll say angrily.
The only way that Cliff found to resolve the problem was to accept
the person and nature of who she is.


CLIFF BEING UNSCONSCIOUS
------------------------

*Requirements to trigger the event*
- In winter and must be a snowy day
- Be on your first year

Head to the town&apos;s plaza by the Yodel farm way.
You&apos;ll see Cliff walking slowly and not looking very good. When he looks at
you, he soon passes out on the snow. You&apos;ll find a picture of his family next
to him. Hopefully, the Inn was nearby and that&apos;s where you&apos;ll be headed to
ask for help. The event continues at the Clinic after Doug and you carried
him. The doctor, with his status news, say that Cliff will be fine and
he&apos;ll be restored to full health after a long rest for a few weeks.
After a while, you&apos;ll find yourself outside the Clinic.
You then realized that you still have the picture that Cliff dropped earlier.
You can give it to him back whenever you want. If you decide to give it to
him now, he&apos;ll wake up for a brief moment, and tell you the meaning of this
picture and about his past and then go back asleep. After a few days,
he&apos;ll be back as a reborn and stronger person.

*FUNNIEST CUT SCENE*

While Cliff is still sleeping, overwork yourself until you pass out.
You&apos;ll find yourself in Cliff&apos;s bed. But wait a minute? Where&apos;s Cliff?
The doctor had to kick him out of the bed and let you take the space.
Cliff is currently laying down in the floor which Elli is trying to drag him out of the screen! XD

APPEARANCE: A guy who is wearing an optical device on his head.

OTHER INFORMATION:
From his name, you may have already concluded that he runs the Clinic
with his personal nurse Elli. He is a serious man looking only for more
power in order to help others in need. You won&apos;t usually find him smiling
and laughing around since he is always serious and always focusing in
his duty. In his childhood, he was an unhappy kid who hasn&apos;t known much
being treated of love by his parents. Like him, their parents were also
doctors. They never had time to spend with their son. So the doctor
deprived them until he became doctor and knew what they felt which
is having the responsability of helping others. When he knew this
feeling, he felt guilty for being such an ass to his parents and
tries to help as much of people as possible to be forgiven.

When Elli first came in the doctor&apos;s life, he considered her as a normal
person. But little did he know that one day Elli will admire him so much
that she might be dying of falling in love with him. Even though, the

complement the doctor for his good work. The doctor also makes the
same remark. Not wanting this kind of answer, Elli will become sad
because the doctor seems to appreciate only for her good work and not for
her good physics. ^_^ Elli wanted more than be praised and acknowledged
by the fact that she&apos;s a nurse. Still ignorant, the doctor wonders what
he did to get her upset.


BLUE HEART EVENT
----------------

Head to Ellen&apos;s house on Monday after 9AM.
Inside you&apos;ll see Elli and the doctor taking medical measure to check
Ellen&apos;s health status. The doctor will say to Ellen to take it easy

Once in, you&apos;ll see Elli and the doctor who seem coughing at the
moment. Worried, Elli tells the doctor to take the day off. Since the

her worries. Blushing, Elli replied by saying as a nurse, that&apos;s her job.

You&apos;ll see the doctor gazing at the lake and thinking about
his childhood. When he will see you coming, he shall tell you
how he felt and lived an miserable life. His parents were doctors too.
However, they never had time to play with him nor showing him
any love. So all his life, the doctor was always frustrated against
them until he become doctor. Now, the doctor knows how his
parents felt and why they never had time to play with him. Being
a doctor is a sacred job which many people&apos;s life are in your hand.
When his thought became clear, he cries for not noticing this sooner.


JEFF&apos;S BLOOD TEST
-----------------

Head to the hospital on a Tuesday between 1PM and 4PM. When you&apos;ll walk
in, Jeff will yell loud enough that you had to barge into the commotion
in a brutal way. Jeff will thereafter try to convince the doctor what

the doctor had to take his blood test to see if he was compatible with Sasha?

APPEARANCE: Mean looking character with orange hair and mustache.

OTHER INFORMATION
Doug, the father of the beautiful Ann and the rough owner of the Inn.
When talking to him, at first you might think of him as a meanie. But
when knowing him throughout the game and especially by trying wooing
her sexy daughter, you&apos;ll find him delightful. You&apos;ll always find him
either behind the counter or in the kitchen. However, there is one
special day which he won&apos;t be present at the Inn. He will be at the
top of Mother&apos;s hill which is the 5th day of Fall. Seek below in
&quot;Doug&apos;s events&quot;if you want further information. His wife died
long ago. So he had to raise Ann alone which brought her until
now greedy.

A FIGHT BETWEEN DUKE AND DOUG
-----------------------------

*Requirements to trigger the event*
- Ann must have a purple heart or higher
- Must be a rainy day
- Must seeing the&quot;Wine Duel&quot;event before this one can occur

Head to the Inn in Sunday while Duke takes a break during his job. So
meaning during 7:30PM and 10PM. Inside, you&apos;ll see Ann trying to stop her
father and Duke from beating the hell of each other. (Go Doug!!!&gt;_&gt;;)
But her effort fell in vain. She will then ask you to do something about this
matter. Just help her out even though it is wiser to stay away from a fight.
When butting in, Doug and Duke will shout at you for barging in their
quarrel. When after through with you, they will no longer remember the affair
of what they were arguing about in the first place. So I guess you&apos;ve just
resolved the problem...that was just lame...


DOUG&apos;S BIRTHDAY
---------------

*Requirement to trigger the event*
- Must be in the 11th of Winter

When Doug is working in the kitchen at around 1PM to 2PM, head
to the kitchen and you&apos;ll see Ann giving him his birthday present.


ANCIENT MEMORIES...NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN...
--------------------------------------------

Go to the Inn on 5th day of Fall between 10AM and 1PM.
Ann will be there greeting you. As you look around, you&apos;ll notice that Doug
is absent. Ann tells you that her daddy is taking a day off and also, the
Inn will be closed early; so basically meaning, no bar time.
She will also mention that her father went to the summit of Mother&apos;s hill.

Next step, head to the summit of Mother&apos;s Hill to trigger yet, another
event which holds Doug staring at the lonely clouds as it fades
away as his memories about her wife. Little did he know that you were
there staring at him, he will mumble around saying stuff to himself.
He remembers the day that her wife died...the sky was crying as
it was raining hard. The last touch he was able to embrace before she
was gone from this world...lasted enough...given him enough strenght
to help himself cure this wound from the heart but not permently...


THE INVISIBLE BOND OF FATHER AND DAUGHTER
-----------------------------------------

Head to the Inn on a Friday between 5AM and 7PM.
When walking in, you&apos;ll see an pleasant surprise. Barley is on the phone
with her daughter Joanna which is the mother of May. Barley ask her if one
day she&apos;ll ever return to see her daughter May. Joanna will reply no until
she has fulfilled her dream. As Barley hangs up the phone, a
conversation between himself and Doug occurs. They&apos;re talking about
Joanna and May. Barley is mad at her daughter for being an awful person
by leaving May in his care. Also, she didn&apos;t thought about May&apos;s feeling. lolo_240 08-02-2008, 07:50 AM -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

APPEARANCE: Man around 50 years old, wearing a purple jacket.

OTHER INFORMATION:
Duke runs the Winery with his wife Manna. This man is quite similar to
Karen. He&apos;s very fond of wine. So I guess he should be an alcoholic.
Sometimes, Duke and Manna always have a fight against each other.
That is why her daughter Aja left the house in the first place. Aja can&apos;t
no longer endure the pain of hearing their parents fight each other,
especially when she gets involved. Since he is the proud owner
of the Winery shop, he gives himself the rights to drink the half
of what he makes which devides in half their benefit. That&apos;s why Manna
is always mad at him.

- Be really friendly with Duke

Go to the Inn on a Sunday during 7:30PM and 10PM.
While inside, you&apos;ll see Karen and Duke challenging each other to a wine
battle. The goal of this challenge is to drink as much wine as possible
until one is over-saturated. They&apos;re both going to wager something which
is Karen has to lay off the debt that Duke owe to Jeff if he wins.
If the opposite, Duke have to pay all the debt he owed to the
supermarket. Karen will suddenly ask you if you&apos;d like to supervise the
duel. It doesn&apos;t matter which options you&apos;ll choose, the event won&apos;t end
When the duel begins, Karen will go wild and win. Therefore,
Duke will have to pay the bill. Doug will then ask to take
Duke at home since he is so inebriated to do it himself.
Once at Duke&apos;s, Manna will be shocked and angry at Duke for being such
a dumbass. Then a long dispute occurs. After this troublesome night,
you&apos;ll be outside their house at 11PM able to control your character again.

about using Aja and Cliff as subject to put Duke into submission. lolo_240 08-02-2008, 08:01 AM -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

her at the Winery shop. Around 3PM, she will be at the plaza with
Sasha and Anna. Despite being around Duke&apos;s negative aura, she is
always smiling and in a good humor. Although, seeing her daughter
who has ran away from home once again will totally make her happiness.

Money Making Guide/Crop Guide


================================================== ===================

Starting Out
------------
You begin FOMT( ) with little more than an Ax, Hoe, Sickle, Hammer,
Pedometer, Watering Can, and 500G. This isn&apos;t much, but it&apos;s enough
to begin your empire of wealth. It&apos;s important to start out earning
a good amount of money in the beginning to make your life much easier
as the game progresses.

There are many ways to earn money in this game. Here is a list of
the money makers.

Foraging -
This is the&quot;easiest&quot;method of making money. You can find many
things worth selling in the forests, mountains, and even on the
beach. You don&apos;t even need to use any tools (and stamina) to get
them, although you will need to spend time actually getting them.
Here is the list for Spring.

Spring Items Price Location
------------ ----- --------
Bamboo Shoots 50G 3 found south of Mountain Lake
Blue Grass 100G 1 found near Hot Springs
2 found in Forest
Orange Grass 100G 2 found on Beach
Yellow Grass 120G 2 found on Beach

Total Net Earnings: 890G a day

NOTE: It will be very difficult, at first, to get everything at once.
When you start out the game, you will only have room to hold three
items and three tools. One of the first things you should buy
(besides seeds for your crops, which I&apos;ll cover later on) is a bigger
backpack. There are two upgrades. The first one, worth 3000G, will
allow you to hold 5 items and tools. You can buy this at the
Supermarket. One week after you buy this, a second backpack, worth
5000G, will be on sale (which can hold 9 items and tools).

During the summer, there will be even more items worth selling.

Summer Items Price Location
------------ ----- --------
Wild Grapes 50G 1 found south of Mountain Lake
1 found in Forest
Blue Grass 100G 1 found near Hot Springs
2 found in Forest
Green Grass 100G 2 found south of Mountain Lake

Fall (or Autumn) is full of all sorts of items worth selling (and
they are also worth a lot of money).

Autumn Items Price Location
------------ ----- --------
Mushrooms 70G 1 found in Forest
1 found north of Mountain Lake
1 found behind Church*
Poisonous Mushroom 100G 1 found in Forest

* You will need to be good friends with Carter in order to access the
back of the Church.

** You can access this area by taking the path behind the large
boulder that located south of the Mountain Lake. You will need to
use either the Cursed, Blessed, or Mythic Hammer to destroy the rock.

You&apos;ll only find two pieces of White Grass in Winter.

Autumn Items Price Location
------------ ----- --------
White Grass 150G 1 found in the north part of Forest
1 found behind Church*

Total Net Earnings: 300G a day

Mining -
You can mine for minerals in one of two places. One is located
behind the Goddess Pond and is accessible all year round. The other
is in the middle of the Mountain Lake and can be accessed in Winter
when the lake freezes over (although it is possible to reach this
cave during the other seasons with the help of a special item). You
find minerals by smashing rocks with your hammer. You can also find
bags of money (worth 10G each) that you earn immediately, as well as
Black Grass by tilling the soil. There are also stairs that you find
using your hoe that will take you deeper in the mine, giving you
access to rarer items. I&apos;ll list the minerals I&apos;ve gotten so far in
the Goddess Mine.

Mining Items Price Location
------------ ----- --------
Junk Ore 1G All floors in rocks
Black Grass 10G All floors in soil
Copper Ore 15G All floors in rocks
Silver Ore 20G All floors in rocks
Gold Ore 25G Floors 3 and below in rocks
Mystrile Ore 40G Floors 6 and below in rocks
Orchalic Ore 50G Floors 10 and below in rocks
Adamantite Ore 50G Floors 10 and below in rocks
Mythic Stone 20000G Floors 60 and below in rocks***

*** Mythic Stones will only appear once all 6 cursed tools have been
upgraded to blessed status.

NOTE: You use up a lot of energy breaking rocks and digging. You may
want to bring some food or energy drinks to regain your strength,
especially if you want to reach any deeper floors. (There are 255
floors in each cave, just to let you know.) In addition, you can
also save time by buying a basket at the Supermarket for 5000G. With
the basket, you can place up to 30 shipping items which you can dump
into a shipping bin at a later time. However, once you put an item
into the basket, you cannot get it back.

During the Winter, the Mountain Lake will freeze over and you will be
able to access the Winter Mine located in the center of the lake.

Mining Items Price Location

Moon Stone 55G Floors that end in 8 in rocks

Fishing -
You can get a standard Fishing Rod by visiting Zack sometime from
11AM to 4PM at his house in the beach. (You will need to have at
least one tool slot open in your backpack.) Fishing is different
when compared to other versions of HM. Here, you can actually
upgrade the Fishing Rod, just like your other tools. The higher
level your rod is, the better chances of getting larger fish. Your
standard Fishing Rod can capture small fish and very some medium
fish. The type of fish you can get (as well as its size) will depend
on where you fish, the fishing rod level, and the season you fish in.

Goddess Game -
During the first five days of Spring, the Harvest Goddess will have a
special TV game show. Her channel is located on the Left Channel
(although you may have to keep pushing the Left button on the
Directional Pad to find it). She will play a greater than or less
than game. She will give you a number and you must guess if the next
number is greater than or less than the original. If you&apos;re right,
you will get a chance to guess if the new number is greater than or
less than the current number. (If both numbers are the same, you
will another chance to guess.) You will be awarded with prizes on
the spot for getting more than 1 in a row. (Same numbers do not
count as a win.) The prize that easiest to get that can be sold are
the herbs (2 in a row). However, you will make more money by selling
the Relaxation Tea Leaves (at 1000G a bag). You&apos;ll need to get
exactly 10-14 answers correctly in a row to get this. You can play
the Harvest Goddess game up to 5 times a day. You may want to save
the game before playing and after winning.

Horse Races -
On the 18th of Spring, you can place bets on horses to win medals.
These medals can be exchanged for gifts. Most of these gifts can be
sold back to earn money. Each medal costs 50G. If you happen to win
with a horse that has pretty good odds (usually higher than x4), you
can make a profit buying some prizes and selling them the next day.
Here&apos;s a list of prizes that can be sold.

Prize Cost Price
----- ---- -----
Adamantine 4 medals 50G
Truffle 10 medals 500G
Diamond 14 medals 100G
Broach 18 medals 2000G
Necklace 20 medals 2000G

You can also ship more items by bringing your Basket so that you can
ship a maximum of 38 items. (30 in your Basket and 8 in your
rucksack.) Your best bet is to fill them with Broaches.

Once your Horse is fully grown, you can actually race with him during
the festival. You can also bet on yourself!

Crops -
During your first year, your main source of income will come from
growing crops. Crops require investments, meaning you won&apos;t see
immediate results and profits. You&apos;ll need to water each crop once a
day in order for them to grow in the shortest amount of time. A list
of crop costs/growth rates can be found in a later part of this FAQ.
You will also find this information in the town Library.

Animals -
A steady source of income will come from taking care of chickens,
cows, and sheep. You start off with a chicken coop, which can hold 4
chickens, and a barn, which can hold any combination of 8 cows and
sheep. These places can be upgraded by Gotz, the woodcutter. Check
out a later section of this FAQ for more info.

================================================== ===================

Crop Guide
----------
First off, you&apos;ll need to clear your land of debris and till the soil
using your hoe, in order plant seeds. There are several formations
of crops out there. Here are the most common ones.

X - tilled soil * - untilled soil

XXX X*X X*X XXX
*** X*X XXX XXX
XXX XXX XXX XXX

Rows U-shape Fat U Full Square
6 slots 7 slots 8 slots 9 slots

The most profitable shape is the Full Square. However, with this
method, you will not be able to water the middle square once your
seeds start sprouting, until you upgrade your Watering Can to at
least Silver. If you get the Harvest Sprites to help, they can water
the middle square. This guide will list the costs and earnings
involved with the Full Square method, as well as the Fat U method.

As far as crops are concerned, there are two types: Renewable and
Non-Renewable. Non-Renewable crops require that you plant seeds
again once you harvest the crops. Renewable crops will continue to
produce crops as long as you water them.

It&apos;s also important to note that if you plant crops that are not
meant for that season (like planting Turnips during the Fall). The
seeds will disappear the next day. This is also true even if the
next day happens to be the appropriate season. In other words, you
can&apos;t plant Summer crops during Spring 30, and Fall crops during
Summer 30, because they WILL disappear.

(All results listed are for the Full Square method, unless they are
in brackets [], which uses the Fat U method.)

============
Spring Crops
============

Turnips
*******
Purchase Seeds: Supermarket
Renewable: No

Cost of Seeds: 120G
Growth Rate: 4 days
Maximum Harvests: 7 harvests
(Cutoff day for MH: Day 2)

Earnings for Crop: 60G
Earnings per Harvest: 60G x 9 crops = 540G
[60G x 8 crops = 480G]
Profit per Harvest: 540G - 120G = 420G
[480G - 120G = 360G]

Cost per Season: 120G x 7 harvests = 840G
Profit per Day: 420G / 4 days = 105G a day
[360G / 4 days = 90G a day]

Profit per Season: 420G x 7 harvests = 2940G a season
[360G x 7 harvests = 2520G a season]

All right, let me explain what&apos;s going on here. I&apos;ve listed where
you can buy the seeds and if they are renewable. Growth rates are
measured in days that have passed. For example, if you plant turnips
on Day 2, Spring, and water them each day, the plants will be ready
in 4 days (on Day 6, Spring). If you plant crops by the cutoff day
(including the cutoff day), you can maximize the number of times you
can plant and grow crops for that season.

Potatoes

[80G x 8 crops = 640G]
Profit per Harvest: 720G - 150G = 570G
[640G - 150G = 490G]

Cost per Season: 150G x 4 harvests = 600G
Profit per Day: 570G / 7 days = about 81G a day
[490G / 7 days = 70G a day]

Profit per Season: 570G x 4 harvests = 2280G a season
[490G x 4 harvests = 1960G a season]

Cucumbers
*********
Purchase Seeds: Supermarket
Renewable: Yes

Cost of Seeds: 200G
Growth Rate: 9 days
(5 days for re-growth)
Maximum Harvests: 5 harvests
(Cutoff day for MH: Day 1)

Earnings per Harvest: 60G x 9 crops = 540G
[60G x 8 crops = 480G]

Cost per Season: 200G
Profit per Season: 540G x 5 harvests - 200G = 2500G a season
[480G x 5 harvests - 200G = 2200G a season]

(Calculations are different for renewable crops. You only need to
buy the initial bag of seeds once.)

Cabbages
********
Purchase Seeds: Won at Zack&apos;s Place
Renewable: No

Cost of Seeds: 500G
Growth Rate: 14 days
Maximum Harvests: 2 harvests
(Cutoff day for MH: Day 2)

Earnings for Crop: 250G
Earnings per Harvest: 250G x 9 crops = 2250G
[250G x 8 crops = 2000G]
Profit per Harvest: 2250G - 500G = 1750G
[2000G - 500G = 1500G]

Cost per Season: 500G x 2 harvests = 1000G
Profit per Day: 1750G / 14 days = 125G a day
[1500G / 14 days = about 107G a day]

Profit per Season: 1750G x 2 harvests = 3500G a season
[1500G x 2 harvests = 3000G a season]

Strawberries
************
Purchase Seeds: Supermarket (Available once you&apos;ve shipped 100
Turnips, 100 Potatoes, and 100 Cucumbers.)
Renewable: Yes

Cost of Seeds: 150G
Growth Rate: 8 days
(2 days for re-growth)
Maximum Harvests: 11 harvests
(Cutoff day for MH: Day 2)

Earnings for Crop: 30G
Earnings per Harvest: 30G x 9 crops = 270G
[30G x 8 crops = 240G]

Cost per Season: 150G
Profit per Season: 270G x 11 harvests - 150G = 2820G a season
[240G x 11 harvests - 150G = 2490G a season]

Cucumbers 2500G [2200G]
Cabbages 3500G [3000G]
Strawberries 2820G [2490G]

As you can see, Cabbages are the most profitable for the Spring
season. However, they take two weeks before you can harvest them.
You might be better off growing some Turnips for some quick cash,
while growing some cabbages. Potatoes don&apos;t earn much money, but in
order to grow Strawberries, you will need to ship 100 of them in
addition to Turnips and Cucumbers.

============
Summer Crops
============

There are more renewable crops in the Summer than in spring. It&apos;s
important to note that the first day of Summer is the Beach festival.
You won&apos;t be able to buy any seeds from the Supermarket or from Won
that day. (You may want to buy some seeds on the last day of Summer
for next year&apos;s Summer harvest.)

Tomatoes

[800G x 6 harvests - 300G = 4800G a season]

Corn can also be used for making Chicken Feed. You get 30 bushels of
feed for each ear of corn that&apos;s placed inside the feed maker
(located next the chicken coop). You actually make money by making
your own feed rather than buying from the Poultry Farm. (You earn
100G for each corn sold, which can be used for buying 10 bushels of
feed. You make 20 more bushels for the same value.)

Pumpkins 3500G [3000G]

Once again, the crop that makes the most money also takes the longest
to grow. Pineapples are very profitable but you won&apos;t even harvest
one until the last days of Summer. Pumpkins have the same profits as
Cabbages. Onions don&apos;t earn much, similar to Potatoes. However,
remember that you need to ship 100 of them in addition to Tomatoes
and Corn to grow Pumpkins.

Animal Guide

Chickens
********
You&apos;ll want to begin taking care of chickens first. They are very
easy to take care of and inexpensive to get. Of course, you also
don&apos;t earn as much money with them as you would with sheep or cows.
You will only need one chicken to start. Once the chicken starts
laying eggs, you can place one egg into the incubator inside the
chicken coop. Three days later, a chick will hatch. After one full
week, your chick will become a full grown chicken.

In order to take care of chickens, you will only need to buy feed.
Chicken feed can be purchased from the Poultry Farm for 10G a bushel.
You can also make your own feed buy throwing Corn (grown in the
summer) into the bin next to the coop to make 30 bushels of feed.
You can also leave your chickens outside for them to feed on worms on
your field. You may want to fence them up (using stones or cut
lumber) to protect from wild dogs at night and to keep them in one
place.

Each egg is worth 50G. As you continue to take good care of
chickens, their heart meter will increase. This is done by feeding
them once a day, and by picking them up. The quality of their eggs
will also improve. You can also earn a little more money by throwing
a regular or good quality egg into the hot springs (from the upper
part of the springs) and selling the Spa-Boiled eggs for 80G.

You can also improve the quality of an egg by winning the Chicken
Sumo Festival. If your chicken wins, she can have the ability to lay
golden eggs. However, your chicken must have at least 8 hearts
before she will lay these eggs (replacing the large eggs she would
normally lay). If you leave your golden-laying chicken outside for
600 total hours, she will lay P-type eggs. On occasion, a P-laying
chicken will lay an X-type egg, which is very valuable.

Once you have upgraded your chicken coop, you can take care of 8
chickens instead of 4, as well as incubate 2 eggs instead of just 1.
You can also have Saibara make the Mayonnaise Maker for 20,000G and a
piece of Adamantite. This can turn your eggs into mayonnaise. You
can also make mayonnaise in your kitchen (if you have one) using an
egg, oil, a whisk, and vinegar from your seasoning set.

You can also sell adult chickens for 500G or for 2000G if they are
the winner of the Chicken Sumo Contest.

Animals now have life spans in FoMT. A chicken will typically live
for only 3 years before passing away. If one does pass away, you
will see a sequence at the Church cemetery with Pastor Carter and
either Rick, Barley, or both.

Cows
****
Unlike chickens, cows require a lot more attention, some more care,
but produce an even better daily income. You can buy cows at Yodel
Ranch for 5000G. Once you buy a cow, you will have to one week
before she is old enough to start milking.

Before you buy cows, you will need to have some fodder to feed her.
Fodder can either be purchased for 20G a bushel at Yodel Ranch, or
can be grown by planting grass in your field and using the Sickle to
cut mature grass.). Grass can be purchased at the Supermarket for
500G and can only be planted (and only grows) during Spring, Summer,
or Fall. Grass does not need to be watered at all and will re-grow
every 9 days once you cut the grass.

You can also leave your cow outside. However, you will need to have
mature grass outside for her to feed on. You may also want to fence
her up, to protect her from wild dogs.

Just like the Chicken Coop, you can have Gotz upgrade your Animal
Barn. You&apos;ll normally only be able to hold any combination of 8 cows
and sheep, with one extra stall only for a pregnant cow/sheep.
Upgrading the barn will make room for 16 stalls, with 2 extra stalls
only for pregnant animals.

Cows produce up to 6 types of Milk, similar to the way chickens can
produce 6 types of Eggs. Use the Milker (purchased at the
Blacksmith) to get milk from the cow. As stated before, a cow that
was purchased from Yodel Farm will take one week before the cow
becomes an adult Cow. You can raise the affection of your cow by
talking to her, feeding her, and using the brush (purchased at the
Blacksmith) every day. Once a cow has 4 hearts, she will produce
Medium Milk, then she&apos;ll produce Large Milk once she&apos;s at 8 hearts.

There is also a Cow Festival in Summer. Unlike the Chicken Sumo, you
don&apos;t win by skill but rather by the amount of affection your cow has
toward you. If you win, your Cow can produce Gold Milk. If she has
stayed outside for a total of 600 hours, she will produce P Milk with
a chance of also producing X Milk. You can also have a Cheese Maker
built by Saibara for 20,000G and Adamantine ore, but you&apos;ll need to
upgrade your Animal Barn first before you&apos;re allowed to have this.

In addition to buying cows, you can also impregnate a healthy adult
cow with the Cow Miracle Potion. Your cow will be pregnant for 20
days after using the potion on her. You will not be able to milk her
during this time. Once she gives birth, the newborn calf will take 2
weeks before becoming a mid-sized cow, and 1 more week before
becoming an adult cow. Newborn calves are born with at least 1 heart
in their affection meter.

Cows have a typical life span of 5 years.

Sheep
*****
Sheep are also purchased from Yodel Ranch, but for 4000G, and also
eat fodder or fresh mature Grass.

Sheep can be used for shearing their wool. Use the Clippers
(purchased from the Blacksmith) to shear their wool. Sheep will be
adults when purchased from Yodel Ranch, so you can shear them
immediately. However, wool is grown back every 7 days.

The same conditions apply for making the quality of the wool better
as with Cows. Sheep also have a separate Sheep Festival that happens
during the Fall season. In order you enter, your Sheep needs to have
her wool intact the day before the festival.

Sheep can also be impregnated, but using the Sheep Miracle Potion.
Again, your sheep will need to have all her wool in order for her to
become pregnant. The sheep will be pregnant for 20 days after the
potion is used. A pregnant sheep cannot have her wool shorn off. A
newborn lamb will also start off with at least 1 heart and will take
2 weeks before she is old enough before you can shear her wool.

A Yarn Maker can be made from Saibara for 20,000G and Adamantine ore.
This will greatly increase the value of your wool, but you&apos;ll only be
able to have the Yarn Maker made once you have upgraded the Animal
Barn.

Final Note
==========
Cows are the best money makers, when compared to sheep. You&apos;ll want
to buy at least one to two sheep, but use the rest of the barn space
for cows.

================================================== ===================

Guide Summary
-------------
As you can see, there are a lot of ways to make money in this game.
Here&apos;s a small list of what to do as you begin this game.

Spring - First Year
*******************
Spend your time foraging for items to sell, as well as growing 4 to 6
3x3 crops (one for Turnips, one for Cucumbers, one for Cabbages, and
the last one to three is up to you). Buy a chicken as soon as you
can. (Don&apos;t forget to buy chicken feed too, although you may be
better off leaving it outside in a fenced area.) Plant at least 1 to
4 3x3 plots of grass to prepare for buying sheep and cows. If
possible, buy a cow (and possibly a sheep) by the end of the season.

It would be wise to start being friendly to Carter, Ellen, and Gotz.
Carter loves any size Fish as well as Curry Powder (sold for 50G at
the Supermarket). Ellen loves Mushrooms, Spa-Boiled Eggs, and also
enjoys flowers. Gotz loves Honey and cut Lumber from your Wood Bin.
Keeping them happy will reap good rewards and fewer headaches later.

Get a hold of Power Berries ASAP. They help permanently increase
your stamina. You can get one on your farm by tilling the soil on
your farm. The location is random. You also get one by throwing
offerings to the Harvest Goddess in the pond. The cheapest things to
offer are flowers that you can find in the forest. A third Power
Berry is purchased as a prize in the Horse Race Festival. There is
also a blue Power Berry which helps with fatigue issues. You get
that by throwing 1 cucumber each day, for 10 days, in the lake by
Mother&apos;s Hill.

Summer - First Year
*******************
Hopefully, you have upgraded your Watering can to at least Silver
(although Gold and Mystrile is preferred). You should now be able to
manage more 3x3 crops this time. Make sure to grow some Corn for
making feed for your chickens and Pineapples to make a lot of cash.

If you didn&apos;t by a cow/sheep by now, do it soon, and buy one or two
more by the end of the season.. There are also more things to gather
outside your farm that&apos;s worth selling. You may also want to try to
get your fourth Power Berry located on the 100th floor of the mine
next to the Goddess Pond.

Start making friends with the Harvest Sprites (if you haven&apos;t
already). Give them flour, purchased from the Supermarket, to really
make their affection rate increase. Have them help out watering and
harvesting crops to prepare them for the busy Fall season. Don&apos;t
forget to give them more gifts to keep their affection up.

Plot a few more areas for grass.

Fall - First Year
*****************
Focus on planting Sweet Potatoes. Have at least 12 3x3 crops
available for all your Fall crops (mostly with Sweet Potatoes
planted). Time your help with the Harvest Sprites. Have a couple of
them water and the rest harvest. Remember that once their agreement
to help is up, they won&apos;t be available for help the next day.

You&apos;ll have even more things to collect and ship outside your farm.
You may want to also start fishing and playing Frisbee with your dog
at the beach.

Make sure that you cut enough grass before Winter arrives. If you
run short, you can always buy more at Yodel Ranch.

Winter - First Year
*******************
You won&apos;t be able to grow crops this season (and there is no
greenhouse or hothouse available in this game either). Spend your
time taking care of your animals, fishing, and mining in the Winter
Mine.

You can get up to three more Power Berries this season. One is
directly behind the Winter Mine. Another one is in the 19th floor of
that mine. The last one can be found at the beach using a Level 5
fishing rod in the sea.

Second Year and beyond
**********************
Keep being friendly to the Harvest Sprites to have them help on your
fields during the non-Winter seasons. Max out on the number of
animals you can have. (Don&apos;t forget upgrades to your Chicken Coop
and Animal Barn, as well as having the Makers built by Saibara.)

You can get the last three Power Berries by now. You can buy another
Power Berry, but this time, from the TV Shopping Show for 10,000G.
You&apos;ll only be able to buy this if you have upgraded your house
twice. The last two Power Berries are awarded for being winners of
the Frisbee contest during Beach Day and personally winning with your
horse in the Horse Races during the Spring or Fall.

There is also an event that occurs every five years (starting on the
fifty year). During the 10th day of Fall, head to Mother&apos;s Hill
after 6PM. You&apos;ll encounter a shooting star which will grant you one
of three wishes. One of those wishes allows you to earn twice the
normal amount of money for items sold the day after you see the star.
Use this opportunity to sell the most expensive items like Mythic
Stones, Pirate Treasure, Pink Diamonds, Alexandrite, Fish Fossils,
and other things.

The festival FAQ,
3- Festivals

This is too help you understand what I am talking about :

name of festival
date
place of the festival
type of festival -&gt;refer to 3.2
prize -&gt;refer to 3.2
screw ups -&gt;refer to 3.2
secrets un-related to festivals -&gt;refer to 3.3
de******ion of the festival
tips for the first year
tips for all other years
other things you should know (if any)

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

3.2 - Important things you have to know

Types of festivals : there are three types of festivals

- DAY : The festival starts at 10:00 AM and ends at 5:59 PM. You can enter
the festival at any time between the time limit. When the festival
is over you are automatically brought back home where it will be
6:00 PM. Zack, the shipper will NOT pick up your shipments that day
so you cannot make any money. But you can still ship things, he will
pick them up the next day and you will get your money. All houses
will be closed, except the sprites and (glitch?)Gotz&apos;s house (but
he won&apos;t take jobs). Nobody will wander around town and you cannot
enter the place the festival takes place until 10:00 AM.

- NIGHT : The festival starts at 6:00 PM and ends at 11:59 PM. You can enter
the festival at any time between the time limit. When the festival
is over, you will wake up and it will be the next day. Zack, the
shipper will NOT pick up your shipments that day so you cannot make
any money. But you can still ship things, he will pick them up the
next day and you will get your money. All houses will be closed,
except the sprites and (glitch?)Gotz&apos;s house (but he won&apos;t take
jobs). Nobody will wander around town and you usually cannot enter
the place the festival takes place until 6:00 PM.

- YEAR EVENT : It is less a festival then an yearly event. You either activate
the event by doing something in particular or the event will
start by itself, or you can just skip it entirely. The event
is noted on your calendar. The time limit is different in
each one. Zack WILL ship your stuff and all shops are open as
usual. People will wander the streets so it is your basic day.

- VARIABLE : If one festival has this noted next to the type, it is because
it is either different, or might change because of some reason.
Refer to the OTHER section at the end of the festival&apos;s
de******ion.

_ _ _ _

Prizes

- YES : This mean that if the festival is a competition and you win, you will
get something. If&quot;only once&quot;is written next to it, it means
you can only get a prize the first time you win the festivals, all
next contests will yeald no prize. Also noted if you just receive
something after.

- NO : The festival was not a competition, or the competition doesn&apos;t give
you anything, no matter how many times you win. Sorry...

_ _ _ _

Screw ups

- YES : This only applies to a competition type festival, and one where the
player&apos;s skill (usually pressing A) determines the result of the
contest. If there is a yes, if you saved before the festival, you
can reset and try again.

- NO : All other contests where your skills do not matter. Or simply festivals
that are not contests. NOTE : cow/sheep contests are not screw ups
because it is not skill, the contest is based on the heart level. Plus
unless you saved before Barley picked up your animal for the contest,
resetting will not do anything.

3.3 - Secrets to use during festivals

These are some tips that you can use to make money or to make your life easier
during festivals. Make sure that you take advantage of them !&quot;^_^&quot;

1- The horse race money making scheme. (HRM)

Bring your EMPTY basket to the horse race. You can go exchange your medals
prizes if you talk to the mayor. Yes, he sells some pretty nice stuff for
the ladies, but ignore them if you want the big cash. What you need to do
is to fill the basket with broaches. You see, he sells broaches for 18 medals
which equals 900 G each. If you want to make a broach, it cost 1 000 G plus
an ore. So you save 100 G. Plus, one broach sells for 2 000 G. So a basket
full of them will net you 60 000 G with a profit of 33 000 G. All the other
merchandises are not worth it when it comes to profit.

2- The endless fishing trip. (EFT)

Bring your EMPTY basket and your fishing rod. Since you do not waste time
or energy every time you are in a festival or an event (I.E. when the bar
at the bottom of the screen where the date and time is is missing) you can
take advantage of this situation and fish endlessly. Up until you have higher
then level 6 fishing rod, you will not make as mush money then in the horse
races. A basket full of big fishes is 6 000 G. A basket full of pirate
treasures is 300 000 G. A basket full of ancient fossils is 150 000 G. Its
a good way to make big money.... but it will test your patience. WARNING :
if you are going after pirate treasures or ancient fossils, please note that
if you have a cursed or blessed rod, you will mostly catch junk. If you throw
away the junk, your reputation (I.E how the town likes you) will greatly drop.
So be careful, once after doing this, my wife and kid&apos;s heart level dropped
from 10 to 7 in one day. This can be fixed by having Carter forgive you in
confession for littering and then, on later days, getting forgiven on
&quot;townspeople don&apos;t like me&quot;confession.

3- The easy uncursing. (EU)

Two of the six cursed tools can be uncursed if they are used 255 times.
During a festival or event, time and energy is not spend, meaning that you
can uncurse the axe and the fishing rod during a festival easily and you
won&apos;t turn blue. PLEASE NOTE : if you try to raise the level of your tools
during an event or a festival, it won&apos;t work. The % of a tool will not rise
when used in those circumstances.

4- The platinum products abuse. (PPA)

Winning the chicken, cow, or sheep contest enables the winning animal to
have golden products (platinum after they spend more then 600 hours outside).
The platinum products mixed with a&quot;maker&quot;will net the highest value for
animal products, excluding the random X grade product. But, you know that
after some time your animals will pass away. The trick is to always enter
in those contests your youngest animal. This way, they will last longer and
more money for you. Also, natural death is random when they reach a certain
age, so if an animal dies and you saved before going to bed, reset, and your
animal will not be dead. That way, you can keep them longer. And if they
start dying a bit too often, even with the load/reload, go sell them. Platinum
animals sell for more then their original buying cost. Not bad.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

3.4 - Before going to a festival

Before going to a festival, there are some things you should know, and things
you should do.

Every festival that is not a yearly event prevents Zack from picking up your
shipments. But, fear not, you can still ship things and still get your money,
Zack will just pick them up the next day and give you your money. So if you
have a field full of sweet potatoes, your sprites can pick them all up and you
will get your money.
(thanks to Marasmus for correcting me)

Please note that every time I mention that your wife will do something, I mean
any wife except for the Goddess. The Goddess will never be present for
festivals. The only thing she will do in a festival is give you a cake during
the Winter Thanksgiving festival.

Also, for every festival, except the cooking festival, you can enter at any time
as long as it is in the allowed time period. This means that you can go pick up
food in the woods until 3:00 PM and still make it in time to win the horse race.
As I said, the only exception is the cooking festival. Since it is in two parts,
you need to attend the 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM part and then make it back before
5:59 PM.

And please note that time seems to stop when it is a festival day. Some things
that are supposed to happen that day will not happen.

- you cannot get married on a festival day, if you propose to your future
wife one week before a festival, the wedding will occur the day after the
festival
- you cannot get married on a day preceding a festival (not sure if it only
applies for festivals where you need to register one day before or all
festivals)
- animals who are supposed to be born will not be born until the next day
- animals cannot die on festival days (well not in my case, not 100 % sure)
- your wife will not give birth, even if she was supposed to (not sure)
- your child will not grow up (your child gets hurt and you need to bring
him to the clinic) (not sure)
- no typhoon or storm will happen (not sure)

Note that you can miss a festival completely if :

- one of your rivals gets married and invites you
- your wife gives birth (not sure, see above too)
- your child grows up (not sure, see above too)

-de******ion : After talking to the mayor, you will be asked if you want to
start the festival. Say yes and you will eat some rice cakes.
The festival will end, and you will get some rice cakes to
take home.
-first year : Sorry, you can&apos;t go because you start the game on Spring 2

rice cakes. Great for gifts.

_ _ _ _

-Spring Thanksgiving
-date : Spring 14
-place : n/a
-type : year event
-prize : no
-screw up : no
-secrets : none
-de******ion : You need to bake ******s for the girls. Usually you only
need to give some to the girls who gave you gifts at
the Winter Thanksgiving, but you can give some to all.
It raises their heart level.
-first year : Sorry, unless you cheat, it is impossible to make ******s at
this point.
-next years : Just make sure she gets the ******s. But try to figure out
her schedule so you don&apos;t spend hours looking for the girl.
Karen is hard to find sometimes.
-other : All the girls will loves the ******s (minus the Goddess). This
is the only time Karen will love sweets. Here are the recipes for
******s.

STEP 1 : BUTTER - milk(any) / mixer
STEP 2a : ******S - flour + egg(any) + butter / rolling pin +
oven + sugar (extras : honey)
STEP 2b : CHOCOLATE ******S - flour + egg(any) + butter +

-prize : yes, only once : power berry
(note if you win the Spring one, you cannot get another
power berry in Fall, and vice-versa)
-screw up : yes
-secrets : HRM / EU
-de******ion : Place bets on horses, win medals, buy some neat stuff...
Oh and once you have an adult horse, you can enter the
races. You will be in the third one.
-first year : Sorry, your horse will not be big yet. So all you can
do is bet. The trick is to bet on the one with the lowest
payout. That&apos;s the one who wins 90 % of the time.
-next years : Same as the first year, but this time you will race. To race,
all you need to do is to press A to give the horse a boost.
The horse will run at a set speed, and all you need to do is
tell him to go faster. But as you press A his stamina will
go down. His heart bubble will switch from green (high stamina)
to yellow (a bit tired) to red (no possible acceleration). If
you stop pressing A he will regain energy. Save before the first
time so you can try again to get the gist of it. The higher his
heart level towards you, the longer he can last.
-other : Once you know how to win, only bet on YOUR horse. Best way to get
easy medals. For item list, refer to section 5.

buy grape juice from the winery but you will not get a good score.

are pre-set. After the fifth year, you can always reset if you
don&apos;t like the category.

3.6 - Summer festivals

_ _ _ _

-Beach day (aka Dog race)
-date : Summer 1
-place : at the beach
-type : day
-prize : yes, only once : power berry
-screw up : yes
-secrets : EFT / EU
-de******ion : The day before, Zack will come register your adult dog, and
will bring it with him. Its a frisbee competition. You have
two throws to ace so that your dog can win the game.
-first year : Sorry, but your dog will not be big enough
-next years : Once he grows up in the first fall, go buy a frisbee from Won
and bring your dog to the beach everyday so he can practice
and raise his green bar. After winter is finish, you can go
back in the spring. Depending on how you practiced, it might
be difficult to win the second year.
-other : You need to ace the two shots. From personal experience : if you
miss one and get a very very long distance in the second one, you
won&apos;t win. But, according to someone on the net, my information
isn&apos;t true. You can still win even if you mess up the first or
second try. Needs confirmation. Oh and on a side note, you do not
need to have the frisbee in your inventory to participate and you
do not need to bring it.

_ _ _ _

-Chicken festival
-date : Summer 7
-place : at rose square
-type : day
-prize : yes, winner lays golden eggs if 8 hearts or more
(after 600+ hours outside : platinum)
-screw up : yes
-secrets : EU / PPA
-de******ion : The day before, Rick will come register a chicken and will
bring it with him. Your chicken will have to battle against
one chicken each round, for three rounds. You need to press
the A button to scare the other chicken out of the ring, while
preventing the chicken to do the same to you.
-first year : You can participate as long as you have a chicken. Do not press
A as soon as the game starts, wait for the other chicken to cluck
and he will advance on you (but he won&apos;t scare you). After he
advances start pressing A to scare him (he will have a&quot;!&quot;
balloon). Just keep pressing A and you should be fine. But if the
other chicken is gaining on you, stop pressing A and time
your A smashing so that you scare him and not vice versa. For
some reason, I find the first round always more difficult.
-next years : Same as before.
-other : WARNING : the chicken returns IN the coop, don&apos;t forget to feed it
or take it outside.

_ _ _ _

-Cow festival
-date : Summer 20

that is not pregnant. The next day, people will judge your
cow and after you talk to Barley again, the festival will
end. If you win, you will see a scene indicating it.
-first year : I do not think it is possible to have enough hearts to win,
but you can try your luck.
-next years : Choose the cow with the most hearts. Usually with 8-10 hearts,
that cow will win.
-other : The higher the hearts, the better the chances. WARNING : the cow

to feed it or to put it outside. You can also milk her now.

-next years : See above.
-other : Just for fun, there are two things that can happen. If you bring
any normal food, you will have a bubble where the word&quot;GOOD !&quot;will
appear and the townspeople will be pleased with the food. But if
you bring something like a poison mushroom or a red herb.... after
eating, the scene will flash and you will faint, and everybody will
have funny comments on the stew.

that is not pregnant and must still have her wool. The next day,
people will judge your sheep and after you talk to Barley again,
the festival will end. If you win, you will see a scene
indicating it.
-first year : If you bought the sheep early in spring you have a good chance of
having more or less eight hearts for the festival. Just keep it
outside, keep brushing and talking to it, and go to the
confessional at the church from 1:00 PM to 3:59 PM on Mondays,
Wednesday, and any rainy day. At the confessional, save your game,
enter the left door and choose one of the two confessions that
talk about cruelty towards animals. If Carter tells you that all
is forgiven, your animals will love you more (not always visible,
but once two cows and three chickens had one extra heart after the
confession). If he gives you a negative response, just reload and
try again.
-next years : Choose the sheep with the most hearts. Usually with 8-10 hearts,
that sheep will win.
-other : The sheep must have her wool. This means that you have to time yourself
so that her wool has grown back the day before the actual festival.

not activate. Do not forget to save a day before so that this

best things to accept are black grass, white grass, and the rice

anything but it might be hard to get. Unless you have a rice cake

As soon as you will go bed, you will see a small scene where your
wife will say something about not waking you up. Check your

4- Cooking festival

4.1- Categories

When you first enter the cooking festival between 10:00 AM and 11:59 PM (noon)
talk to the gourmet guy. He will tell you what the category for the year is.
After learning the category, exit the festival and you will be back home at
12:00 PM. Now you have until 5:59 PM to make your food and bring it back to
the festival. Take the food out and give it to the mayor.

There are five categories for the cooking festival. At first, all categories
are linked to a certain year. But after the fifth year, those categories become
random.

Below is a list of what is accepted and rejected in the competition. Please note
that if it is not written it probably means it is not accepted. The rejected
section is only there for confusing foods that are unclear as if they belong
in the category.

1st year : Juices

Accepted : All juices (both fruits and vegetables), all lattes, relaxation tea

Rejected : n/a at the moment

Unconfirmed : Hot milk, strawberry milk

Please note that wine, bodigizers, turbojolts and milk are not considered food
so you cannot even enter them in the contest.

-

4.2- The judging

As a basic rule, if you don&apos;t participate or if you get disqualify, the winner
will be chosen at random between Doug, Ann, Lilia, and Manna (Karen and her...
umm...black stuff will never win...).

But if you participate, you can get one of six judgement. The scene will
flash and he will either :

- the scene stays the same and he has an angry bubble and tells you that
you are disqualify because it is the wrong category

- the scene switches to a snowy mountain and he tells you that the food
is bad. You should keep your day job, your cooking is awful... almost
Karen-like.

- the scene stays the same and he tells you it is very homemade (see below)

- the scene switches to a rainy mountain and he tells you that it&apos;s good
but something is missing (see below)

- the scene switches to the mountains and he tells you that you are good.
You have a pretty good chance of winning.

- the scene switches to shooting stars. You have 100 % chances of winning.

PLEASE NOTE : When the scene stays the same and he tells you that it is
very homemade, I never win. But I do not know if it is impossible to win
or if you are put in the random choosing with the four others participants.
Ditto for the rainy mountain scene.

4.3- Tips for the cooking festival

1- The more food you can add in a recipe, the more chances you have to
win. For example, its almost impossible to win with jam bread, but
with a sandwich, its easier. But this also means that for some
categories, you can only easily win with one recipe.

2- You should start collecting food for the contest a year before. I mean
if you want to do a recipe that needs mushrooms, you will need to get
them in fall. Anticipate people !

3- DON&apos;T FORGET, you don&apos;t win anything in this contest. So don&apos;t worry
if you lose. (In the girl version, if you want to marry the Gourmet,
you need to have won all five categories. But then, the girl version
isn&apos;t out here yet... and who would want to marry the Gourmet? Uhh,
I&apos;m getting shivers just thinking sbout it)

5- Horse race prizes

5.1- List

Here is the list of all the things you can exchange at the horse races.

Please note that one medal costs 50 G and that you can only get them if
you bet on a horse and win. If you have a lot of money to spare, note
that you can bet on more then one horse. And one last trick is that if
you know how to win, save before entering the horse races. Do not bet
until it is your horse that is racing. Put 99 on your horse, and its
easy medals. Once got 5940 medals because my horse had a payout of 60.


-Jewel of truth - 1 000 medals (note, can only buy once)
- collect 9 and you will get a stone that shows your
strength and fatigue

-Power berry - 900 medals (note, can only buy once)
- raises your energy levels

-Dress - 250 medals (note, only after buying the jewel of truth)
- gift for the girls

-Perfume - 150 medals (note, only after buying the power berry)
- gift for the girls

-Facial pack - 42 medals
- gift for the girls

-Skin lotion - 35 medals

- sell for 50 G

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

5.2- Item analysis

Jewel of truth - 1000 medals = 50 000 G
MY THOUGHTS : Buy it after you have a cabinet so you can keep it in. It
should be bought but it is not a high priority.

Power berry - 900 medals = 45 000 G
MY THOUGHTS : Buy it ASAP. You can&apos;t say no to raising your energy level.

Dress - 250 medals = 12 500 G
MY THOUGHTS : If you want to give it to a girl. Real expensive though.

Perfume - 150 medals = 7 500 G
MY THOUGHTS : If you want to give it to a girl. Real expensive though.

Facial pack - 42 medals = 2 100 G
MY THOUGHTS : If you want to give it to a girl.

Skin lotion - 35 medals = 1 750 G
MY THOUGHTS : If you want to give it to a girl.

Sunblock - 30 medals = 1 500 G
MY THOUGHTS : If you want to give it to a girl.

Necklace - 20 medals = 1 000 G
MY THOUGHTS : Well, you can make 60 000 G if you ship a basket full of them
but you will also only make 30 000 G of profit. Its better to
stick with broaches to make big money.

Broach - 18 medals = 900 G
MY THOUGHTS : You can make 60 000 G if you ship a basket full of them. And this
will give you a profit of 33 000 G. Best moneymaker of the races.

Diamond - 14 medals = 700 G
MY THOUGHTS : A diamond sell for 100 G so if you buy it to sell it, you will
lose 600 G. Some girls really like diamonds, but there are a
lot of less expensive gifts for her. Bottom line, if you want
diamonds wait until winter and go in the winter mine floor 10.

Truffle - 10 medals = 500 G
MY THOUGHTS : Since a truffle sells for 500 G, you will make a profit of zero.
There is no need to go buy them here. If you need to ship
truffles, just become good friends with Carter and he will let
you in the backdoor so you can pick some in fall. You can also
find some near the lake in the forest. Just have a level 6
hammer or better and smash the big stone (or SONE if you prefer)
and continue down the path (only in fall).

Adamantite - 4 medals = 200 G
MY THOUGHTS : Well, adamantite only sells for 50 G. Not only that but its not
so hard to find. Spring mine, below level 10. Bottom line, buying
adamantite is a waste of money.

6- FAQ

_ _ _ _

Q : How do I get the relaxation tea leaves for the relaxation tea recipe to
win in the contest ?
A : 1- Win 10-14 times in a row in the Goddess New Year&apos;s TV game
2- Keep giving offerings to the Goddess until she asks you who
you like. Choose her (or already be married) and she will
give some to you.
3- Be good friends with the harvest sprites and they will invite
you to a tea party in Spring. They will give some to you after.
4- Recipe = blue grass + yellow grass + orange grass + purple grass +
red grass + indigo grass + green grass + weed / knife +
frying pan

Q : How do you play the frisbee with your dog ?
A : You don&apos;t play with the frisbee the same way as with the ball. To
play frisbee, you must have an adult dog and the frisbee. Have the
frisbee in your inventory and carry your dog to the beach in any
season except winter. If your dog is on the beach (in your arms or
on the floor), go read the sign where the frisbee rules are explained.
The game will ask you if you want to play frisbee. Say yes.

Q : HELP!!! I&apos;m stuck with the frisbee/ball/stuff from the girls!!!
A : First of all, calm down, you can get rid of them. You can put them
in your cabinet. To get the cabinet, upgrade your house at least
once and the cabinet will start to appear on the shopping channel
on Saturdays.

Q : Where can I find all the grasses ?
A : All grasses can be obtained at random from the Goddess game show if
you win 2 times

You start with 6 tools, the Axe,
Hammer, Hoe, Sickle, Watering Can and the Fishing Rod
At first you can&apos;t do much with them, you&apos;ll
notice you are overpowered by the big boulders and the wood stumps! Well, if
you enter the Farm Summary screen and hit left you will see 6 meters, one for
each tool, once you use that tool enough, you will be able to upgrade it, just
get the ore needed and talk to Saibara, for some time and money, he will get the job done.
you DO NOT have to upgrade a tool level per level, you can
skip from normal to Mystrile if you wish.
Once all your main tools hit Mystrile you will be able to obtain the Cursed
tools (More info below), altough more powerful, they suck a lot of energy, 3~5
uses is enough to get you down! However, you can permanently &apos;bless&apos; them so
they can use less energy, after this, you can finally turn them into Mythic,
the highest level. There are some other tools that won&apos;t level up however...

Lastly, in order to use an upgraded tool, just hold down B longer, your
character will move the tool, change pose, whatever, this is how you use
charged tools, so even if you have Mythic Tools, you can still use the normal
action.

Level 1 Tools: Nothing required.
Axe: Chops branches with 1 hit. It can&apos;t cut stumps yet though.
Fishing Rod: Can catch small fish only.
Hoe: Tills 1x1 square of land.
Hammer: Can smach small stones. But it can&apos;t smash the large stone and
boulders.
Sickle: Cuts 1x1 square of land.
Watering Can: Waters 1x1 square of land.

Level 2 Tools: Copper Ore + 1,000 G to upgrade.
Axe: Can now chop Stumps with 6 hits.
Fishing Rod: It can catch medium fish now as well.
Hoe: Tills 2x1 squares of land.
Hammer: It can now smash the large stones in 3 hits. The boulders are still
too much.
Sickle: Cuts 1x3 squares of land.
Watering Can: Waters 1x3 squares of land.

Level 3 Tools: Silver Ore + 2,000 G to upgrade.
Axe: Stumps can now be cut in 3 hits.
Fishing Rod: Nothing new, only small and medium fish yet.
Hoe: Tills 3x1 squares of land.
Hammer: It can smash large stones in 2 hits, the boulders fall at 6 hits. The
giant boulder near the lake is too much yet.
Sickle: Cuts 2x3 squares of land.
Watering Can: Waters 2x3 squares of land.

Level 4 Tools: Gold Ore + 3,000 G to upgrade.
Axe: Stumps fall in 2 hits now.
Fishing Rod: This rod can fish large fish now.
Hoe: Tills 4x1 squares of land.
Hammer: The large stones are powerless now, 1 hit is enough. The boulders need
3 hits, but the giant boulder is still too much.
Sickle: This can now cut 3x3 squares.
Watering Can: You can water a 3x3 patch of land with this.

Level 5 Tools: Mystrile + 5,000 G to upgrade.
Axe: Fear the axe! 1 hit is enough to take stumps down.
Fishing Rod: With this, you can catch a Power Berry in the Winter and a Recipe
in the Spring.
Hoe: 6x1 is the number to till now.
Hammer: Boulders fall in 2 hits. The giant one is still out of your reach
though.
Sickle: Now you can cut 5x5 pieces of land.
Watering Can: With this, you can water 3x5 squares of land.

Level 6, Cursed Tools: To get these tools you must have all 6 tools at Mystrile
level already, then go to the Winter Mine and dig around. The tools
are in specific levels, they are more powerful, but they will zap you
out of life... If you equip it, you have to go with Carter for a
blessing to get it off.
Axe: This one will obliterate all stumps on screen! Find on Floor 49.
Fishing Rod: This can catch King Fish, Pirate Treasures and Ancient Fish!
Find on Floor 29.
Hoe: Tills 12x3 squares of land! Find on Floor 39.
Hammer: This one can smash EVERYTHING in 1 hit! Find on Floor 59.
Sickle: This one can cut a space of 9x9! Find on Floor 79.
Watering Can: You can water an area of 6x13 with this one! Find on Floor 69.

Level 6, Blessed version Tools: Same as the Cursed tools, these ones however,
won&apos;t suck your energy mercilessly. To &apos;uncurse&apos; you must fulfill
some requirements...
Axe: Use the Cursed Tool 255 times!
Fishing Rod: Use the Cursed Tool 255 times!
Hoe: Ask Carter to bless the Cursed Tool 10 times, each blessing costs
1,000 G.
Hammer: Equip the Cursed Tool for 10 straight days.
Sickle: Equip the Cursed Tool for 10 straight days.
Watering Can: Ask Carter to bless the Cursed Tool 10 times, each blessing
costs 1,000 G.

Level 7 Mythic Tools: Once all the Tools are Blessed, you can find Mythic
Stones in Floor 60 of the Spring Mine. This, and 50,000 G will
persuade Saibara to work on the tool.
Axe: Neuters all stumps/branches in the area consuming even less energy!
Fishing Rod: Odd of getting Treasure/Fossils are higher!
Hoe: Tills an area of 18x5!
Hammer: Nukes all stones in the area!
Sickle: Cuts a 15x15 area!
Watering Can: Waters a 12x21 area! The limit of 100 uses was raised to 225
now!

And the extra Tools. These are gotten from Saibara.
Milker: As the name implies, you use this to milk a mature cow.
Brush: Get this ASAP when you get Livestock. Brush all your livestock (except
for Chickens).
Scissors: These are used to shear a sheep whose wool coat has grown back. 08-09-2008, 12:52 PM

Cursed Tools /---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|3.) Introduction to the Lake Mine |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Lake Mine is the mine where you will find the cursed tools. You can only
access the Lake Mine in the winter when the lake on Mother&apos;s Hill is frozen
over (not the spring near the hot tubby-thing, the actual lake). The Lake Mine
has more expensive gems that you will be able to find than the Spring Mine (the
one near the spring by the hot tubby-thing). Going into the Lake Mine for the
cursed tools is pretty much one of the only reasons why you will ever go into
this mine.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|4.) What They Do |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Here is a table of what the cursed tools do:

|Tool |What it Does |Floor Found On|
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|Cursed Hoe |Tills a twelve by three rectangle|39 |
| |of land. | |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|Cursed Hammer |Smash a boulder and a large |59 |
| |boulder in one hit, smashes | |
| |multiple boulders at once. | |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|Cursed Fishing Rod |Catch all fish |29 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|Cursed Axe |Cut all tree stumps on the screen|49 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|Cursed Sickle |Cut a nine by nine square of |79 |
| |grass. | |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|Cursed Watering Can |Water a six by thirteen rectangle|69 |
| |of land. | |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|

In addition to doing all of the above, once equipped the only way to unequip
them is to have either Carter bless them or to turn them into the blessed tools
(more on the blessed and mythic tools later).

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|5.) Elli Leaves |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Elli Leaves are something that are pretty much vital to getting all of the
cursed tools. What they do is restore your stamina and fatigue all the way up
to 100 percent which is vital for getting the cursed sickle.

The Elli Leaves are a very complicated food to make here is the recipe:
First you go to the hospital and buy four Bodgizers and four Turbojolts from
Elli.
Next you need to make them into Bodigizer XLs and TurboJolt XLs. You do
this by adding blue grass to the Bodigizer and using the Mixer on them and by
adding green grass to the Turbojolt and using the Mixer.
Now is the hard part. You need to go to your chicken coop or your barn and
grab six pieces of feed. On one you need to use the Knife. On the second you
need to use the Frying Pan. On the third you need to use the Pot. On the
fourth you need to use the Mixer. On the fifth you need to use the Whisk and
the Oven. On the sixth and final you need to use the Rolling Pin.
Now you need to use the six burnt foods that you just made along with the
Bodigizer XL and the Turbojolt XL using the Knife, Frying Pan, Oven, Pot,
Sugar, Salt, Vinegar, Soy Sauce, and Miso.
Congratulations, you now have one Elli Leave! Now repeat the process above
so that you have four of them total.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|6.) Easiest Way to Get Them |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

First thing is first, you need to take all of the Elli Leaves that you made
(you can bring more than four if you want, and it will be easier, but four is
more than enough as it is).

Our whole goal here is to go in and grab all of the cursed tools in one go.

Your whole process is made easier by the fact that you have Elli Leaves. With
out the Elli Leaves it would be incredibly hard for you to make it all of the
way to the Cursed Sickle (the last cursed tool in the mine).

While your process of digging all of the way down to the 79th floor is made
easier by the Elli Leaves, it can still be very hard...unless you use the
following method:

1.) MAKE SURE YOU ONLY HAVE YOUR MYSTRILE HOE AND YOUR MYSTRILE HAMMER WITH
YOU UPON ENTERING THE MINE (nothing bad will happen if you have other tools, it
is just not advised).
2.) Save your data on File 1 soon as you enter the LAKE Mine (the only time
that you can access it is in the winter). Make sure you save it before you
have used any of your tools that day, it will help a lot.

3.) Smash rocks and dig around until you find the stairway down to the next
level of the mine.
4.) Take note of exactly where the stairway is.
5.) Load your data from File 1.
6.) Go to where the stairway was and dig there.
7.) Before going down the stairs save your data on File 2 (this is so that
if the next level is a dead end or you just dont like the way the next level
looks you can get a different level next).
8.) Save your data on File 1 before you do anything on that level.
9.) Repeat all of the steps until you have all of the cursed tools.

TIPS FOR GETTING THEM:
***When you are on a floor with a cursed tool in it simply save to File 1 as is
normal and then eat an Elli Leave. Go around smashing all of the rocks and
digging everywhere until you have found both the stairway and the cursed tool
(you may eat as many Elli Leaves as necessary to do this, just dont save
afterwards). If the floor lacks either the cursed tool or a path down then
load File 2, go down and repeat the process.
***Until you have gotten a cursed tool you can hold L and press B to switch
between tools (make sure you dont do this when you have a cursed tool because
once equipped you cannot remove them).
***More Elli Leaves, the better, one is the absolute minimum.
***The stairways are never next to the walls, this will make your search easier
in larger levels of the mine.
***If you go to a floor and dig up the entire floor and don&apos;t find the cursed
tool, simply load the save from the floor before and go back down and try, try
again. This should work, if it doesn&apos;t then you will have to resort to trying
again on another day.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|7.) Upgrading Them Further |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Now you might be saying what is the purpose of a cursed tool if you have to go
to carter to remove them? Well the whole purpose is that you can upgrade them
twice more into the best tools in the game. The blessed tools and the mythic
tools.

First we will go over the blessed tools.

There are three different things that you have to do to bless your cursed tool.
Each tool will only respond to one type, so here is a handy dandy table to tell
you all that you need to do to bless the tool.

|Tool |What to do to Bless |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Cursed Watering Can |Have Carter Bless it ten times for 1,000g each |
| |time. |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Cursed Axe |Use it 255 times. |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Cursed Hammer |Have it equipped for ten days straight. |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Cursed Hoe |Have Carter Bless it ten times for 1,000g each |
| |time. |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Cursed Fishing Pole |Use it 255 times. |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Cursed Sickle |Have it equipped for ten days straight. |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|

Explanation of Methods:

HAVE CARTER BLESS IT TEN TIMES FOR 1,000G EACH TIME: Simply go to the church on
a rainy day during the times that Carter is in his confession booth. Simply
reequip it every time he removes it until it turns into one of the blessed
tools.

USE IT 255 TIMES: Simply take the tools to a festival (you dont drain stamina
during the festivals) and use the tool until it turns into a blessed tool (you
dont need to use it on full strength, just tap the B button a lot).

HAVE IT EQUIPPED FOR TEN DAYS STRAIGHT: Simplest and easiest method, do this
during the winter because you probably arent going to need to use other tools
that much during that time.

On to the Mythic Tools.

The mythic tools are the best tools in the game. Pretty much you are going to
want to have at least the watering can if you are going to become a big time
farmer.

The way to upgrade them is all the same. You need to dig all the way down to
the 60th level of the SPRING MINE (NOT lake) and bash rocks down there until
you have six mythic stones (one for each tool) (the mythic stones will not
appear until all of the cursed tools have become blessed tools). You can then
take a mythic stone and the tool you want to upgrade to Saibara, pay him 50,000
gold and then come back in two days to pick up your brand new shiny mythic tool.

You can use them same method to get the mythic stones as you did to get the
cursed tools but it will be a lot easier if you have eight Elli Leaves this
time because you are going to be bashing a whole lot of rocks on the 60th floor
to find them.

The mythic stones are incredibly rare but there is one simple thing that you
can do to allow you to bring back with you the maximum you can get on floor 60.
Simply bring eight Elli Leaves and then while you are searching for the stones
(they are in the rocks not the ground) simply keep using Elli Leaves, and when
you have run out of them and are blue or have searched the whole floor you can
head back to the surface with plenty of them stockpiled.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|8.) Frequently Asked Questions |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Q: Are all the cursed tools found on the same level?
A: No, they are found on levels 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79.

Q: Are the tools in the ground or in rocks?
A: They are found in the ground.

Q: On what level should I start looking for the cursed tools?
A: If you want them all then start on the 29th level, otherwise just go for the
ones that you want.

Q: Its impossible!
A: No its not.

Q: I have all the mystrile tools but I cant find the cursed ones, are there
any other requirements for finding the cursed tools?
A: You only need all six mystrile tools and to be in the Lake Mine.

Q: Im playing it on an emulator. Could this be why I cant find them?
A: It could be, or it could be that you are looking in the wrong mine or dont
have all of the mystrile tools.

Q: The stairs arent there! Am I doing it all wrong.
A: Sometimes the stairs arent there, just simply load FILE 2 go down the
stairs save on FILE 1 and look for the stairs again.

Q: I keep turning blue around the sixth floor of the lake mine, but I dont
have a kitchen. What do I do?
A: Just using my strategy you will be able to get to at least the 39th floor
without turning blue. If you want to go past the 39th floor then you need to
get a kitchen and make Elli Leaves.

Q: Im on the 29th floor but the cursed tool isnt there and I have all of my
tools upgraded.
A: The tools are extremely hard to find. Just dig around on the whole floor
[you may have to load FILE 1 several times to do this (make sure you dont dig
on the same place twice as that would be a waste of your time)]. If they
arent there then load FILE 2 and repeat the process until you find it.

Q: Can it be any kind of burnt food to make Elli Leaves?
A: You need to use the six kinds of burnt food that are made if you follow the
Elli Leaves section.

Q: Do I need to have all of my tools upgraded to mystrile before I can find the
cursed tools?
A: Yes you need to have all six tools upgraded to mystrile before you can find
any of the cursed tools.

Q: I have found all of the tools up until the hammer and now I cant find the
hammer, what is wrong?
A: As you get farther down in the mine the tools are harder to find, just keep
reloading the floor until you have one that has the tool in it.

Q: I cant use both of my save files because my brother is using the other one,
what should I do?
A: Just bring eight Elli Leaves with you and just go on without the save/reload
trick and hope that you are lucky and can get all of the way to the sickle, it
may just require a few trips though.

Q: I have heard that you can access the winter mine in other seasons, is this
true?
A: Yes you can get to the winter mine in any season if you have the incredibly
hard to get (just because you need insane patience) Teleport stone. For info
on how to get it please read my Easy Farming Guide for this game.

Q: How come no matter how many times I get Carter to bless my tools it doesnt
become blessed.
A: First you need to make sure that it is a cursed tool you are getting blessed
second it needs to be either the hoe or the watering can. Lastly it needs to
be done ten times.

Q: Can I get the cursed fishing rod even though I brought the mystrile fishing
rod into the mine?
A: Yes. You can still get the cursed fishing rod.

Q: You can get further than level 39 in the mine without using an Elli Leaves!
A: Yes, I know that you can however if you are in your first year then that is
in my opinion as far down as you can get.

Q: Im using an emulator and the cursed tools dont show up.
A: The fact that you are using an emulator could be the problem.

Q: I have all of my tools blessed but I cant find the mythic stones.
A: First of all make sure you are in the spring mine and secondly the mythic
stones are extremely rare so you will have to break every rock in the mine to
find two or three of them.

Q: Nintendo Power said that you can get the cursed hammer on floor fifty, is
this true???
A: As far as I am aware you can only find the cursed hammer on floor 59, and
them saying fifty could have just been a typo.

Q: Do I need to have all of my mystrile tools with me when I am looking for the
cursed tools?
A: You only need the hammer and the hoe in the mine. If you take any other
tool with you then you cannot get all of the cursed tools in one go.

Q: I cant find the cursed fishing rod!
A: Make sure you are digging in the ground and not hitting the rocks. lolo_240 08-12-2008, 06:45 AM =====================================2. Table Of Contents:

Tutorial: A few tutorials of how to play (but, you have me for that :D)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so you want to start your game already. Seems to me like that stuff
would be useless without a file. Anyway, to jump in, go to START on the title
screen (the only option you have if this is your first game). The first screen
is to put in your name. Put whatever you like. The next screen asks for your
birthday. Put your birthday, already. Next is the Farm Name. Come up with
something. If you can&apos;t, just email me. I&apos;ll help you out. After that you
get to name your dog. Cool, free dog. I named mine Bark. But I&apos;m sure that
you can do better than that. Game asks if all of that is cool. Say it is,
since you had plenty of time to correct mistakes (I mean, really, why do they
ask that question?) You then get this really long cut scene, explaining why
you&apos;re there. After the little movie, you get to play Harvest Moon.
================================================== =============================
6. Basic Farming/Ranching/Mining/Walkthrough of first days
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great. You can play. What should you do, though? First, let&apos;s get that
farm all cleaned up. From where you start, go up to the TV. I assume that you
know what the TV is. I can&apos;t help you if you don&apos;t. Okay, I&apos;ll help. It&apos;s
the big screen in the middle of the top wall. There, happy? :P
Press A on it. Wow, TV shows! You can see the next day&apos;s weather report by
pressing up, see upcoming events by pressing right, see some more tutorials by
pressing down, or, for a while at least, play the Harvest Goddess game by
pressing left. Play it. Good luck. You lost, didn&apos;t you? The best I can do
is five. That was only once. Okay, enough of that.
Go to that big treasure chest thing in the bottom right corner. Press A while
facing it. Pull out the Axe, the Hammer, and the Sickle. Be prepared to spend
a couple of days doing this. Go outside, and just below you is your farming
space. It&apos;s where you plant crops.
Oh, wait, damn those townsfolk. Thomas and Zack come and show you the basics
again. Listen to Zach, he tells you to put your crops in the bin. Whoo hoo.
You may see your poor little dog roaming around.
At the beginning of every day, you should whistle to your dog (UP+L) and pick
him up with A. EVERY DAY. He&apos;ll get to loving you soon enough.
Now, make some cash. Go to the tree south of your house, it has a beehive.
Press A while facing it, and you&apos;ll have honey. Go to the bin, and throw it in
with A. Good source of a tiny bit of easy money.
Okay, now, to the clearing of your farm space. See that big brown area with a
lot of weeds, branches, tree stumps, and rocks? Start clearing it out. Today.
First, get rid of the little sticks. To do this, equip your axe through the
Rucksack screen (go to the screen, select the Axe, and move it to the square on
top if it isn&apos;t already there). Start chopping all the little branches away
(the brown ones, not the green leaves). Don&apos;t even try chopping the stumps up.
You need a higher level axe (later on that). Then, equip your Hammer in the
same way you equipped your axe, and get rid of all the little grey rocks. Once
again, don&apos;t even try to get the big rocks. Hammer&apos;s too weak. Oh, a little
tip. If you go to the Farm Map, you can see each and every little thing in the
field. That helps right now. If you go blue in the face and fall down, don&apos;t
press B again. Either go back into your house (press A on the door, FYI) and
sleep (press A facing the side of your bed, or go south and search the area for
a blue plant. Find it, and pick it up with A. Then, eat it, by pressing L+B.
Make sure you ate it. If not, press L+A, and try again. Once you&apos;ve eaten a
few of the little devils, go back to clearing the place out. Don&apos;t stray too
far, you may get lost. After you&apos;ve gotten all the small rocks, you can start
clearing out the weeds. There&apos;s two ways to do this. The fastest way is by
using your Sickle. That gets you tired, though. The other way is to press A to
pick it up, and press A to throw it. This takes a while, though, but it
doesn&apos;t get you tired. If you did this in one day, good job. If not, don&apos;t
sweat it. Just spend another day.
There, doesn&apos;t that just look so much better? It doesn&apos;t? You don&apos;t like
those big rocks and ugly tree stumps? Well, we&apos;re going to have to do
something about it, aren&apos;t we? Hey, wait, did I say that this was a complete
walkthrough? I did?! Well, okay, then. I won&apos;t be so detailed anymore,
though. You need to get some money to upgrade those Tools. There&apos;s quite a
few ways to do this at this point in the game, although it&apos;s still tough. The
fastest way is to go mining. What? You don&apos;t know how to mine?! Okay, let
ol&apos; JJ teach you, then. Go south out of your farm. Then, along the left wall,
there should be a little diagonal path. Take it. There&apos;s the spa, two stumps,
and a hole in the wall. You brought that hammer, right? Okay. Go in the
hole. What, there&apos;s a bunch of rocks? Well, smash them! Oh, you found an
ore! Great! Here&apos;s the trick. If it is a little grey thing with three parts,
throw it. If it&apos;s Copper or Silver, put it in your Rucksack. After two, the
sack is full, but you can still carry some. Take them all to your shipping
bin. Okay, do this a whole bunch of times, eating blue herbs or using the spa
to restore your energy.
After a couple of days, you should have some money, but, what are you going to
do with it? Hey, that kid&apos;s back on your farm again, trying to figure out if
there&apos;s really someone living there! I guess it&apos;s time to meet the townsfolk.
Go to town (go north). Talk to everyone you see. Also, pick out the girl that
seems cutest to you, and stalk her, er, find out where she is at what time.
You&apos;ll start giving that girl gifts as soon as you can. I&apos;ve been trying to
get Ann, the bar girl. I&apos;ve found that she doesn&apos;t like herbs much, and she
absolutely HATES minerals (she dismissed a chunk of silver as big as her!).
I&apos;ve also found that she LOVES boiled eggs. You don&apos;t have eggs?! Um, let&apos;s
take care of that later. You should have at least 3000 by now, and it should
NOT be Sunday or Wednesday. Then, you can go to the Supermarket (it&apos;s the
building with the bags sitting on a table in the middle of the store. I told
you to go EVERYWHERE for a reason, you know :D).
Okay, go the the table with the bags, and talk to it. You heard me. Select
CUCUMBERS, and buy, oh, about three bags. Also, buy a bag of grass. No, not
a SACK of grass, a bag. If you had a lot of money, like, if you have 3k left,
buy yourself a bigger rucksack. It&apos;s on the right side of the store. It will
help a lot, especially during your long days of mining. If you have EVEN MORE
money left, say, five thousand, you probably waited too long to buy stuff, or
you&apos;re cheating. But, if you have it, buy the harvest basket. Don&apos;t worry,
you don&apos;t have it permanently, just press A to drop it where you want it.
With the harvest basket, you can put your crops and minerals in the basket
instead of the rucksack. It can hold thirty items. Back to your farm! Go and
grab the Hoe, and the seed bags. If you bought a bigger rucksack, then you can
also grab the watering can.
Okay, now, this is a little trick I&apos;ve figured out. When tilling soil, don&apos;t
till in three by three groups. You&apos;ll end up with a little plant in the middle
that doesn&apos;t get watered, and it takes longer to water them and pick the crops.
You&apos;ll want to make a patter something like this:
X X
X X
X X
Or like this:
XXX

XXX
Those are the best ways with the non-upgraded water can. Okay, stand in the
center of your lines:
X X
XoX
X X
and &apos;use&apos; your CUCUMBER seeds. You throw them up in the air (?!) and they
all miraculously fall down in the right place. Now, for the bag of grass,
make a 3X3 patch of tilled soil, like this:
XXX
XXX
XXX
Then stand in the center and throw your seeds into the air. You don&apos;t have
to water grass. Now, go grab your Watering Can if you haven&apos;t already, and
water all of your cucumber seeds. Now, it&apos;s just a waiting game. Let them
grow, and sell the profits. That should be enough to get you started. I&apos;ll
explain more detailed stuff in its own section, such as upgrading your tools,
fishing, and a more in depth explanation on mining. Remember, the stuff said
above was just to get you into the game with a good start.
================================================== =============================
7. Town:
================================================== =============================
PROBABLY NEVER COMING!
================================================== =============================
8. Tools/Upgrading the Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, time to explain a little better about the tools, and how to upgrade
them.
************************************************** *****************************
Axe:
The Axe is a tool that you need, but you won&apos;t need to upgrade a lot.
It is used for chopping wood, and ONLY chopping wood. The little sticks that
you see laying around are the only things that you can chop up in the
beginning of the game. After chopping quite a few little sticks up (about to
the point where you have eighty peices of wood) you can upgrade your Axe.
Upgrading the Axe to the &apos;copper&apos; stage lets you cut down stumps by charging
up the tool (hold down B) and hitting the stump six times. This gives you
six peices of wood. At the &apos;silver&apos; level, you get to take one out in three
hits. &apos;Gold&apos; Axes need only hit the stump two times. With the &apos;mystril&apos; Axe,
the bloody little stumps go down in one chop.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Fishing Rod:
The only Tool you don&apos;t start out with. The Fishing Rod can be acquired at
Won&apos;s shop. Just keep going there until you get a cutscene with
Karen. Soon after, go in the store again, and Zack will give you the Fishing
Rod. On the &apos;copper&apos; level, it can catch only small fish and trash. It took
me a while to figure out how to catch the little bluggers. When you cast out,
wait. An ! will appear over your head; when that happens, press and HOLD the
B button. You&apos;ll pull in whatever bit if you timed it right (how do boots
bite?) I don&apos;t have any more info on the Fishing Rod at this time. Coming
Soon.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hammer:
The Hammer is one of the tools that you&apos;ll use a LOT, especially if you follow
my guide on how to start off the game. Mining requires ONE tool, the Hammer.
It can also use another tool, but it isn&apos;t necessary. The Hammer also smashes
rocks in the farm to get them out of the way. In the beginning, you can only
smash small rocks. The &apos;copper&apos; level smashes larger, round rocks to dust with
three hits. The &apos;silver&apos; level destroys the round rocks in two hits, and can
crush the rugged large oval rocks in five hits. The &apos;gold&apos; Hammer can
obliterate the round rocks in ONE hit, and the rugged ovals in three. The
coveted &apos;mystril&apos; can destroy the ovals in only two hits.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hoe:
No, I&apos;m calling you names. That&apos;s the name of the tool, for those poor,
uneducated people out there. It is another tool that is sure to get a lot of
use. It must be used to till (prepare) the soil for seeds, and it can be used
in the mine. The mine? Yes. In the mine, the Hoe is used as a shovel. You
can find bags of money (10 G), black herb, or, even better, stairs to the lower
levels. In the lower levels, you find even better minerals, such as gold and
mystril. You get tired fast, though, so I wouldn&apos;t suggest this until you have
the second rucksack upgrade, so you can take some blue herb with you (don&apos;t
forget the lighter, to, um, light the way!) On a side note, no matter how far
down into the mine you go, if it is raining, you can hear it. Strange. . . .
As for mining, upgrading the Hoe does nothing. On the farm, though, the
&apos;copper&apos; version gets you two tilled squares a hit (don&apos;t forget to charge!).
The &apos;silver&apos; upgrade gets you three squares. With a &apos;gold&apos; Hoe, you till four
squares at once. The &apos;mystril&apos; Hoe sends a tremor across the land, hitting six
squares at once (all in a straight line, of course). Why four to six? I don&apos;t
know. Ask Natsume. Plus, who actually plants in a row of five?
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Sickle:
Death&apos;s weapon, er, what you use to chop down weeds and withered crops. It can
also be used to chop down the grass, to use it for cow feed. Sort of useful,
but not as much so as all the previous items. You don&apos;t even have to upgrade
it, so if you can do without an upgrade for it, save yourself the money and the
minerals. Regardless, I&apos;ve made a chart of the cut patterns:

&apos;Copper&apos;: XXX

&apos;Silver&apos;: XXX
XXX

&apos;Gold&apos;: XXX
XXX
XXX

&apos;Mystril: XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
Wow, yeah.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Watering Can:
The last Tool on my list, and the most useful, sort of. It ties with the other
tools, except the sickle. I mean, you don&apos;t even really NEED the sickle, for
a while, at least. The Watering Can, um, waters crops. You need to fill it up
before you water things, just use that little pond by your farm, or the river.
After filling it up, the basic Can gets you a one square watering radius. Push
it up to &apos;copper&apos; and you get 3x1. Well, actually, it&apos;s exactly like the cut
pattern on the Sickle. Just look above at that cut pattern. Upgrade this as
soon as you can, really. Right after the Axe. Axe first, though, because you
want to upgrade that house soon enough. What?! I didn&apos;t tell you how to
upgrade your tools!? I know that! That&apos;s in the next section, grasshopper!
************************************************** *****************************
Upgrading the Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, now to teach you how to upgrade tools. You&apos;ve been a pretty good learner
so far, so this shouldn&apos;t take so long. What? You skipped right to this
section? Shame on you! Stay and listen anyway.
To upgrade the tool, you need three things: The Tool, money, and the Mineral.
You can upgrade the tools to four higher levels: &apos;Copper,&apos; &apos;Silver,&apos; &apos;Gold,&apos;
&apos;Mystril,&apos; and Mythic You can find these minerals in the mine. Dig deeper with
the Hoe to find the last two. When you have these things, go to the Tool Shop
hat old man Saibarra runs.
Talk to Saibarra&apos;s counter (not on a Thursday, he won&apos;t serve you on a Thursday,
even though he&apos;s still there).
Select the first option, and then select the tool. Finally, select the mineral
to finish the process. He&apos;ll tell you how many days it will take, and kick you
out. You heard me. He&apos;ll kick you out. Mean ol&apos; Saibarra. That many days
later, go back, and get your newly upgraded Tool. Not on a Thursday, though.
That&apos;s how you upgrade tools. Now, the HOUSE is a different story, later on
that, though.
Here&apos;s a breakdown of the amount of money needed to upgrade to each level:

Copper: 1,000 G
Silver: 2,000 G
Gold: 3,000 G
Mystril: 5,000 G
Mythic: 50,000 G

Also, you can find a cursed tool, and bless it. More on that in the next
section.
************************************************** *****************************
Cursed, Blessed, and Mythic Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can obtain the Cursed Tools in the LAKE MINE. I may have told some of you
that you obtain it in the Spring Mine, but that was bad information. I
apologize. Just keep digging until you find them. They are always buried in
the ground. Dig dig dig. It&apos;s
very random.

***SPEAKING OF RANDOM***
The tools are found RANDOMLY. SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT THERE! FINAL! I didn&apos;t
program the game, that&apos;s just the way it is. Sorry!

ALSO,
THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS. I can&apos;t repeat this in fifty emails a day, so I&apos;ll
tell you here! Sorry for not doing this before!

1. ALL TOOLS MYSTRILE
2. AN OPEN TOOL SLOT FOR EVERY CURSED TOOL
3. IT&apos;S RANDOM!!!!!!

Here&apos;s their locations:

Cursed Fishing Rod: Floor 29
Cursed Hoe: Floor 39
Cursed Ax: Floor 49
Cursed Hammer: Floor 59
Cursed Watering Can: Floor 69
Cursed Sickle: Floor 79

To bless a tool, each one has a different requirement. Since I&apos;m such a nice
guy, I&apos;ll even tell you those requirements. Be warned, they&apos;re quite
difficult:

Fishing Rod: Use the Cursed Rod 255 times. A trick I&apos;ve heard for this that
takes a while, but gets the job done is to use it inside the Bar, and keep
ordering water until you&apos;re strong enough to use it again. Do note, though,
that water only restores about .01 of your Stamina. That ain&apos;t a lot.

Hoe: Have Carter &apos;Bless&apos; the Cursed Hoe 10 times.
You can have him bless things during confessional.

Ax: Use the Cursed Ax 255 times. All I can say is to use the same trick as
for the Rod.

Hammer: Equip the Cursed Hammer for ten days straight. The only advice that I
can give is to have the Sprites look after your livestock, and do this during
Winter.

Watering Can: Have Carter &apos;Bless&apos; the Cursed Watering Can 10 times.

Sickle: Equip the Cursed Sickle for 10 days straight. See the Hammer for
the strategy.

To have Carter bless something, it must be during confessional (Thursday
evenings, I think), and it costs 1,000 G each blessing. You can only have him
bless one thing a day.
Cursed and Blessed tools have the same effects, except for the fact that Cursed
Tools sap your Stamina faster than a Downer. Here are the effects:

Fishing Rod: You can now catch the &apos;King&apos; fish, as well as Treasure and
Fish Fossils.

Hoe: Till a 12x3 area of land, like this: XXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXX

Ax: Chops ALL stumps and branches that you can see on the screen.

Hammer: Smash a Boulder, Large Boulder, and the Boulder on the Mountain in
one hit.

Watering Can: Water a 6x13 area. XXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXX

Sickle: Cuts a 9x9 Square: XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX

The Mythic Tools need an ore called Mythic Stone for Saibarra to upgrade them.
The Mythic Stones only appear after you&apos;ve had ALL TOOLS BLESSED. You heard me
right. All of them. They then appear in the Spring Mine, on floor 60.
After you take them to Saibarra, he&apos;ll use them to make your Tool an Mythic
Tool, for the nomimal charge of 50,000 G. He&apos;ll take about a week, too. Also,
the Mythic Stones (which look like burnt wood) sell for 20,000 G A PIECE. Yep,
so the cost at Saibarra&apos;s shouldn&apos;t be too bad after all. Here&apos;s a breakdown
of the Mythic Tools:

Fishing Pole: Increases chances of catching Fossil or Pirate Treasure.

Hoe: Till an 18x5 area:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Ax: Same as Blessed/Cursed, but uses 50% less energy than Blessed.

Hammer: Smashes ALL stones and boulders on the current screen.

Watering Can: Waters a 12x21 square of land: (I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m doing
this, I must really like you guys. . . . no, that aint it. . . .):
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

9. Mining:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let&apos;s get into the basics of Mining. If you&apos;ve been through the whole
guide, you already know the basics of the basics. If not, shame on you, but I
guess I&apos;ll go over it JUST FOR YOU.
Okay, to mine, go to the mine (it&apos;s on your map [press L+START]). Oh, take the
Hammer. Use the Hammer to smash the rocks you see. If you get three little
grey rocks joined together, throw it. If you get a silver or copper chunk, put
it in your rucksack. That&apos;s that. Now ship it or use it to upgrade. Now,
with that out of the way, we can get into more complicated mining.
First, I&apos;d like to point out that there are two mines. There&apos;s the normal one,
and the one in the middle of the lake. To get to that one, wait until winter.
In either mine, there is more than one level. To reach these lower levels, you
need the Hoe. Take that in, and start using it like a shovel to dig.
there&apos;s a little trick to mining.
It takes a helluva long time, but you can go in with maybe one or two herbs and
make it really really far.
Once you enter an area (map) everything will always be the same if you save and
reload. Until you leave.
Therefore, save as soon as you enter a floor. Find the stairs, memorize the
location. Load game. Go
straight to the stairs, dig them up. There you go, about one &apos;tool action&apos;
used, unless you had to get through
rocks.
Save before going down. Lather, rinse, repeat.
The reason you save before going down the stairs, is because sometimes what
you&apos;re looking for in the next
floor just isn&apos;t there, due to a glitch, or the programmers being asshats. So,
saving before you go down gives
you a new map every time :) Enjoy.
As you go deeper
into the mine, you&apos;ll find better minerals. Here&apos;s a breakdown:

Spring Mine:
Copper (All Floors): 10 G
Silver (All Floors): 20 G
Gold (Floor 3 and Below): 25 G
Mystrile (Floor 5&amp;Below): 40 G
Orichalc (Floor 10&amp;Below): 50 G
Adamantite (Floor 10&amp;Below: 50 G
Mythic Stones (Floor 60): 20,000 G
Teleport Stone (Floor 255, only third year and past.)
Fried Potato Recipee (In my FAQ, er, floor 255)
Goddes Jewel: See Goddess Jewel Section.
Power Berry (Floor 100)

The Teleport Stone lets you warp to any location on the map. Note that you
must have an empty tool slot when you see it the first time, or it&apos;s gone for
good. You could even go to, say, the Winter Mine, in Summer. . . .
The Winter Mine is the same as the Spring Mine, except for these things:

Winter Mine:
Agate (All Floors, except 50, 100, 150, and 200): 62 G
Alexandrite (Floors 50, 100, 150, 200, 251 and below): 10,000 G
Amethyst (All floors except 50, 100, 150, and 200): 60 G
Diamond (Floors that end in 0 (10, 20, 30, 40, etc.), 200+): 100 G
Emerald (Floors that end in 5 (5, 15, 25, 35, etc.), 200+): 80 G
Flourite (All floors except 50, 100, 150, and 200): 65 G
Kappa Jewels: See Kappa Jewel Section.
Moon Stone (Floors that end in 8 (8, 18, 28, 38, etc.)): 55 G
Peridot (All floors except 50, 100, 150, and 200): 68 G
Pink Diamond (Floors 30, 70, 90, 110, 130, 170, 190, 255): 10,000 G
Ruby (All floors except 50, 100, 150, and 200): 75 G
Desert Rose (Floors that end in 9 (9, 19, 29, 39, etc.)): 60 G
Topaz (All floors except 50, 100, 150, and 200): 70 G

Also note that Junk Ores, which sell for 1 G, can be found anywhere.
Also, on the ninth floor is a pond where you can catch Coelecanth, a King Fish.

******************************SPECIAL NOTE*************************************
Okay, I&apos;ve gotten enough bitching on this topic to get so sick and tired that I
will write this in here. Yeah, I said BITCHING. Bother me if it bothers you.

EVERYTHING in the mines is random. If you don&apos;t find something, then it isn&apos;t
there that time! That&apos;s final! Sometimes things just DON&apos;T SHOW UP! SO,
you should save BEFORE you go down the stairs, EVERY TIME. That way, if what
you are looking for isn&apos;t on the next floor, then you can simply re-load the
game, and it will be a new floor below you. This INCLUDES CURSED TOOLS, gems,
even stairs! Hope that helps you guys out!
================================================== =============================
10. Crops:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let&apos;s admit it. Harvest Moon is about the HARVEST. Sure you can be
*almost* completely successful by just mining. But, what&apos;s the fun in that?
There&apos;s a good number of crops in this game, from flowers to fruits and
veggies. If it&apos;s on a sandwich at you&apos;r local burger joint, it&apos;s in the game.
There&apos;s also a lot of stuff that isnt USUALLY used on burgers in this game.
I&apos;m yet to see a cabbage burger. Actually, it sounds good. . . .
Okay, let&apos;s get down to the crops. First of all, lets get the basics down, for
those people who skip around in guides. To plant things, you need a bag of
seeds for that plant. Then, you need to till the soil. I&apos;ll suggest a till
patter for the first couple of watering cans:
X X
X X
X X
or
XXX

XXX
Simple, yes? After it&apos;s tilled, stand in the center, and throw the seeds up,
and whatch them miraculously land in place (is there no wind here?!)
After that, with the exception of grass, water each seed with the Watering Can
(don&apos;t forget to fill it up!) Eventually, the seeds will sprout into little
plants, which will then grow bigger, then get flowers, and, finally, produce
some produce. Pick the produce with A, and put it in the shipping bin. Viola,
at Five, you&apos;ll have more cash.
Planting Seeds off season will kill them.
Harvest Sprites can water for you, getting at the seed in the middle of this:
XXX
XXX
XXX
Normally, the middle seed would be neglected.
Walking on seeds will not hurt them.
Selling 100 of the three basic seeds in one season gets you a special seed.
Here&apos;s a breakdown by season, items with an * are basic seeds:

&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
Spring
&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
*Turnip: Takes 4 days to grow, but it can only be harvested once. Each packet
will cost you 120 G, but each Turnip sells for 60 G. In a six plant pattern,
you get 360 G, which is a 240 G profit.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Potato: Takes 7 days to grow, and can only be harvested once. Each packet
willcost you 150 G, but each Potato sells for 80 G. In a six plant pattern,
you get 480 G, which is a 330 G profit.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Cucumber: Takes 9 days to grow, but it can be harvested more than once. Each
packet will cost you 200 G, but each Cucumber sells for 60 G. In a six plant
pattern, you get 360 G EACH HARVEST, which is a 160 G profit EACH HARVEST. It
takes 6 days to get another Cucumber, three days less than another turnip, and
also 120 G less.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cabbage: Takes 15 days (!) to grow, and can only be harvested once. Each
packet will cost you 500 (!) G, but each Cabbage head is worth a whopping 250G,
In a six plant pattern, you get 1500 G, which is a profit of 1000 G. Wow. The
Cabbage packets are bought from Won.
&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
Summer
&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
*Corn: Takes 13 days to grow, but can be harvested more than once. Each
packet will cost you 300 G, but each ear of Corn will sell for 100 G. In a six
plant pattern, you get 600 G a harvest, which is a profit of 300 G a harvest.
It takes four days to regrow Corn.
Great money maker, but also a good way to get chicken feed. Just pull an ear
of Corn, and put it in the watermill with A, and you get 30 Chicken feed.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Tomato: Takes 7 days to grow, and can be harvested more than once. Each
packet will cost you 200 G, but each Tomato will sell for 60 G. In a six plant
pattern, you get 360 G each harvest, which is a profit of 160 G each harvest.
It takes 3 days to regrow Tomatos.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Onion: Takes 8 Days to grow, and can only be harveted once. Each packet will
cost you 150 G, but each Onion sells for 80 G. In a six plant patter, you get
480 G, which is a profit of 330 G.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pineapple: Takes 21 DAYS to grow (!!), but can be harvested twice. Each packet
will cost you 1000 G (!!), but each Pineapple sells for a whopping 500 G. In a
six plant pattern, you get 3000 G EACH HARVEST, which is a profit of 2000 G in
one harvest, making a total of a 5000 G profit if planted Summer 1. It takes
5 days to regrow Pineapple. Bought from Won.
&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
Autumn
&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
*Sweet Potato: Takes 6 days to grow, AND can be harvested multiple times.
WOW. Each packet costs only 300 G, and each Potato sells for 120 G. In a six
plant pattern, you get 720 G a harvest, which is a profit of 420 G a harvest.
It takes only three days to regrow Sweet Potatoes.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Eggplant: Takes 8 days to grow, and can be harvested multiple times. Each
packet costs you just 120 G, and each Eggplant sells for 80 G. In a six plant
patter, you get 480 G a harvest, a profit of 360 G a harvest. It takes 3 days
to regrow Eggplant.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Carrot: Takes 8 days to grow, and can only be harvested once. Each packet
costs 300 G, and each Carrot sells for 120 G. In a six plant pattern, you get
720 G, which is a profit of 420 G.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Green Pepper: Takes 8 days to grow, but can be harvested multiple times. Each
packet costs 150 G, and each Pepper sells for 40 G. In a six plant pattern,
you get 240 G, which is a profit of only 90 G. Now, the good part: It takes
only two days to regrow the Pepper. That&apos;s 90 G EVERY TWO DAYS. Neat.

11. TV
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There&apos;s plenty to watch on TV. But you&apos;ll probably only pay attention to a few
things with me here. :). Pressing up gets you the ever useful weather report.
Listen to it.
Pressing right gets you a limited event calender.
Pressing down gets you another turorial.
Pressing left gets you different things on different days:
Harvest Goddess game: Only available the beginning of Spring. Guess if the
number is higher or lower, and get a prize if you get a lot right in a row.
Dueling Chefs: Tuesday
Sort of like the Japanese show&quot;Iron Chef,&quot;two chefs battle it
out with food, whoever&apos;s dish is better wins. You can get some neat recipees
from here.
Fishing Hour: Tutorial on how to fish.
TV SHOPPING: Saturday
The best one on the left channel. They say what they&apos;re selling,
and if you want it, and have the money, go to the Bar/Inn (where Ann is) and
use their phone. It comes the next day. Here&apos;s a list of all the stuff:

Mirror 1010 G Tells you useless stuff
Clock 2010 G Tells the time (?)
Refridgerator 2510 G Store Crops and Foods here. Useful.
Cupboard 2510 G Store more stuff
Kitchen 4010 G Lets you use cooking materials
Carpet 5010 G Decoration. Waste of money in my opinion
Big Bed 10010 G A big bed. Wife wont have to sleep on the floor anymore :)
Oven 2510 G An oven. It&apos;s actually a Microwave oven.
Knife 1510 G Use it to cook
Fry Pan 1510 G Use it to cook
Pot 1010 G Use it to smoke, er, um, cook
Mixer 1210 G Use it to cook
Seasoning Kit 2510 G (more expensive than the pot?) Use it to&quot;Kick things
up
a notch.&quot;:P
Rolling Pin 760 G Use it to cook
Whisk 510 G Use it to cook
Power Berry 10010 G Decrease rate of energy loss

You may notice that my prices are 10 G higher than the item&apos;s price. Simple
reason: it costs 10 G to use the phone, and you can&apos;t get them without using
the phone.
================================================== =============================
13. Cheats
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some NOTES you should be aware of:

First of all, I don&apos;t condone cheating. It is a cheap way to ruin a game, in
my personal opinion. I am also aware that there are people out there who do
not believe this in the way I do. Some people are weak, and therefore need the
cheats to win. That&apos;s fine. That&apos;s why I&apos;m adding this section in.

ALSO:
This guide was copied (with some minor modifications to make it flow better
with this FAQ) DIRECTLY from VALT Jasper&apos;s Codebreaker guide. WITH HIS
CONSENT. Please, VALT, if you don&apos;t like the reformatting I&apos;ve done to it,
contact me, and I&apos;ll change it back. Thanks again, man.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Coding Should Be Done
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After I put this guide on the net a lot of people emailed me saying that they
just couldn&apos;t get it, and that they couldn&apos;t understand how to use these codes.
Well, first of all, you need a codebreaker. A codebreaker can be bought at
places like Toys R&apos; Us, Gamestop, Ebay Games, Games For Less, and most stores
that carry electronics and/or electronic gaming products. Once you have a
codebreaker all you have to do is plug in the codes listed in here and then
start your game. For different stages you will want different codes, and
sometimes you may want to turn off/on your codebreaker at different points in
the game when using these codes. More on this in the next chapter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Different Stages And How They Work
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town there are two main types of codes:
Stage 1 and Stage 2. Stage one codes are codes that are used BEFORE you load
your game data (aka, while your in the main menu). Many people use these codes
because you can turn/leave your codebreaker on right when you turn on the game.
Stage 2 codes accur AFTER you load your game (aka, when your in the game). The
way that you can tell that you are in a possition to use stage 2 codes is when
you can move around. To use stage 2 codes players should turn off their
codebreakers, load their game files and then, when they can move around in the
game, they should turn on their codebreakers. This will allow you to use the
codes correctly.

The difference in the stages is simple, a stage 2 code is 2834 + the stage 1
code (added hesadecimaly). For those of you who would like to calculate your
own stage 2 codes from stage 1 codes you can follow the following instructions:

1: Open the windows calculator.
2: Click on view and then click Scientific.
3: Click the hexadecimal button.
4: Plug in the value of the stage one code.
5: Now, there are two ways to do this. You can either:
-A: Click add and type in 2834
or
-B: Click the Decimal button, then click add, then plug in 10292. Then click
hexadecimal.

The result will be the stage 2 code!

With this knowledge of codes you should now be ready to begin pluging in codes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Codebreaker Master Codes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master Code For The Coebreaker System Is As Follows:

0000E882 000A
100D1BF8 0007

If you are not using an emulator then you MUST plug this code in before using
any other codes and this code must be active whenever any other codes are
active.

If you have any questions, don&apos;t contact me, I don&apos;t know! Please contact
VALT Jasper using the contact information given in the &apos;credits&apos; section.

Cheats I&apos;ve found elsewhere:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of them I found myself, some of them I found on weird sites on the web
with no labeled webmaster. If they&apos;re yours, and you can prove it, tell me.
I&apos;ll gladly give you credit. I still won&apos;t help you with them. I don&apos;t like
cheating. I have tested them out, though, so you&apos;re good to go. These are,
to the best of my understanding, Stage 2 codes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

99,999,999 Gold - 820068B4 E0FF
820068B6 05F5 *Tested. It works*

Infinite Stamina - 32006A29 004B
32006A2A 002A *Tested. It puts you to the first level of
Tiredness, and keeps you there.*

Infinite Lumber - 82004E30 03E7 *Doesn&apos;t seem to work on my copy.*

There&apos;s more, but I can&apos;t get any of them to work, so I won&apos;t even screw
around like that. Peace.

Japanese version of the game, as the word Shi (four) also means Death in the
Japanese language. On a small side note, the Afikaans word for death is
DOOD. Yep, Dude. Aint that a trip?

13. FAQs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. DUUUDE! TOTALI SEN ME DA ROM!
A. I don&apos;t have the ROM. I don&apos;t do ROMS. Got it?

Q. Where do I get the fishing rod?
A. In Won&apos;s store

Q. How do I buy Golden Logs?
A. Have 999 Lumber

Q. Can You answer a question?
A. Ask it, and, yes, I can

Q. How do I get a hold of you?
A. Email or AIM. They&apos;re at the top of the guide, or I&apos;ll tell you a little
later.

Q. When was this game released in North America?
A. Damned if I know. I got it on November 13, 2003. The date varied. Bad.

Q. How do I make a fence?
A. For a wood fence, just go the the little building next to your horse stable
and press A to grab a log (you have to cut some wood first). After that,
just place it the way you want it in your field. For a stone fence, grab
the small round rocks around the farm and use them like the wood. After
a few days, the wood will rot, but will not lose its effectiveness.

Q. Where are the Harvest Sprites?
A. To the right of the Church is a path. Follow it.

Q. Where do I get the horse?
A. After making friends with Barley, he gives it to you. You don&apos;t even have
to be friends, you just have to introduce yourself. Get out and MEET THE
PEOPLE, all you people who can&apos;t find it! ammar-nar 08-13-2008, 02:07 AM lolo_240 08-13-2008, 04:09 AM 
:smailes21: ( ):smailes21: lolo_240 08-14-2008, 05:46 AM Buildings
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To Upgrade your buildings you&apos;ll need to talk to Gotz. He&apos;ll finish the upgrade
in 3 days but he takes a break for holidays. To upgrade you&apos;ll need not only
wood but gold so make sure you have enough. Upgrades are usually pricy but
definitely well worth it if you want to be successful. Some upgrades later in
the game are just for looks so you can decide whether you want them or not.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 House Upgrades
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your house is a wee but cramped when you start off so it&apos;s a good idea to
upgrade it. Upgrading allows you more space for furniture (such as a kitchen)
and it&apos;s mandatory for you house to be upgraded twice for you to marry a girl.
Upgrading your house cost quite a bit so don&apos;t worry about upgrading it too
quickly.

Smallest House
Cost: N/A
Lumber: N/A
The House you start off with is a small shack beside your mailbox (to be
honest ^_^). There&apos;s barely any furniture and the only things you have are
the bare necessities.

Bigger House
Cost: 3,000G
Lumber: 200 pieces
This next upgrade gives you space for a kitchen and makes your table bigger.
You can now also purchase a Refrigerator and Cabinet for keeping extra items.
Your house takes up twice as much room and has a neat curve to the roof and
you now have 3 windows.

Biggest House
Cost: 10,000G
Lumber: 700 pieces
You can now acquire every item from the TV Shopping Network. It comes free
with a fireplace which increases your stamina on a snowy day, any other day
and it decreases your stamina. This last house is very spacious and is
required to marry a girl. The attachment looks like your first house only
with a skylight and chimney. You now have 4 windows with shutters. You can
now upgrade get all of the Other Upgrades in section 4.3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Livestock Upgrades
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To upgrade the barn or coop will cost a little more than your house. When you
upgrade them there&apos;s room for more animals increasing your profit.

Small Chicken Coop
Cost: N/A
Lumber: N/A
Chickens Capacity: 4
The first chicken coop is a small building to the bottom left of your farm.
It has room for 4 chickens and 1 incubator for eggs. You have access to a
feed bin inside as well as Chicken Fodder (bought from Rick&apos;s Farm). The
building to the left of is the Water Mill. You can put corn in it to get
30 bushels of Chicken Feed.

Small Livestock Barn
Cost: N/A
Lumber: N/A
Livestock Capacity: 8 (any combination of cows&amp;sheep)
The Barn on the right side of the north entrance to your farm. There&apos;s one
space for pregnant livestock in the north west corner and two rows of four
spaces for fodder. On the north side you have access to the fodder (bought
from Yodel Farm or cut from Grass Seeds) and a feed bin on the south side
near the entrance.

Large Chicken Coop
Cost: 5,000G
Lumber: 500 pieces
Chicken Capacity: 8
An almost identical building is added to the right side giving you more
room in your coop. You now have two incubators and 8 feed boxes allowing
you to have more chickens.

Large Livestock Barn
Cost: 6,800G
Lumber: 500 pieces
Livestock Capacity: 16 (any combination of cows&amp;sheep)
A barn attachment identical to your old one is placed on the left side. Now
you have two spaces for pregnant livestock, two places with access to fodder
and two feed boxes. You now also have four rows of four feed boxes allowing
you to hold up to 16 (!) cows and/or sheep. This is pricy but well worth the
profit you make with double the amount of livestock.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 Other Upgrades
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Upgrades are not necessary to be successful but a stylish adjustment to
your house. In my belief they&apos;re are very expensive for what they&apos;re worth but
it&apos;s really just an add on. These become available after everything else
previously mentioned is upgraded.

Remodel Window
Cost: 25,000G
Lumber: 300 pieces
Types: Square Window With Screen
Square Window Without Screen
Round Window
Allows you to remodel the four windows on your house. You can have them with
or without a screen or have them round for something a bit different. You
begin with square windows with a screen.

Remodel Doghouse
Cost: 20,000G
Lumber: 500 pieces
Types: Red Doghouse
Blue Doghouse
Strange Doghouse
The doghouse you begin with is red but you can change it so the roof is
striped
blue with a slant instead. The strange doghouse looks like a cat opening it&apos;s
mouth wide for the entrance. It&apos;s actually very cute but bizarre for a
doghouse.

Remodel Mailbox
Cost: 10,000G
Lumber: 200 pieces
Types: Red Mailbox
Blue Mailbox
Strange Mailbox
Your mailbox begins as red but you can make it a blue miniature house or
&apos;strange&apos;. The Strange mailbox looks like a little blue man with a big mouth
for inserting letters. Comes complete with arms, legs and angry little eyes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 Things to be Built
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gotz can also build things for you. These are not upgrades from previous
objects or buildings they are completely new. These serve useful purposes but
are both VERY expensive so it&apos;s a good idea to purchase them a lot later in the
game when you can afford them without going bankrupt.

Bathtub
Cost: 30,000G
Lumber: 580 pieces
This is used just like the hot springs are to regain energy. It appears as
a door beside your fireplace. You do not actually see the bath you just
enter the door and come out half an hour later squeaky clean and
re-energized.

Vacation House
Cost: 100,000,000G(!)
Lumber: 999 pieces
This house is built next to Sabaira&apos;s blacksmith in south Mineral Town. There
is a table with four chairs, a bed, two shelves (one with your diary), a TV,
clock, mirror and fireplace. Your wife will never come inside. You can spend
the night in this house.

Moutain Cottage
Cost: N/A
Lumber: N/A
Your cottage is on mothers hill near the lake. On your 50th anniversary your
wife will give this to you. It has a bed, clock, calendar, journal and table
but no TV. You can spend the night in this cottage.

Seaside Cottage
Cost: N/A
Lumber: N/A
This can only be obtained if you connect Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral
Town with Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life for Game Cube. If you do this small
white cottage will be built at southwest Mineral beach. It&apos;s furnished with:
a bed, clock, calendar, journal and table but no TV. You can spend the night
in this cottage. *You need a 42 star link exchange to get this from the HG*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.0 Furnishings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These section is for furniture you can add to your house and their uses. Half
of these objects are extremely useful while the other half are just to show
off. You can obtain one from Won but the rest must be bought from the TV
Shopping Network. To collect them all is mildly expensive. Most of these things
are crucial to marry a girl.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 TV Shopping Network
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The TV Shopping Network is aired every Saturday on your TV. Just go up to your
TV and press left and you will be told what is on sale, the price and a bit
about it&apos;s purpose. To buy the piece of furniture you have to call in from the
Doug&apos;s Inn in town. On the counter there is a phone that cost 10G to use and
on the same day you see the item you want to buy call in and request it. Zack
will come and deliver it to you within two to three days. It usually takes
three days if there is a festival on the second day.

Notice:
I once order a whisk from the shopping network when on the second and third day
there was back to back festivals and I never received my order even though I
paid. Make sure this doesn&apos;t happen to you and plan ahead by looking at your
calendar before hand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 Furniture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section is a list of the furniture you can buy from the TV Shopping
Network or elsewhere. It contains quite a bit of information so I&apos;ll brief you
on how it is organized:

Name of Object
Cost: Amount of Gold need to purchase the object
Upgrade: What house upgrade you at least need
Item Required: What other item needed to buy the object
A brief de******ion

and item requirement needed. If you have anymore information or see anything
wrong please contact me!

Big Bed
Cost: 10,000G
Upgrade: Second Upgrade
Item Required: Kitchen&amp;Utensils
A Big Bed placed to the right side of your smaller one. This is a required

sleeping bag. However, I think she&apos;d be much more comfy in a bed ^_^

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.0 Other
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Lumber:
Can be obtained from Gotz for 100,000G when you have 999 pieces of wood. You
can also get it from the Mayor on Winter 2nd by getting him the item he asks
for. Golden Lumber is very useful for building fences because it never rots.
However, the people in town will be annoyed that you&apos;re showing off your
wealth. It&apos;s best to keep it inside as a show item.

Fences:
To make fences go up to your wood bin (in between the barn and horse stable)
and press the &apos;A Button&apos; to get a piece of wood in your hands. Then place it
on your field to make fences. They rot over time so you cannot pick them up
and move them but they never disappear completely. Useful for fencing in
animals and crops.

Gotz&apos;s Creative Urge:
Sometime during the game Gotz will become depressed and say he hasn&apos;t found
his creative urge. He will refuse to build you anything until you shower
him with his favourite gifts (apples, honey and eggs) for a year or two.
When he will accept buildings again you&apos;ll see a little cutscene in which
he thanks you.

7.0 Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Is there any other way of getting the Vacation House?
A. Nope sorry, you&apos;re going to have to work for it.

Q. What is up with the fireplace?
A. People ask me this ALL the time. At first I put down incorrect information
but now I have the correct info up. Thanks for all your help!

Q. How to you get 1,000,000G/Vacation House?
A. I&apos;ve never gotten the Vacation House but I suggest planting 20+ of each
major money making crop (Cabbage, Pineapple, Sweet Potatos) and getting
the H.S.s to water/harvest them. Also, bring a basket to the Horse Races
and exchange all your medals for broaches. Empty your basket the next day
and you should make about 60-70,000.

Q. Why won&apos;t Gotz make me anything?
A. People asked me this so many times I put it in &apos;6.0 Other&apos;.

Q. How can I use my Cursed Axe 255 times without collapsing?
A. Use your axe during a festival where there is no time or stamina. It might
take a little while but it&apos;ll be worth it.

Q. How come I can&apos;t un-equip my cursed axe?
A. To un-equip your axe go to the church between 1pm-4pm during confession
and ask Carter to remove it. If you use it enough times it will become
blessed and you can remove it like an ordinary tool. lolo_240 08-18-2008, 04:27 AM Mining-----------------------------------

get angry, but Elli will be happy.
-&gt;Purple Heart: Go to the Clinic between 9 AM and 7 PM on Thursday, Saturday

see you are. Jeff then walks in looking bad, Elli calls the Doctor, who
aks her to get some medicine, Elli leaves and comes back, but with the
wrong medicine, she apologizes and gets the correct one immediately, the
Doctor comforts her saying that it was a common mistake, Jeff feels

[103]-----------------------10.3. Harvest Goddess------------------------------

General Info: As the name says, the Goddess, you can &apos;summon&apos; her by throwing
something from your farm in the pond, be sure that the day is sunny! This

heart level by the way.

Rival: None.
Schedule: There&apos;s no schedule...

Birthday: Spring 8th (9th if yours is on the 8th).
Favorites: Pineapple, Strawberries.

pedometer count, every crazy thing like that).
Schedule: Always at the pond.
Marriage: The Goddess isn&apos;t happy with just having your house expanded and
with the bed, no...
-&gt;Catch ALL the different fish, including the Kings.

excuse. Even if you vist her at the Pond she won&apos;t say anything
different (...). She won&apos;t join events that include your wife. Time later
she will be pregnant... Which makes you wonder,&quot;HOW IN HELL?!&quot;considering
she never is with you... Anyway, when the boy is born, he is also all yours
to take care of. So basically, it&apos;s a lot of work to marry her, and she
sucks... Challenge my ass!
