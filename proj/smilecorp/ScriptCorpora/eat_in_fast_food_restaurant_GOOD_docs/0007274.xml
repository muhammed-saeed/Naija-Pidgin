Best Fast Food Franchise in the Philippines and their Costs
 
The best fast food restaurants to franchise in the Philippines are in this hub. They are the top fast food chains to franchise and really lucrative business to start up. If you want a sure profit, choose only the best franchise.
 
A lot of businessmen and entrepreneurs would rather choose
franchising a business than starting a new one from scratch. In franchise, you
don’t have to be known because your franchise business is known already and has
been successfully established years ago. You will save a lot of time, too in
thinking about building and executing your business because all aspects has been
laid out and planned already. Franchising a proven profitable business requires
a big investment of huge money in return of a bigger and higher profit for you.

 Why choose fast food
franchise? Simply because food businesses are ninety-five percent
profitable than any other kind of business. People always eat, anytime,
anywhere and at any cost. You can skip buying a new pair of shoes or fancy clothing in
a mall but you can never skip dining inside your favorite fast food restaurant.
When you’re on a road trip, you always drop by any drive thru or when you’re
lame at home, a pizza delivery is just a call away. Would you pass not eating
Kentucky’s fried chicken in a year? Or probably not even in a month nor week? See,
fast foods are already part of our lives.
 
Below are the top
fast food chains in the Philippines best to franchise by anyone who’s so
interested. I’ve included the requirements for franchising when applying a
franchise for the best fast food in the Philippines. Majority of these fast
food businesses are already known worldwide and are proven profitable and
solvent for many years already. Here are the best fast foods to franchise with
their initial franchise costs .



 Jollibee, top franchise in the Philippines 
 Jollibee Franchise Philippines 

 Jollibee is the number one fast food chain in the Philippines. It also belongs to the top 100 corporations in the Philippines for the more than two decades now. It also was the first food service company to be listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange, meaning Jollibee’s performance was booming so quick in the track thus it continues to sustain its expansion not only in the Philippines but also globally. Jollibee has achieved numerous awards of excellence in Asia and the world. There is a page which shows all of its awards. Those facts are reasonable enough why it’s best to franchise Jollibee if you have what it takes to be a franchisee. The r equirements to franchise Jollibee are on their official website and the cost to franchise Jollibee is around 15 million pesos to 30 million pesos (USD 266,445.00 to USD 532,890.00) depending on the site. Want to franchise Jollibee? Visit this page .




I love Jollibee more than Mc Donald’s because their spaghetti is the best and their burgers are just so mouthwatering.



 Mc Donald&apos;s franchise 
Mc Donald’s Franchise Philippines

Everyone knows Mc Donald’s . It is also one of the top fast food here. The numbers of Mc Donald’s franchised stores in the Philippines is still growing. I’ll never get sick of their mc flurry and fries, just the best. If you’ve got enough capital investment, you’re financially secured and has a good leadership skills, you can be qualified to franchise Mc Donald’s store in the Philippines. How much will it cost to franchise Mc Donald’s in the Philippines? The franchise cost of investment ranges from 25 to 35 million pesos depending on the size of the site, building, location and land cost. The complete requirements to franchise Mc Donald ’s in the Philippines are in this website . 



 Mang Inasal, fastest quick serve restaurant 
Mang Inasal Franchise




 Mang Inasal is the fastest growing barbeque fast food chain in the Philippines, serving chicken, pork barbeque and other Filipino favorites. Wow, grilled barbecue in charcoal, rice wrapped in banana leaves, a marinade concocted out of local spices and herbs, every time I pass by Mang Inasal, the smoke and aroma is calling me. With just 1.2 million pesos initial franchise fee, you can open your own Mang Inasal store anywhere in the country. The initial franchisee fee covers the operation support, use of brand name and trade name, opening marketing support and training support. The requirements and all franchise costs to open Mang Inasal restaurant are in their website .



 Greenwich Pizza 
Greenwich Franchise

Greenwich is the Philippine’s favorite pizza chain and also the one of the fastest growing fast food chains in the country. It is the largest pasta and pizza chain in the Pinoy’s land. Greenwich has become the Outstanding Filipino Franchise of the Year - Hall of Fame for some years now.. It is truly a pride of the Philippines because it started here. Greenwich is a big rival of Pizza Hut and Shakey’s here. The requirements to franchise Greenwich are commonly the same in terms of skills but the initial franchise fee is a bit lower.

Royalty fee is 10 percent of gross sales and the term of franchise is up to 10 years and is renewable. The complete requirements and franchise FAQs are in their website . 



 KFC bucket meal 
KFC Franchise Philippines

Everyone knows Kentucky&apos;s fried chicken (KFC) and everyone just loves their finger lickin’ good chicken. Franchising KFC in the Philippines is becoming more phenomenal, too. There are over 13,000 KFC outlets in more than 80 countries and territories around the world. KFC has strict franchise requirements. For international interested franchisees, the franchise fees aren’t disclosed in their website. And they require someone who has professional managerial experience - preferably in the service industry (whether in the distribution, commercial or financial area) , with the necessary skills to successfully operate, manage and grow a restaurant business. The minimum financial requirement to open a KFC in the US is $ 1.5 million net worth and $750,000 in liquid assets. If you live outside the US and wants to franchise for KFC, go to kfc franchise website . 



 Chowking&apos;s famous halo-halo 
Chowking Franchise Philippines


I just love my Chinese
foods . Chowking has it all –
noodles, dumplings, rice toppings, siomai, siopao, and even the famous Pinoy halo-halo . Chowking gathered the
rewards from the ground-breaking product and marketing expertise of Jollibee when it became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Jollibee Foods Corporation in 2000. Chowking has won the Outstanding Filipino Franchise of the Year for several years like Jollibee. To franchise Chowking, one must has a good
moral character and posses a enthusiastic entrepreneurial business skills,
financially stable and capable. Franchise investment requirement costs from P9M to P12M , depending on the size of
the store.



 
Goldilocks Franchise

They say you’re not a Filipino until you’ve tasted mamon , palabok , dinuguan and puto. Goldilocks is the leading brand in the Philippine bakeshop industry and caters Filipino famous dishes like the ones mentioned a while ago. With over 40 years of experience, it also was in the Hall of Fame in the Outstanding Filipino Franchise of the Year last 2005.

I loved chowking and yes they are one of the most loving fastfood but now, CHOWKING is the WORST fast food ever. Poor SANITATION(LANGAW) and Poor Customer Service. Here&apos;s the story, few hours ago i was eating at Chowking Lipa Batangas near BigBen. I was alone then this waiter served the combo C. I was asking politely to get me a straw because I don&apos;t want to leave the table. Di naman ganun kadami tao nung oras na yun. He said yes, I keep on waiting and I was keeping my eye on the waiter then napansin ako ng manager &quot; Yes mam may kulang pa sa order niyo? &quot; sabi ko &quot; Wala na po sabi kasi ng waiter kukuha niya ako straw&quot; then she replied &quot; self service kami dito &quot;. Binalewala ko na lang. I was eating my Combo C then nung asa gitna na ako ng mangkok may nangingisay na LANGAW. I was very very upset!!! Tinawag ko ang manager at sabi papalitan nila. Wala na talaga akong gana! then they refunded what I pay for. Gustong gusto ko ipahiya ang Chowking kanina sa mga diners but I can&apos;t , so I ended up crying! Then I walked out.

Hello Dexter! I think there are but they are not so popular. If there are exotic restos, I think there are restaurants that serve everything healthy -like let&apos;s say &quot;all veggies resto&quot; for vegetarians. Havent find a particular one yet. If I&apos;m not too busy, perhaps I could search and collect some for you. But I&apos;m not making a promise OK. If you have done your research, can you share it to me? Thanks! Good luck on your feasibility! :)

Very interesting hub. I am only familiar with about half of these franchises. (My location: Michigan USA.) It&apos;s kind of good to know that not EVERYTHING in the world is the same, even if there is a McDonald&apos;s in every country.

Hi Everett! Honestly, I didn&apos;t yet eat in Mang Inasal coz I didn&apos;t like inasal chicken when I dined in Kenny Rogers..I see their foods are mostly grilled. But I never heard bout someone having toothache after eating.. I think the benefits of eating grilled meats and foods are obvious so you just have to be more careful while eating them. Avoid the burnt parts as they cause toxins. Eating to street vendors would be cool once in a while but you have to know the vendors personally so that you&apos;re comfy everything you eat is clean and well done.

Re: tooth aches from charcoal cooked chicken

i tried chicken cooked over charcoal by street vendors... it get stuck between teeth and causes severe tooth ache.

WHo doesn&apos;t like foods? haha To make it easier for you, Philippines has 3 Ps :) I love Jollibee&apos;s menu. The taste differ from branches abroad though. Here it&apos;s so &apos;langhap sarap&apos; as they say. Franchising a business is a good source of income. Thanks for your great comments Safiq :) Bless ya!

I like this hub for two reasons. First reason being that I like food, in fact I love food. And the second reason I like this hub is that it tells me about food in philipines in particular it tells me about fast food in Philpns. ( I can&apos;t spell philipines at times.) I don&apos;t often get the chance to travel the world but I really like to know what is going on in other parts of the world. Jollibee is a franchise I had never heard of. I really like the idea of fast food from far east asia. I also have an interest in franchising. I use to run a franchised (TEXACO) Caltex petrol station. Thank your for your article. A good hub is one that tells me things that I didn&apos;t know. xx safiq.

This is nice one! Since you do this very well, I&apos;d like to bring to your attention other restaurants of superb services and offers. I know, they are my favorite hangouts! Dad&apos;s Saisaki, YakiMix, Tong Yang are just few among my favorites. I travel that far just to have my fill- occasion or no occasion. Try them, for additional subject to write about here.

Yeah Jollibee&apos;s spaghetti is perfect for Pinoy&apos;s taste. I love McDo&apos;s fries more than Jollibee, too. Oh boy, just the aroma of chickenjoy I can&apos;t resist anymore LOL Oohh you&apos;ve mentioned all your likes and I gotta blame you for craving them now hahaha Glad to meet fellow Pinoy :) Thanks for dropping by

Mang Inasal is the quickest and easiest to franchise among them for the super low franchise cost. There are lots of business opportunities out there but if you really have the capital, I suggest to hit the restaurant and fast food franchise. People will always eat no matter what :) McDo is very profitable here because they only franchise in very crowded locations such as malls, schools and cities. Thanks for sharing McDo&apos;s operation in some countries. That&apos;s so interesting. Thanks for popping in. :)
 
 BenjaminB   22 months ago
 
Interesting twentyfive to learn about new food haunts in foreign countries to me. I would love to try the phillipine style barbecue at Mang Inasol. Interesting to note about Mcdonalds,in many countries they fail miserably profit wise due to them forcing all franchisees to purchase their food only from the American food distibutors they operate. This practice has in some places made the price of a Big Mac and other sandwiches go through the roof.

Hello moi friend :) Indeed, these franchise business opportunities would surely click. If I had the capital, I&apos;d definitely choose fast food franchise then a coffee shop franchise maybe haha Yep, Cath Jollibee is a big company here in Phil and it is owned by a Chinese man, they are expanding worldwide. There are Jollibee branches in the US I heard. Not sure in the UK.. I know you&apos;re planning to open a Costa coffee franchise something right? Ow, the &quot;moi friend&quot; thing hahaha XO

Hello Prof. A! Mang Inasal&apos;s franchise fee sounds so affordable and bbq is always loved. It&apos;s the fastest local growing franchise here in Phil. and if I had that savings I&apos;d definitely open one ;) Chowking and Goldilocks sounds cool, too. In mall areas I think they would click the best. The market place is really the big factor here isn&apos;t it? :) I&apos;m always happy to see you Prof. A. :)

Hi, Sandyspider! :) Ah kfc and Mcdo? Thanks for dropping by. To choose between the two, I&apos;d choose kfc ;)

Coolmon hello! Yup Jollibee is expanding globally that&apos;s why it&apos;s known worldwide. The others though are still focusing on the local market. I think Chowking has opened some branches in south east asia, too. Thanks for dropping by here ;)
