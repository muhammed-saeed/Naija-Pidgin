 Direct Buses to the University of Utah 
 Filed in Trains of Thought Tagged with 2 to the U , bus , Change Day , Salt Lake Central , TRAX , University of Utah August 10th, 2011 @ 12:07 pm 
The addition of two new rail lines has brought many changes to UTA’s system. Though thousands of bus riders are used to the regular change days held each year, this is the first big change for the agency’s rail riders. Few local riders are used to making a transfer on rail and it’s been a difficult adjustment for some.

Operationally, UTA is limited in the number of trains running in a specific area. To determine the new configuration, UTA developed it’s direct trips based on ridership, in order to efficiently carry passenger loads and create the smallest number of transfers. 

One group affected by the changes, were those used to taking a direct train from Salt Lake Central to the University. Today, those riders can depart Salt Lake Central by train every five to 10 minutes , however their trip will require a transfer to the Red Line at Courthouse. For those departing on the Blue Line the transfer time is three minutes, while the transfer time for those who depart on the Green Line is every 13 minutes.

A more efficient option (even prior to the change) for those traveling from Salt Lake Central to the University is to travel by bus. There are four bus routes that travel directly to the University.

The 2 to the U departs Salt Lake Central Station every 15 minutes (:12, :27, :42, :57). The bus makes a stop at President’s Circle, North Campus Drive and University Medical Center. The trip takes about 20 minutes.

 Route 3 departs Salt Lake Central Station every 30 minutes (:12, :42). The bus makes stops at President’s Circle, Rice-Eccles Stadium, Marriott Library and Reasearch Park. The trip takes about 25 min.

 Route 220 departs Salt Lake Central Station every 15 minutes during peak (:00, :15, :30, :45) and every 30 minutes midday (:00, :30). The bus makes stops at President’s Circle and Rice Eccles Stadium. The trip takes about 15 minutes.

 Route 228 departs Salt Lake Central Station every 30 minutes during peak (:10, :40) and hourly midday (:10). The bus makes stops at Rice-Eccles Stadium, Marriott Library, Huntsman Center, LDS Institute, Madsen Health Center and Research Park. The trip takes about 20 minutes.

 
 
 Families Enjoy First Public Ride 
 Filed in Mom Aboard Tagged with Change Day , FrontLines 2015 , Mid-Jordan , Mom Aboard , TRAX , West Valley July 17th, 2011 @ 8:27 pm 
Some of Utah’s most successful social media professionals and their families enjoyed the first public ride on the new Mid-Jordan“Red Line”Friday, July 15 as a part of the Mom Aboard program.

The event–a bit of a press conference for bloggers–was planned to help share information about grand opening ceremony for the new Mid-Jordan and West Valley lines.

 The event, at Historic Gardner Station , was attended by about 30 bloggers and 95 children. Each of the children were provided a gift bag with an engineer’s cap, a train whistle and some candy. Their parents received information about the new TRAX line to share with their readers.

 

Prior to accessing the platform, families were treated to a brief safety discussion that highlighted the following:

 Be alert Always expect a train is traveling down the track Watch for trains in both directions Cross the track at designated crossings NEVER walk on or play around the track Observe all safety markings and signals 

 Information was also shared more specific information about the opening of the Mid-Jordan and West Valley TRAX lines.

 Following the remarks families boarded the train for a trip from Historic Gardner Station, to Daybreak Parkway and back–about 45 min. round trip .

 This event is understood to be the first of it’s kind for a public entity in the State of Utah.

 
 
 August Service Schedules Live 
 Filed in Trains of Thought Tagged with bus , Change Day , Schedule , Service Changes , TRAX July 11th, 2011 @ 6:59 pm 
Last fall, UTA began work on service adjustments necessary due to the opening of the Mid-Jordan and West Valley TRAX line on August 7. Service schedules for bus and rail lines affected by the changes are now available online on UTA’s website. 

UTA announced the opening date for the new TRAX lines in October 2010. They will bring significant changes to the agency’s Salt Lake County service, resulting in about 9,000 new riders daily.

Following the announcement UTA engaged in significant public outreach that included online and telephone surveys and a series of open houses that began in the fall.

In November, the agency held a series of open houses designed to gather feedback from local residents to ensure that transit objectives are met in a way that accurately reflects the desires and needs of the local community. Hundreds of comments were collected in this process.

UTA spent December, January and part of February analyzing the feedback and checking it with possible county-wide scenarios.

Based on the research, UTA brought two scenarios to the public for review in March . The scenarios were presented to the community at public meetings throughout the valley and during an online chat. About 900 comments were received.

The final plan was introduced to the public in May . It addresses and resolves 60 percent of the comments received, while still meeting UTA’s goals.

 
 
 Hearings to be held on proposed service changes 
 Filed in Trains of Thought Tagged with bus , Change Day , Mid-Jordan , Open House , Public Hearing , Salt Lake County , TRAX , West Valley March 7th, 2011 @ 4:13 pm 
UTA has released two detailed service plans for public review and comment on its website. The changes are in response to the opening of two new rail lines–Mid-Jordan and West Valley–in August 2011.

Over the next two weeks, UTA will host eight public hearings throughout Salt Lake Valley to answer questions and take feedback on proposed service changes.  Formal comments may also be made on the agency’s website .

 UTA first announced opening date for the Mid-Jordan and West Valley TRAX light rail lines in October 2010. The new lines will bring significant changes to the bus and rail lines in Salt Lake County, adding more than 9,000 new riders per day, significantly increasing transit service to the west side and to Southwest Salt Lake County. Since the announcement UTA has been working hard to get ready for the change.

In November, just one month after announcing the opening date, the agency held a series of open houses designed to gather feedback from local residents to ensure that transit objectives are met in a way that accurately reflects the needs and desires of the community. Hundreds of comments were collected

UTA spent December, January and much of February analyzing the feedback and checking it with possible county-wide scenarios. The proposals have been narrowed down to two possibilities:

Scenario 1 -

 Maintains current frequencies of service on weekdays Slight reduction of weekend service (Saturday and Sunday) Realigns some route to meet TRAX Adjusted start and end times on some routes Eliminates some routes, converts others to flex routes that run a regular schedule Fast bus routes not eliminated would be reclassified as express routes and require premium fare. 

Scenario 2 -

 Increases 15 min. service routes on weekdays Reduced Saturday service; no Sunday service except for TRAX Realigns some routes to meet TRAX Adjusted start and end times on some routes Eliminates some routes and converts other to flex routes that run a regular schedule Fast bus routes not eliminated would be reclassified as express routes and require premium fare 

TRAX in both scenarios -

 Mid-Jordan TRAX would operate from Daybreak to University of Utah Medical Center West Valley TRAX would operate from West Valley Intermodal Hub to Salt Lake Central The existing Salt Lake/Sandy line will continue to operate between Sandy Civic Center and Salt Lake Central The University Line will be replaced by the Mid-Jordan line Weekdays: 15 min service from approximately 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday: 20 min service from approximately 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday: 20 min service from approximately 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 

Comments on the proposed service changes will be taken until March 31.

 
 
 Public hearings scheduled for April 2011 proposed service changes 
 Filed in Trains of Thought Tagged with bus , Change Day , Ogden , Public Hearing , Trains of Thought , UTA , Utah County , Utah Transit Authority January 11th, 2011 @ 6:31 pm 
UTA is proposing several service changes to bus service in Box Elder, Davis, Weber and Utah counties.

The changes proposed are based on current ridership, efficiencies and 2011 budget projections. Although a number of the changes represent a small reduction in service, net ridership is expected to increase in the coming year.

Following is an outline of proposed changes:

 Route 685–Brigham City/Ogden Express– Discontinue service. Route 685 has one weekday southbound trip that leaves Brigham City about 7 a.m. and one weekday northbound trip that leaves Weber State University near 5:10 p.m. The underutilized route services Brigham City, downtown Ogden, Weber State University and the Flying J office in Ogden.

Routes 626 and 627 –West Roy/Weber State University Davis Campus/Davis Applied Technology Center–discontinue Saturday service. Routes 626 and 627 run hourly on Saturdays from approximately 7:20 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. These routes connect 5600 South and 3500 West in Roy to the WSU Davis campus in Layton and the DATC in Kaysville. The changes will impact less than seven percent of riders on each of the routes.

Route 667–Lagoon Shuttle–Discontinue Sunday service. The Lagoon Shuttle runs every 30 minutes on Sunday from approximately 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. April through October. The route connects Lagoon to the Farmington FrontRunner Station. This is an under utilized route and the change will affect approximately one percent of current shuttle riders.

 Route 455–University of Utah/Davis County/Weber State University –Discontinue Saturday service. Route 455 Saturday service runs hourly from approximately 8:45 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. The route connects downtown Ogden and Weber State University Campus with downtown Salt Lake City and the University of Utah. The changes will affect less than two percent of route 455 riders.

 Route 613–Weber Industrial Park - Discontinue Saturday service. Route 613 Saturday service runs hourly from approximately 8:30 to 6 p.m. The route connects the Ogden Transit Center/FrontRunner Station to the Weber Industrial Park. The changes will impact less than four percent of route 613 ridership.

 Route 816–Sandy Civic TRAX to Provo East Bay - Discontinue Saturday night service due to low ridership. Route 816 connects the southern most TRAX stop with Utah County, continuing south to Provo’s East Bay.

 Route 850–Utah County State Street –Cancel 15 of the 43 trips with the lowest ridership.

The proposed changes would impact less than one half a percent of UTA riders.

Public hearings are being held in each county to provide interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes. Meeting dates, times and locations are available on the UTA website. 

Following the public hearings UTA will review the comments collected, make any necessary adjustments and finalize the schedule. Changes will be implemented in the system in April 2011.

For more information on Box Elder, Davis and Weber County changes, please contact  Kent Jorgenson at kjorgenson@rideuta.com or (801) 510-1484 prior to January 18.

For more information on changes in Utah County, please contact Ken Anson at kanson@rideuta.com or (801) 227-8957 prior to January 27.

 UTA gathers feedback to determine funding priorities 
 Filed in Trains of Thought Tagged with August 2011 , bus , Change Day , Mid-Jordan , Open House , Salt Lake County , TRAX , West Valley November 19th, 2010 @ 3:00 pm 
 UTA has gathered feedback from hundreds of Salt Lake County residents in an effort to ensure future transit objectives are met in a way that reflects the needs and desires of area residents.

The agency has hosted three of eight community open houses thus far. Future open houses will be held in West Jordan , South Jordan , Murray and Salt Lake City , Nov. 30 through Dec. 2. For more information, view the open house schedule .

 

Interested individuals who are unable to participate in one of the open houses are encouraged to share feedback in an online survey and/or comment form .

 UTA will be opening the Mid-Jordan and West Valley TRAX light rail lines August 7, 2011 . These new lines will significantly increase transit service to west and southwest Salt Lake County. The opening of these new lines will bring changes to UTA’s system, as the agency works to ensure that the entire system is operating efficiently.

 Seeking community input on August 2011 changes 
 Filed in Trains of Thought Tagged with bus , Change Day , Construction , FrontLines 2015 , Mid-Jordan , Open House , Salt Lake City , Salt Lake County , TRAX , West Valley November 18th, 2010 @ 7:00 am 
 UTA will open the Mid-Jordan and West Valley TRAX light rail lines August 7, 2011 . These new lines represent a significant increase in transit service to west and southwest Salt Lake County . The opening of these lines will also bring changes to UTA’s system, as the agency works to ensure the entire system is operating as efficiently as possible.

The economic downturn has left UTA with fewer operating resources than originally anticipated and the agency will be making these changes under some constraints . In an effort to ensure that transit objectives are met in a way that reflects the needs and desires of area residents, UTA is seeking feedback from the community.

You can participate in this information gathering process by attending one of eight open houses , held throughout the valley in the coming weeks, or by participating in an online survey .

 UTA will use the information to develop service plans that will be shared with the public for additional input and refinement in early 2011. Final plans for service will be adopted in late summer for implementation on August 7, 2011.
