Needing no power source the machine can be used anywhere&amp;is ideal where space is limited or ceiling height is low.
 
When discarding stretch wrap from incoming products, generally it gets thrown in the garbage. Most net costs of garbage pickups are $90.00 per metric ton in cost.

Stretch wrap is made of LLDPE and has a market value as of today of $1750.00 per MT. Which means in many cases companies are paying $90.00 per MT in landfill costs to get rid of something worth $1750.00 per MT and is a perfectly recyclable commodity. Up to now however quite expensive to separate and store out of the main waste stream.
 
We know that used stretch wrap is usually an afterthought and a necessary disposable product for many businesses. Previously there was no simple way to bale it and get paid for it.

In today&apos;s market, each small bale of stretch wrap is worth $35.00

Safe Environmentally Friendly Ingredients

The TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease Compost Odor Control Spray is a biodegradable, non-toxic and non- flammable deodorizer. It is made entirely from safe naturally derived ingredients. TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease does NOT contain hazardous air pollutants, ozone depleting substances, phosphates, nitrates, nonyl phenols, carcinogens, fragrances, dyes, alcohols, caustic, ammonia, chlorine bleach, quats, silicates, chlorinated solvents, or petroleum distillates. It is a high performance odor control product without the environmental, health and safety issues associated with conventional deodorizers containing harmful synthetic chemicals.

How TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease Controls Compost Odors

The TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease Compost Odor Control Spray utilizes state of the art biotechnology and works in a uniquely effective manner to eliminate composting odors. Firstly, it immediately binds to the odor causing molecules such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia to destroy them. Secondly, it inactivates the enzyme urease which converts nitrogen and urea to noxious and unpleasant smelling gases like ammonia. Thirdly, it destroys odor producing anaerobic bacteria and promotes the growth of friendly aerobic odor destroying bacteria. TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease does not merely mask odors, it truly eliminates them and prevents their formation using the Deodorizing Power of Nature.

Applications

TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease Compost Odor Control Spray can be effectively used to eliminate ammonia and hydrogen sulfide odors generated from any small home or large commercial compost operation.

Directions

Firstly, dilute 0.25 oz. TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease super concentrate/gallon water to make the working solution. Once mixed with water, the diluted TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease should be used within 2-3 days to ensure optimal activity of the product. If you need to store the diluted solution for longer, add 0.15 g sodium benzoate/gallon diluted TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease™or 0.1 oz copper sulphate/gallon diluted TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease gallons to preserve it. Spray the diluted TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease into waste as it is formed into static piles or widrows until it is moist. When the latter are turned and moistened, reapply TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease™. It should also be sprayed onto the compost surfaces during curing. Adjust the application rate, dosage, and frequency to optimize the elimination of odors. For large scale odor control applications, TheCompactorGuy Odor-Ease may be effectively delivered from a variety of equipment ranging from a simple portable fogging machine to complex metering, injection, and recovery systems found in air scrubbing/filtration units.
