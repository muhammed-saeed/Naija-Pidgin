Should I Be Eating This? Subway BBQ Pulled Pork
 By Elizabeth Gunnison at 3:08 PM 
 Subway&apos;s big launch of its new BBQ Pulled Pork Sub didn&apos;t go over so well recently , with many a spectator knocking the new product before even trying it. Not being the type to hastily judge a pulled-pork product, I decided to try it out for myself and see if all the heckling is really warranted.

Subway bills its new sandwich as &quot;tender, succulent slow-cooked pork with sweet and smoky barbecue sauce, all on freshly baked bread.&quot; It&apos;s worth noting that Subway is really going out on a limb here by adding barbecue to its repertoire; cold cuts and tuna salad are one thing, but barbecue is a foodstuff with honest-to-God devoteeseven rabid, know-it-all ones prone to becoming indignant at those who deign to produce something bearing its holy name that is not to their specifications. It&apos;s hard to see how Subway could ever come out on top with these people.

As a point of reference, what&apos;s considered by many to be an authentic barbecue sandwich would typically consist of pulled pork, a regional barbecue sauce, and coleslaw, all heaped onto a Martin&apos;s potato roll. As I learned when I stopped into my local Subway the other day, the BBQ Pulled Pork Sub is something else entirely. First of all, you&apos;re asked whether you want it dressed with the same condiments as any other Subway sandwich, which means the cheese, tomato, mustard, etc. sitting in those iconic plastic bins. I asked for mine made just like the one in the picture, which included a couple ounces of pork (which most closely resembled canned tuna, but tasted like ham) and barbecue sauce (which tasted suspiciously like ketchup) on Italian bread with lettuce and onion.

So, let&apos;s be clear: This is a barbecue sandwich in only the most liberal sense of the term. But apart from the obvious discrepancies with the &quot;real deal&quot;leaving aside whether it should or should not actually take its own namedoes it taste good?

Frankly, and I know this is something of a cop-out, I think all Subway sandwiches have a way of tasting the same no matter what&apos;s inside, and this one is no exception. So if you like what Subway&apos;s been up to in the past, you&apos;ll probably enjoy this BBQ Pulled Pork Sub. Me? I&apos;ll avoid it at all costs.
