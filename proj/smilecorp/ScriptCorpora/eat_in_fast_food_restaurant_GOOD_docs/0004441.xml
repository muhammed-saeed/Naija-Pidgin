 Making Markouk Bread , (...) My little village of Ain El Delb does try hard, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , you know. Today, they invited a prestigious army band over to commemorate the feast of the disciples of St Maroun, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , the patron of the local church. They organised a village style dinner: a simple spread of labneh (strained, salted yoghurt drizzled with olive oil), zaatar and fresh markouk bread. Markouk is our most traditional and loved bread. I’ve uploaded a video of the bread being made. Notice how thin it is. This thinness allows the sheets of bread to cook super quickly and since the bread has very little moisture, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz , it lasts very well compared to bread loaves and the like. Check out the skill these ladies have, how they turn the dough to something seriously thin and evenly round. I thought it’s best to keep the church prayer in the background, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , just to give you a sense of the place.

CD drive is actually in our daily lives often say a CD player, some people call it a CD player or CD player. It is a microcomputer-controlled intelligent high-fidelity stereo audio equipment, using advanced laser technology, digital technology, computer technology and a variety of new components, with a high density recording, playback time (up to 60 ~ 75 minutes ), simple, (...) , fast, (...) , etc. selections. It vividly replay recorded content, structured, there is presence. Its high sound technical indicators, dynamic range, wide frequency response up to 5 ~ 20000Hz, a small distortion to 0.003%. CD player is now very common audio playback device, according to its shape can be divided into two kinds of desktop and portable. The most famous portable cd drive with Sony, Panasonic and so on.

Construction and principle of the first CD player and the main principles of construction products introduced mainly by the laser pickup CD player and turntable system, servo system, signal processing systems, information storage systems and control systems composition. CD player laser pickup is a key component, which consists of semiconductor lasers, optical systems and electronic detector. Laser is a low-power (MW level) AIGAS laser diode, the laser beam through the optical lens system projected onto the information recording surface, due to record a number of pits on the record, so when the light hit in the pits at the point when weak due to reflected light, photoelectric detectors pick up the signal is small; when spot hit in the absence of pits on the aluminum film, the reflected light is strong, large photoelectric detection to pick up the signal, so that corresponding to the presence or absence of pits in The output of the detector to produce high and low electrical pulse signal, and then through the RF amplifier, its internal comparator to be , frame synchronization signal detection, error correction, etc., will be added to processed data DAC (D / A), the converter into an analog sound signal output. Bright as a mirror of the CD film is extremely thin aluminum or gold film with sound protective layer made of PVC. Like with the floppy and hard disk, CD disk can be in binary data (from To store data on the disc, you must first convert the data using a binary computer, then burning with a laser engraved on the flat data model, with a reflectivity of the disc, laser disc pits carved on behalf of space on behalf of In the read data from the CD drive when directed beam (laser) on the surface of the disc to move quickly. Read data from a computer disc or laser after laser to sing the opportunity to observe every point, to determine whether it reflected laser. If it does not reflect the laser (where there is a pit), then the computer will know that it represents a If the laser is reflected back, the computer will know this point is a Then, these tens of thousands, or millions of

Portable CD Players (10) The first CD player in 1982, the world&apos;s first CD player, but also the production of the first Sony CD player was born, it is Sony&apos;s CDP- 101, because this player is a binary code to record sound, so the model of the sells for $ 900. Main Products and CD player car audio console is the largest production of Japan and Europe focus on producing power amplifiers and speakers. (A) the host&apos;s top product CD player: Japan NAKAMICHI (middle) is characterized by all of its products are based on high-end design, the most recommended product is the MB-75, middle unique design, integrated six-disc CD player can be rotated in the instrument panel, directly in front of the more than one CD disc easily switch, eliminating the extra on the boot changer. The use of lift storage structure, to make use of limited space in a volume the size of the host DIN 6 CD, sodium content, but also has AM / FM, hand-held wireless remote gods, output power 40W × 4, the front output 4V, static sound, adding bass, clock and so on. Fine craftsmanship, performance and stability. 1: Anti-swing suspension system: If the machine is tilted 30 degrees within the mechanical adjustment is not necessary, its internal sensor automatically senses and make automatic adjustments. 2: Magnetic recording folder: Disk fixture with the traditional spring-type shock is completely different, or similar objects using spring resistance of direct debit to a CD disc in rotation, (...) , this method greatly cabinet vibration power transmitted to the plate, the impact of yu broadcast results. Fixtures with magnetic recording folder chassis completely isolated, so the shock can not enter inside and outside to get the most accurate, pure signal read out. 3: The shock-absorbing system with stereo, you can not install the regulator placed heavy suspension to absorb uneven road arising because of the worst shock, ensure that temporary off music. 4 intelligent three-dimensional suspension system, preventing sound down. 5 discs out of the Department of Mechanical movement, do not touch the CD tray table, only touch the edge of CD drive, CD drive to prevent scratches. (Ii) advanced products: Japan ALPINE (Alpine) which is characterized by BBE technology; BBE sound system is to improve the clarity of any common audio technology. BBE is the Fender guitar developers LeoFender and U.S. companies use California BarcusBerryElectronics successful research. Now, it has been a number of musicians and recording technicians used. Has now been applied to the field of car audio. How it works: When you listen to live music, the treble and bass will also spread to the headset. However, speakers broadcast, the voice coil impedance will cause a higher frequency of the sound was delayed. Transient intense music (drums, guitar, piano) even more so. BEE through phase compensation pot (the lower the frequency the more then a long delay time) and increase to compensate for the higher and lower frequency range of the speaker in the lower efficiency of these to overcome this problem. This is a dynamic process-driven approach to enhance the frequency and phase compensation. BBE benefits: the phase relationship between the frequency of music, especially the right means that the rich presence. In other words, as if in person. More clear and detailed treble, and bass-rich strains. Pitch of each string guitar is more obvious, to further improve the clarity. Percussion sound and clear allocation of bombs could be heard, exciting, so the piano fidelity have improved. Rich deep electronic music, and more forceful vocal clarity. MaxTuneSQ regulator: MaxTuneSQ regulator in the technical aspects of the following: 1. Frequency Modulation (FM) part of the new phase-locked loop using a small jitter (PLL) circuit and the new low-noise frequency detector circuit, so that SNR to 80dB. 2. The improved demodulation coil, reducing distortion (typically 0.01%, but usually less than 0.1%) 3. High-performance ceramic filters, (...) , with automatic wide / narrow mode switching function, expanded choice, which the signal intensity in the reception areas of particular importance. 4.

in ASP, FSO means that File System Object, the file system object. We are going to manipulate the computer&apos;s file system, here is the web server is located on top. So, be sure you&apos;re with the right permissions. Ideally, you can build your own machine on a web server, so you can easily test. If you are running on the Windows platform, please try the free Microsoft Personal Web Server PWS.

System Folder Object: access to the folder object for the folder All property TextStream Object: the text stream object for access to documents you can use the above content object on the computer to do anything, including sabotage ;-( So, be careful using the FSO. in a web environment, it is important to store information , such as user information, log files, and so on. FSO provides a powerful and simple way to efficiently store data in this article which, focusing on the FileSystemObject and the TextStream object. FSO supported by Microsoft for non-Windows system, probably can not use ASP. how to use the FSO? to use the FSO to perform all the work, we must first create an object, code like so: This establishes the FSO and the variable fso, then you can use the familiar object.method syntax to perform file system operations [see Visual Basic documentation for more information on objects and programming knowledge] Object Wizard in Here, we can use fso.method or fso.property, these will be seen in the example below. FSO model in the script provided by Microsoft run-time DLL file, it is scrrun.dll. you can in any application reference this DLL file, such as MS Access, Word. that is, not just limit it in ASP applications. FSO FSO off switch command command regsvr32.exe / u% windir% / system32/scrrun.dll FSO to open the command regsvr32.exe% windir% / system32/scrrun.dllFSO list CopyFile method to copy a file or multiple files to create a new path CreateTextFile and returns a TextStream object OpenTextFile DeleteFile to delete a file, open the file and return the TextStream object to read or append. If you want to know the full the FSO methods and properties, please refer to Microsoft MSDN. Let&apos;s look at a few examples. licensing authority discussed above, the basic knowledge, and then talk about the permissions of the problem. FSO to create a user account permissions to run it, in other words, if someone from the Internet to access your page, then the internet account is created FSO. If you log in as administrator of the computer and the login page, then the administrator account is created FSO. It is very important because some accounts have a certain authority, and FSO requires some permissions so that it can perform the full function. internet account

(IUSER_MachineName, MachineName is the name of the server) generally has only read access, which means that users will not be able to write guest book file, however, There are several options to circumvent this problem, first, is very difficult, is to require users to log into the server before completing guest book, however, the guest book at the point is to gather information from anonymous users, if you require users to log on to to know who they are, so skip this option, look a The first two methods is to create a directory or file, IUSER_MachineName users have write access to. This may open some potential security vulnerabilities, because anyone who knows correct directory and have some web skills who will be able to fill the content on the server, this is a very serious taboo, so you must make sure to save in a hidden place these writable directory information, and as much as possible to set these directories outside the web directory structure (for example, in Windows, this is a not a directory under inetpub directory.) file read now has some user information stored in the file, like a simple database. Suppose a user wants to understand all of the visitors, it is necessary to separate the information from the registration of the relevant part, because there is no the same as the ownership structure of the database column, we know that in the created file, the user name is the first line, second line is their home page, line 3 is their e-mail address. then the user is registered in accordance with such a structure to store their information, so every 3 will contain a user&apos;s registration information to know these, you can write the following code to Display Information: here just do a very simple output, but you can include tables or DHTML form of information if you have correctly set up and write into a file, a small circle above the appropriate listing of everyone in the database information. ReadLine method to read a line of content, until it encounters a newline, followed by the ReadLine call will read the next line. AtEndOfStream is TextStream object&apos;s properties, it tells us when the end of file is encountered. Suppose for some reason, we have not properly documented, if a user only two lines instead of three lines of information, it will produce some errors, we here loop back file information in the next 3 lines, 3 lines without much information, it will appear the following error message: Server object error&apos;ASP 0177: 800a003e&apos;So, be sure to add some error handling code to prevent file insert the extra lines or less the necessary line information written document assumes that you want to create a simple book, you can create a database in which to store the user&apos;s information, however, if the power does not require a database, use FSO to store the information will save you time and money, and some ISP may limit the application database on the web, assuming you are in a form to collect some user information, here is a simple
fso operation form HTML code: look formhandler.asp code to handle the form:&lt;%&apos;Get form info strName = Request.Form (Request.Form (get form field value and assign to variables. The following appeared in the interesting part - write file: path = fso.opentextfile (path, ForAppending, TRUE)&apos;write the info to the file file.write (strName)&amp;vbcrlf file.write (strHomePage)&amp;vbcrlf file.write (strEmail)&amp;vbcrlf&apos;close and clean up file . close set file = nothing set fso = nothing Recall, OpenTextFile method returns a TextStream object, which is another FSO object model. TextStream object reveals the contents of the file operation methods, such as writing, reading a line, skip a line. VB constant vbcrlf to generate a newline in OpentextFile command parameter defines TRUE, which tells the system, if the file does not exist, create it. If the file does not exist, and does not define TRUE parameter, an error occurs.

Public Function CheckFile (ByVal ckFilename) Dim M_fso CheckFile = False Set M_fso = CreateObject (know how to write files, but can do some more? Here&apos;s to try to build a web site search function. The key is to establish a recursive search engines, mainly to the preparation of a code search files in that directory, and then catalog circulation to all execute the same code. because they can not determine the total number of subdirectories, it is necessary to perform a search code over and over again, until the end. recursive call is very good! below to create a search page. Suppose an HTML table has been established single, in which the user enter a search string.

Close Next&apos;Here&apos;s the recursion part - for each&apos;subfolder in this directory, run the Search function again For Each objSubFolder in objFolder.SubFolders Search objSubFolder Next End Function In order to open the file, FSO need the actual file path, not the web path For example, the c: inetpubwwwroot empindex.html, rather than www. enfused. com / temp / index.html or / temp / index.html. To the latter into the former, use Server.MapPath (, filename path name that represents the web. The above code will specify the initial directory in your folder under a subdirectory for each run, where the initial web root directory is directory of each file to see if it contains a specified string, the string is displayed if you find a link to that file. Note that with the increase in the number of files and subdirectories, the search will also increase the time spent, if needed heavy search work, I suggest you take other methods, such as Microsoft Index Server Index Server. FSO for content management with this, you may already have a good FSO experience. Let us in-depth study by step, to solve more complex problems. First, you may want to rename the file. In order to keep track of all the documents, you will want to rename them so unique, so the system can be easily differentiated. Unfortunately, FSO does not allow simple file renaming, so We had to change it.&lt;%&apos;create the fso object set fso = Server.Createobject (; (Server.MapPath (strDir)) then set f = fso.CreateFolder (Server.MapPath (strDir)) else set f = fso.GetFolder (Server.MapPath (strDir)) end if&apos;create and write new file set file = fso . Createtextfile (f.path&amp;; rst (Assuming this to create a unique folder and a unique file to store the article, however, because the path of the folder will change every day, it must first check whether the folder exists, if you do not exist, create It is this in if not fso.folderexists code completion and then made that path, create a new file. After the establishment of a new file, delete the old file, which by fso.DeleteFile to complete this step 2 is: on rename the files, then move to a more appropriate directory. Note that this file can also do more to operate, such as a new file is written before about the editorial content. FSO FSO can not do that there are some weaknesses - For example, it is difficult to handle binary files, including Word documents, many graphic file formats and other documents, but you can still use other way to operate these files - move them, delete them, etc. You can not do is to open them or write operation. Another limitation is the length of the question for the file when reading and writing some content immediately, all information is stored in memory - more content, the greater the consumption of memory, which will Each work becomes slow up, so if you need to manipulate very large files, or a large number of small files, consider the file into small pieces, and often a clear memory into the application components into a COM object can also greatly enhance the speed of the program. Also, you can not use the FSO to manage permissions and the file, folder properties, the implementation of a secure encryption method is the previously mentioned great guest book file read-only, when needed and then set to be written, modify and then come back and this method is often used in CGI and Perl, but unfortunately, there is no satisfactory way to achieve with the FSO Few understood the FSO FSO also function in There are many great features, but many people do not realize these functions often do you feel after something difficult to find, when you often have to sigh to: If I knew this method just fine! Here are how these unusual but very cool feature: GetSpecialFolder Method to return a specific path to the Windows folder: Windows installation directory; Windows system directory; Windows temporary directory FSO.GetSpecialFolder ([0, 1, or 2]) GetTempName Method Returns a randomly generated file or directory name, for the need to store temporary data GetAbsolutePathName Method returns the absolute path to a folder (similar to Server.MapPath). For example, FSO.GetAbsolutePathName (The results: the parent folder (for example: FSO.GetParentFolder (best to create good error handling code, because if the required parameters does not exist, the information will have trouble.

 To create a good paste, (...) , I blitzed the pistachios along with some glucose and created an emulsification with grape seed oil. You could use any neutral oil. I didn’t take measurements and went with feel and taste. I stopped when the pistachios tasted slightly sweet and the paste was smooth enough for me (a bit of coarse meal is fine). The consistency needs to be slightly runnier than peanut butter. I went home and mixed in some cream with a small sample to test out the flavour and the gates of heaven opened and I heard a sweet song, (...) , and a choir or angels called out to me. Seriously, it was that good.











After shelling for an evening, thumbs sore with pain from the odd stubborn pistachio that refused to open, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz , I ended up with a good amount to try making my paste. I was aiming for a smooth paste, (...) , and I knew my food processor was not up to the task. A quick tweet and the incredibly generous Mr Franz Scheurer was quick to donate his time and his Thermomix (what would have cost me $2000 to buy).



The Ice Cream



Now that I had finally experienced what a jar of pistachio paste from Bronte tastes like (bloody amazing), I seriously needed to do something about the low supply situation. A visit to my Greenacre-based Lebanese green grocer Abu Salim provided a good kilo of roasted unsalted pistachios for $15.00. I wouldn’t call us a perfectionist race, but when it comes to roasting nuts, the Lebanese are masters – they get it so right. The nuts were wonderful; the roasting concentrated and amplified their flavour brilliantly.



The Paste


Pistachios&amp;the Easiest Way to Ice Cream


I was aiming for a custard based ice cream, but as luck would have it, Jules from The Stone Soup posted a churn-free, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , machine-free lemon ice cream recipe. It looked incredibly simple, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , and I decided to give it a go. The basic idea is that by increasing the amount of sugar, ice crystals do not form. Jules folds lemon juice and icing sugar into whipped cream and simply freezes the lot for 6 hours. I did the same, but substituted pistachio paste for the lemon juice, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , and added some water to dissolve the sugar. The result was a beautiful. pistachio green ice cream with the texture of semifreddo, light, airy and delicious. I urge you wholeheartedly to try making ice cream this way. It is so simple – 5 minutes and you’re done, (...) , and it tastes ridiculously good.





Are you sick of my pistachio packed posts? I don’t blame you, but really, this is a follow up on my obsessive post on Bronte pistachio paste, so bear with me and you will learn the easiest way to make ice cream, ever.



It is worth mentioning that if you want to make pistachio paste for ice cream, you may as well add some water into the blender to make the paste smoother. That way, you wouldn’t need a Thermomix, because with that much liquid, your food processor should do the trick. If you do add water, make sure you omit it from the recipe below.






Method

Whip the cream until soft peaks form

Mix icing sugar and pistachio paste and 1/3 cup of water until smooth (omit water if already used in paste preparation)

Fold the pistachio and sugar into the cream until evenly distributed

Whip the cream again until it gets to soft peak stage once more

Freeze for 6 hours or (...) ml whipping cream

200 grams icing sugar

4 heaped tablespoons (or to taste) of pistachio paste, prepared as mentioned above



I wanted to create a pistachio paste that I could use in desserts, one that could have a decent lifespan, so I decided not to follow the ingredients of my jar of Bronte pistachio paste and instead omitted the milk. The paste would last longer, and I could add milk when I needed.

Jock itch symptoms one jock itch at the prologue as the verge of the clear, slightly elevated erythema, gradually expanding, down aboard the scales, consciously itching, gradually from red to lavender brown,alternatively skin color.two If never treated,abuse to the nigh radiate and the hub of the lesion gradually healed automatically, the nigh development, and erythema of the brink of the inflammation is more perceptible the above activities may have rash, blisters, crusts,or even erosion, the capital self-healing, the formation of circuitous alternatively semi-circular.three After leaving the more temporary pigmentation.four Chronic disease process,paucity of skin lesions showed a moss can be changed.5 Jock itch may be the cardinal omen is intense itching associated with regional itching. Likely repetition of the disease. Many woe from ringworm deserving apt exposure to the patient alternatively along cats, dogs and other infections,or indirectly amongst infected raiment and equipment,alternatively to undergo from athlete&apos;s foot, the scatter of infection deserving apt scratching. Summer season,peppery and humid, the body sweating,especially among the Unit,if I were you bathe,alternatively wearing tight-fitting underwear likewise late a tremendous numeral of sweat evaporation,namely easy to get the disease. In addition,folk with diabetes,undue vaginal discharge and other patients, and long-term oral alternatively topical application of a colossal digit of broad-spectrum antibiotics alternatively corticosteroids, are also susceptible to jock itch. From the occurrence point of view mainly juvenile people more men than women. The disease occurs in the summer,peppery and constantly humid,alternatively sicker, alleviate alternatively remedy the winter. Any violation by pathogenic fungi due apt the inside of the groin alternatively semi-circular ring lesions are collectively referred to as jock itch, ringworm namely actually chapter of the special shares in the screen type. Often occurred in the contralateral scrotal peel of the leg unilateral or bilateral, (...) , mostly circuitous or semi-circular patch. Appear early in the shares of the inside of the upper small chips erythema,aboard which there is scaling, and gradually expand and apt scatter approximately clear border which have pimples, blisters, scabs. Central parts of the self-healing, pigmentation alternatively desquamation, long while in the local skin infiltration thickened mire,often accompanied onward itching. In severe cases,constantly extended scatter vastus medialis, perineum alternatively anus, its lower brink even more clear. Fashion tin be disperse apt the scrotum, penis, etc.. Jock itch causes disease namely caused onward Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum and other caused more contagious, such as through dress gear alternatively transmission of pathogenic own hand, foot and ringworm; environmental conditions also affected, (...) , such as In the warm season and rainy areas, the anus of minor peel abuse morbidity. Chinese antibiotic believes that disease namely caused forward the wind outdoor the analgesic,gather the skin and even afterward tin not moisten the skin; alternatively deserving apt chilly outdoor attack,happening health disorders; alternatively wind-heat invasion hair awakened, Yu-long dryness; alternatively the Chong and Ren disorders, blood detriment camp consumption, blood absence such as dry peel caused onward weathering dystrophy; alternatively rheumatism of the invasion,apt stay in the Cou; alternatively alive in the wetlands, water slurry submerging rainy evil outdoor the submerge depression in the skin; alternatively because Hanyi rainy ta, drowning the sound of rain peel resumption according the sun, Shushi maceration hair awakened, and the spent of disease. Incidence of conditions 1 the right environment as the growth of dermatophytes: tepid and humid conditions two Source of infection 1 self-infection: a fungal infection from additional parts of their own men near the vastus medialis and the scrotum,particularly obese two entirely fit splice,aboard which the secretions, and so complicated to remove clay and the regional temperature than high humidity, it is suitable for fungal growth and reproduction, so the men susceptible apt jock itch.2 sexually transmitted jock itch: so the antibiotic ambition also be classified as jock itch, Clinically, jock itch namely more than 80% amongst non-sexual transmission. Clinical diagnosis based aboard symptoms and bacterial examination, it namely easy to analyze jock itch jock itch confusing peel lesions diagnosis namely not perplexing,merely should be alert apt identify with some of the peel,or targeted therapy namely complicated to be done. Easily confused with tinea peel are: 1 Seborrheic dermatitis: sometimes also be violations of negative leg rash of roseate specks there namely scaling, and some ring, clear siteline yet the direct microscopic fungi were negative.two Red ringworm: Corynebacterium caused onward a skin disease, common in the armpit,leg etc., brick-red skin lesions,not inflammatory brim ring, do never itch, direct infinitesimal fungi were negative.three Psoriasis: commonly known as psoriasis, may interpose the leg showing ring or patchy erythema,usually thick scaly surface,additional parts of the body may also have the same rash.4 Vitamin B2 deficiency: deserving apt absence of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) due apt the peel scrotum and oral syndrome, mainly with scrotal inflammation,began apt appear as a diffuse pink spot scrotum film clear boundaries, edges slightly higher out of leather, overlying gray alternatively brownish African thick scaly crust, scaly check-negative bacteria. Glossitis and angular cheilitis concomitant in the same edible element collective tendency to disease. Treatment Western antibiotic mainly in hormone treatment anti-histamine narcotics mainly deserving to crucial side effects, the use of a huge digit of hormones can occasion tinea fungal infections amplify quickly the solid namely only appropriate for patients with severe long-term control of symptoms as a short period General were given anti-fungal analgesic dermatophytes local treatment,local treatment,meanwhile nipping cases, oral drugs Treatment are: one Xin compound resorcin solution, liniment two Miconazole Nitrate three.1% clotrimazole compound four Salicylic mordant compound tincture 5 Compound tincture six.1% pseudolaric econazole emulsion 7.1% eight.1% compound ketoconazole lotion mold pyrithione net tincture,lotion 9.1% terbinafine cream compared with 10.1% azole emulsion Buddha pluck needs attention namely penis, anus and additional peel skinny and tender area never also strong with irritating drugs preventing the deterioration of the condition. Chinese medicine Chinese antibiotic disease namely caused onward the ventilation outside the narcotic,gather the skin and even afterward tin not moisten the skin; alternatively deserving to chilly outdoor aggression, (...) ,affair health disorders; alternatively wind-heat invasion hair awakened, Yu-long dryness; alternatively the Chong and Ren disorders, Camp Blood depletion, blood absence such as dry peel caused forward weathering dystrophy; alternatively rheumatism of the invasion, (...) ,apt stay in the Cou; or alive in the wetlands, water slurry submerging rainy malign outdoor the submerge depression in the skin; alternatively because Hanyi wet ta, sound of rain flooded the peel re-by the sun, Shushi maceration hair awakened, and the priced of disease. Thus, the sub-type diagnosis and treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine prescription one three Rumex grass restraint usage: Daozhi vinegar. Wrap the affected area Indications: tinea, jock itch, athlete&apos;s foot prescription 2 Coptis, Phellodendron, Huang Dan, Nepeta (Wei Chao) of equal parts, system usage: research as the kill For outer use.

Treatment of jock itch medication ought be continued, that the withdrawal ought never itch, treatment ought be thorough,impede negative bacteria before stopping treatment. Summer namely the rainy season, rain and more discreet tinea raining,combine more and more folk today prefer to dress fixed pants, jeans, nylon underwear and tights, so more and more folk infected with jock itch. Physician cried jock itch raining season is a agreeable hair duration reminding people to take essential precautions work.

stomach in the diaphragm,afterwards aboard the esophagus, small intestine, the next one Gastric cardia catchy because the next port of Helicobacter. Stomach, also known for epigastric (guǎn hose and read wǎn bowl), So aboard height of the stomach because the esophagus, stomach,below the intestine, the stomach called the gastric tube among the two ranks (abdominal). The upper,middling and lower three. The upper part of the stomach, said Shang Wan, including the cardia; the middling of the stomach in the abdominal said that the gastric body part; the lower chapter of the stomach called lower abdominal, including the pylorus. the bottom of the pylorus, even in the small intestine. treatment of permeable disease protection plus maintenance diet stomach stomach stomach stomach stomach temperature five to keep dispersing the suggested medicinal potion Stomach exciting Chinese interpretation Chinese edible exposition Stomach stomach nursed back apt health prevention and self-nine stars, the maximum complex to digest edible Shang Wei roles comment the stomach wèi knowing. Word from the field from the meat Original meaning: the human body in the farmland. Description: Stomach alias And numeral Invention of Chinese personas the Chinese have been founded aboard agriculture, agricultural land to become a core chapter of China, the kernel chapter of the conceptual territory centre If the folk of ancient China plus the analogy,afterwards the human body exists in the grain apt its original zone only the stomach, the stomach is the person that the Basic Introduction Pinyin: wei English: Stomach strokes: nine parts of the stomach in the body of the sternum below the xiphoid,hub of the upper chapter slightly quit of navel
schematic
upper stomach in the abdominal crater even aboard the esophagus, small intestine, the afterward one Stomach, also understood because epigastric, divided into upper,middling plus lower three: the upper chapter of the stomach Shangwan, including cardiac; the lower chapter of the stomach is lower abdominal, including the pylorus; among the upper and lower abdominal chapter is in the abdominal. Even aboard the esophageal cardia, pylorus pass below the small intestine, stomach and bowel diet food out of the aisle The main physiological function of the stomach is the main receiving and decomposition of water valley,is the cardinal physical features pass down,favor the malign flee dry. Form of stomach vogue size, location varies, mainly determined along the brawn tone and size. In the standing position with barium sulfate contrast agent filling the stomach and as the X-ray learn the stomach tin be divided into four types. High-angle position of the stomach, gastric and stomach into the body about horizontal position, wider by the stomach, gastric angle blunt, was horn type, common type of physical force in the super-chunky. Hook-type gastric fundus and gastric body diagonal alternatively perpendicular lower right, upper right shift pyloric part the fashion of the anchor nick angle was, the lower pole of the stomach up apt the class of the iliac crest. More common in those who are power-type physique. Falls were gastric fundus packet pocket, dumping back, stomach huge bubble resembles seen in normal people Stomach plus the stomach long perpendicular position, the whole left side of the stomach namely about located in the abdominal cavity plus only in the right side of the pylorus, the lower fringe of the stomach can be connected below the class of the iliac crest,plus even into the pelvic crater the narrow-minded breadth Physical inability apt type more common in those long, thin plus brittle Stomach fashion location, size is never only vary,merely entire the bits and stomach with the degree of filling varies. Supine, (...) , the higher; standing, the lower position; over-filling of the stomach, the reach below the hub
anatomy
role of the stomach namely mainly adapt apt grind colossal pieces of edible into small pieces (also understood for physical digestion),and degradation of macromolecules in edible into smaller molecules (also known for chemical digestion), so for beyond absorption. The bishop absorption of water and a small aggregate of liquor and a small aggregate of very micro salt. With gastric, secretion of gastric nectar gastric drink contains hydrochloric sour plus proteases, may be initially digested protein. The cells of gastric acid secretion in the gastric acid secreted during digestion (hydrochloric sour HCl pH = 2 the headmaster cells secrete protease (pepsin), rennet enzymes enzymes. Stomach secretes mucus floor plus discourage the secretion of gastric pepsin plus sour digestion. Acid - acclimate apt kill bacteria on the surface attached apt edible Proteases - proteins into peptides acclimate (peptides). In Chinese antibiotic the stomach is a member of six interior organs,and five internal organs of the spleen table. Mechanism apt modify edible in the stomach is the abdominal organs. Buckling its vogue even aboard the esophagus, small intestine, the after an Satisfied according the decomposition of water main valley,for the cereal core of the storage a sea of ​​blood, reduced stomach apt pass along,and spleen associative apt table, stomach often collectively known for the day back tomorrow. Cohabitation Turkey stomach and spleen,but the stomach namely a affirmative as the dry soil,raining soil namely yin spleen. Structure observed gastric biopsy sample (HE staining) stained lilac blue naked eye, mucous membrane,outdoor of the submucosa were light red light red brawn plus staining of the outer membrane of low observation times of the stomach namely divided into four layers from the inside out .
architecture
one mucosa: from the inside out is divided into three layers. ① epithelium: the epithelium. epithelium forming gastric pits down to depression. among the columnar cells of the nuclear base,at the altitude of the original particles pale cytoplasm filled with sticky transparent stained location clear boundaries between cells. epithelium connective tissue deep to the common architecture of columnar cells with the same tubular architecture system cross-section near the gastric pits. ② intrinsic layer: connective tissue, including blood vessels lymphatic tissue,smooth brawn cells and scattered in a enormous digit of gastric glands. fundic gland mucosa in the gastric pits and between brawn is a lonely tubular glands, glandular crater namely small and intricate to discern mainly along the parietal cells plus primary cells. ③ muscularis mucosa: thin, the interior floor of external longitudinal smooth brawn component 2 2 submucosa: Department of lax connective tissue containing tremendous blood containers lymphatic vessels and submucosal plexus, submucosal plexus along the digit of nerve cells and non-myelinated nerve fibers. visibility No three muscle: thick,indirect line from the inside, in the ring, the external longitudinal flat muscle component four the external membrane: Department of serosa according slack connective tissue between the peel plus the outer surface composition. high-powered observation: gastric glands from the five varieties of gland cells, focusing aboard observation of parietal cells and capital cells an wall cells: gastric glands in the neck and body are more cells are larger,round alternatively triangular,round nuclei,constantly dual-core, the central alive cells. cytoplasmic staining ruddy 2 headmaster cells: quantity, in the gastric glands of the body plus the base more. cells were columnar.circuitous nuclei, located by the base. cytoplasmic staining blue cells at the altitude of the small vacuoles is liquefied due apt Department of zymogen granules 3 cervical mucus cells: a small digit located in the neck. cells were columnar alternatively goblet. flat circuitous alternatively triangular nuclei located by the base. cytoplasmic granules fraught with the original stick four endocrine cells plus stem cells in the HE staining of the specimens is never easy to distinguish the stomach with a four-layer structure: one it can be mucosal divided into the epithelium easy columnar epithelium is the surface mucous cells), lamina propria tin be divided into gastric glands, glands plus pyloric glands spray the door) plus the muscularis mucosa 2); submucosal layer (which namely connective tissue) three The mucous membrane has a thick flat brawn inner oblique outer longitudinal floor of flat brawn in the ring form) 4 The external membrane of the stomach serosa pleasing architecture described as follows: the stomach along the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and adventitia four composition,and nerves, blood containers plus lymphatic distribution.1 gastric mucosa soft, orange live lanes. Empty stomach, when the formation of much folds, filling time-varying flat. Pyloric ring formation by the mucosal folds, protruding into the cavity called the pyloric valve (pyloric valve). Gastric mucosa can be divided into three layers.an epithelium: the epithelium,planned in neat rows,tin excrete mucus covering the surface of the gastric mucosa against gastric acid plus pepsin of the gastric mucosa abuse 2 lamina propria: the connective tissue, which contains a huge numeral of gastric glands, which are cardiac glands (cardiac plus pyloric gland (pyloric gland), gastric glands (fundic gland). Cardiac gland plus pyloric glands are located in the cardia plus pylorus of the lamina propria, mainly excrete mucus. Gastric fundus plus gastric glands are mainly located in the lamina propria of the body,namely to generate the bishop gastric glands. Gastric glands from a diversity of gland cells, primary cells and parietal cells namely the cardinal Down the formation of tubular epithelium of gastric depression by: Main compartment chief compartment also understood because stomach enzyme cells in larger quantities, mainly in the fundus of the media plus lower. Cell body cylindrical,round kernel basophilic cytoplasm, with zymogen granules. Main function is to secrete pepsinogen. Parietal cells (parietal cell also known for hydrochloric acid cells, mainly in the upper chapter of gastric glands. Cells are larger, triangular or circuitous eosinophilic cytoplasm, in the HE staining in ruddy Parietal cells cardinal function is to excrete hydrochloric acid with activation of pepsinogen plus sterilization; while parietal cells also secrete intrinsic factor,tin improve the role of vitamin B12 absorption. Neck mucous cells (mucous neck compartment small number of cells, located in the upper part of gastric glands, parietal cells caught in among Cells were columnar, flat circular kernel located in the compartment base, the aboriginal compartment fraught with sticky particles that excrete mucus. In addition, there are undifferentiated cells of gastric glands and gastric endocrine cells.three muscularis mucosa: the thin floor of smooth brawn,prepared outdoor the internal longitudinal, the dismiss is conducive apt gastric secretions.2 the submucosa from the lax connective tissue containing lymphocytes, mast cells plus nerve plexus, blood vessels and lymphatic containers.3,vigorous stomach muscle developed forward the ramp, Central plus external longitudinal flat brawn ground composition. Among them, the media ring in the pylorus brawn thickening, formation of the pyloric sphincter, a moderate role in dismiss of gastric contents.4 the external membrane is a floor of serous membrane, the mesothelium plus a small amount of connective tissue. Single-chamber stomach classification namely only an organ that maximum mammals,known because solo stomach. Monogastric piglet stomach that namely a typical representative. The shape namely divided into cardia, gastric body and pylorus of three parts. Stomach from the inside out along mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, serosa plus additional accessories. Mucosa along the mucosal epithelium, lamina propria and muscularis mucosa composition; submucosal floor from the connective tissue; brawn particularly thick, divided into three layers. Inner indirect muscle located in the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach; the middle floor of muscle around the longitudinal axis of the stomach into the ring arrangement,entire located in the stomach; prepared in the outer longitudinal brawn located in the greater curvature of the stomach and small curve Complex multi-chamber stomach stomach is uncommon to ruminant stomach, cattle, sheep and other animals, the stomach namely criminal of such structures. From the fashion into the rumen, reticulum, omasum plus abomasum of four parts. The 1st three deformation of the stomach is the esophagus, abomasum gastric body. Complex architecture of the stomach with the stomach for a solo stomach. Muscle floor developed rumen mucosa plus submucosa protruding inward to form horny papillae, papillae densely arranged; network ground of the stomach muscles are more developed, the mucous membrane protruding honeycomb arrangement, also known as honeycomb stomach; omasum plus abomasum brawn floor developed, the mucosa and submucosa flaky folded inward protruding, its short aboard crude beef and fleece As the complicated stomach of meat inside are long hair, so the culinary industry ambition be referred to for And some more scrupulous points,for the most developed rumen of beef and wool to be understood for the longest Duck; reticulum of beef and hair planned in a honeycomb cell because stomach; omasum plus abomasum of the dense folds of said wall Melaleuca belly apt paunch alternatively an hundred. Melaleuca thin layer of brawn belly Function

digestion of food folk dine the soon apt be digested forward gastric nectar Highly acidic gastric drink,but never his own digest namely the hidden In fact gastric nectar in the digestion of food,but also has some abuse aboard the role of the stomach, which caused some cell death. However, because the stomach has a strong talent apt regenerate, so the abuse namely only temporary, the stomach would soon be restored for ever. Department of Medicine University of Michigan Professor of the German research data show that the surface of the stomach per minute apt generate about 50 million modish cells. That namely just three days, it tin be regenerated to a popular stomach. However, gastric nectar in the stomach tissue within a few hours to thaw away, alone generate fashionable cells, had a chance to fully compensate for the losses. Therefore, the ability apt have the job otherwise. Protection aptitude of the second stomach,is covered with a thick floor of the stomach, called gastric epithelial cells. It is in direct contact with the gastric drink so with corrosive gastric nectar can never penetrate apt the inner wall of the stomach. We know that whether the stomach produces too much sour can lead to ulcers. As the gastric mucosa with special protection, it can be mild alternatively only against acid erosion. Gastric nectar namely mainly composed of pepsin and hydrochloric acid Pepsin namely a protein, it is a harmless digestive enzymes. However, hydrochloric sour is different it is extremely corrosive plus can available destroy the stomach cells. Therefore,depend on the regenerative capacity of the stomach plus gastric mucosal protection namely insufficient In gastric epithelial cells covered with a thin height ground of carbohydrates, the so-called sugar body floor It can beyond enhance the protection of the stomach. In addition, the internal layer in the stomach, also covered onward a ground composed of fatty substances called lipids in the body of the material. Hydrochloric sour of such substances aboard the hydrogen ions and chloride ions, has a strong impediment, which is the third stomach to protect their uncommon skills. In recent annuals scientists have bottom that gastric epithelial cells continue to synthesize plus release of endogenous prostaglandins, gastrointestinal mucosa, it has a significant protective accomplish In addition,apt testify that the gastrointestinal tract is the body&apos;s largest endocrine organ that secretes a popular hormone both peptides). Maintenance treatment of gastric disease commonly understood as stomach, generally refers apt gastritis and gastric plus duodenal ulcer disease. Gastritis namely a common term for inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Frequently occurs in 40 apt 50 years old more men than women. Cause stomach for many reasons, including genetic, environmental,edible,pills bacterial infections,and smoking,redundant drinking tin occasion How to treat stomach? [What are the omens of stomach] tin be quite mild omens of gastritis can also be very cumbersome the most common are upper abdominal discomfort alternatively pain nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,detriment of appetite. Symptoms of gastric and duodenal ulcers,likened with burning ache in upper abdomen especially in among meals, breakfast alternatively drinking orange drink coffee alternatively aspirin after the zone In caustic cases, it may have tar,African stools alternatively bloody stools. [How apt treat stomach] attention apt the common treatment of the patient&apos;s stomach, such for the everyday customary of the system and a reasonable diet, moderate vacation smoking plus brandy consumption, coffee and tea namely disabled. At the same time,ought depress the acid levels and strengthen direct contact with the gastric mucous floor of protection. Usually the application of non-prescription pills including antacid agents plus gastric mucosal protective agent,and adapted use of antispasmodic agents. Stomach Jichi Symptoms of the disease 1 pain This is the maximum common symptoms of stomach. Cause hurt as many reasons, the performance of complicated forms. Causes include exposure apt chilly qi stagnation, blood stasis, showing the form of rankle tingling, cramps.two inflatable. This namely the maximum common symptoms of stomach. If the spleen plus stomach dereliction of obligation,alternatively blocked deserving apt cold,alternatively additional factors,can lead to stomach gas tin never be timely,not be properly expelled leading apt flatulence.three food inflation. Due to a diversity of factors, the stomach tin not digest edible properly,or also slow alternatively gastrointestinal motility,can guide apt edible inflation.four tongue pale and tasteless. Chinese medicine theory, the spleen opens into the mouth,if trapped spleen, spleen,alternatively other causes,want guide to the mouth of patients do never know taste,not appetite edible 5 I undergo This is the heat generated by the typical omens of liver and gallbladder,namely courage on the pan&apos;s performance.

Codonopsis deficiency blood and liquid Jujube tin stomach the blood plus nourish strong. Interpretation of Chinese antibiotic are argued Stomach stomach-like fashion of buckling, there namely greater curvature lesser curvature. Ancient medical paperbacks aboard the stomach size,form position plus weight have been documented. Such because : apt 40 cm. Zhou&apos;s two feet six inches,alternatively nearly fifty-two centimeters, the number seems large than this,yet approximately the same, that the ancients is the outcome of substantial observation plus measurement. Ming Li, l,and linger the same applies. the tremendous intestine, stomach, small intestine, referred apt because Stomach Meridian (Meridian) and spleen meridians every network namely apt form table relations. Therefore,one The main stomach satisfied along the decomposition of water valley Water Valley. Mizutani, that edible material. Receiving the cardinal stomach,is the stomach in the absorbent tract has apt adopt and adapt the role of dietary compounds. Intake of dietary compounds,1st through the jaws by chewing and mixing tongue, swallowing the epiglottis from the esophagus into the stomach. The stomach namely satisfied,never only to adapt it also means active intake, also known because The stomach namely capable apt take the initiative apt sodium intake is dependent aboard the role of Wei Qi, Wei Qi cardinal pass down, down apt diet,edible,under the stomach blank the stomach namely vacant tin be diet, it gives rise to detriment of appetite. Eating population,through the esophagus, the stomach skill so the stomach namely called The stomach to accommodate the amount of water the valley, in the Maturity,is the initial gastric digestion of food material, forming a After receiving the stomach Mizutani, relying aboard the role of the stomach of the decomposition, the initial digestion, water valley into chyme, transfer more easily preoccupied into the state. Chyme,backward passing the small intestine, in the role of the spleen, the refined material is preoccupied metaplasia of blood, nutrition, body. Therefore, the stomach is called Receiving the stomach, decomposition dysfunction,one fewer than satisfied along the decomposition, such for Wei Qi disabled,or Wei Qi did not fall,even if blank stomach,no appetite,alternatively epigastric pain behind eating, ai deteriorate smell edible alternatively behind eating vomiting; First, sodium intake maturity too such because stomach Huo, consumption Valley down too fast,starve soon backward eating Yushi. Satisfied according the decomposition function of the stomach,although the beginning of the absorbent process,but it namely quite important, because the stomach satisfied by the decomposition,namely fraught onward the small intestine plus spleen transport of compounds prerequisite. Blood and body liquids of human sperm production, direct from the edible material,and because the water of the ocean valley of the stomach,aspiration chance the source of qi and blood. Therefore, stomach, the water of the sea valley, six inner organs are also great sources. Gomi entrance, hidden in the stomach,to reserve the five internal organs are organs of gas ... ... smell, are out of the stomach. source of nutrition. Therefore, stomach satisfied along the decomposition strong the body&apos;s blood-based sources are sufficient; the contrary, the absence of sources. Therefore, the The stomach is satisfied according the decomposition of water main function of the valley,plus the spleen must match function, in order to acquaint grain into infinitesimal water, blood plus body liquids apt metaplasia,apt support the body, maintain the body&apos;s life activities. Such for 2 Pass down amongst the cardinal stomach namely smooth Down is down. Food material through the esophagus into the stomach, the stomach satisfied forward the decomposition plus afterwards pass below the small intestine, in the process, the stomach must be reserved open state in order apt acquaint the flat scampering of dietary compounds. Maintain the Stomach penalty is represented onward Pass,to drop; down, in order to maintain communication. If never pass, it is impossible apt drop; the additional hand,if you do not fall, it want never pass. In other words,namely every additional through plus down the conditions, reinforce each additional Therefore, the normal function of the stomach,constantly Pass down the cardinal stomach, spleen Shengqing associative terms, it is down and filthy Cloud, this means eating cereal, such because the The cardinal stomach down plus filthy mainly refers to the initial digestion of the stomach chyme,underneath the impetus of the Stomach and intestinal ebb Loss amongst the stomach down,namely the pathological state. If the Wei Qi disabled inability to transfer,reason edible stagnation stomach, resulting in epigastric ache fullness,dine fewer embolism; if the Stomach did not fall, even the Shang Ni, resulting in epigastric fullness, belching, hiccups, vomiting embolism . Doctrine in the viscera, the spleen plus stomach often down to hug the plenary permeable system of functional activities. Stomach&apos;s pass down the role,not only performing aboard the stomach itself,but for the entire six inner organs of the absorbent system have a significant clash aboard functional status, so that the performance of six internal organs are characteristic as the pass down. Stomach plus additional organs, a General plus all instructions a drip namely Jiexiang. In Chinese antibiotic food residue on the small intestine will pass underneath the colossal intestine,and huge intestine mass of dross of functional activities,but also pass down with the stomach apt summarize, the constipation is also included in the detriment of the stomach pass down the disease. Therefore, the stomach of the pass down, summarizes the Stomach and the residue down the chyme conveyed to the small intestine,huge intestine and enhance the fecal excretion plus other physiological processes.three stomach favor wrong dry flee also. The stomach namely satisfied forward the decomposition of water main physiological functions of the valley, in addition apt promoting Stomach, inviting accomplish but also need apt gastric nectar (yin) and moisten nourish, its function to normal. Food into the stomach, gastric nectar aspiration rely aboard impregnation and decomposition; whether the absence of gastric nectar hard to saturate into the corrode that may occasion indigestion Zhu Zheng. From the stomach satisfied according the decomposition dysfunction clinical performance,deserving apt stomach deficiency Erzhi who are constantly easy apt perceive especially in chronic atrophic gastritis is more prominent The stomach is deserving apt dry soil, water does not saturate Yin much reasons leading apt the stomach,quantity it entire up not more than exogenous,internal injuries two aspects. Exogenous aspects apt summer,hot dry as the main malign Heat injury,extravagant sweating,can pillage the stomach yin; tepid Evils attack tin be instantly fumigation of stomach yin; consumption of flaming peppery you actually bare stomach Tianjin. In inner injuries, the body Yin alternatively factors,lack of body fluid; alternatively because of Yangming Heat,blaze stomach fluid; alternatively because of stagnation of the flame Fan Wei Shangyin; alternatively because of chronic ailment postpartum, go beyond in person, chi burned; and mistakenly applied sweat, spit, logic,abuse Stomach Yin. For all these reasons, vaginal injuries robbed liquid resulted no longer stomach yin. The clinical manifestations of stomach Yin: Shezao throat, dry jaws thirst,dine fewer sodium,alternatively swelling of the liver namely not fantastic edible,or no appetite,mouth sallow blunt swallowing negative, vomiting, hiccups,alternatively retching, epigastric rankle noisy, uncomfortable, dry stool, emaciation, Shenpi fatigue, light ruddy tongue, a small chin or ruddy cracks, pulse a few thin strings,alternatively the collapse of weak embolism. According apt the stomach prefer soft features, the treatment of stomach, gamping alternatively Ganliang moisten the Yin, the body fluid apt re-make just carry aboard amongst the fall. In addition, liver qi stagnation, tribulations Fan Wei, Yang Wei ought Shugan, reuse peony, sparse in soft,sour and sweet shade; stagnation of the flame robbed Shang Wei Yin, Xin-bitter drip should not be too much, with Adenophora , Radix has Xiehuo Rougan Stomach achievements. And Zhongjing dry malign four folk to Stomach-oriented from the Jin Li Gao that one the primary concept of Wei Qi in Chinese antibiotic the Such for refers apt the stomach&apos;s digestive function. Stomach is the role. Thus, Third, referring to the spleen and stomach function in a reflection aboard the pulse, that pulse with lull gentle elephant. it with Wei Qi,one and two, two plus one who is the yang of the intrinsic nature of the stomach, husband still peppery smoke of flame also. gas the Stomach-oriented,folk covered onward the Water Valley gas to health, the so-called clean air Rong Qi, Wei Qi, Chun-sheng of the gas, are also another name as Stomach. Qi, Wei Qi, germinal Zhu Yang gas, the six who are eating into the stomach, Valley gas upstream, Stomach vary assign in fact,an can who is simply stressed stomach digestion plus absorption of water, grain refined importance of the role.an inner organs, a transport a sodium, a ascend and fall, coordinate affix apt complete the digestion of edible material,sly material absorption process, so , Yan flavors out. Therefore, a medical traceability of organs, ping who meteorological theory, The stomach is a sea of ​​blood Mizutani,plus lungs,inner organs,start with disappointment. out of the internal organs of smell are the stomach. the judgment of life and death Nishun pulse card seven volumes of the spleen plus stomach Water Valley apt support Non core and blood,no body apt establish the base; non-water Valley,not set form of the strong. ... This is the valley of the ocean water depends aboard whom the cardinal innate,merely excellent sea of ​​blood, whom they have to depend on the daytime after tomorrow capital. the antagonist of the self apt the age where there is not enough innate,but have obtained the power of civilization the power of the Sky, also household of their strong plus a half. This stomach of the gas on the human body are not small. function plus diet nutrition is important apt human life plus health, so the words are into the stomach,inner organs are intrinsic gas in the stomach. ... ... it does not enter the valley, half-day atmosphere is bad,afterwards the gas daytime fewer carry aboard The theory stomach of the gas without injury,and afterwards to nourish their strength; if the Stomach of the feeble since the times of eating,afterwards either the spleen and stomach injuries,and strength tin not be filled the students also escape along assorted diseases. stomach, riddled according students metaplasia passive, emaciation, organs are wrong absence of justice malign and illness susceptibility,because said: degree of machine often missing,and amuse has been procured angry, fresh Sapporo pepole who die prematurely have not diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the significance of the five interior organs Ju Sheng, Wei Qi ebb the five internal organs entire wrong Stomach examination shows the climb plus fall,is the medical consultation of the outline,assistance determine priorities plus prognosis of the disease, such for police watch Wei Qi Wang,kernel also Qi Jing,brittle Shenpi, ignoring the see sick multiple. Another instance is seeing tongue police Stomach, Stomach The tongue namely suffocating, tongue alternatively absence, may reflect the survival of Stomach. thin white tongue coating plus humid is Stomach strong performance; tongue without coating of light for the stomach qi, yin alternatively stomach abuse performance. Another example namely to ask the police Stomach Diet, in the disease process, changes in edible intake of patients namely a direct reflection of the success alternatively failure Stomach plus whether edible intake diminished the blood biochemical athletic suggesting that mild disease, has never been marred and Stomach; appetite increasing along a mini,then gradually resume that Wei Qi, disease tends to amend the prognosis is good; whether loss of appetite, decreasing edible intake, indicating Stomach recession, worsening the disease, the prognosis much worse; If the patient does never enter the water slurry, said Wei Qi ebb the prognosis is much more dangerous.and whereupon Guide to Medical do not dine Although the potential extension of light want cause screenplay This truth namely also straightforward language folk also. treatment of diseases affecting the strength of the gas, such as filthy are numb, so many men aboard the disease.all wealth born from the world,yet also from the soil and return,whether the spleen and kidney are never called also.remedy diseases,discover a spleen and those much more.must be scrutinized Stomach; who paucity treatment,have to constantly attention Stomach. Stomach lossless,entire tin be OK said: Stomach, Canadian consumer adviser plus other narcotics inside plus outdoor the assorted diseases apt be cast among those who contradict with the Stomach, none ought be accustom with caution. , diet regulated. someone tin not control their diet, met on Mengchi palatable meal does not taste of the repast hungry so easily navigate to gastric motility disorders, thereby enabling the vagus nerve plus the nerve surrounded the stomach Cong hyperthyroidism,enhance the secretion of gastric nectar over duration there longing be gastritis alternatively gastric ulcer.

In addition, patients usually can never stomach apt dine snacks, otherwise it would counting gastric motility,plus enhance gastric acid secretion, aggravation of gastric ulcers. Second,disburse attention to edible hygiene.repast must ponder over the slow pharynx the edible in the jaws full of grinding mowed and mixed with saliva, which tin reduce the burden on the stomach, the food easier to digest In addition, eating spicy foods should be lessened not drinking plus smoking. tobacco and liquor are very disadvantageous apt the stomach. Tobacco The stimulating accomplish of nicotine aboard the stomach, the stomach contents it ambition discharge delay and thus lead to increased gastric sour secretion, causing gastritis, peptic ulcer exacerbations. drinking, especially drinking on an blank stomach in patients with gastric damage is even greater, because the brandy of ethanol on the gastric mucosa has a quite enormous incentive stomach irritation occurs behind a strong abbreviation expansion and additional sports,namely quite likely to cause stomach bleeding or ulcer perforation site, resulting in danger again dine less of the gastric irritant narcotics long-term use of gastric irritant pills such because erythromycin, prednisone, etc.can occasion gastric mucosal injury plus inflammation alternatively ulcers, so do not take long-term irritation of the stomach narcotics such for occasionally eat these drugs ought also dine a repast,if conditions allow, the best use of Chinese herbal medicine have the same accomplish Fourth,apt maintain a cheerful and the stomach is healthy plus has a lot apt psychological factors.undue mental stimulation, such as long-term accent dread sadness depression,and this longing adviser to cortical dysfunction, promotion of the vagus nerve dysfunction, spastic abbreviation of blood containers leading to the stomach,plus then induced gastritis, gastric ulcer.

 Truly Outrageous: Cybill Shepherd On Shoulder Pads


If you loved the 80s as much as we did the first time around, you&apos;re in luck--we&apos;ve got an interview with a different style icon from the decade of excess every day for the next week! And if you&apos;re too young to remember it, consider this your crash course. Susan sat down with the Bangles to talk bangles yesterday, and now we&apos;ve got the ever-fabulous Cybill Shepherd dishing on one of fall&apos;s biggest trends--shoulder pads! Let her talk you into loving this power look, after the jump.


Cybill is bona fide Hollywood royalty, from her first appearance on-screen in 1971&apos;s The Last Picture Show to her recent stint on The L Word and a slew of movies due out next year. But my favorite memory of her will always be as top-model-turned-private-detective Maddie Hayes, who spied on cheating husbands and uncovered dead bodies--almost always while wearing serious shoulder pads--on Moonlighting. In an era where a woman&apos;s power was defined by how broad her wingspan was, Cybill was queen bee.



STF: So, in case you haven&apos;t heard http://www.swarovskicz.com , shoulder pads are back! Be honest, does that make you want to cringe or celebrate?

CYBILL: Shoulder pads can be one of the most disastrous looks possible! But when they&apos;re done right, they can also be gorgeous. I used to have this Yves Saint Laurent tuxedo with a short jacket and really broad shoulders and a wide collar, and it sounds scary but it was just cut so beautifully. I love it because it’s a very powerful look. It takes up space, I mean a woman really looks powerful in it--she takes up physical space!

STF: Your character on Moonlighting was rarely without that major shoulder moment. Did you have a say in the wardrobe on the show? Were you interested in what they dressed you in? And were you pro-pad back then?

CYBILL: I was very interested in it. I wanted to always make sure I had a waist http://www.schuheonlinedeutschland.com , because with my broad shoulders and my broad butt, I always felt like with a waist it was a much more flattering look. I always wore belts, and always wore these jackets that didn’t go all the way down to the hemline. If you want to wear shoulder pads, you&apos;ve gotta show that waist.



Cybil Shepherd http://www.ferragamocalzature.org , left, in the Moonlighting days, and a look from the Louis Vuitton fall 2009 runway, right. Check out the full collection at style.com

STF: Did you have a chance to give some input to the costume designer?

CYBILL: Robert Turturice did the costumes, and I would consult with him about every appearance I had. He was brilliant. Once you&apos;ve worked with someone like Robert, it&apos;s hard to work with anyone who&apos;s not as brilliant. He just really captured that Rosalind Russell look, the severe silhouette that harkens back to the 40s.

STF: So you don&apos;t think this&apos;09 revival of the shoulder pad is the first time we&apos;ve seen it recycled?

CYBILL: Oh no, it goes back much further than the 80s. It&apos;s the look from screwball comedy! In fact, when we were working on the show I suggested we all watch Bringing Up Baby with Cary Grant and My Man Godfrey to really get a feel for the time. It wasn&apos;t that new then http://www.belstaffjackenwien.com , either.



STF: Did you save any of those clothes from the Moonlighting days? Are you ready to bust them out again?

CYBILL: I have to say I deeply regret the fact that I had an opportunity to take a bunch of costumes and put them in storage but I never did. I had three kids, and I never got around to it.

STF: What a bummer http://www.ralphlaurendoudounefr.com ! Do you think you would have worn any of those strong-shouldered jackets and dresses again if you still had them?

CYBILL: I keep very few things, because I don’t want a lot of stuff, and it’s taken me many years to realize,&quot;if I’m not wearing something, pass it on.&quot;But there are a few things that I will never let go--one is an Armani suit http://www.gucciscarpeoutlet.com , actually I have three of these suits and they&apos;re black with a great thin pinstripe and the jackets are absolutely out of the 40s with big shoulders and cinched waists and I will wear them forever.

STF: So, is it safe to say you&apos;re embracing the return of the shoulder pad? No guilty feelings about the role you played in its prominence in the 80s and its revival now?

CYBILL: It’s great to see something old come back new again. It just makes fashion fun, and it’s nice that you’re not wearing the same old thing all the time!

So tell me dolls...has Cybill convinced you that shoulder pads can be cool again? Did you love her look from the Moonlighting days? And are you ready to embrace the 80s once more? Discuss http://www.themulberrybags.com !

 For this recipe, I used jam sugar, which is used in the ratio of 3 parts fruit to 1 part sugar. By using jam sugar, you can substantially cut down the amount of sugar you need for jam, (...) , resulting in a fruitier, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , healthier jam. The added pectin in the sugar allows the jam to set more quickly, so you do not need to overcook the fruit. This means the fruit flavour is not killed by heat or excess sugar. However, I don’t think jam with this little sugar lasts too long, but I can’t tell you how long it will store, as mine disappears very quickly.






Beyond Nurnberg’s Walls
Is a walnut tree
And a plum that neighbours
A blackberry
Whose fruit lie sweet
Amongst the thorns
A reminder for history
Which still yet mourns
That joy can come
From where there is pain
And though winter’s long
There’ll be spring again






This blog may not be the best venue where a budding young poet such as myself should be expressing himself, but I could not help but share my feelings when visiting Nurnberg for my brother’s wedding. As it once was the centre of Nazi Germany, I don’t want to delve into the history of this beautiful city, since poetry, (...) , politics and pastries don’t mix. Instead, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , I just want to encourage you to go there, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , when it’s blackberry season.






Put a plate in the freezer. Crush blackberries and stir with sugar and lemon rind in a pot and place on medium heat. You can add lemon juice if you feel it needs it, but tate it first. Crushing also becomes easier when the berries get warmer. Bring to boil, stirring the mixture. After around 10 minutes, get that plate out of the freezer and put a spoon of the jam on the plate. This is a good trick to see if the jam has set. If the jam doesn’t appear runny, and you can draw a clean line with your finger across the jam, it’s all good and ready. Pour into your sanitised jars, and the jam is ready to eat once the jars cool down.






As my poem suggests, a bike path led me to the outskirts of the city, where I happened upon a wild blackberry bush. The berries were sweet and just slightly sour, bursting with color and flavour. After having my fill, and more, (...) , of fresh blackberries, (...) , I decided to make some blackberry jam, as a gift that I would leave to my kind hosts.




yum, (...) !!!

 often hear the doctor&apos;s patients, said: recent sex life flies well http://www.thenorthfacecoats.co.uk , because the children are on vacation, and fights it. It was also said that the last quiet place to vacation, feel good sex life. Seen in this light, the sound is affected not underestimate the sexual life of a factor.



Moaning and screaming in the process of sex, some women are often given different levels, a variety of moans or cries, as some people describe as forced tight throat groans, while others are described as a kinds of non-stop moaning, and some people describe as cock, also described as torture, and more people with some

Do not help by the process of this sound http://www.nikefreetilbuddk.com , it should be said is difficult to use language to express. Generally believed that it is a sex voice, which is the The Japanese use the This calls for some men cling to the attitude of joy, and the size of the sound level of excitement or pleasure as a women&apos;s criteria. Such groans of men openly expressed resentment is minimal. And most men will be issued because of their partner&apos;s sexual satisfaction groans proud. But there are many men secretly whispered in my heart: only heard or seen (A-level film) a prostitute or adulteress will coquettish Langjiao, correct female character how it will be called out? This is a wrong idea, or it may be a bias or a lack of common sense. Couples during sex so groan, coming entirely in orgasm pleasure arising due to, is a natural physiological reaction exposed.

Physiologically speaking, women in the sex groan for two reasons. On the one hand as close to or reach orgasm, the blood oxygen content is reduced. At this time, because women will fall into a minor state of hypoxia showed absence eyes, blurred vision, mild cramps and a series of so-called body Reduction in blood oxygen content http://www.belstaffcazadora.com , the relative increase in carbon dioxide will, therefore http://www.cheapcrystalsale.com , breathing is bound to accelerate, speed up breathing a disorder, it will naturally feel unique to orgasm moan. On the other hand is close to orgasm, the female brain&apos;s Already know that it makes sense but fuzzy, does not relieve the brain inhibition. This role would dilute the female intellect, even issuing their own calls are unimaginable. Some women had for themselves whether to issue a groan, and afterwards are even ignorant.

Wonderful music melody music as the role of induced sex couples desire more and more people have been widely recognized and utilized. Affect our emotional response in a number of factors, the music plays an important position ---
most couples should have the memory of love, romantic music period, those melodies indelibly deep in their hearts. These romantic music, romantic melodies like a woven tapestry of color lines, will install them as crazy as the Magpie Bridge drunk meet the happy couple and romance weaving Ming. Unfortunately, once people get married, have a

In the living room, accompanied by only a couple dance music CDs, or indulge in pillow quilt embracing both the world of music, VCD disc players in a gentle and elegant or graceful, or touching or soothing or loud intoxicated or unrestrained or warm music, lower the volume, sound is now hidden, Ruoyouruowu, that&apos;s wonderful mood music from the circumflex melody, chord development, and the pace of the ups and downs http://www.mulberrysbags.co.uk , or the memory associated with the music , especially over the period by the husband and wife share a passion rising music will stimulate vitality. Some people say they love the most are willing to describe the natural beauty of music to listen to, hear it, as if walking in the sea http://www.guccigoedkope.com , forest, hills, and I feel it will become very comfortable.

the long run if the couple do not work together to foster and support the flower of romance, then it will wither and die. Many couples overlook a romantic scene and sound, making their marriage has become boring, monotonous, boring, spend a romantic day wither. For them, love the melody, the music of life, but courtship is a period of romantic boat.

Catalyst carefully pondering what language is, to do every couple made love in the process will be more or less warm or elegant or romantic, or obsession, or to say some of the private houses, these private houses, then, is the provocative sex flirting language, it not only to arouse each other&apos;s sexual awakening, go all out to mobilize both the Chi-sex love, but also a sexual maturity. However, many couples regret the lack of the language of communication, they avoid the topic of sex, but refused to exchange and discuss sexual feelings.
&lt;FONT Style=Of course, some couples sex life is severely poor vocabulary, so husbands can not be the appropriate word to talk about sex with his wife&apos;s feelings. Many wives are subject to traditional ideas of love in the process of sexual feelings in silence. Between the sexes which makes a fantastic, sweet, happy fusion becomes step by step, tedious, repetitive or even rigid physical mechanical movement.

Have a healthy sex life for the attitude of his wife, when talking about sex with her husband, she does not care about his use of the word, nor is there a sense of being offended, she only knew that he expressed to her sex , full of love and passion the two men both love to stimulate sexual desire, she will also be the same way the freedom to express her sexual feelings. For example, the process of sex clumsy operation, improper, heart manic panic husband, wife having sex when his soft words lightly: sex can be the actual pleasure and requirements, childish way, Therefore, any pursuit of a harmonious sexual life happy wife must not be

Discordant noise with a man named Marina&apos;s Miss America, had secretly told of her first orgasm physician&apos;s experience with: If someone walked up and down outside, I would suspect others peek or eavesdropping. If happiness is about to reach climax of the moment he heard voices outside, and I will be happy climax in one second to fall down but when I was unaffected by interference, I will have two or three times the climax of the experience of pleasure, and sweet sleep. , may cause serious men have psychogenic impotence, women have vaginismus.

&lt;FONT Style=Some couples even if the lightning Ray Ming voices can still mesmerized Most couples having sex indoors, and for this kind of environment we are familiar, but familiarity does not mean perfect. Less well-off family conditions such as sleep a couple of beds is not high, while more afraid of it non-stop

Some noise that we can not predict and suppression. Such as the romantic couple, regardless of day or night, whenever there is a strong desire, they seize the opportunity to act in a timely manner. Do not want to, rang out suddenly http://www.baratasbotas.com , the.

No noise sex environment does not exist, which we need to work hard to fight. Such as sex before you check on the room door did not - so as not to rush into without the knowledge of outsiders; try to enhance the room&apos;s acoustic performance, do not let outsiders hear the house movement, and so on. Only in this minimal noise environment couples dared to enjoy the performance of their passion.

Children were young couples, it is impossible to love your child to sleep alone, if they want to make love, even though children are not sensible, but his presence is likely to be a psychological wake up. If this happens, it is best first to determine whether the child was asleep, if they go into deep sleep stage, is unlikely to wake up, the couple can safely have sex. If you still do not trust, then, something can also be used to temporarily separated from their children.

In short, the nature of daily life will be as colorful as in the whole process of sex, marital completely natural, relaxed play, a variety of natural language will increase the couple&apos;s sexual pleasure.

these names on the tombstones, is a European Hing engraved word for word, even this whole mausoleums, are the elderly at their own expense to spend more than 100 million yuan to build, not only that, he also waiting here for nearly 30 years.
cemetery is located in Anhui Province Guzhen Ren Qiaozhen cool village, where remoteness, took 40 minutes, through the large green wheat fields, in order to ride, and then shake the car&apos;s 50 minutes to into the county.
this did not spend a penny of the 20 acres of the financial martyrs cemetery, not in the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 114 directory assistance not find it, post office the postman never been here. The only communication with the outside world the elderly, is a signal or bad, or often arrears down the phone.
the old man&apos;s eyes, the way place the land, but it is During the war, here is an important transport hub, 14-year-old joined the revolution, had been the instrument of General Zhang Aiping, served as staff officer, Major Chiefs of Staff, Chief of the Central Military Commission first shot of the school administration and other staff of the European Hing, who witnessed More than 2400 New Fourth Army to protect the arteries and blood of this sacrifice. The most heroic time, 60 soldiers to fight hundreds of Japanese, the battle day and night, and finally gunned all killed, the blood of the soldiers next to the Da River is dyed red.
After the war, Europe Hing&apos;s unit, the village has been built in the cool Japanese Martyrs Huaibei west gate, destroyed after the Huaihai Campaign during the war. To the 1980s, retired elderly, began to rebuild the cemetery.
cemetery can not say what the beauty of the design. Although the gate carved with flowers spent more than ten million, he designed the monument is a triangle, mark the places spiritual meaning, Reiho, places pregnant three counties martyrs. May have been to most of the people here believe that the old cemetery, desolate,
can stand as long as the old comrades of the mound every morning, he felt that the past 30 years, to spend all our energy and money are worth it.
these graves are not in the beginning, all over the old one moved. Some of the descendants of the martyrs to convince the elderly to move here. He has done much to find some of the
each to his comrades, firecrackers, chattering away to his comrades,
clear that no one explained this to enjoy the division-level treatment of the elderly retired cadres, there are six-seven thousand one month&apos;s wages, and why the city stood a good day, however, here as

, who will sacrifice his comrades to the grave keeper. As I promised, you have to do it.
then a commitment to the elderly, after almost half a lifetime to use the entire practice.
let these souls of Reconstruction of the cemetery, (...) , many people come to him crying, . Some descendants, knowing that their parents died in the Da river, dead but not dead, dug in the river mud squeeze a small child who, packed in a coffin buried.
these things are determined to promote the European Hing: hard to have to build the cemetery to commemorate the more than 2,400 souls of this.
early cemetery was built, he and his wife live in shacks on barren land take two years, water barrier, on the point of kerosene lamps, wells, water every day to fetch water to pick 60 of more than 2,000 pine and cypress trees.
leveling to be able to find the remains of the martyrs, he spent more than two years, five day cycling 60 km traveled to all three county towns, and some families do not have descendants of martyrs, Some of the government are not registered into the file disappeared. He experienced difficulties, back and forth to implement. Finally, more than 2,400 recorded list, one by one into the file.
sometimes in order to find a grave, he was going to a lot of times, dark and slippery, many fell in the ditch. Others when he is telling, wild doctor, For those who do not recover as martyrs into the book, he opened a letter of introduction to the relevant department, suffered a supercilious:&gt;
order to finance the construction of the cemetery, the elderly four to Beijing, to the six provinces
European Hing in these old comrades fought straight to the point: no one to see who gives you 500, you look to it! Old leaders have come up with a sum of each person not a small number. General Zhang Aiping Hing to Europe during the war used a coarse quilt, a special exhibition hall for the cemetery the title word. General Zhang Zhen, donated 50 years ago used a whip.
alms to a 13 million Euro Hing also their life savings and all of the monthly wages of 6,000 yuan into the whole ride. Many difficulties can still follow.
Businessmen think that this is something the public sector, 45 cars sold for the elderly poor-quality brick, substandard construction quality, the water will pull the elderly, the elderly have been rejected, (...) , blaming the elderly is an old liar, but also with underworld to threaten the elderly. Some companies give rebates obvious to the elderly, The Some villagers do weddings and funerals, swaggering under the eyes away from the old brick two vehicles. European Hing four chasing The villagers said: Relations were strained to the village people to plug the intersection, not to feed the elderly.
most difficult when the old man walking on the road, not a care for him. Some villagers pointed to the old man said: You&apos;re old man is dead, I do not give you burn a piece of paper. His wife also yell: here it does not go up. Finally his wife not to anger the elderly cook. Grandchildren also complained: Grandpa insult for no reason by these grievances, it is

city children who do not understand him, and said he was Over the years, he did not leave any younger, In the children&apos;s employment, the issue of joining the army, he refused to use their Son of angry laid-off, he hated him, for many years without saying a word with the elderly.
his wife&apos;s death, his sons and daughters in the cemetery residence forced open the lock, he moved back to town clothes quilt, I hope he enjoyed a few years back to the city blessing, the day of the elderly can be stubborn back to the cemetery. He said: He will not die away.
life of the elderly is extremely simple, only one house of home appliances and a fridge can not receive TV signals, he ate bread dipped in chili sauce all year round. Him out of a thread of wool vest is 20 years ago, the pants have more than 10 years, the only stylish hat that looks like Chinese, Chinese New Year this year,
now, the elderly are bent, busy types of peppers and eggplant, vegetable too expensive, he said, the money saved can be engraved on a monument of many.

 Grant93718   [Nov 10, 2011 at 07:38 AM] 
 1.The death penalty was already falling into disuse in the United States when the Supreme Court ended it in 1972. There had been no executions for five years. Death houses were still filled with candidates, but the old zest for sending convicts to the gallows, the chair, and the gas chamber seemed to have waned. State governors, whose duties include the macabre obligation to sign death warrants, were increasingly finding reasons to commute capital sentences to life imprisonment or to grant extended delays of execution. What Justice Harry Blackmun called the “machinery of death” had come to a slow idle.
Then something happened. By the middle of the 1970s there was a rising public clamor for capital punishment. Politicians were discovering that pledges to be “tough on crime” worked like catnip on voters, and who could be “tougher” than the candidate howling for the death penalty? Mr. Dooley was not joking when he said the Supreme Court follows the election returns; by 1976 it had decided that capital punishment was not “cruel and unusual” after all; executioners came back to work.
Nowadays American devotion to capital punishment is such that only the most foolhardy governor would dare confess that signing a death warrant doesn’t make him sleep better. Periodically congressmen call attention to their “toughness” by discovering more federal crimes that require capital punishment. Periodically politicians denounce the entire legal system for making it hard to clear out the death houses with dispatch. Recently a Missouri man nominated for a federal judgeship was blocked by his state’s Republican senator, John Ashcroft, because of a “poor record on the death penalty.”

Professor McFeely, the biographer of Frederick Douglass and General Grant, found himself performing in this Grand Guignol when he was asked to testify in the Georgia sentencing trial of a man convicted of kidnapping, rape, and murder. A distinguished historian, McFeely had been opposed to the death penalty on philosophical grounds, but “proximity” to a man very likely to die in the electric chair seems to have produced an emotional loathing for it.


Advertisement

His short book is a tribute to the Southern Center for Human Rights, a small band of lawyers based in Atlanta, and especially to Stephen Bright, who is not their leader but the “first among equals.” Their goal is to save clients from “the ultimate expression of violence,” which, in McFeely’s phrase, is “the state killing its own people.” Because of work like theirs, years often elapse nowadays before a court’s sentence of death is carried out. The average time between conviction and execution in Georgia is over eight years. One of the center’s clients whom McFeely met was still in prison eighteen years after being sentenced, and his case still in court on appeal.
Bright and his colleagues are people whom the steamier proponents of capital punishment love to hate: lawyers who use what Senator Orrin Hatch calls “frivolous appeals” to impede swift exaction of the state’s “awful vengeance.” Why do they do it? Not for money. No one in the group is paid more than $23,000 a year. And few jobs can be grimmer; this one often ends with a lawyer attending his client’s execution.
McFeely finds the answer in a courtroom confrontation between Stephen Bright, arguing for the life of one Carzell Moore http://www.cheapshoessaleuk.info , and Tommy K. Floyd, a district attorney, arguing for Moore’s execution:
They stand as exemplars of two fundamentally different philosophical positions on the death penalty. Bright and Floyd guard gates��of different cities.

Carzell Moore has been convicted for an act so terrible that neither guardian would lightly allow this man the freedom of his city’s streets. One, to sustain the city, would use the law’s authority to banish from life a being no longer within his concept of human; the other would claim that no person is ever wholly outside the city’s wall. Though Moore has raped and murdered��has sacked his own city��he is, to Stephen Bright, still of its people. For the authorities of that city, for its citizens, to match his act of killing with a killing, to deny even him life, is for the city to lose its very civility.

Here is the debate in its classic terms: Is the death penalty essential to preserve a civilized society, or is it a relic of barbarity mocking society’s claim to be civilized? Bright’s group acts on the principle that no crime, no matter how monstrous, can justify a civilized people in killing its perpetrator. It is a lonely position these days. McFeely concludes that Justice Antonin Scalia came closer to speaking the popular mind when he “forthrightly advocated retribution as a proper motivation for the death penalty.”

This enthusiasm for capital punishment is not easily explained. It flourishes at a moment when most other industrial nations have turned against it. Today it is either abolished or in disuse throughout Western Europe, in most of the former Eastern European Communist bloc countries, and in Russia. Israel, since its founding, has used it only once, with the hanging of Adolf Eichmann. The modern industrial world seems to have abandoned it out of some embarrassed sense that it is a barbaric vestige of an archaic culture. Professor McFeely is hard pressed to explain why the United States, “with its claim to moral leadership of the world,” has gone in precisely the opposite direction. Our “vigorous use of the death penalty http://www.uggsbootssale-uk.info ,” he notes, puts us “in company with Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.”He examines several theories about why Americans are now so fond of it. One holds that the United States is so singularly infested with criminals that an exasperated public demands Draconian measures for self-protection. This appetite is whetted by local television news shows saturated with crime stories and by the spectacular nature of terrorist crimes like the bombings of Oklahoma City’s federal office building and New York’s World Trade Center.
There is great political mileage to be had from exploiting these public passions; hence the politicians’ incessant campaign promises to be “tough on crime.” Hence when elected they vote for ever “tougher” punishments: long-term imprisonment for minor drug offenders, life sentences for bad apples with several felony convictions, and application of the death penalty to a wider variety of crimes.
The underlying assumption of this theory is that a testy public must be humored by aggressive use of the death penalty. The problem with this theory is that it presumes a degree of brutality in the public spirit that seems inconsistent with the present increase in America’s Christian churchgoing population. Puzzling about this contradiction, McFeely wanders into the theological bogs, borrowing from a theory about lynchings which was formulated by Donald D. Matthews, a historian of American religion. Why, Matthews wondered, had religion and lynching “waxed” simultaneously in the South of the 1890s? Perhaps it was because the Christianity then popular in the South devalued a compassionate New Testament God in favor of the “stern and inscrutable God of Israel.” Christ had to suffer death on the cross to provide atonement for the original sin of which all humanity was guilty. And so, “at the heart of salvation,” Matthews writes, “were the metaphors of retributive justice: at the center was a symbol of torture and death.”
Then, McFeely: “So imbued with this belief system were some adherents of lynching��and now executions��that for them, only with a killing can we atone for the sins of the society or one of its worst miscreants.” This may be a theory that only a theologian can love, but at least it offers a pious rationale for what many now consider an unholy policy.

Other theories are more profane. One argues that the enthusiasm for executions expresses the hardiness of undying American racism, for a high proportion of the condemned are black. Another suggests it is part of the conservative reaction against the tolerant culture of the late Sixties and early Seventies. Many a small-bore Jeremiah now blames those years for creating such rot in the nation’s moral code that our very survival is at risk. Which brings us back again to the old dispute about who holds the high moral ground in this endless debate.When he was solicitor general arguing before the Supreme Court for restoration of the death penalty, Robert Bork said the state could legitimately “conclude that capital punishment serves a vital social function as society’s expression of moral outrage.” A “venting of outrage at the violation of society’s most important rules,” he argued http://www.cheapuggbootsukonline.info , “is itself an important, perhaps a necessary, social function��.” McFeely prefers the opposed view of what is moral, represented by Justice Thurgood Marshall, who held that it was the death penalty itself that violated society’s rules.
The ascendancy of the New Democrats under Bill Clinton cannot be ignored. This group realized that Democrats had to combat the Republicans’ claim to be the “tough-on-crime” party by matching them in “toughness.” To illustrate that he was leading a “tough-on-crime” party, Candidate Clinton interrupted his 1992 campaign http://www.uggs-sale-uk.info , returned to Little Rock http://www.cardybootssale.info , and did his gubernatorial duty by signing a death warrant for a mentally defective man.
Democratic Governor Bob Graham of Florida was put to the test by the sentencing of John Spenkelink, the first man condemned in Florida after the Supreme Court restored capital punishment in 1976. McFeely describes immense pressure on Graham to be merciful. He had once been opposed to the death penalty.
Though said to be agonizing over a grant of clemency, the governor, as one of the new breed of southern Democrats with reconstructed racial views, thought it essential to balance that stance with a toughness on crime. To hold him fast to that resolve, Graham’s fellow young governor, Bill Clinton of Arkansas, called with legal advice, lest Graham make a mistake and jeopardize the restoration of the death penalty in other states.

Spenkelink was electrocuted, and Florida now stands second only to Texas in the number of people put to death by a single state.
2.For all the fervor among death-penalty adherents, they are curiously squeamish about how the thing is to be done. The present session of the Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether Florida’s notoriously troublesome electric chair is exacting “cruel and unusual” punishment with performances The New York Times has delicately called “messy.” No one expects the present Court to enlarge the case by considering whether execution itself amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. If the Court puts the chair out of business, Florida is ready to shift to death by lethal injection. Putting people to death is not the issue; the issue is how to put them to death neatly.
This is a matter that has troubled societies throughout history. The Roman historian Livy, writing during the golden Augustan Age, was still appalled by the way one Mettius Fufetius had been executed six-and-a-half centuries earlier, about 670 BC. Mettius was tied, spread-eagled, between two chariots, each drawn by four horses. “At a touch of the whip the two teams sprang forward in opposite directions, carrying with them the fragments of the mangled body still held by the ropes. All eyes were averted from the disgusting spectacle.”
This technique obviously offends Livy’s Roman pride. He seems to think it so revolting that Romans will be ashamed to read of it, for he hastens to reassure them:
That was the first and last time that fellow-countrymen of ours inflicted a punishment so utterly without regard to the laws of humanity. Save for that one instance we can fairly claim to have been content with more humane forms of punishment than any other nation.

Well, this may be doubtful, but how modern of him to disapprove of “messy” executions. Like our Supreme Court pondering Florida’s electric chair, he is concerned not with morality but with technology.
Many cultures have exulted in the messiness with which executions could be done and tried to make them ever more dreadful, as though the death agony should match the gravity of the crime. In England during Tudor and Stuart times, people guilty of treason might be publicly hanged, drawn, and quartered. Condemned people of high breeding might be let off with a private beheading in the Tower of London.
Dreadful public executions were doubtless intended to deter crime by showing the masses how unpleasant its consequences could be, but the public seems to have flocked to them more for thrills than for edification. The tireless seducer Giovanni Giacomo Casanova tells of a woman looking down from an open window who allowed him to have his way with her while she watched an especially nasty execution in a public square.

Within the present century, hangings in America were often conducted in a circus atmosphere. In his days as a police reporter, H.L. Mencken attended an assortment of them in Maryland’s county jailhouse yards. His first, in 1899, was “a hanging of the very first chop” since four men were to be “stretched at once.” Several witnesses and reporters were “wobbling” drunk before the event began, and a half-dozen “fell in swoons, and had to be evacuated by the cops.” On one occasion http://www.bootssaleuk.org , Mencken reports, a giant of a manfought Joe [the hangman] and the sheriff on the scaffold, knocked out the county cops who came to their aid, leaped down into the bellowing crowd, broke out of the jail yard, and took to an adjacent forest. It was an hour or more before he was run down and brought back. By that time all the fight had oozed out of him, and Joe and the sheriff turned him off with quiet elegance.

By 1947, when I came to Maryland journalism, the era of circus at the scaffold had ended, though I met a few old cops who talked nostalgically of it. The trend in execution was toward something that might be loosely called dignity, although in Maryland it also seemed that everybody thought something shameful was being done. The hangings were done at midnight in a small white-walled brick chamber at the state penitentiary in Baltimore. The atmosphere was unrelievedly grim. The number of witnesses was limited and whiskey forbidden. I had the good fortune never to attend one. A newspaper colleague relieved me of the assignment. He saw three men dropped through the trap and was sick for days.
Nowadays it is common for demonstrators to gather outside the prison as a convict’s final hours are counted down. This produces the only remnant of the theater of execution that once titillated crowds and gave the condemned a chance, perhaps for the first time in his life, to address a large audience. Professor McFeely conveys the mood of these modern demonstrations, using testimony about Georgia’s execution of Roosevelt Green.
The demonstration area was divided into sections, one for the press, one for Ku Klux Klan members, and one for people opposing the death penalty. Klan members wore traditional robes and held signs. The witness recalls that “most of the signs were jingles that said something like, ‘Now he’s going to burn, now he’s going to fry, now he’s going to shake, now he’s going to die,’ that sort of thing.” Their mood was “angry, hostile, and eventually celebrative.”
Another witness had brought his wife and teenage children for the occasion. He remembered “some celebrating” after the crowd heard the execution had taken place. “When they brought the hearse out, I remember the crowd jumping up and down and celebrating.”
Edward Stephens, a former Grand Dragon of the Georgia Klan, didn’t remember Green’s execution “standing out over and above the other seven or eight executions that I’ve went down there in support of the death penalty on��.”
Stephens’s reaction to news of any execution was “joyful relief that it’s another burden off the taxpayer’s back.” Opponents of the death penalty, he went on, “stand around and hold candles and cry because a person has just been executed. But they don’t think anything of the victims. We rejoice that the person that has created the crime, that has taken a person’s life and extinguished it like a cigarette butt has been put to rest, and hopefully sent to where’s he’s supposed to be, no matter what color he is.”

 Marc Jacobs On What&apos;s Sexy (And Why Clueless Straight Guys Are His Barometer!)


Looks like we&apos;re not the only ones interested in what fashion-clueless straight guys think about fashion--Marc Jacobs is, too!




Last night, Jacobs sat down with the deputy director of the Museum at F.I.T., Patricia Mears http://www.todsborsa.com , to discuss everything from his underwear preference (briefs!) to his regularly-occurring creative blocks to just what makes a woman sexy in fashion today. The Cut was there, and they got the scoop on exactly what the designer finds sexy and why clothes simply aren&apos;t a part of the equation.&quot;&quot;I don’t find clothes sexy at all http://www.nikefreebillig.info ,&quot;he said.&quot;I find people sexy, and I find personalities fascinating and sexy and appealing and charming. So a sexy girl wrapped in a sheet is a sexy girl, and an un-sexy girl in a low-cut dress is still an un-sexy girl.&quot;

Sign up for Glamour.com’s Style Tips of the Week and Beauty Tip of the Day newsletters!

That thinking influenced the highly-buzzed-about casting of his fall 2010 Louis Vuitton show, which featured beautifully curvy women not usually seen on the high-fashion runways.&quot;I believe that these iconic, larger-than-life women are very Vuitton-like,&quot;he said of his selection.&quot;I was saying earlier that I believe that a Vuitton woman has luster and more of an edge to her, and this season we talked about it and we decided the criteria was http://www.shoesgreece.net , they have to be available on the day of the show and they have to be gorgeous. So we just kept throwing out names  I suggested Elle Macpherson and Laetitia Casta http://www.mulberryoutletdanmark.net , and [my stylist Katie Grand] suggested Alessandra Ambrosio and Adriana Lima.&quot;

He went on to explain how he knew he&apos;d succeeded--when straight dudes with no interest in fashion told him the show was beautiful.&quot;Even if you had no idea about fashion and had never looked at fashion, you would say, ‘Wow http://www.thenorthfacepoland.com , look how beautiful those women look.&apos;I did receive e-mails from people’s brothers who were like&quot;— here he faked a deep http://www.belstaffsdeutschland.com , dopey voice —&quot;‘I don’t know anything about fashion, but that was a gorgeous show.’ Which was really what we wanted to do.”

Ah yes http://www.guccisverige.org , if you can get the frat boys of the world to see beauty in a Louis Vuitton show, there&apos;s certainly no denying its sex appeal. What do you say, ladies? Do you agree with Marc that clothes themselves aren&apos;t sexy, but it&apos;s the women in them that really makes them sizzle? Did you love his model lineup for this show as much as we did? Who do you think has the most power to make a paper bag look gorgeous? Discuss!

For now, Nickelback continues to tour and write songs for their next album.

&quot;It is really funny,&quot;he continued.&quot;You really think you have a clear picture as to how you think that next (album) �� or any song for that matter is going to sound. Once you start putting the meat on the bones (writing and recording) and putting the icing on the cake (finishing your album), it really starts to shape itself.&quot;

Chad wrote most of the songs for on a tour bus between cities. At the time, he was going through a difficult relationship.&quot;I try to draw from personal experiences for a lot of stuff on the Nickelback albums,&quot;he explained.&quot;It is so much easier than talking about something you have no clue about.&apos;Rockstar&apos;for instance. I was on the back of my [tour] bus, and I had a guitar. I was trying to think, because we meet a lot of people just traveling on the road. We meet actors and we meet sports stars and NASCAR (racing) drivers. It is so funny that all of them lean into you at one point in time, and go,&apos;I would love to switch jobs with you http://e-uggbootsclearance.net , even for a week.&apos;That is amazing. I do not want to switch jobs with anybody.&quot;

Nickelback&apos;s career boasts over 25 million records sold around the world, making them the third best-selling Canadian band in music history http://www.girlsboots2u.com , behind Guess Who and Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Chad describes the band&apos;s highlight.

&quot;We were just in Toronto, and we were inducted to the Canadian Walk of Fame, which is like getting the star on Hollywood Boulevard [California landmark], but it&apos;s the Canadian version. It was really, really special,&quot;he said.&quot;When we went up after they showed a lot of footage of the band and us doing everything we have done, then we went upto accept the award. I was choking back tears so hard. They showed a clip of my mother, and I did not actually see the show, but she was just bawling [crying,] and I am like so choked up and trying not to cry. It was such an honor.&quot;

&quot;At the coffee shop where my brother was working http://sheepskinsnowboot.com , everything [cost} $1.95, $2.95, $3.95,$4.95 or whatever it was. So all day long, it was,&apos;Here is your nickel back.&apos;[ed. note - A nickel equals $.05.] Mike called me up and asked,&apos;What do you think of the name Nickelback?&apos;And I am like,&apos;What does it mean?&apos;, and he said&apos;It does not mean anything!&apos;It was perfect!�� Chad said.

With nine Juno awards (Canada&apos;s top music award), an MTV Video Music Award, World Music Award for World&apos;s Best-Selling Rock Artist, and three Billboard Music Awards, Nickelback is now enjoying the success of their most-popular album. was re-released on July 10 with additional live tracks. It is their fifth album, with work on a sixth already underway.

Nickelback is donating the revenue from digital sales of their song&quot;If Everyone Cared&quot;to charity.&quot;Where do you go? Where do you focus when you can help? Where do you send some money or help out in any way? We sat down for a long time and thought between (band member) Ryan (Peake) wife&apos;s charity, International Children&apos;s Awareness, it would be great to sort of go&quot;halfers&quot;(50 percent), and allow Amnesty International to take half the proceeds.&quot;

Chad&apos;s brother and fellow band member, bass guitarist Mike Kroeger. actually came up with the group&apos;s name.

So far the song has been downloaded more than 600,000 times. Nickelback has been on tour for two years. Chad says he loves making a connection with their international fans.&quot;We were just in Quebec, and we played to our largest crowd ever. I think it was 100 http://warmsnowboots2011.com ,000 people. The whole time I was thinking http://e-uggbootsclearance.net , in the seventh grade I took French but why didn&apos;t I pay just a little more attention because this would be so much cooler. If I could just scream a couple more phrases.&quot;

Band member, Chad Kroeger, said,&quot;Yeah, we are tossing around some ideas. I hope we never stop coming up with ideas. I do not know when we will be releasing that (sixth album). They kind of shape themselves.

One of the most recent musical success stories is the comeback of the band Nickelback. In 2001, they achieved major success with their album, , with 10 million copies sold worldwide. In 2005, Nickelback released which recently reached eight million in worldwide sales. VOA&apos;s Larry London talked with Nickelback lead singer Chad Koreger about the band&apos;s latest tour and next album.

 Question:


I&apos;m in my early 30s and I&apos;ve never dated anyone that I didn&apos;t meet through online dating or speed dating. While I&apos;ve met some good people through these means, I always feel it is a little forced and wonder what people did before we had these things. I don&apos;t meet many single men I&apos;m interested in, but when I do I have no idea how to move from knowing someone (a colleague, coworker, friend of a friend, team mate, classmate, whatever) to dating them. How are all these people getting together?


Sherri&apos;s Answer:


Hi Anna!


The frustration you express seems to be the trend these days. So many people are tired of the online dating scene and looking for new (or old) outlets. We have become so dependent on the Internet and other social networking tools like speed dating that it&apos;s incredible to imagine that less than 15 years ago many people were taking out ads in the personals to find a mate in and between blind dates. While Internet&amp;speed dating certainly present some interesting challenges, conversation lulls and moments of discomfort are natural in any setting and take time to overcome.


Regardless of the medium of how two people meet, http://www.cheapgooseoutlet.com , I always encourage individuals to go beyond the first date or two and remind them to give others the chance to be themselves minus the pretenses. Many people freeze up when they meet someone they are interested in dating and do not even realize that they are giving off the&quot;I am not interested&quot;or&quot;let&apos;s just be friends&quot;vibe. While I cannot say for certain if that is the case with you, it is something you may want to think about for the future.


When it comes to relationships, quality and compatibility vary from person to person. Your best bet right now is to focus on finding the right someone for you and not on those who are coupling off around you. You may want to take a break from the online dating scene for a while and explore other avenues. Here are a few suggestions to help you get started:


1. Try reaching out to friends, colleagues (and if you are really bold, http://www.cheapgooseoutlet.com , family) and let them know you are interested in being fixed up. Don&apos;t be shy about telling people you are actively searching for set-ups--- meeting friends of friends is a tried and often true matchmaking technique because they know you and have your best interests at heart.


2. If time and budget permit, plan to take a group trip for the holidays or invest in a winter time-share with other singles. There are plenty of travel companies and cruises that cater to the single segment including GAP Adventures, Club Med and Singles Travel International, to name a few. To make sure you are paired with other singles before embarking on your journey, call the travel provider and find out who else has signed up for the getaway you are interested in booking.


3. I am also a big fan of the&quot;house party&quot;because they are more intimate, which makes introductions and conversations less forced. With the holidays just around the corner, you don&apos;t have to wait to be invited to one, just invite some friends over and encourage everyone to bring someone who is single along to the party.


4. You should also consider dining out or attending the movies alone on a regular basis. You never know who will be sitting in the row in front of you or at the bar stool beside you and it&apos;s very easy to strike up conversations in those situations.


5. If you meet someone cute in the elevator at work or at the gym, just smile and say hi. You&apos;d be surprise how far a friendly&quot;hello&quot;can take you today.


I hope these tips help and wish you Good Luck!

According apt the numeral of neuronal processes of classification of pretended unipolar neurons (pseudounipolar neuron) to issue a protrusion from the compartment body,never distant away from the cell body was divided into two T-type, so cried false unipolar neurons. Processes in which a slender, the same architecture and axons extending toward the surrounding, said nearly suddenly peripheral process), its function is equivalent to dendrites,tin feel the thrust apt refresh and transmitted apt the compartment body; anew branch toward the centre said chief protrusion capital process), the thrust to pass to anew neuron, the equivalent of the axon. Such as the spinal ganglion sensory neurons and so aboard Bipolar neuron (bipolar neuron) from every annihilate of the cell body to issue a protruding,an dendrite and an axon. Such as the cochlear ganglion sensory neurons and so aboard Multipolar neurons (multipolar neuron) has an axon and several dendrites, the largest digit in the body of a neuron, such as the spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons and cortical pyramidal cells. Multipolar neurons but likewise apt emulate the width of axons and branches were divided into two types: ① Gorky type Ⅰ neurons, and its colossal compartment body, axon width given the access the act of parallel such as spinal rope anterior horn motor neurons; ② Gorky Ⅱ type neurons, the compartment body is small, short axons, in the instance given approximate the compartment body advocate such as the spinal tether dorsal horn neurons of small and large and small coupler neurons in the head According to the function of neurons,tin be divided into three types of sensory neurons,likewise known as afferent neurons (afferent neuron) is the conduction of sensory thrusts,compartment bodies in the head spinal ganglion, mostly false unipolar neurons. The processes constitute the afferent nerve. Terminal nerve fibers in the peel and muscles and additional parts of the formation of receptors. Motor neuron (motor neuron): likewise cried efferent neurons (efferent neuro),namely a behavior impulse conduction of neurons, mostly multipolar neurons. Cell bodies located in the chief nervous system and the autonomic section of gray matter, which processes constitute the efferent fibers. Not the annihilate of nerve fibers,situated in the brawn tissue and glands, the formation of effector neurons in the middling (interneuron): likewise known as coupler neurons (association neuron) in the liaison among neurons neurons are multipolar neurons the human nervous system,highest neurons amid the capital nervous system constitute a complex network. Cell bodies situated in the central nervous system gray matter, the processes generally situated in the gray matter. According to neurons of vary neurotransmitter released from cholinergic neurons classification (cholinergic neuron): The nerve endings of neurons apt release acetylcholine, such as spinal tether anterior horn motor neurons and so aboard Amine neurons (aminergic neuron): the release of monoamine neurotransmitters: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine,five - hydroxytryptamine, histamine and so aboard If the release of adrenaline as adrenergic neurons, such as sympathetic ganglion neurons among the additional Amino mordant neurons apt release glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid and so on Peptide neurons (peptidergic neuron):: to release enkephalin, P substance, such as peptides, as the hypothalamus and myenteric plexus neurons in some of the additional These neurons forward the release of substances referred apt as neuropeptides (neuropeptide). Now namely the effects of neuropeptide does not directly reason compartment changes, only the effects of neurotransmitters to regulate the role, it aspiration be phoned neuropeptide neuromodulator (neuromodulator). Basic lesion: 1 Acute neuronal death ruddy neurons,ruddy neuron): sensitive ischemia, hypoxia,alternatively infection can occasion perceptive poisoning death of neurons, neurons showed nuclear condensation,depressed cell body deformation, the cytoplasm Nissl bodies (Nissl body) disappear HE staining cytoplasm namely black red in Iraq,known as ruddy neurons red neuron). Enzymes such as compartment decease of the decomposition process to continue apt develop can lead to dissolution of the core disappears, the contours of residual cells alternatively traces of cells called the specter ghost compartment Red forward the ischemia-induced neuronal maximum common in the cerebral cortex of the pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje (Purkinje) cells.2 effortless neuronal atrophy simple neuronal atrophy): chronic advanced neuronal degeneration alternatively death of neurons namely phoned simple atrophy. Neurons,likewise understood as chronic degenerative conditions. Lesions represented as neurons abbreviate nuclear condensation without significant dissolution of Nissl bodies, generally not accompanied forward inflammation. Late may be associated with significant glial compartment proliferation.three capital Nissl body dissolution chief chromatolysis): as a reversible degeneration,often according a viral infection, vitamin B absence and crashing away from the axons of neurons and additional factors. Neuron lesions showed swelling rounded, nuclear deviation, the chief cytoplasmic Nissl body malfunction and after dissolved away,alternatively only a small aggregate of residual cells in the marginal cytoplasm were slightly dyed and sallow homogeneous state.four neurons in the formation of intracytoplasmic inclusions (intrancyto-plasmic inclusion): neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusion body formation can be penetrated in crucial viral infections and degenerative diseases, with its shape size and color namely revise from the distribution there are decisive parts of the decree such as Parkinson&apos;s disease substantia nigra, locus coeruleus neurons, etc. in the Lewy body (Figure 14-2); rabies hippocampus and mental cortex pyramidal cells in the Negri bodies, respectively, with the diagnosis of these diseases.

 Wearing an innocuous cotton t-shirt, a pair of shorts and sandals, the eleven year old girl walks thoughtfully down a hot suburban street in the west Texas desert. Although preoccupied with the cast on her painfully broken wrist, Kaitlynn notices a large black, gleaming crow standing on the sidewalk not far ahead of her, and wonders why the bird isn&apos;t flying, or roosting on a tall building. The crow inhabits the bright surreal scene in a central, almost unnatural way through its strong presence, causing Kaitlynn to worry that it might be rabid. As she slowly approaches (...) , the crow seems to steadily watch her from within its black, feathery aura low on the ground. With an acceptance of and a submission to a power surpassing her resistance http://www.akleyreplicaosunglasses.com , Kaitlynn inhales a deep breath as the large bird suddenly flies up into her arms. She feels a passing sharpness from the pressure of its claws on her skin, as the crow fully spreads its outstretched wings across the small girl&apos;s chest in the forceful, rational daylight.





The huge bird feels like an emblem permanently staining her, a black spiritual coat of arms armoring her, proclaiming, extolling, and emblazoning her small, abused body - fragile and in pain. On that scorching day in the hot Texas sun, the commanding crow remains on her chest for only a brief time as a powerful, living symbol of mercy. Startling her into a higher consciousness, the bird becomes one with her, electrifies-stuns-unites and stirs her with the contradiction of its powerful strength and feathery weight. The loud, raucous sound of the crow emerges as a compelling voice for her unspoken reflections and crystalline dreams, throughout the years of Kaitlynn&apos;s life. The powerful black bird anchors her safely on the temporal earth, while the young girl reaches without fear toward the ethereal, haunting mysteries of the vaporous universe.



When buying replica sunglasses, consider these tips:



Do not buy the cheapest ones offered, since extremely low prices always indicate low quality in terms of materials and craftsmanship. A more prudent move would be buying those in mid-range prices for designer replica sunglasses.



There are a lot of designer replica sunglasses out in the market and in the web. Visit several of these sites so you can properly select the right one for you.



Quality is one characteristic that holds much difference between replica and fake sunglasses. Fake eyewear tends to break easily and some will fade after a short time of using them. Most replica sunglasses, on the other hand, are more durable and may be used for as long as you want to, until it goes completely out of style or gets misplaced. And because of its affordability, you can replace designer replica sunglasses as often as you like.



And lastly, check the refund and return policy of the retailer, in cases where the sunglasses do not fit or you got a different pair from what you ordered.



There are some people who mistook designer replica sunglasses as similar with fake sunglasses. Actually, these two types of eyewear products are quite distinct from each other. For one, replica sunglasses do not sport any logo or label, unlike fake sunglasses which are passed off as the real deal. Though both are available at affordable prices, replica sunglass designs are inspired by and modeled from designer brands like Chanel, Prada, or Bulgari. Replica sunglasses are also stylish and trendy, offering viable alternatives to pricier ones without the wearer having to sacrifice his or her expression of fashion style. Want the latest honey-colored Giorgio Armani GA 475s but just can&apos;t shell out its $300 asking price? Consider buying replica sunglasses inspired by Armani instead, where for less than $30 you get a stylish yet high quality fashion accessory.



Always put ultraviolet protection as your prime consideration. Sure, designer replica sunglasses are meant to enhance your looks and compliment your outfits, but do not forget that in the first place, they are put on to protect the eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. This is one reason to stay away from products that are not stated to be UV protected.

 Using the power of Texas Biomed’s AT&amp;T Genomics Computing Center (GCC), (...) , the researchers found the region by devising a new method for analyzing thousands of potential risk factors for this complex disease, a process that led them to a new biomarker that may be helpful in identifying people at risk for major depression.









Source: Joseph Carey, (...) , Texas Biomedical Research Institute, via EurekAlert






Because the RNF123 expression levels can be measured relatively easily in the blood, this finding could lead to a way of identifying people at risk for major depressive disorder, Blangero said.



Once they found this risk factor, further analysis directed scientists to an area on chromosome 4 containing genes that appear to regulate RNF123.









Major depressive disorder is one of the most common and most costly mental illnesses. Studies have estimated that up to 17 percent of Americans will suffer depression at some point in their lives. The disorder has proven to be a tough challenge for geneticists. Despite strong evidence that people can inherit a susceptibility to major depression, (...) , years of study have failed to locate any of the key genes that underlie the illness.












“We might be able to know in advance that a person will be less able to respond to the normal challenges that come about in life,” he said. “Then doctors may be able to intervene earlier after a traumatic life event to remove some of the debilitation of depression.”



“We were searching for things in psychiatric disease that are the equivalent of what cholesterol is to heart disease,” said John Blangero, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz , Ph.D., (...) , director of the GCC and a principal investigator in the study. “We wanted to find things that can be measured in everybody and that can tell you something about risk for major depression.”



The study was directed by Blangero and David Glahn, (...) , Ph.D., (...)/homme.html , of Yale University. It was published online in October in the journal Biological Psychiatry and supported by the National Institutes of Health.



The study also shows the potential for using this method of analyzing a multitude of heritable traits as a way to zero in on disease-causing gene variants.


--&gt;




The scientists used blood samples from 1,122 people enrolled in the Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study, a large family study that involves people from 40 extended Mexican American families in the San Antonio area.



Blangero and his colleagues looked at more than 11,000 endophenotypes, or heritable factors, and searched for the ones that were linked with the risk of major depression. They found that disease risk correlated most strongly with expression levels of a gene called RNF123, which helps regulate neuron growth.



Scientists at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and Yale University have identified a new target area in the human genome that appears to harbor genes with a major role in the onset of depression.



The research capitalized on the newest ‘deep sequencing’ technology that enables Texas Biomed scientists to search through more genetic variables. The GCC has 8, (...) ,000 linked computer processors that are capable of analyzing millions of genetic variables drawn from thousands of research subjects.

 Making Markouk Bread

Today, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , they invited a prestigious army band over to commemorate the feast of the disciples of St Maroun, (...) , the patron of the local church. They organised a village style dinner: a simple spread of labneh (strained, (...) , salted yoghurt drizzled with olive oil), zaatar and fresh markouk bread. Markouk is our most traditional and loved bread. I’ve uploaded a video of the bread being made. Notice how thin it is. This thinness allows the sheets of bread to cook super quickly and since the bread has very little moisture, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , it lasts very well compared to bread loaves and the like. Check out the skill these ladies have, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz , how they turn the dough to something seriously thin and evenly round. I thought it’s best to keep the church prayer in the background, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz , just to give you a sense of the place.

 Lebanese Breakfast
I remember breakfasts of Labneh, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , Zaatar, mint, tomato and cucumber with fresh, paper thin markouk bread. On weekends, (...) , when time was a luxury we could afford, it would be kishk and qawarma hiding full cloves of garlic in creamy whiteness speckled with shallow fried pine nuts. We burnt our tongues in impatience and never learned to wait. Eggs with sumac were fluffy and crunchy, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , slowly fried with olive oil in pottery and devoured within seconds with farm fresh home made goat’s milk yoghurt. Every once in a while, mom would send dad down to the baker’s with a variety of containers to be made into Lebanese pizzas and pies. The one for manakish would be full of her special zaatar mix – hand picked mountain thyme, dried and mixed with freshly roasted sesame seeds, sumac and of course, olive oil from our decades old olive grove. Another would have spinach and wild silver beet mixed with onions and used to fill the triangular Fattayer b’Sbenekh w Selek. Then there was Lahm b’Ajeen, mutton and beef mince mixed with onions, tomatoes, pine nuts, pomegranate molasses and spices served piping hot on top of the crispy golden brown pastry. A squeeze of lemon juice was all it needed to become the perfect meat pie. Let’s not get into an argument here.


Dad would drive on missions in search of the freshest produce. On his way back home, he would beep the horn, sending a special message that got us on to our feet and out to greet him. The three boys would help dad carry boxes full of the freshest produce upstairs where mom would complain. On a good day. electricity was only available for two or three hours if we were lucky, and that meant that produce needed to be bought and consumed very quickly. But Dad had a problem. Buying a kilo or less of anything was a strange concept he never embraced; and so mom got busy cooking three or four meals at a time, preserving what she could and handing out the rest to the neighbours, who were all too keen to repay the favour and offload their own husbands’ overzealous shopping habits, (...) , undermining mom’s evacuation efforts.


Over the next few posts, (...) , I want to cover many of the Lebanese breakfast foods we eat. I will aim to recreate the recipes using high quality raw ingredients sourced locally from Sydney wherever possible . Wish me luck.

 Fast and Easy Toum – The Best Lebanese Garlic Sauce Recipe









What you are about to read is a breakthrough in the toum making process. I have unlocked the secret to easy, fast and perfect toum. Since I’ve decided to share this invention, I have a feeling the world will owe me something good in return, apart from immortalising me in the memory of future generations. If you don’t know what toum is, you haven’t lived, (...) , but it’s not too late. Read my first toum recipe for background information about this amazing dip and then head to the first Lebanese charcoal chicken place you can find.



So, with my new recipe, here are the technological advances I have been able to achieve:






Now, you may have heard me make this claim before: the best toum (Lebanese garlic sauce) ever. And I still stand by it. But hear me out. My first toum recipe is undeniably a success story, having made possible what most of you thought was impossible: home-made Lebanese garlic sauce as good as any restaurant’s toum, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , made by a fail-safe recipe that needed only oil, garlic, lemon juice and salt. But I needed an alternative, and after months of pondering, I have actually found the answer.










Why a second toum recipe?


It takes so bloody long. Ten minutes of whizzing and adding thin streams of oil interchanged with lemon juice took so much discipline and concentration. It was all a bit too hard
A good food processor costs an arm and a leg (and the occasional finger), and many of my readers don’t have one
It produced such large volumes of toum that unless you had your 25 cousins come around for a bbq, you’d need to be eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner for 2 weeks straight to get through it all What does the new approach give us?



But, why do we need a second toum recipe, you ask. Well. Good question. There are three issues that I have with my first recipe:



Well, (...) , inspiration came late last night, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , when I saw someone making mayonnaise using a food processor. I had thought that by now, people should know that a blender is a much easier option for mayonnaise (see here). I have been able to make mayonnaise in 1 minute flat. The blades actually create a sort of suction that uses gravity to its advantage and makes the emulsification process much more simple. I decided to use a blender, and an egg white (which is used by almost all Lebanese restaurants) to bind the oil to the garlic and lemon juice. The result is amazing, creamy, light, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , easy, and fail-safe Lebanese garlic sauce. Let the world know and share the love!


I have been able to reduce the necessary amount of oil required to make toum to 1 cup instead of 4 cups
By using a blender (which is usually more readily available at homes) a food processor is no longer necessary
Toum preparation time has been reduced to a maximum of 3 minutes, and the process happens without continuously worrying about using thin streams of oil as it can handle a much more heavy handed approach That’s all good and well, but how does the magic work?



Fast and Easy Toum Recipe (Lebanese Garlic Sauce)
Ingredients 5 cloves of garlic
1 egg white
1 cup of neutral oil (sunflower is fine)
Juice of 1 lemon
A good pinch of salt
1 cup of iced water of which you will use around 2 tbsp Method Put the garlic cloves along with salt and 1/4 of the lemon juice in the blender
Blend on medium and scrape the sides down when the garlic goes flying everywhere
Add the egg white and blend on medium
Add half the oil in bit by bit. A thin stream is not necessary, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz , but don’t go crazy. A reasonable, (...) , fine, steady pour is good
At this stage, the emulsification should have taken place. If it hasn’t and the sauce looks like it has split, then something has gone wrong. You may need to remove half the amount, add another egg white, whizz away and re-pour what had already split. But if you take it slow without pouring the oil too quickly, it should be fine
Switch to a slow blend, and add the rest of the lemon juice in slowly too
Add the rest of the oil in the same fashion
Add 1 or 2 tbsp of water. You will see the consistency change into something wonderfully creamy and light. Water seems to do wonders for the texture, (...) , I’m not sure why
Taste it, praise the Lord, and write back and tell me how amazing I am

 A Cute Hairstyle Idea to Steal From Selena Gomez
From the looks of things http://www.guccidanmark.com , it was really windy on the MTV Movie Awards red carpet http://www.swarovskischmuckch.com , but that didn&apos;t stop Selena Gomez&apos;s hair from looking extra-lovely.




She just pulled the top part back into a knot—nothing too crazy. But what I love is what&apos;s going on in the front. Instead of smoothing out the waves http://www.belstaffjackensui.com , they&apos;re twisted maybe once or twice before they were pulled back so they give her a little texture around her face. A very simple move, but one that gives this old hairstyle a bit of an update.

Are you digging this hairstyle idea? Or is it just not your thing?

 by Emad Drimly, Saud Abu RamadanRAMALLAH http://www.belstaffjackensui.com , Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians said Monday that the political crisis in Israel as a result of Defense Minister Ehud Barak&apos;s decision to quit his Labor party and resignation of three Labor party&apos;s ministers from the government would not influence the stalled Middle East peace process.Palestinian observers expected that such dramatic development&quot;won&apos;t have serious influence&quot;on the coalition of the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Palestinian officials have also refrained from interfering into the Israeli affairs.Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the state-run news agency Wafa that the crisis in the Israeli Labor party&quot;is merely Israel&apos;s internal affair,&quot;adding that when the Israeli government had to chose between peace and settlement, it chose settlement.&quot;The current Netanyahu government is seeking to undermine the peace process and annul the results of the previous peace negotiations,&quot;Erekat said, who called on the United States and the international community&quot;to hold Israel responsible for stalling the process of peace talks.&quot;Earlier on Monday, Barak announced that he had decided to quit his Labor Party, and form a new party called&quot;Independence.&quot;Right after Barak&apos;s announcement, three Labor party ministers announced that they had also decided to quit the coalition government headed by Netanyahu.Before Barak made his decision http://www.mulberryisverige.com , he had severe disputes with the leaders of the Labor Party who insisted that the party should quit the coalition headed by Netanyahu. The Labor Party has 13 lawmakers in the 120-member Knesset.Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian negotiator http://www.ralphlaurenjacka.com , said that he doesn&apos;t expect dramatic changes after Barak quit his party and split it, adding&quot;Barak destroyed his party and the left-wing in Israel after he shared with Netanyahu all the crimes. He quit in fear that he would be expelled out of his party.&quot;Following Netanyahu&apos;s announcement that his collation won&apos;t be affected, Shaath called on the Palestinians&quot;to escalate the popular struggle to gain the national Palestinian unity http://www.brandbootsstore.com , and intensify the moves with the international parties to support the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.&quot;Following the resignation of the three Labor Party&apos;s ministers http://www.swarovskischmuckch.com , leader of the opposition in Israel Tzipi Livni called for holding early elections. She considered the current government&quot;a narrow government and has no legality.&quot;Hani Habib, a Gaza-based political observer http://www.guccidanmark.com , told Xinhua that all indications show that the current political crisis in Israel&quot;won&apos;t represent any danger to the coalition government headed by Netanyahu, which still has a majority in the coalition and gains the support of the parliament.&quot;&quot;The split in the Labor Party has been expected a long time ago, especially when Barak obliged his Labor Party to joining the coalition that Netanyahu formed. Barak justified joining Netanyahu&apos;s government as to block any upcoming right-wing decisions http://www.ferragamoitalia.com ,&quot;Habib said.He said that Barak decided to quit his party to avoid the pressure to force him to quit the government, meanwhile,&quot;his withdrawal would give power to Netanyahu, mainly in keeping the peace process stalled and keeping settlement construction going on.&quot;The direct Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were suspended in October last year, one month after it was launched in Washington. The talks were suspended after Netanyahu&apos;s government refused to extend a ten-month moratorium over freezing settlement construction in the Palestinian territories.Related articles：

 To the Editors:

In his review of the Letters of Leonard Woolf [NYR, March 29], Noel Annan described Woolf as “an ethical socialist” who “detested ideological socialism and equated communism with Roman Catholicism http://www.uggstiefelrabatt.com , both evil systems.” Woolf certainly was consistently skeptical about dogmas of all kinds and, over a long life, he never allowed his commitment to the left to be a narrowly sectarian one. Nevertheless, I think it worth noting that, suspicious though he was about a “science of society” and the inevitability of class struggle http://www.true-religion-france.com , he could describe himself as a Marxian socialist http://www.uggstiefelgunstig.com , and one who believed in the essential truth of Marx’s theory. Woolf was, of course, aware that these positions might seem contradictory, but that did not seem to trouble him. (See his War for Peace originally published in London in 1940 by Routledge and reprinted in 1972 by the Garland Press http://www.uggdeutschland.de , New York, p. 152).

S.J. Stearns
The City University of New York
Staten Island, New York
Noel Annan replies:I don’t want to split hairs with Professor Stearns. On page 152 of the book to which he refers Woolf describes himself as a Marxian socialist. But he then goes on to declare that the “conflicting economic interests of classes” are not inevitable. He next says it is as wrong to personify classes as it is to personify nations. In many cases the interests of one set of workers conflict with those of another set, and each has more in common with their capitalist masters than with other workers.
Professor Stearns is quite right to say that none of this troubled Woolf. He got out of his difficulty by calling orthodox Marxists “neo-Marxists.” He seemed to regard the theory of natural rights as valid��in some sense��as utilitarianism, and both as valid as Marxism. Woolf may have considered himself “Marxian” in that he believed part of politics consisted of “facts http://www.bootsdeutschland.info ,” i.e., the social and economic relationships between individuals. But for him the determining force in politics was the psychology of those individuals. That determined how they acted http://www.uggbootsstorede.com , and that was why reason should be brought to bear upon political problems in the hope that it would dispel prejudice.

 Kay Mrp software application platform


confirm whether the phone Mrp software support methods:


test whether the phone can be installed MRP format software and games


What is MRP?


now various mobile phone software development platform to game makers generally focus on high-end mobile phone market. China-made mobile phones, brand-name mobile phone and other so-called cottage is often no one attention, resulting in many domestic mobile phone users want to install software and games do not.


MRP is a cross-platform mobile application format, (...) , written in ANSI C standard. Skye exclusive intellectual property rights for the games and application format. MRP wide range of applications, the current domestic cell phone to use the format has been widely applied. Now stand-alone games, online games, e-books, music, pictures, themes, chat tools and more than 200 applications. As long as the user&apos;s mobile phone built SKYEngine, MRP can be downloaded directly through the mobile phone format a variety of mobile software. SKYEngine platform:


SKYEngine platform Sky Network Technology Co., Ltd. Hangzhou self-developed mobile application platform. MRP format to be run on a variety of applications pre-installed SKYEngine platform. The platform has a very excellent application-driven performance in harsh environments the hardware to run the game smooth and applications. A very small footprint, about ordinary JAVA virtual machine space for 1 / 6. JAVA files of the same file only 1 / 3 the size.


the platform since 2003, almost all the cell phone adapter hardware solutions, has now become the most mainstream of mobile phone software platform.


1. to see whether the phone supports the MRP:


enter * # 777755999 # or * # 220807 #, responsive? Then I congratulate you, your phone supports (usually a reflection of the prompt

2. Download the MRP:


phone memory card to see whether there is [mulgame] [mythroad] [downdata / MR] or [mrapp] four in one folder, the file is stored mrp place (part of the phone&apos;s folder name is not the same, and some still in Chinese), the downloaded file into the MRP mrp folder.


3. to find the list of games and run the downloaded mrp:


general support mrp phone menu comes with a list of games (some phones - Fun&amp;Games - Game Center, and some in the toolbox to open the game ...), you can see the download list The mrp software or games.


PS: Some phones support mrp but could not find the list of games you can try this method


course, you must first make sure your phone supports mrp, otherwise a waste of time, has talked about how the test above


1. the list of drivers to download the game file dsm_gm.mrp, and then placed in mrp folder, that is, [mulgame] [mythroad] [downdata / MR] [mrapp] one of four


2. In standby mode, enter * # 220807 #, 100% support mrp phone can open the game list. [Note: to see whether the phone supports MRP: Enter * # 777755999 # or * # 220807 #, there reaction? Then I congratulate you, your phone supports (usually a reflection of the prompt mrp software must be installed or in the standby screen dial * # 220807 #, (...) , the picture is changing the software can be installed]


here, you can run QQ2010 [Download (cracked full version)] QQ browser 2010 [Download (official version)], and


Mrp software installation:


one - before the installation of several predicate and understand files and folders:


1 - program folder: it is kept running all the MRP software and its program components needed to run the file or some files generated when the folder. It is stored in the memory card root directory. Because different models, the folder name may be different. For example mythroad, dowmdata, MyGame, etc., belong to the program folder, the different roles of their names, although it is the same. In a phone&apos;s memory card, the number of program files folder can only have one, and the name can not be changed, renamed the folder becomes invalid. Even if the memory card to artificially create a program folder, you must also specify the name of the establishment of the phone will be effective. For example, a memory card for mobile phones mythroad the program folder, then mythroad can not be renamed, the establishment of the program only when the folder name mythroad, if established dowmdata name is invalid. Even if they function the same, but it is used for different models of mobile phones.


2 - Software Manager: Software Manager interface exists in the phone menu features some of which, it is characterized with an internal Without updating the software manager before the list, favorites as In other words, with the recent Download, favorites and other projects are all phone functions software managers. And a cell phone may be several such similar software management functions. For example, game centers, mobile QQ and other features in the software manager may have existence. Software Manager role is to download, manage, start, update the MRP list and the software. Also called all the software manager for the

3 - Manager folder: Manager folder that corresponds to the software manager exists, its role is to store data related to the software manager. More importantly, only the MRP software will be downloaded is stored in this folder, MRP software can use. In other words, the MRP will download manager software stored in the folder, then you can download the latest software manager to run the software. In fact, MRP software will move into the Manager folder in the process, the so-called MRP software installation. Manager folder stored in the program folder. And if the phone function of N software manager in the software folder, there will be N-Manager folder exists, and this N-Manager folder names vary, each manager folder are corresponding to the phone features in a software manager.


4-applist.mrp: it is a MRP format, store them in the manager folder. applist.mrp is a list of software management software file, only the updated list of mobile phones after a software manager, software manager of its corresponding manager folder appear applist.mrp file.


5-Received: Received MRP program actually does not belong to the system folder, which is received from the network to download files stored in folders. In other words, when the download MRP software, not directly stored in the manager folder, but are stored in the Received, download MRP software, can be found in the Received MRP software site to download the file. Of course, if the list directly from the software manager download manager will automatically be deposited into a folder, not into the Received, will only download the site into Received in. Received the memory card folder is located in the root directory.


the files and folders are not renamed, the renamed folder on the phone MRP systems is invalid.


discussed above, the relevant files and folders, the following talk about the specific installation.


two-MRP software installation: MRP software installation as different models, there are two common situations. The first is the phone itself comes with a software manager; second is the phone does not have the software manager functions.


1 - with mobile software management functions of the MRP software installation: the installation of such models can be divided into two cases, the first is the use of mobile phones in the list of download manager software, the second is In the MRP software download. If the list in the software download manager you need to manually install the software, download the software files are automatically stored in the manager folder, as long as the software after downloading the most recent download manager you can start using the software. If you are on the website and the MRP software, MRP software will need to manually move the file into the folder manager, before the most recent software download manager to use.


installation method is simple, but for beginners, we do not know their cell phone memory card manager which folder is a folder, so we are really experiencing the problem is how many in the memory card folder in the folder manager to find out. We mentioned above, Manager folder which is stored in the program folder, and program files folder located in the root directory of the memory card, memory card, then only the first heads to identify the root program folder, and then find the folder in the program Manager folder.


way to find the program folder: root directory of the memory card all the folder names followed by an For example, Audio to AudioA, Ebook change EbookA ...... Video change VideoA. Phone standby mode after the instruction type * # 220807 # WAP pages link to be up and click off exit link, enter the memory card, you will find almost the same name which has two folders, the name behind more than just a a A, then the same name and the name behind many A folder is the folder we are looking for the program. For example, a cell phone program folder name should be mythroad, renamed after mythroadA, type the command and then enter the memory card, there will be mythroad and mythroadA, then mythroadA is what we are looking for the program folder. At this point we remove the non-A, mythroad, then the memory card root directory folder name deleting all A and saved, that all changed back to original name. The method is called

Manager folder to find the method: the same folder with the search process, with the renamed method. Under the program folder level in the folder name followed by all the A to save, then exit into the software manager and then manager, into the program folder, the folder in the program will also be two almost entirely of the same name folder We are looking for this folder is the folder manager, record the name of the folder, deleting the name behind non-A, and then rename all the folders change it back OK.


law actually renaming the folder for the search process is very effective, because the program folder in memory card root directory, and the root directory of the number of folders are generally not too much, it will not be renamed trouble, but the manager folder is stored in the program folder, if the phone functions of the software manager to be updated and used, then the program folder of files and folders may be infinitely more, (...) , if the use of renamed method to find the manager folder, it is bound to all the program files folder in the folder rename all, very troublesome. So that we can use the aforementioned applist.mrp file folder to find the manager, we said before, applist.mtp exist in the manager folder, which is a list of file manager software, and only the updated software Manager, the appropriate manager folder appear applist.mrp file after updating the software manager to see which folder we just stored there applist.mrp files, then this folder is the folder manager. But here there is a problem, that is, if the phone function in the software manager with N, and all Manager software is updated in whole or in part, (...) , will be the manager of N corresponds to a folder, and all Manager file there are applist.mrp folder, so that we can not judge this situation which is corresponding to the Manager folder to which the software manager, we can remove all the applist.mrp file, and then enter a list of the software update manager, and then which folder to see again the applist.mrp file, this folder is just update the software corresponding to the manager&apos;s manager folder.


using the above method to find the manager folder, we can be in the MRP software site to download the file into the Received folder manager, and then into the Manager folder corresponding to the software management Download the latest device to use it. Of course, if the phone has a N-Manager N-manager will have a folder, the downloaded file is stored in different folders manager, the software will appear in a different package manager to download the most recent. The method is limited to use MRP software users. China-made mobile phone firms are not able to use other software formats, but some mobile phones can make use of MRP format NES game simulator to use NES software.


Note: The above-mentioned ! ! , (...) ! ! !


now to talk about the situation for another installation.


phone functions do not have the software manager MRP software installation: This phone&apos;s memory card root directory of the program folder, but the program folder in the Explorer folder is not, we can manage their own website to download software device files and application software files, then these two files stored in the program folder, this time we have a cell phone on MRP software management functions. The following specific methods that, first download dsm_gm.mmrp and yyrj.mrp these two documents, dsm_gm.mrp manager for the software file, yyrj.mrp for the file manager application, note dsm_gm.mrp file name To underscore, the file name to use when the two can not be wrong or upside down. Also note that when you download these two files if their file name is not correct, you need to download or download manually after renaming, which will be named file size 40.3KB dsm_gm.mrp, file size 85.2KB named yyrj. mrp. Once downloaded, (...) , rename the above-mentioned method using the memory card in the root directory to find the program folder to download the dsm_gm.mrp and yyrj.mrp file into the program in the Received folder in the Programs folder and then create a folder name mor_list17, attention mor_list17 name in the In other words, MRP software will download in the store mor_list17 can use. After these steps, we completed the installation of the software manager, then type in the phone standby to testify * # 220807 #, you can start the software manager. Note that at this time * # 220807 # start the software has become the manager of the directive. Boot into the

even if your phone has a software manager, you can also use this method to make mobile phones more than a set of software management system.


Mrp software break fee simple:


MRP software for older models (including stand-alone games and applications) will be empty save message center number, face charges click moment information is sent, indicating successful registration you can use, but not actually charging. Can also be used to crack down card charges can still play games with free software, with more down card insurance.


MRP for new stand-alone game or software, registration approach is typically taken into SMS WAP Internet registration, with the down card and delete the message center number is not available, you can phone and SIM card inbox messages Copy text messages with the way is full of information, until full and prompt information not received any so far, then the message center number to +447785012998 or +12085978915, and then encounter fee Note, however, break from the start to the last time, do not delete any information within three days, to maintain full tank of at least three days before the state can delete information, or chargeback! ! ! ! ! ! .

 Steve Earle, mort et vif




Une ame de rockeur dans le c?ur d’un bluesman. C’est à peu de chose près l’état d’esprit de Steve Earle, Texan torturé et révolutionnaire, un des rares chanteurs country accepté par la communauté rock de Nashville. Aujourd’hui, à 56?ans, ce troubadour solitaire s’est décidé à tourner avec les Dukes, sa formation électrique de toujours. Dans le même temps, son dernier disque, I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive (titre d’une des dernières chansons enregistrées par Hank Williams, mais aussi de la nouvelle qu’il vient de publier), http://www.poloralphlaurenes.com/ , n’aura jamais eu un son si country. ?Si cet album est comme ?a, c’est par hasard, lache-t-il au téléphone, sur le départ pour Paris. Cela a été une surprise pour moi, quand je l’ai écouté fini. Car c’est mon premier disque de country depuis longtemps.?

?Fant?me?. Lorsque Steve Earle assiste au concert de Robert Plant et Alison Krauss, au Hardly Strickly Bluegrass Festival de San Francisco, il y a trois ans, le son de la guitare de T?Bone Burnett, producteur renommé et ami de longue date, lui donne envie de travailler avec lui. ?On a fait le disque très vite. Et j’ai insisté pour qu’il joue sur chaque morceau. Quand tu t’es habitué à une chanson, T?Bone a le chic pour te remettre dans l’étatoù tu étais en la créant.?

Le disque est ficelé en deux sessions : la première à Nashville, avec T?Bone et Allan Toussaint. La seconde à Los Angeles, avec un groupe de musiciens soigneusement triés par Burnett. La mort de son père en est le fil conducteur. Une sorte de réflexion entre destin et fatalisme. ?Le but n’était pas de faire quelque chose morbide, dit-il en riant. Je parle de la mort dans mes textes, (...) , mais de celle qui fait partie de la vie. J’ai perdu mon père il y a trois ans et je suis devenu père peu après.?

Mais Steve Earle est choqué quand il se voit. ?Je ne me sens pas vieux ; mais dans une glace, je vois un fant?me. Je ressemble de plus en plus à mon père. Pourtant, je me sens encore l’ame d’un skateboarder, http://www.poloralphlaurenes.com/ , même si je ne sais même (...) Lire la suite sur Liberation.fr

She remembered the soul master of divination, Su Qingxing want to forget, but it felt more clear. It turned out that they have care so much about him?
So she promised a wish.
Do not believe his promise of a desire.
But this time, Lam Hui wither return is completed, just a minute, then that is blue flowers bloom, fragrant full. She slowly turned around, but found, Mo Xiang Yi Zhu a, handsome face, quietly looking at himself.
Su Qingxing suddenly startled, then suddenly brings to mind a desire, she suddenly felt very painful, she looked Moxiang bamboo, gently: She left. Turned into a bamboo canopy, only Moxiang bamboo standing on the beach, whispered.

They panic in the back, saw the big waves within the monstrous hood seal, secret island green, the central peaks towering clear that they see the secret eyes looked at them, face expressionless, they quickly saw the seal cover close, and finally back to normal!
Looked at three passing secret figure, murmured: Moxiang some grief three bamboo, why, the master can not leave together? What does he know the secret?
A long while, Ji Chen Sheng said: Mo Xiang Zhu and Su Qingxing nodded, although there is some grief. But they know that the secret is do not want to come out, to be otherwise, his ability, has long been out.
Thought of this, three somewhat relieved. Until they become strong, will come here in person to open the seal, (...) !
Face is returning to the blue sky, calm like the sea, like jasper, vast and deep. Three laugh, they come out! Do not know to the mainland four years time, will happen to it?
Wailing loudly, flying purple Dapeng crashing out, Kumi its wings in the sky, then excited, large wings shaking, twinkling thousands of miles!
Dragon&apos;s nine sons, and by the gods to stay the Su Qingxing horse in the bag, say Su Qingxing This bag almost even and Moxiang bamboo, but is black, it is called deep black bags, but coldest Yuan is not the old black pine and silver fir Tianshan Millennium woven, and Daytona bags, as has the magical effect numerous.

Big Wings Tang Zijin Dapeng dance, the sun thousands of miles, clouds leisurely, the secret behind the end of the island disappeared.

 One&apos;s lifestyle is also critical. Obesity and smoking are both thought to increase the risk of severe macular degeneration by 4 times. And regular exercises are usually helpful in maintaining a health life.



Omega-3 fatty acids are also thought to help maintain eye health. The most common way is to consume fish oil extracted from cold water fish such as salmon, mackerel, anchovies as well as sardines. Ordinary people are encouraged to contain certain amount of fish oil in the diet.



1. Prevent age spots from forming in the first place
Instead of trying to remove age spots, it&apos;s much easier to prevent them from forming in the first place (...) is the fastest growing online community selling affordable yet high quality prescription eyeglass, prescription sunglasses and other eyewear. Firmoo&apos;s return and refund policy makes your purchase with Firmoo risk-free.



In addition to sunglasses, experts also recommend some nutrients for AMD prevention. Zeaxanthin and lutein are two of the powerful antioxidants that have been found in the macular tissue of the retina. Both of the two nutrients protect the photoreceptors against oxidative stress, inflammation and even degeneration.



The diaphanous, pellucid cosmos envelops her, embracing Kaitlynn/ and it is staggering, astounding, exalting, and astonishing in her free flight away from the agony of constant pain/ it is a cathartic flight from the paralysis of choices she never made/ the bridges she could not cross/ the beauty she did not get to touch/ and the comfort she could not ever reach/ in the degrading room she was suffocating, choking, smothered-not-moving and restrained Just-Like-Death. Her little wrist still hurts, but more potent and more compelling - she is released - she is justified - and standing in absolution as she reaches up and inhales the new breath she has sought, while walking freely again in the ice blue clarity.



There are many sources of zeaxanthin, including foods and supplements. Those foods include egg yolks, squash, pumpkin http://www.akleyreplicaosunglasses.com , orange peppers, collard greens, tangerines, romaine lettuce, green beans (...) , spinach and so on. In addition, supplements from various brands such as Eye Promise-Restore are helpful for those who can not get adequate amounts of zeaxanthin from a diet.



UV rays have been long reported to damage eye tissues because they produce free radicals in the eye. What&apos;s more, blue light is particularly harmful to the macula which is the central retina. A common way to fight against these harmful rays is to wear sunglasses with HEV and UV protection. And brown or amber sunglasses are believed to block out HEV most effectively.



Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among people over 50 years old in industrialized countries. Scientists have found that antioxidants such as carotenoids are helpful in decreasing the risk of AMD. In particular, spinach is one of the best sources of carotenoids, which are considered as normal macular protective pigment (MPP).



Glutathione is an intracellular antioxidant. It can literally prevent degeneration in the delicate photoreceptor cells. This type of antioxidant is a billion more times potent than Vitamin C in neutralizing those free radicals in the eye.



What if I told you it&apos;s easy to remove age spots? A large segment of our adult population suffers from these dreaded spots, yet people are unaware of the basic steps they need to take for curing them effectively. In this article I&apos;ll discuss three steps for effectively combating age spots.

 Everyday people worry, some worry about how to pay their bills and others may worry about losing their job, http://www.uscolumbiajacketssale.com , these are very common fears that have been around for centuries and will probably continue to plague mankind for many more, (...) , but over the past few decades the number of things people worry about has been rising at a dramatic rate and is showing no signs of slowing down. Worrying can also affect your health in many ways by upsetting your sleep schedule or eating habits, worrying can also cause some people to abuse alcohol or start taking drugs.

 &quot;I can tell you that the commission has largely helped to not only sensitize Nigeria on the need to fight corruption, they have also succeeded in fighting corruption head on,&quot;he said.

&quot;We have reached the point in this area where a lot of things are said, but when it comes to implementation we find something different happening http://e-uggbootsclearance.net ,&quot;she explained.&quot;If the governors are actually brought to book it will be a deterrent factor to this new government http://e-uggbootsclearance.net , governors that are in place, that when you are in office, if you do not perform well, if you make money from the people, when you leave office you have the people to answer to.&quot;

Martins says he disagrees with the often-made accusation that the Commission is a political tool used by the government to intimidate political opponents.

She says she is impressed with the recent developments made by the EFCC (...) , but that in the past the government and EFCC have talked a lot about fighting corruption, but done little.

By Selah Hennessy Dakar

Former governors in Nigeria suspected of corruption have showed up in Abuja for a meeting with an anti-corruption body, but several others are on the run. The government of new President Umaru Yar&apos;Adua has vowed to stamp out corruption http://bestwomensboots.net , but some opposition leaders say only political opponents are targeted. Selah Hennessy reports from the West Africa bureau in Dakar.

Tunde Martins http://2012classicboots.com , a political analyst in Nigeria who has been advisor to previous governments, says he believes the EFCC is doing well in its fight against corruption, despite persistent criticism.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, had summoned 15 governors on charges of corruption amounting to millions of dollars.

But at least four are on the run, having left the country before turning over power in inauguration ceremonies last week. One outgoing governor organized a transition of power several days ahead of schedule.

EFCC chairman Ribadu says it will be difficult for the commission to bring the runaway former governors to justice, as it does not have jurisdiction outside of Nigeria.

A Nigerian journalist says that new president Umaru Ya&apos;Adua is cautious not to appear to be using the EFCC for political gain now. He says this is why the EFCC did not arrest and publicly humiliate the former governors, as was sometimes done under the former president.

The anti-graft agency was set up by former president Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001 to purge the country of official corruption.

&quot;This is a very significant step that the EFCC is taking and Nigeria is actually watching,&quot;she noted.&quot;The way that this investigation goes is really going to impact negatively or positively in terms of the way that the new government behaves.&quot;

Nigerian media said at least ten met with Nuhu Ribadu, the chairman of the EFCC on Wednesday. Details of the meeting are not known. None of the former governors was detained following the discussion.

The EFCC says it wants to investigate most of the 36 governors who left office last week after serving during the presidency of Mr. Obasanjo&apos;s. Under Nigerian law http://uggboots5815clearance.com , they enjoyed immunity from arrest while in office.

Damka Pueba is based in Abuja for the non-profit organization Stakeholder Democracy Network. She says the outcome of this investigation will have huge repercussions for the future of corruption in Nigeria.

The EFCC says that Nigeria&apos;s military governments squandered around $400 billion over the course of 40 years.



&quot;I am not impressed with some comments of people who try to say that the EFCC has been fighting political enemies of the government,&quot;he added.&quot;So long as it has been confirmed that they were arrested for stealing public funds there is no need to bring politics into it.&quot;link：

Ajax&apos;s war shield general in other ethnic groups rarely appear in the early epic, but Homer is a large number of use cases, the phenomenon tends to ordinary language. Such structural features of simile is like B in the A segment is appended to the full content of a whole, its modification or not to accept metaphor explained the object of A, but as a metaphor like material B. For example: In the glorious Hector fell dead men.

In this sense, the about the identity of the narrative) and drama (poetry) between a poetry form that Plato, Homer is the scope of the tragedy, and Homer is the blind poet&apos;s life and birth and death can not test. 12 BC legend describes the Trojan War and the 11th century sea adventure story about a long narrative of the ancient Greek epic folklore ballad written in comprehensive Accordingly, the era of his life, when in 10 BC, before the 9,8 centuries.
Homer
Homer is the the book, you can self-contained small library. Homer&apos;s epic is written in the 12th century BC Greece to attack the city of Troy and the post-war story of the epic form and the record, almost through the whole process of the formation of slavery. Trojan War After the Asia Minor area, there are many heroes of the ballad extolling war spread, the ballad of the spreading process, and together with God&apos;s story, enhancing the mythical heroes of war After finishing Homer, to 8th century BC and 7th century, gradually shaping into a great war legend, in the 6th century BC, when it is officially recorded in written form. to the 3rd century BC and 2nd century, but also by scholars Maria Alexander compiled, for the 24 ministries. The formation of the book has gone through several centuries, a mix of historical factors of each era, the ancient Greeks can be seen as the universal creation of creation of other ethnic backgrounds and the world, like the ancient Greek the history of ancient times are also a way to keep the legendary ancestors of the ancient memories of the later epic form Youyi word of mouth among the people. This epic legends and historical works, though not real, but they retains many ancient historical fact has important historical value, it can be said that they already have a history of some of the features and properties. they directly gave birth to the ancient Greek historian. but remain in the memory of all the Greeks in the history of the Trojan war ended, some Greek city-states of the folk singers and folk artists will Greeks in the heroic deeds of war and victory, compiled through the lyrics, in places of public assembly singing these stories from the folk singer word of mouth, after centuries, through constant gain and changes, to the hands of Homer is deleted as two parts, a work setting. about the mid-6th century BC, when the skin Xite La diagram (Pisistratus, about 605 BC - 527 years) came to power in Athens, it was only the last words fixed down, and we see today, Scholars from the Alexander Maria had compiled works. In 1795, German scholar Wolf along this line of epic conducted a detailed study, which asserts that each part of the epic poems have as an independent by the singers concert, after numerous finishing after it became the way we see later, Wolf&apos;s fellow Rahman explained more clearly his point of view, thus forming a written in the 12th century BC Greece to attack the city of Troy and the post-war story of the epic form and the record, almost through the whole process of the formation of slavery. After the war of Troy, in Asia Minor area, there are many popular ballad celebrating war heroes These ballad of the spreading process, and together with God&apos;s story, enhancing the mythical heroes of war After finishing Homer, to the eighth century BC and the seventh century, gradually shaping into a grand War legend, in the sixth century BC, when it is officially recorded in written form. to the third century BC and second century, but also by scholars Maria Alexander compiled, for the 24 ministries.

Homer, was born in the latter half of the eighth century BC, the Ionian, the ancient Greece&apos;s most famous and greatest poets, he is Set the culmination of ancient Greek oral literature, it is the greatest works of ancient Greece, but also in Western literature&apos;s greatest works. and the dispute between Agamemnon, and after the fall of Troy, Odysseus return to the island kingdom of Ithaca, and Wong Houponieluo reunion story. The beauty of art to make it to the whole of Greece and the surrounding ocean as the main plot of the background, shows the scene of liberal freedom, and morality of the Greeks for the future (and thus for the whole of the moral values ​​of Western society), establishment under the model. Following this comes first and foremost a pursuit of achievement, self-realization of human ethics, followed by a freedom of theology gay man and God, stripped of the spiritual world of mysterious fear. became the Epic also showed a humanist ideas, affirmed the human dignity, value and power This is the art of human childhood, in terms of ideology, art can not help with the limitations of the Trojan War in ancient myths and legends widely read throughout Greece. wandering in the Greek world, many rap artists, who are enthusiastic tour Wing, so that the generation to generation, the ancient Greek poet Homer&apos;s two brilliant poem Competition , is a world famous ancient masterpiece. centered on the end of the war to describe the dozens of days before the events of the Greek forces besieged Troyer years absence, and brave commander Agamemnon Achilles anger wins the female prisoners, refused to play, after because of their friends died, Naifu play. Troyer Prince Hector and Achilles fight bravely in his death, Troyer Plymouth Ames begged the king to recover Hector&apos;s body, funeral, just this year and dozens of days in the last decade things. Odysseus fun of by the gods, returned the way for a decade drifting in the sea, and everywhere in distress, and finally by the gods mercy before it may go home when the Odyssey Sri Lanka living exotic, the Ithaca and the neighboring nobles deceive his wife, the young child is weak. Pinieluopu to marry his wife, forcing her to remarry, Pinieluopu exhausted all methods of delay. most Houao De repair Sri Lanka disguised as a beggar to go home, kill all the suitors with his son to restore his power in Ithaca. historical formation of many centuries of accumulated myths and legends and heroes of the story, save the ancient culture of the real, natural features, while that in the ancient eastern Mediterranean early this ancient cultural center, it had reached a very high degree of literary prosperity began with the word epic handed down later, and after many centuries of processing refinements, became the final version now. This special condition is excellent and the ancient Aegean civilization, and Athens and Alexandria the day after several hundred years of slavery era of prosperity and culture inseparable . It is an ancient folklore of the epic, but also to achieve a high degree of artistic literature. Homer&apos;s epic is the first great European literary history literary masterpiece, it reflects the ancient Greek prehistoric aspects of life, is to study the sacred
Homer
social significance of early Greek literature; its unique features exquisite art of the later European literature and world literature has far-reaching impact on the development by the ancient Greek poet Homer blind to collect, (...) , collate made Homer the source. separate and mutually linked. authoring based on Homer&apos;s epic to certain historical facts, combined with the myths and legends, widely reflected the Greek society from primitive communal system, the transition to slavery, economic, political, military, etc. , as well as the life and struggle of the Greek people. history of this period often called the all, but private ownership is being formed, http://www.canadagoosejackets-uk.net , people living in the the use of iron tools and weapons production work and fight. epic about Carpenter&apos;s description of God and the blacksmith place, showing that the metal production process at the technical level. political life, the implementation of a military democracy, the public discussion of the General Assembly decisions on major issues, but this Epic also has a more extensive reflection. thinking is reflected in the epic, we can also see people-oriented thinking to reflect, to honor the wisdom, laugh at God&apos;s evil, praise, praise the world, contempt of God, this people-oriented thinking and often nation with the praise of the combination of noble heroism. Engels pointed out that all the This mindset is clearly suitable to slave-owning aristocracy of appetite. the creative arts in the creative arts epic, first mentioned, is there have been epic realism and romanticism of these two basic creative method. epic description of the war, describing the characters, both ancient myths and legends of the factors, but a portrayal of the Greek social life. Images of the epic hero in the shape, such as sulfur Adams A passenger, Hector, Agamemnon, Russia at the end of Hughes, and both are real, but it is also romantic; both legendary, full of realism; both the national hero of the common and a distinct personality traits in terms of character portrayal, the character placed major conflicts, through their language to describe actions, such as sulfur Adams A customer conflicts and Agamemnon, and Hector A customer sulfur struggle between Sri Lanka and so on, (...) , followed by a high degree of artistic concise epic specific details and vivid description of the combination. Teluo Ya decade war, hydra-headed, personnel number, the author was able Qucuqujing to see the great small, can be summarized in the art of excellence, the interception of a few pieces after the war to write, compact and concentrated, distinctive character, while the highly artistic concise historical facts, but also the actual reality of people and things through the specific and detailed description to reflect, there are thrilling, tragic, urging them moved and inspired the scene description, there are life to death, people cried description of love is widely deep historical content through meticulous performance of the activities of people out of the epic with a strong artistic appeal again, to create the perfect epic of literary forms (such as verse), significant characteristic of oral literature (such as an important factor in making it a source of future generations of literary and artistic creation and model. precious value of Homer&apos;s epic is to such a rich and profound ideological content and exquisite art of the unique features into it as an outstanding monument of ancient Greek culture, it is as if the encyclopedias , the ancient Greek people draw on astronomy, geography, history, society, philosophy, art and mythology of all knowledge, and future generations in Europe and many other regional and national artists and writers to learn from the infinite wealth of nutrients. is now, it is still We study the precious ancient literature, is still able to charm us with its permanent noble art of enjoyment. epic characteristics, artistic features music by the Six Foot Homer&apos;s verse, not rhyme, but a strong sense of rhythm. This poem body is clearly recite or chant and created, in the chant, probably also to strengthen its rhythm piano piano effect. Because of this narrative poem by Homer artists that

sing, so Many commonly used words and phrases often repeated, or even the entire repeat, word for word, sometimes re-use some adjectives, just to syllable needs, not necessarily how much this means to strengthen, while the number of repeat phrases again and again, Like a symphony in the recurring melody, but also gives a deeper feeling of beauty, which is probably due to some ancient artistic albeit simple, but experienced the use of story-telling skills are very skilled poet, so in order to produce the effect of this success using metaphor to enhance the atmosphere, making the characters more distinctive, is Homer&apos;s artistic in a prominent addition is also good at Homer&apos;s description of the way with simple, with a few words to express the deep feelings. long length feature Homer, 110 lines, two are divided into 24 volumes, this is just the beginning of two epic compiled according to the ancient legend of oral literature, relying on musicians scattered handed down to recite chapter, if the people of Homer, this is probably the last two initial shape of an epic career musicians in the 6th century BC, before these two epic final version has not yet written down, according to well-known essayist Cicero said of Rome, the mid-6th century BC ruler of Athens at the time Bailey Shite La proper leadership, scholars have been prepared by Homer; ancient times there are other scholars think that this is his son Xipa Erke Si to power things, while starting from the 5th century BC, Athens every four years to celebrate an important festival, there are readings of Homer&apos;s epic performances. From this system is implemented, the content and form of the epic is basically fixed down. but at that time reading the epic artist, or under their own Sometimes the number of rows in the text and may be some changes in this case, the number of transcripts was epic in some parts of some simplified difference is understandable. whether or not the person of Homer, whether the two epic are the same poet&apos;s work, nearly two hundred years has been the study of Western scholars of Homer warm debate. Some people think that two epic description of the content is somewhat different, if not the same age who work, also suggested that two epic writing style similarities than differences. Now the majority of Western scholars believe that these two epic works of Homer, Homer was a real person, of course, Homer is based on the oral tradition of the chapter order is made a; If there is no long-term accumulation of the legend, Homer also wrote two not so great ancient epic. version of the character of Homer&apos;s epic today can see the old manuscripts, the earliest about the 10th century around two epic are save a lot of manuscripts, but the content is the same, they are based on 3,2 centuries BC, the city of Alexandria, the revision of several scholars. epic, there are many incomplete fragments of manuscripts, the years have the early to the 1st century BC, the content is identical, which means that 3,2 centuries BC, several scholars of Alexandria, after revision, the final version of the epic have, then it&apos;s not any changes to the content. Then last revision Homer scholars, most notably three, one 泽诺多托斯 (285 years BC), said he made a lot of the original poem&apos;s text processing, the content is also to determine their own increase or decrease; now are divided into two epic 24, is scheduled 泽诺多托斯 which the structure of the original poem that he made some important additions and deletions, the length of the original epic about these two is not so neat. The second revision of Homer&apos;s epic is well-known scholar Aristophanes (195 BC or so), he was more careful editing epic, more respect for the old manuscripts, not to make many subjective additions and deletions. The third well-known scholars Aristo Dove&apos;s disciples Arista Coase (BC 160 years or so), he also respected the old manuscripts, that all changes must be based on which three scholars are at the Greek city of Alexandria, the famous academic centers person in charge of the library have the opportunity to see a lot of books, there are good conditions to carry out editing work can be seen in their era, this epic, there are simplified two different manuscripts, the text is also different from the modern Western scholars have compiled a the ancient writings of Homer&apos;s epic citations, a total of 480 line segments, are 5,4-century BC. Some of these citations is identical with the final version now, and some similar, some not seen this today. In general different accounts to less than half. many ancient Greek writers, such as the hippo carat Tesi, Aeschylus, product Daedalus, Xenophon, Aristotle, Aristophanes and Plato are cited through Homer, those citations are often not identical with this in this, such as Aristotle cited the is from the It seems, this is only 33 lines of these different changes and simplified content, indicating that 5,4 century BC epic passage of the transcript with this there are many differences Homer described the contents of the content is very rich in terms of artistic skills or from history, geography, archeology and folklore, there are many areas worth exploring what it has been in Western classical literature, have the highest position from 8,7 century BC, there were already many Greek poets imitate it recognized that it is a model for literature. two thousand years, Westerners have always thought that it was the greatest of the ancient epic. Troy&apos;s a king 名叫伊利昂, East Troy, who is the overlord of many tribes, when the powerful tribes in Greece where people referred to as A Kaiya, sometimes epic, also known as Argos or of that Asian people ; A Kaiya people to Mycenaean king Agamemnon led. Yi Liang prince Paris city by boat to Greece by the king of Sparta ink Niela Austin&apos;s hospitality, but he put ink Niela Austin cheated wife Helen&apos;s beauty, back to the Yi Liang City. A Kaiya people very angry, then the ink Niela Austin King Agamemnon of 哥哥迈锡尼 initiative, called the tribal chiefs, common crusade against Trojans They mobilized more than 1,000 vessels, through the Aegean to attack Yi Liang City, which took nine years to this king did not take to. to the first 10 years, Agamemnon, and E Kaiya of the fiercest tribe Achilles fight the leader of a woman captured in war, (...) , because the hands of Agamemnon stole from Achilles that female prisoners, Achilles angrily quit fighting. story, beginning with the anger of Achilles, focused description of that first decade of the 51 days thing. Because Akai Ya lost the most courageous generals, they can not beat the Trojans, has retreated to the coast, do not resist Santo will live Yi Liang Hector (Paris&apos;s brother) fierce offensive. Agamemnon Achilles reconciliation with the request and asked him to fight, but they refused. Achilles close friend of Pate Luo Klose will have to see A Kaiya military destruction, they borrowed Achilles&apos;armor to fight the Trojans repulsed the attack, but was himself killed by Hector. Achilles was very grief, determined to battle, revenge for the death of friends, he was finally killed by Hector, and to Hector&apos;s corpse away. Yi Liang of the Pharaoh (Hector&apos;s father) Priam to A Gurkha camp to redeem sulfur Sri Lanka to take Hector&apos;s corpse, temporary truce, held a grand funeral for him. assassination shot, A Kaiya were among the most courageous leader of Ajax and Odysseus, the leader of the most resourcefulness fight Achilles&apos;s armor, however, Ajax is Dionysus possessed , loss of sense, Odysseus won the latter a clear suicide, I felt humiliated and finally made the offer Odysseus a big Trojan horse, built ambush, the Trojans drag the horse into the city, the results of A Kaiya people collaborated with the capture of Yi Liang City, ended the last ten years of war known as Trojan horses in mind. to leave the country for a long time A Kaiya chiefs have returned, Odysseus has with his partner, by boat to Yi Take his hometown starting from here began to Odysseus&apos;s adventures at sea as the center of another epic sea ​​and wandering for 10 years. epic flashback to the middle way, talk about the gods who have been at sea drift in Odysseus 10 years, decided to let him return home Yi Take. Then Odysseus at home son, Telemachus, has grown up, asking out his long missing father&apos;s information. Yi Take a lot of people think he does not return for 10 years, must have been dead. Many of the local nobility in the pursuit of his wife, Pei Nieluo Pei, Peinieluopei in every possible way try to deny them, but still hope he can survive his way home, it seems destined to all roses, Odysseus in the past 10 years through a lot: eat-eyed giant his companion, goddess Dakar engraved with the magic of his companions into pigs, and put him to stay on the island; he went to the edge around the earth Yinghai see the ghost of many of the past; escape Banshee plug Wang&apos;s voice to confuse the people, escaped the monster Scylla and Charybdis, the goddess Calypso in the last several years after Odysseus left, agreed to let him go back to his people&apos;s land to Feiaikesi , North to the King A Erji repeat the past nine years, sea adventures, Aer Ji Northrop send its ships to send him back home. those who seek to marry his wife, who also occupies his palace, eating and drinking. Odysseus pretended beggar, into the palace, trying to kill it with a group of high-handed son of nobles, and his wife reunited. related to the evaluation of the ancient war of attack Yi Liang and Odysseus, etc. There are many myths and legends, are scattered throughout ancient Greece the writings of authors, while these two epic war only chose Yi Liang the first 10 years in the city for 51 days, focused on the anger of Achilles described in this section, and Odysseus wandering for 10 years at sea after the last back home this section that such an approach is clearly one will tell the story of the ancient poet well-designed outcome. In this regard, the ancient genius of the poet named Homer&apos;s argument is more credible. Homer&apos;s epic On the one hand in the folk oral literature formed on the basis that it is the raw material of many centuries of accumulated myths and legends and heroes of the story, save the ancient culture of the real, natural features, while that in the ancient eastern Mediterranean early this ancient cultural center, it had reached a very high degree of literary prosperity. epic words handed down after the start, (...) , and after many centuries of processing refinements, became the final version now. This special condition is excellent, and the day after the ancient Aegean civilization, Athens Alexandria Times and several hundred years of slavery and cultural prosperity inseparable. It is the ancient folklore of the epic, but also to achieve a high degree of artistic literature. ancient Eurasia had a lot of important cultural center, From 2500 BC or earlier, 1000 BC to the beginning of the eastern Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean area there had been a thriving culture of early slavery, western Asia and Egypt, as the area has long had flourished in the early culture of slavery, to the center of early Aegean culture and culture of ancient Western Asia and Egypt, there are many links. on the epic

 1. Daily fights. If you fight more than you get along in your relationship, maybe you should break up. Your relationship should be safe and comfortable for both of you. It should not cause you stress.



3. Cheating. If someone tells you that you are the only one for them, then they go out with someone else and hide it, they can not be trusted.



5. Your relationship is heartbreaking. If there is no abuse, but your relationship still gives you a lot of stress and makes you feel bad, you should break up. Your love relationship should make you both better http://bootsonsaleclearance.com , not worse.



2. Broken trust and lies. Broken trust can permanently destroy your love relationship. It takes a lot of time and effort to get the trust back when it has been broken. If you can not trust someone, you probably should not be in a relationship with them.



4. If there is any kind of abuse, get out of the relationship.





These are some of the times when it might be the best to break up with your boyfriend or girlfriend and find a love relationship that is a better match for you.



7. Long distance relationship. If one of you moves far away and it is too tough for you to have a long distance relationship because you can not deal with the loneliness of a long distance relationship http://winter-bootsonsale.com , you might have to break up.



6. If your family has very good reasons for objecting to your boyfriend or girlfriend http://winter-bootsonsale.com , you might have to break up.

 If a woman who was known to be a&quot;loose&quot;woman, http://www.seedress.net , in the parlance of the day, http://www.airweddingdresseses.com , was to wear a white http://www.setweddingdress.net , http://www.setweddingdress.net , there would surely have been quite a bit of nasty whispering going on behind her back. Needless to say, http://www.airweddingdresseses.com , second time brides never wore white, http://www.onweddingdresses.com , favoring pastels like light blue or pale pink.Times have changed, http://www.onweddingdresses.com , however, http://www.airweddingdresseses.com , and there is no longer an expectation that a bride-to-be is saving herself for the honeymoon. That particular fiction is especially hard to maintain when the couple has been living together for five years before they tie the knot, http://www.hasdresses.net , and even more ludicrous when their children precede the wedding bells. And yet, http://www.airweddingdresseses.com , most first time brides will still wear white or ivory gowns. Besides, http://www.setweddingdress.net , etiquette would dictate that making rude comments about the bride is a far greater sin than her choice of gown color.

About the main properties of missile performance characteristics of the larger development context mobility. Advantages of vertical launch missile Composite guidance, which is to control the trajectory with the instructions, close to the target at 15 km or more to switch on at close range on the radar target tracking, missile, anti-interference ability.

at home. The missile has been the French Dassault Active radar and infrared homing combination of improved system with a unique lock in the target to intercept short-range function. May 1998, when a U.S. Taiwan Air Force has ordered 460 sets of The main performance guidance system: radar-guided, (...) , active / passive infrared homing Weight: 243 pounds Length 10 feet range: 28 miles Speed: 4 Mach Propulsion: Solid rocket motor development background due to the long and the European countries are not the same defense guidelines France&apos;s defense industry to establish a complete system, armed forces battle equipment self-sufficiency, even if the peak of the Cold War proliferation of American equipment to Europe, France unmoved. The late 20th century, with the accelerated process of European integration, the French defense industry and other European countries began to strengthen the links between, joint development of weapons of this period the production of mainstream Europe. In 1979, the French missile maker Mate La company successfully developed ultra-Mate La-530D and improve the development of R-550 Magic short-range air to air missiles, the French Ministry of Defense hopes to adapt to the development of a 90&apos;s and early 21st century as well as air environment, air to air missiles. Meanwhile, the defense budget for savings, reduce the logistics burden of the consideration, the French Ministry of Defense would like to have a balance between the distance from the block and close combat missile. Mate La company after a year of technical feasibility studies to determine the interchangeable modular seeker, thrust vector control and other basic technical characteristics. As aerial platform, both in the same shot from the bar and close combat capability. The end of 1981, joint development program. Mate La&apos;s development plans progress smoothly, in October 1982 in southwestern France Landes Test Center conducted the first deflection jet thrust vector control system ground tests, in October 1983 missile test-fired unguided ground, In early 1985, will complete the feasibility verification, enter the project development stage. In May 1987, the French Defense Ministry approved the overall project development and signed with Mate La worth $ 327 million in procurement contracts. In January 1989, in Landes Test Center conducted the first kind of active radar-based missile successfully hit the ground tests and CT-20 target drone, began in the spring of 1990 with Mirage 2000 fighters to fly and test set to 1 in 1992 A total of 20 times on the ground and air tests. January 9, 1992, Mirage-2000 fighter jets on board the At the same time, test. In 1995, In 1997, In addition, China Taiwan Air Force ordered 400 aircraft equipped with the legal system Mirage -2000-5, the Middle East, Qatar has ordered a As of 2003, Features The main features of the play is stopped shooting from the first time in close combat with the dual task of rolled into one, rather than Russian, as in the same short-range air to air missile or the missile away from the series, the use of interchangeable use active radar and passive infrared seeker, thus further expanding the use of tactical missiles. In close combat, you can type and use of active radar locks onto the target before launch, you can also type using infrared imaging before launch or after launch targeted to gain after launching capability. When the shooting stopped in the distance, the use of active radar-type, its guidance system inertial guidance for the early stage, middle set machine instruction amended the last paragraph of active radar-guided, with the airborne side track / while-scan radar with, can attack 6 to 8 the target. Terminal guidance radar for the J-band (10 ~ 20GHz) PD radar, code-named AD4A, by the French electronics company Dassault and the British company GEC-Marconi jointly developed. Imaging infrared seeker developed by the French SAT Corporation, (...) , a dual-band scanning program and improve the mechanical and electrical signal processing techniques, the role of distance and with far better anti-jamming capability, off-axis launch angle to ± 90 °. The missile uses the normal aerodynamic layout style, along the missile body configuration with a rectangular edge of the wing of the long wing and tail rudder, (...) , the rocket engine nozzle that has the four side steering, and aerodynamic control of the rudder face combine to make the larger of the missile mobility. Missile guidance system according to the different strengths, Both the main difference in appearance is the head fairing shape, Seeker must possess two kinds of anti-jamming capability. The frequency of the 10-20GHz. The guidance system for the inertial guidance, the middle set machine instruction amended the last paragraph of active radar-guided, (...) , can attack targets 6-8. Therefore, Mate La&apos;s propaganda The AD-4A role of seeker 15 km distance from the countries in the world can only be regarded as the interceptor missile in the middle. It is noteworthy that several countries in Europe responsible for the Navy Fleet Air Defense mission Aster -15/30 region also used the same missile seeker. anti-jamming capability. Vertical launch Le Aerospace (DASA) merged to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) company. Subsequently, MBDA took over the In 2000, in Singapore at the Asian Aerospace show, MBDA first public demonstration of their newly developed vertical launch type MBDA&apos;s sales and marketing manager, said at the time, vertical launch type According to MBDA&apos;s research, six years, the vertical launch type In 2001, France Landes Test Center, the vertical launch type MBDA&apos;s view, since the mid-1990s, the increasing air threat, the most prominent in the Air Force to strengthen the capacity of saturation attack. As long as coordination is good, in the same airspace lot of different types of aerial platforms (fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles) from different heights and different directions at the same time overhead. These aerial platforms and radar cross section generally decreases, especially in a variety of precision-guided bombs, cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-air defense system is a nightmare. Ground-air defense system in order to adapt to the changing battlefield situation, traditional and new threats emerge, they must have the following properties: 1, while the ability of multiple targets engagement; 2 powerful electronic warfare and anti-jamming capability; 3. launch, (...) , control, detection systems distributed deployment capability; 4 dead free of fire. Moreover, it should also have a lower life-cycle cost in order to adapt to the global trend of reduced funding for defense; training, use and maintenance are relatively simple to reduce the dependence on the logistics supply system, control personnel should also be reduced. These requirements are traditionally difficult to achieve ground-air defense missile systems, especially to deal with them more low-observable targets appeared to be inadequate. Based on the above judgments, MBDA company that in the next decade there will be a number of surface to air missile system due to meet the needs of the war out of active service. The MBDA&apos;s select the The position of the short term is difficult to shake. In contrast, short-range air defense missile technology difficulty is low, and in the next few years a number of technical level of the 1980s, the system will be eliminated, which will leave the market empty. Starting from these reasons, MBDA selected technologically advanced MBDA will be vertical and ambitious emission Vertical launch a new Vertical launch type module is a 5-ton truck chassis (the chassis or the French army Caesar self-propelled howitzer chassis), equipped with a standard 4-mounted transmitter box, crew 2. Usually, the level transmitter box placed on the chassis, through the hydraulic system launch preparations complete erection work; 2 radar detection module installed in the chassis a coordinate on the radar, the maximum tracking distance of 50 km, the maximum altitude of 9,000 meters, installed automatic IFF system; 3 tactical command center to the launch and implementation of remote control detection module, perform threat analysis, target distribution, system monitoring and other tasks. As a result of the layout of distributed systems, detection module, transmitter module and tactical command centers are independent and will not be destroyed because of a module and make the entire paralysis of combat units. Ensure the survival of the entire system the higher the probability of war. At the same time, MBDA&apos;s new between different units within the unit as well as freedom of movement. As a result, the internal structure of the entire air defense network is no longer a hierarchical tree, but a network, each module into a network node is destroyed, another node may weaken the combat capability of the entire network, but not the traditional command structure will be destroyed in part the result of the paralyzed. This operational capability of the generation gap is especially seen in the detection / command module was destroyed in the battle, when the traditional fighting structure when this happens, there must be paralyzed combat units, combat-style structure in the network, http://www.canadagoosejackets-uk.net/ , even when a detection / command module was destroyed, firing unit can still be obtained from the network to share information, to maintain combat capability. To-air type Also has a passive infrared, active radar-guided modes and two kinds of thrust vector control. Be on fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground missiles to implement full attack. After launching the system with the ability to be all-weather operations, which can intercept multiple targets. Vertical launch type Vertical launch type If the-air type Ship empty type Its focus is on the existing platform and combat system and the organic whole. As the ship empty type MBDA&apos;s claims: the installation of air-based vertical launch of the ship, fire control system, even without a dedicated console design. This greatly reduces the space ship type Vertical launch type . And in air defense missile system for the first time two kinds of active radar and passive infrared-guided modes mixed, greatly expanded its tactics, but also a strong air defense system in the operational environment of electronic jamming countermeasures have more . From a business perspective, MBDA has developed vertical launch type main components - the missile, wheeled chassis and vertical launch systems have mass, so the fixed costs low, with low development cost, vertical launch type This country in the current context of tight defense budgets have a significant impact on sales; as Open Category: weapons, missiles,

 Pensioni, http://www.sitoufficiale-moncler.com , Emilia seconda per indennità di anzianità




Bologna, 28 ottobre 2011 - L’EMILIA Romagna, http://www.sitomonclerdonna.com , appena dopo la Lombardia, guida la classifica italiana per numero di pensioni di anzianità e baby-pensionati. E ovviamente la provincia di Bologna contribuisce in maniera massiccia. Attualmente si contano, infatti, 407.656 pensioni erogate per anzianità o vecchiaia e 18.029 prepensionamenti. Ma il dato sicuramente importante da sottolineare è la frequenza con cui ogni anno, da dieci anni a questa parte, si va in pensione con il criterio dell’anzianità (quindi dove non è necessario raggiungere la quota dei 65 anni previsti dalla legge attuale, http://www.giubbottimoncler-sito.com , ma basta avere un certo carico di contributi versati negli anni precedenti). L’anno scorso sono state 3.568 le persone che hanno raggiunto la pensione di anzianità, contro le 3.103 pensioni raggiunte per vecchiaia. Anche per quest’anno ci si aspetta un numero simile, leggermente inferiore.

SONO interessanti i dati che presentano il reddito mensile medio per tipo di pensione: per chi ha ottenuto la pensione di anzianità nel 2010, l’importo si aggira sui 1.843 euro (il picco nel 2003, con una media di 1.963 euro al mese). Mentre chi deve aspettare sino al raggiungimento della vecchiaia, le cifre si abbassano notevolmente: la media ha raggiunto il suo massimo l’anno scorso, con la cifra media di 632 euro mensili. Incrociando i dati forniti dall’Inps si può anche calcolare il peso sociale dei pensionati bolognesi, che tra pensioni e prepensionamenti costano allo Stato circa 606.111.338 euro.

DIFFICILE stabilire invece quanti siano i baby-pensionati a Bologna, perché ormai da tempo non è più possibile usufruire di quei trattamenti che furono privilegiati: oggi quei ‘baby’ non sono più tanto giovani, ma rientrano nella soglia tra i 50 e i 60 anni.? Sono comunque 447 le persone con età compresa tra i 50 e i 54 anni che ad oggi godono della pensione (in media 1999,41 euro mensili).

 Speaking of the feel of the Callaway FT Irons, the clubs do feel nice. The Sense-Sert works well. I am actually a big fan of Taylor Made&apos;s and Nickent&apos;s Tungsten Polymer Cartridges for this very reason. Every shot feels good. There is no fear of the dreaded&quot;Hogan Sting&quot;even on a mis-hit during the dead of winter. Unfortunately, the one thing the cartridgers and Sense-Serts do is deaden an extremely well struck shot as much as they do a mediocre hit. Seeing as I have a lot more mediocre hits than ones where I absolutely pure the sweet spot I guess that&apos;s okay. It keeps me close to my Taylor Mades and it works just as well on these Callaways.






If you are the right person who are in the market for a new set of irons, the Callaway FT Irons do satisfy you without any doubt. They are appraised as the most maneuverable irons from the tee; quite adept from uneven lies; creamy feel that still differentiates between center and off-center (...)


Besides, what the golfers really care is the forgiveness of the discount golf clubs. Thanks to the aforementioned Short Hosel, Extreme Perimeter Weighting, (...) , and Extreme Heel Toe Weighting, the Callaway FT Irons have a lot more forgiveness than a lot of the clubs being marketed as transitional game improvement clubs for mid-cappers looking to get to low capper or even scratch status. They have a very high MOI and very low Center of Gravity, so high launches and lack of club head twisting are innate qualities of the club itself. If you get a bad case of&quot;the shanks&quot;w/these well balanced short-hoseled clubs, you might think about sticking w/&quot;Super Game Improvement Clubs&quot;instead.



Today, this objective review aims at the one of the golf clubs online, the Callaway FT Irons, which are released in 2008 with the stylish design. In terms of target audience, they are generally aimed more at the mid to low handicap golfer, who already plays a decent and tidy golf game. Moreover, (...) , Callaway Golf has long been in the market to provide user friendly clubs, and the FT Iron series is the ultimate game improvement iron.

 Still, (...) , (...) , the American populace has broadly assented to the changes of the last 10 years, expressing willingness to trade personal liberties and national resources for a sense of safety.











Although it has faced grave national security threats in the past, the United States has been transformed as never before by the threat of terrorism since the September 11, (...) , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC.











The declared enemy in this fight is al Qaeda, a stateless organization founded in the late 1980s and motivated by a radical interpretation of Sunni Islam. Al Qaeda is led by Osama bin Laden, the son of a prominent Saudi family, and operates from bases concentrated in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and North Africa.



Certainly, the U.S. has not been alone in contending with Islamist terrorism. Al Qaeda and associated groups have killed civilians in attacks in England and Spain and a significant number of attempted attacks on airliners, airports and other sites have either been foiled by authorities while still in planning stages or interrupted in the attempt (as in the case of the attempted Christmas Day, 2009 bombing of a Detroit-bound jet and a man&apos;s attempt to set off a car bomb in Times Square, New York in May, 2010).

Critics of the so-called&quot;War on Terror&quot;say that the threat of terrorism - vague and impossible to ever fully extinguish - had been used to justify costly wars (both in terms of deficit expansion and human lives) and abuses of human rights including torture and indefinite detention without trial for alleged enemies believed but not proven to have committed terrorist acts.



The threat of new attacks on American soil and new - albeit widely debated - imperatives in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, http://www.sacburberryfrstore.com , have the led the nation into costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq lasting nearly a decade. At home, the country has reconceived its approach to security, creating a new cabinet-level department, (...) , (...) , the Department of Homeland Security, and granting sweeping new powers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and other arms of the national security complex.

爱上一个人是一件很麻烦的事，特别是你不知不觉中会为她放弃了很多事，为她做了很多事。而她却死终坚持某种东西，不肯放弃时，那你是走进一个地狱，很苦很苦。特别是到最后她却说，错的是你，这一切是你自找的。

比如感情，痛过了，才会懂得如何保护自己；傻过了，才会懂得适时的坚持与放弃,在得到与失去中我们慢慢地认识自己。其实，生活并不需要这么些无谓的执著，没有什么就真的不能割舍。学会放弃，生活会更容易。
放弃是一门艺术，它不是叫你盲目的逃避，而是要你明白痛苦的维系还不如放弃！学会放弃，在落泪以前转身离去，留下简单的背影。将昨天埋在心底，留下最美好的回忆,学会放弃，让彼此都能有个更轻松的开始，遍体鳞伤的爱并不一定就刻骨铭心, Canada Goose Store ！爱一个人，就要让他快乐，让他幸福，使那份感情更诚挚。如果你做不到，还是放手吧！放弃何尝不是另一种美丽！

 Masterchef : Une délirante parodie signée Kevin Razy, le comique à suivre




Parce que Masterchef est l&apos;émission de cuisine qui marche le mieux en ce moment à la télé, parce que TF1 cartonne avec ce programme le jeudi soir, parce qu&apos;hier soir jeudi 27 octobre, la demi-finale a vu sortir Nathalie, il fallait qu&apos;un humoriste en fasse une parodie ! Et c&apos;est le meilleur comique, spécialiste du clip ou sketch parodique de la nouvelle scène, Kevin Razy, qui s&apos;en est chargé.

Pour thème satirique, Kevin Razy et son&quot;nègre&quot;Tarik Seddak ont choisi la crise économique qui touche la Grèce, absolument d&apos;actualité. Ils ont créé Masterchef en Grèce ! C&apos;est complètement délirant, c&apos;est libre et c&apos;est un vent d&apos;air frais sur le milieu de l&apos;humour contemporain.

Kevin Razy est un jeune humoriste, certainement le plus souriant, ses vidéos sont diffusées toutes les semaines sur LCI dans la Mediasphère. Il cartonne dans ses imitations, ses détournements de chansons. C&apos;est d&apos;ailleurs à Barney Gold (sa bo?te de production, qu&apos;il a créée avec Tarik Seddak), que l&apos;on doit la version antillaise de Bref. ?a s&apos;appelle Bwef et reprend les codes de la mini-série du Grand Journal, mais dans les clichés antillais.

C&apos;est également Kevin Razy qui était derrière Sexion d&apos;Homo, http://www.gafassrayban.com , un sketch qui dénon?ait en 2010 le dérapage homophobe du groupe de rap Sexion d&apos;Assaut. Ou encore la puissante reprise de The Time des Black Eyed Peas, transformée en Ben Ali, j&apos;ai quitté mon pays, satire de la fuite du dictateur tunisien.

Tarik Seddak et Kevin Razy se sont rencontrés il y 3 ans, et ont fait leurs armes sur RNT, la radio de Direct 8. Depuis ils sont à l&apos;impulsion de cette vague de liberté virale, en opérant par vidéos sur Internet ! Orfèvres de la blague, Kevin Razy et Tarik Seddak (il faut le citer sans cesse car on le voit moins mais il est tout autant brillant) ont surfé sur l&apos;époque 2.0.

Kevin Razy, http://www.raybansaviator.com , il a une tête d&apos;acteur, http://www.carrera-lunette.com/ , il devrait d&apos;ici peu c?toyer Angelina Jolie (...) Lire la suite sur purepeople.com

Several additional students can be a go Zhixing today, said a a.m. rain also, so their wait at the station had to draw back. Just meditation people really have a lot of difficulties to face, when you face these difficulties, how would you see at.

All the way from Deyang, Mianyang, Guangyuan, Hanzhong, Foping, weeks, to Xi&apos;an, Xianyang, spent 7 days.

Hanzhong plain long flat road in the p.m. people slumberous, even become idle meantime riding http://drdrebeatsprodetox.com , collided with a truck stop mend, but also thought he was finished. Front of a dark, but after a few seconds immediately realized that this is the car parked, he was just scratched the car&apos;s hand merely. Shu Road all the way out of a lot of mountains, opening students have the vantage of speed car to the hill, lightweight car more convenient, in array to surmount the heaviness and cost of stamina seems to be not a small boo.

Students on a slovenly, turned somersaults in the cotton, cotton is better, or life died. While he seems to be extra reliable for the rough road, understand the conviction, at a time you care, the surroundings or vanquish the evil.

 , (...) “We might be able to know in advance that a person will be less able to respond to the normal challenges that come about in life, (...) ,” he said. “Then doctors may be able to intervene earlier after a traumatic life event to remove some of the debilitation of depression.”








--&gt;













Using the power of Texas Biomed’s AT&amp;T Genomics Computing Center (GCC), the researchers found the region by devising a new method for analyzing thousands of potential risk factors for this complex disease, a process that led them to a new biomarker that may be helpful in identifying people at risk for major depression.






The study also shows the potential for using this method of analyzing a multitude of heritable traits as a way to zero in on disease-causing gene variants.



Because the RNF123 expression levels can be measured relatively easily in the blood, this finding could lead to a way of identifying people at risk for major depressive disorder, Blangero said.



The research capitalized on the newest ‘deep sequencing’ technology that enables Texas Biomed scientists to search through more genetic variables. The GCC has 8,000 linked computer processors that are capable of analyzing millions of genetic variables drawn from thousands of research subjects.



Scientists at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and Yale University have identified a new target area in the human genome that appears to harbor genes with a major role in the onset of depression.



Once they found this risk factor, further analysis directed scientists to an area on chromosome 4 containing genes that appear to regulate RNF123.



The scientists used blood samples from 1,122 people enrolled in the Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study, http://www.poloralphlauren-pascher.biz , a large family study that involves people from 40 extended Mexican American families in the San Antonio area.









The study was directed by Blangero and David Glahn, (...) , Ph.D., of Yale University. It was published online in October in the journal Biological Psychiatry and supported by the National Institutes of Health.






Blangero and his colleagues looked at more than 11,000 endophenotypes, or heritable factors, (...) , and searched for the ones that were linked with the risk of major depression. They found that disease risk correlated most strongly with expression levels of a gene called RNF123, which helps regulate neuron growth.









Source: Joseph Carey, (...) , Texas Biomedical Research Institute, (...) , via EurekAlert



Major depressive disorder is one of the most common and most costly mental illnesses. Studies have estimated that up to 17 percent of Americans will suffer depression at some point in their lives. The disorder has proven to be a tough challenge for geneticists. Despite strong evidence that people can inherit a susceptibility to major depression, years of study have failed to locate any of the key genes that underlie the illness.



“We were searching for things in psychiatric disease that are the equivalent of what cholesterol is to heart disease, http://www.poloralphlaurenfrance.biz ,” said John Blangero, Ph.D., director of the GCC and a principal investigator in the study. “We wanted to find things that can be measured in everybody and that can tell you something about risk for major depression.”

 Biennale de Venise: polémique sur la nomination du nouveau président




La nomination d’un proche de Silvio Berlusconi à la tête de la Biennale de Venise, qui coiffe la Mostra de cinéma mais aussi les Biennales d’art et d’architecture, http://www.chaussuresconverse.com , faisait polémique ce vendredi en Italie, http://www.chaussuresconverse.com , tant dans l’opposition qu’au sein du conseil d’administration de l’institution. Le ministre de la Culture Giancarlo Galan, également ancien gouverneur de la région de Vénétie, a annoncé jeudi la désignation du publicitaire Giulio Malgara à la tête de la célèbre institution culturelle en remplacement de Paolo Baratta, dont le mandat arrive à terme en décembre. ?Le choix du ministre, dicté par des motifs personnels, est une erreur?, a réagi le maire de Venise Giorgio Orsoni (Parti démocrate, opposition de gauche). ?Malgara n’a jamais eu d’intérêts dans le domaine de la culture. Il n’a pas le profil?, a-t-il déploré.

Malgara, 73 ans, qui a fait toute sa carrière dans le monde de la publicité, ne dispose d’aucune expérience dans le domaine de la culture. Vénitien d’origine, http://www.todsmanshop.com/ , il a dirigé pendant 23 ans l’UPA (Utenti pubblicità associati, association des usagers de la publicité) et a entre autres fondé Auditel, la société qui relève l’audimat des programmes audiovisuels, dont il est encore président honoraire. Le recteur de la prestigieuse université d’architecture IUAV de Venise, Amerigo Restucci, l’un des quatre membres du conseil d’administration de la Biennale, s’est lui aussi dit ?très surpris?: ?Il devrait y avoir une réaction contre cette nomination (...) On aurait pu penser à un homme de culture pour succéder? à Baratta.

Ce dernier avait été nommé en 2008 après avoir déjà occupé ce poste de 1998 à 2000. Durant son mandat, il a notablement augmenté les espaces d’exposition de la Biennale et obtenu en 2011 une hausse de fréquentation de 13% de la Biennale d’Art par rapport à la dernière édition en 2009. Le ministre de la Culture a d’ailleurs dans un communiqué ?remercié vivement Paolo Baratta pour le précieux travail accompli durant les huit années passées à la (...) Lire la suite sur Liberation.fr

The old man appeared in his minds, (...) , now think of as the eyes can feel a touch of sadness, so that he can not forget how.
That night he had a dream, Wan Ying mainland collapse of broken sky, earth subsidence, the dark clouds of. Even more horrible than hell here, tens of thousands of people&apos;s lives have been harvested with, the despair of those who look deeply hurt in his heart. Old friends and family no one is immune, even chawol and Cher did not escape fate.
Purple shadow suddenly sat up, his face the tears, just a dream is so real, watching one of those people die, he should do nothing.
The romantic side of almost vomit blood, arrived on the inexplicable is this guy to the&apos;pit&apos;, the most hateful thing the guy actually fell asleep, so that they turn a half hour before circle came out, thought of that guy to do also considered a nightmare to his head.
Purplish feel have a big head, (...) , had wanted to try it, and did not even sleep last show to forget these things.
Who did not hold that out, although people can not do good but to bully it.
Romantic in the absolute number of people regarded as an alternative, soon after birth, the mainland did not happen two big events will appear on the scene, but each time as the role of spectators, never interfering.
Tokgo family has always been a single-pass pulse to God opening the eyes of this generation turned out to be twins, but bad music those antique family. Tokgo home has Fangchuhualai, whoever hurt romantic overcome located on the family. That is why the two brothers from childhood to watch never been unnecessary war spread to.
A yellow jade floating in front of the purple shadow that disappeared between two blink of an eye, even the purple shadow to see how they did not leave.
The same word, such as blow hit the purple shadow heart, is a coincidence or ... ...
Point where everything in the end, the answer seems to be revealed, there is dense fog, people Bianbu Qing authenticity.
Purple shadow to hear confused, Is the world can be divided into the authenticity of it, how the girl after hearing the ancient road it becomes strange.
step may interfere with their future destiny ... The legend also has it too in shock, almost Guards to the terrible, but fortunately it is only legend.
Han Han, then like a blockbuster long as his heart can not calm down, so the real dream, and unknown in the past, the ancient road so that he could not resist the temptation.
Purplish Xipixiaolian said, if the dream is true, (...) , then it was not as happy alleys to die, (...) , so also simply point.
Ever since two-Feng a new round of negotiations began, but the unusual trouble, and no results after a few hour.
After they are silent, then it is precisely because of this rush to leave, put the Buddha has seen his fate.
Han Han has been worried the past few days, even she did not find even for that damn worried about the guy, she had a bad feeling, If this guy to leave, then, from the day after they no longer meet.
Han Han sitting in the lake, the stones in their hands severely pound the water. Calm lake splashes spray a few feet high, one side of the Little Black eyeball trickle trickle of turning.
... ...
Little mystery in front of the purple shadow, said: Before Little finished, a golden roasted rabbit will handed over. Void split out a little dark boy, his smile said hey, purple shadow felt nausea, almost to just spit it out to eat.

Weitere 23 Menschen seien in Dörfern Süd-Syriens von Sicherheitskräften getötet worden. Da Syrien die meisten ausländischen Journalisten des Landes verwiesen hat, http://www.ralphlaurenjackende.com , ist eine unabhängige Überprüfung solcher Meldungen kaum möglich.

Die Oppositionsbewegung „Erklärung von Damaskus“ veröffentlichte in der Nacht einen Aufruf an die „schweigenden“ Gegner des Regimes. Diese sollten ihre Angst überwinden und sich den „Revolutionären“ anschließen. In der Erklärung hieß es weiter: „Denn dann erst schlägt für das Regime die Stunde der Wahrheit. Dann ist auch Schluss mit den Illusionen über den angeblich so großen Rückhalt, den (das Regime) noch in der Bevölkerung hat und dann wird die Rechnung, http://www.borsesitoufficialet.com , die von den Syrern mit ihrem Blut bezahlt werden muss, (...) , auch weniger hoch ausfallen.“

I received the brown pair first (black was backordered) and loved them. When I got the black pair, I was surprised they fit differently. They did not fit as snug and the shape didn&apos;t hold as well. I ended up keeping the brown pair (which I think looks nicer). The black pair looked a little like patent leather and was bit too shiny for my liking.As for sizing, I&apos;m normally a size 5.5-6 and I ordered a 5 which fits a little snug but I&apos;m sure after a little wear it&apos;ll flatten out a bit.I love that these are exclusive to Nordstrom.

 Just like clockwork, (...) , and yes it in no way is not able, About 6 weeks before the wedding ceremony, I buy the dilemma,&quot;What will i have intended for the big event presents?Inch Of course, there are plenty of variations in this issue, http://www.widedress.com/ , nonetheless it many boils down to young couples trying to figure out what on earth is traditional, predicted or maybe bare nice to offer to their particular family and friends along with close friends who&apos;ve served these with their particular wedding ceremony course of action. Sad to say, you don&apos;t see any rules to simply answer this, however below are a few guidelines We have continually utilized with to help you the confused couple.

1.Partnership. Take into consideration ones relationship towards the maid of honor. Recall, almost all presents don&apos;t have to become the same. Using the more time in order to ponder what makes your marriage specific plus supplying your wine connoisseur an elegant vino operator instead of the identical couple of flip-flops you provided your rose girl will mean much more! There are many approaches to tailor-make your own surprise in addition, which we&apos;re going to touch on yearly round. In case you and also your best friend are actually buddies for several years, look for a denoting second with your marriage that is certainly pleased along with memorable you can lead to a present, for instance a lovely photograph figure that has a photograph person trying to play wedding day be Seven calendar year olds!

2.Choices. Very simple initials with window keyrings, initialed or monogrammed luggage, http://www.widedress.com/ , along with&quot;title&quot;hand bags are perfect solutions to add a individual touching to be able to on a daily basis objects ones bash members can utilize. Lovable facial foundation hand bags and also toiletry baggage can be purchased online providers for instance Beau-Coup additionally, on WedSpace. There are so many amazing options available and options are usually endless.

3.Bling. You cant ever go wrong with a little *sparkle*. Studs and also wallet designer watches will be cool choices to give the guys, http://www.widedress.com/ , though especially designed jewelry for that women to put on right then and there within your wedding party is going to be loved to get twelve months in addition to season, and greatest of the, they could be made use of once more! Necklaces does not need to can be expensive. Basic gold and also rare metal bangles or even drop very necklaces inside your hues to (...) go along with the get-togethers attire or perhaps sarees absolutely are a specific hint. Monogrammed cufflinks for men for the men&apos;s&apos;suits are available from reasonably priced prices likewise.

4.For celebration. In case you and also your fianc?? get unusual celebrities, use it to your benefit. Try to remember, your day can be a get together of you being a couple of, so what superior means than to give your current bash associates something to really recall people through. Are not able to think about nearly anything? Are you currently both cabinet The twilight series supporters? Consider offering the social gathering a collection of creature of the night fangs and also a lovely little jewellery box coffin to store all of them around! Can you both (...) equally appreciate meade or beer? Why don&apos;t you make your own property order as well as bottle of wine around beautiful bottle of wine using a please note to be able to uncork on the 5th anniversary, http://www.widedress.com/ !

5.Styles. I recently adore the concept of including your motif completely from start to finish with your working day! When you&apos;ve got hawaiian isle topic, make sure ones party will be fitted however you like along with special fresh flower leis along with perhaps bright in addition to cool colored sandals resorts in jamaica! Issues adopted a far more detailed theme, for example a renaissance or even Victorian design, your present is actually a straightforward as letting attires for your bash to wear to your occasion, or possibly begging alongside the all inclusive costs.

 Latest Foreclosures, http://www.saclancel-fr.com , Mortgages News


But now, the foreclosure crisis is spreading to homeowners with good credit who took out safe, fixed-rate mortgages.











Allegations of faulty foreclosure paperwork will likely increase the foreclosure inventory into 2011, the Mortgage Bankers Association has estimated. Several major lenders temporarily suspended foreclosures to review thousands of cases for improper handling. Attorney generals in all 50 states launched a joint investigation into the issue.
























That&apos;s nearly twice the $133 billion Fannie and Freddie were in line to receive from taxpayers as of November 2010 and would make theirs the costliest bailout of the financial crisis.



As of November 2010, Fannie and Freddie together have repaid $16.7 billion as dividends to the Treasury Department.











Many homeowners have complained that the government mortgage-aid program is a bureaucratic nightmare. They say that banks often lose their documents and then claim borrowers did not send back the necessary paperwork. The banking industry contends that borrowers are not sending back their paperwork.







That will continue to weigh on home values because foreclosures are sold at deep discounts and slow the country&apos;s housing recovery.























Dubious mortgage practices and lax lending standards were blamed for contributing to a housing bubble that eventually burst and thrust the economy from 2007-2009 into the worst recession since the 1930s. Many Americans took out home loans that they didn&apos;t understand and bought homes that they couldn&apos;t afford. As a result, foreclosures have soared to record highs. It&apos;s one of the negative forces restraining the economy&apos;s ability to get back on sounder footing.







However, this will only delay foreclosure sales coming on to the market, not stop them. Lenders are on track to take back more than 1 million homes in 2010, according to foreclosure listing service RealtyTrac Inc.



The government rescued McLean, (...) , Va.-based Freddie and Washington-based Fannie nearly two years ago to cover their losses on soured mortgage loans, and it estimates the bailouts will cost taxpayers up to $259 billion.





















Separately, (...) , an Obama administration foreclosure-prevention program intended to help those at risk of foreclosure by lowering their monthly mortgage payments. But the Treasury Department reports that the effort is still plagued by high failure rates.





During the next year, lawmakers plan to review the nation&apos;s mortgage-lending system and consider a potential replacement for government-controlled mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The financial overhaul signed by President Obama in July didn&apos;t address that issue, http://www.borseburberrysito.com , despite protests from Republicans that it was incomplete without such a plan.







The foreclosure crisis started years ago when borrowers took out risky loans with variable interest rates that they couldn&apos;t afford. Many also qualified for mortgages without providing documented proof of income.















The housing market, (...) , however, remains a huge challenge. High unemployment, tepid economic growth, (...) , tight credit and uncertainty about home prices have kept people from buying.







Fannie and Freddie buy up home loans from lenders, bundle them together into securities with a guarantee against default and sell them to investors worldwide. They own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million home loans, which is worth more than $5 trillion. They buy home loans from lenders, package them into bonds with a guarantee against default and sell them to investors.

 (AP) WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama and his allies in the Senate promise to press ahead with separate votes on pieces of his failed $447 billion jobs measure despite unanimous opposition from Republicans. But there also are signs of slippage among Democrats and evidence the strategy isn&apos;t working with voters.

Future votes on individual pieces of the measure, however, aren&apos;t likely to fare better than a pared-back jobs measure designed to boost hiring of teachers and first responders that Republicans and a handful of Democrats scuttled on Thursday.

Obama&apos;s revised plan failed on a 50-50 test vote that fell well short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster. Three Democrats abandoned Obama on the vote and two more who voted with the president said they couldn&apos;t support the underlying Obama plan unless it&apos;s changed.

Thursday&apos;s $35 billion measure combined $30 billion for state and local governments to hire teachers and other school workers with $5 billion to help pay the salaries of police officers, firefighters and other first responders. The White House says the measure would&quot;support&quot;almost 400,000 education jobs for one year. Republicans call that a temporary&quot;sugar high&quot;for the economy and say it&apos;s a taxpayer-funded bailout of state and local governments.

Obama and his Democratic allies are acting like they&apos;ve found a winning issue in repeatedly pressing popular ideas such as infrastructure spending and boosting hiring of police officers and firefighters. The sluggish economy and lower tax revenues have caused many teachers&apos;jobs to be cut over the past several years.

&quot;For the second time in two weeks, every single Republican in the United States Senate has chosen to obstruct a bill that would create jobs and get our economy going again,&quot;Obama said in a statement after the vote.&quot;Every American deserves an explanation as to why Republicans refuse to step up to the plate and do what&apos;s necessary to create jobs and grow the economy right now.&quot;

&quot;We cannot afford to be bailing out local governments, and we can&apos;t afford stimulus 2.0,&quot;countered Sen. Marco Rubio, (...) , R-Fla.

Democrats haven&apos;t said which piece they&apos;ll resurrect next as an individual bill, but there&apos;s widespread support among party members for spending on highway and bridge projects, as well as for a poll-tested financing mechanism — a surcharge on income exceeding $1 million.

An AP-GfK poll taken Oct. 13-17 found 62 percent of respondents favoring the surcharge as a way to pay for jobs initiatives. Just 26 percent opposed the idea.

More ominously for Democrats, the poll shows that Obama&apos;s party has lost the faith of the public on handling the economy. In it, only 38 percent said they trust Democrats to do a better job than Republicans in handling the economy, the first time Democrats have fallen below 40 percent in the poll. Some 43 percent trust the Republicans more.

&quot;The fact is we&apos;re not going to get this economy going again by growing the government. It&apos;s the private sector that&apos;s ultimately going to drive this recovery,&quot;Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.&quot;Look, if big government were the key to economic growth, (...) , then countries like Greece would be booming right now.&quot;

Democrats Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut broke with Obama on Thursday&apos;s vote. Two Democrats who voted with the president, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, (...) , said they couldn&apos;t support the underlying Obama plan unless it&apos;s changed.

&quot;This bill fails to give taxpayers any guarantee that this money would actually be used to hire teachers and invest in our schools,&quot;Tester said.&quot;States would get loads of money with little guidance that they spend the money on teachers.&quot;

Immediately after the vote on Obama&apos;s plan, Democrats turned the tables and filibustered Republican-backed legislation that would prevent the government from withholding 3 percent of payments to government contractors. The legislation failed to get the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster on a 57-43 vote, even though 10 Democrats voted to advance it.

Many Democrats and Obama support the idea but opposed it Thursday because it would be paid for with $30 billion in cuts from domestic agency spending. Advocates of repealing the withholding requirement say it will help create jobs, especially from contractors on large projects with smaller profit margins.

The withholding law was passed in 2006 by a GOP-controlled Congress. Then, the idea then was to make sure contractors couldn&apos;t duck their taxes and was imposed after government investigators found that thousands of federal contractors owed taxes.

The GOP-controlled House is likely to pass the measure next week and Reid promised that the Senate would revisit the issue, though there&apos;s likely to be a split between the House and Senate over how to pay for the cost of repealing the withholding rule.

After voting on the competing jobs measures, the Senate worked past midnight on a $128 billion spending bill covering five Cabinet departments.

Early Friday, the Senate voted 84-15 to end direct payments to farmers whose annual incomes exceed $1 million.

 Pour Netflix, ? le marché est un peu trop régulé ? en France




Oui, Netflix devrait arriver en France t?t ou tard. Mais sauf surprise, http://www.louisvuitton-borseit.com , les Fran?ais ne seront pas les premiers européens à tester le fameux service américain. La faute à une régulation un peu trop contraignante à en croire Netflix, interrogée par Le Figaro et relayé par FrenchWeb.? Nous irons partout ? a tenu à assurer Ted Sarandos, qui s&apos;occupe de l&apos;acquisition du contenu chez Netflix. ? Mais il reste à en déterminer l&apos;ordre (NDLR : des pays qui seront concernés par l&apos;arrivée de Netflix). Nous nous concentrons sur les marchés où l&apos;Internet haut débit est avancé et où le contexte économique nous est favorable. En France, pour l&apos;instant, http://www.louisvuitton-borseit.com , le marché est un peu trop régulé. ?

Le problème n&apos;est donc pas la qualité des lignes en France, d&apos;autant plus qu&apos;elles sont illimitées (pour l&apos;instant) contrairement à d&apos;autres pays, mais plut?t les lois encadrant le contenu vidéo. Rémi Tereszkiewicz, le directeur général délégué de Videofutur, nous expliquait d&apos;ailleurs en juin dernier toute la problématique :

? Aujourd&apos;hui, construire une offre purement SVOD à l&apos;instar de ce que propose Netflix depuis quelque temps n&apos;est pas possible en France. La restriction des contenus à 36 mois et plus, imposée par la règlementation, empêche d&apos;inclure dans l&apos;offre des films récents qui représentent pourtant la grande majorité des consommations. Et le choix proposé sur ces titres anciens n&apos;est pas assez important pour apporter une promesse d&apos;exhaustivité, comme le DVD peut le faire. ?

En attendant une possible évolution des règles en France, (...) , Netflix compte bien ne pas s&apos;arrêter au continent Américain, où il est quasi intégralement présent. Et l&apos;Espagne semble plut?t bien placé, ce qui confirmerait les actualités de juin dernier.

? Nous sommes, en revanche, plus intéressés par l&apos;Espagne qui est ravagée par la piraterie ? a ainsi confirmé Ted Sarandos. ? Car nous avons les outils pour y répondre. ? (...) Lire la suite sur PCInpact.com

 One hundred and twelfth met your mother mother battle
They settled in the Zhong Tao Court House, after driving a Porsche Lu Yu, Tian Yani&apos;s Blossom returned alone villa. The whole house is quiet, no one. Lu Yu walked upstairs, walked toward his room.
An open door, a white shadow immediately leapt to the shoulders of Lu Yu, (...) , who is not white. White as if they grew up some, the wolf goes lovely face is in intimate wear fondle Lu Yu&apos;s face. A pair of brown eyes of the wolf, the light flashed grievances, like the missing three days in a strange land buildings generally.
To appease a small white feather in the face on the pat domesticated hen, Lu Yu took out his cell phone from the bed. Point to open a look, ah, did not answer the phone but also a lot. A village out, there are two unknown calls, I do not know who is calling. Lu Yu surprise is that, even white Qiang took the initiative to give yourself two telephone calls.
See the white phone Qiang, Lu Yuli that the decision, give her back the phone. As for the two unknown calls, the first care.
Think of it, called the white-Qiang Lu Yu the phone.
Hear the words of Lu Yu, the other end of the phone was silent for a moment, then a woman&apos;s voice came over from the phone, not the white Qiang sound. This sounds Duoliaoyifen lovely, the girl would be less crisp.
Lu Yu heard this sound, Somewhat taken aback, said, Upon hearing this, Lu Yu surprised not help, turned out to battle Mother Mother. Khan, although he would like and that white Qiang Han, but they&apos;ve seen a total of both sides, not to the point where it, how to battle Mother Mother have emerged.
Although turning these thoughts in his head, but Lu Yu mouth is not to be on the slow, quickly said, Lu Yu Qiang mother heard the words of the white, hard mouth and swallowed saliva, should said Lu Yu know Tongshan drums, is a park in the name of the applicant city.
Hung up the phone, Lu Yu deep breath, and began to pack up their full come. Ah, see the battle Mother Mother, the first impression is very important.
Copper Mountain drums, driving a Porsche Lu Yu slowly into the park entrance, just stopped the car and a leather suit, his face with glasses, in the hands of a man holding a bag, they welcome over, for just under Lu Yu asked the car Lu Yu heard this man, then, nothing left eyes flashed, then the alert said, Lu Yu is not beyond the control of vigilance, it is that Lu Yu was kidnapped in Burma experience, to engage in fear, (...) , and Chuang, coupled with a warning. Think about it, a stranger, suddenly leans in front of you to say your name, can not doubt it.
This man is obviously very smart, Lu Yu&apos;s face to see the alert, quickly explained, Ah, the battle with the mother how your mother had a male secretary, secretary to see this scrub, very small white face of the potential future of the old battle will be assured. Bai Qiang, she does not name the white bar.
Think of it, Lu Yu not deep thought, (...) , too evil, he becomes so when the evil, and must be led astray by my village tomorrow.
Chuang, poor, and back once to bear the blame.
This man do not know the evil Lu Yu the idea of ​​turning the hearts of Lu Yu said, Lu Yu of the strange man said, Man heard the words of Lu Yu, pointed to Porsche&apos;s license plate, said Our ancestors said, Know thyself, know yourself. But well aware of their own battle Mother Mother, Mother Mother is their antithesis ignorant. To see your mother this Mother driving potential battle, but also with the Secretary, will certainly want to come as extraordinary.
Bai Qiang&apos;s family background, is very simple.
Not the origin, and Lu Yu heart suddenly uncomfortable, (...) , because they have been investigated, or because their white Qiang did not tell her family background, land and buildings are also confused.
Copper Mountain has a drum in the lake, lake center built water Xiedan Ting, is dedicated to those people who tired to play with the rest. However, to this water Xiedan Ting, the need to take a dragon boat is sitting for money.
Have to praise one, creating wealth. We come out to play, naturally not for this little money, and bad mood. And to Copper Mountain to play drums, mostly young men and women in love. This time, the majority of fellow men, nature will not be his girlfriend in front of petty.
Boat to sit shiting, mother mother followed a war secretary, Lu Yu came to a graceful lady in front of the Secretary of the battle that lady mother Mother Gong Sheng Road, Mother heard the secretary of war, then the mother, Lu Yu know this lady is in front of their future battle mother Mother, mother of the white-Qiang. But see her at the age of appearance, clarity and White by Qiang looks somewhat similar, but immature white Qiang to some, like the still slightly unripe apples. And she is mature, like a ripe peach.
Lu Yu know, white-Qiang at the age calculation, the front of this lady, at least in the four-ish, but the watch looks like she has only three years old, is clearly an excellent maintenance.
Yu looked white lady in the land when the white lady also looked at the landing Yu. Looks pretty handsome, attitudes reasonable manner, a black suit, while not fancy hand-made, but also considered the body. Overall, this young man fairly well, and some said intelligence does not match.
However, the difference will not want to come too.
Think of this, the White Lady to see the landing Yu, faint, Lu Yu made this time even some of their tension, overflowing palms sweat. Hear the words of the White Lady, Lu Yu quickly said

Until recently, most skin care products around the world have contained preservatives that enhance skin aging. However, new skin care technology has amplified and there are now a few distinctive skin care ranges on the market that have eradicated preservatives with the goal to support the skins state of wellness and protect the skin from premature aging. ( ).

Look at the hydration rates of the skin care product you are using and the clinical proven results.

A new water-based skincare line hydrates the skin by 80% afterward only one use and uses the technology of glyconutrients (plant based nutrients) to carry the water to the skin cell and clutch it in. This dramatically reduces wrinkles. Research also shows that glyconutrients in skin care products stamp the skin keeping in the water and keeping harmful units out, averaging skin cells will be regenerated and skin can return to be like a babies bottom.



So use a skin care line that hydrates and uses safe carrier nutrients to fight the apparent signs of aging by reducing wrinkles nigh your eyes http://www.genuineuggsaleuk.co.uk , mouth and forehead.


STEP 4. Nourish your skin with healthy ingredients

This is the basis of a preservative free skincare product line.



STEP 5. Use A Wrinkle Cream That Is Proven To Work

 Android&apos;);&quot;&gt;Android-App, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com (...) verlangten bei einer Auktion spanischer Staatsanleihen eine Rekord-Prämie von 6,975 Prozent Zinsen – die höchste seit der Einführung des Euro. Auf dem Zweitmarkt kletterten italienische Papiere wieder über die kritische Marke von sieben Prozent Zinsen, die Portugal, Irland und Griechenland unter den Rettungsschirm gebracht hatte. Spanien wählt am Sonntag ein neues Parlament. Ein Regierungswechsel von den Sozialisten zu den Konservativen gilt den Umfragen zufolge als sicher.

Spaniens Ministerpräsident José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero forderte eine Intervention der Europäischen Union und der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB). Die EU müsse unverzüglich eine Antwort auf die internationale Krise geben, sagte Zapatero. „Jetzt bedarf es einer europäischen Zentralbank, die auch wirklich ihrem Namen gerecht wird und die gemeinsame Währung verteidigt.“

Spanien habe Kompetenzen an den EU-Ministerrat, http://www.borsesitoufficialet.com , an die EU-Kommission und die EZB abgegeben. Daher müssten diese Instanzen nun auch reagieren. „Europa muss eine Antwort auf die Krise geben und dafür sorgen, dass die Stabilität zurückkehrt“, betonte Zapatero.

Händlern zufolge kaufte die Europäische Zentralbank spanische und italienische Papiere, um die Zinsen zu dämpfen. Auch Frankreich musste höhere Zinsen zahlen. Für Zweijahres-Anleihen kletterten sie auf 1,85 Prozent, nach 1,31 Prozent im Oktober. Fünfjährige Anleihen stiegen von 2,31 Prozent auf 2,82 Prozent.

Druck auf Belgien Gleichzeitig erhöhte die EU-Kommission den Druck auf Belgien, seine Finanzen zu sanieren. Während sich die Haushaltsverhandlungen in Brüssel offensichtlich dem Ende näherten, bekräftigte ein Sprecher von EU-Währungskommissar Olli Rehn die Forderung an das Land, sein Haushaltsdefizit 2012 auf unter drei Prozent zu senken.

Der Bundeshaushalt profitiert massiv von der Flucht der Investoren in die Sicherheit. Die gestiegene Nachfrage nach deutschen Staatsanleihen beschere der Bundesfinanzagentur „ein Luxusproblem“, sagte ihr Leiter Carl Heinz Daube. Denn die Zinsen sinken. Sie fielen in den vergangenen Wochen unter zwei Prozent.

Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) sagte in Berlin, wer glaube, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB) könne das Problem der Euro-Schwäche lösen, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , der liege nicht richtig. Die Euro-Krise erfordere eine politische Lösung. Wirtschaftsminister Philipp Rösler (FDP) verlangte, die EZB solle keine Staatsanleihen kaufen.

Wie lange schaut die EZB zu?Die EZB dürfte aber bereit sein, die Anleihekäufe im Notfall deutlich auszuweiten. Commerzbank-Chefvolkswirt Jörg Krämer sagte: „Wir glauben, dass die EZB massiv eingreifen würde, wenn die Währungsunion bedroht wäre. Wir glauben aber nicht, dass sie sich öffentlich dazu bekennen würde.“

„Wir glauben immer noch, http://www.borsesitoufficialet.com , dass die EZB eher zu einem kraftvolleren Eingreifen bereit wäre, (...) , als einen Zusammenbruch des Euroraums zu riskieren“, sagte auch Holger Schmieding, Chefvolkswirt der Berenberg Bank. Allerdings bedeute der Widerstand von Merkel und Bundesbankpräsident Jens Weidmann, dass die Hürde hierfür hoch liege. „Deshalb glauben wir, dass solche Interventionen wirklich erst als allerletzte Möglichkeit in Betracht gezogen werden.“

Wirtschaftsweise warnt vor selbsterfüllender Prophezeiung Die Wirtschaftsweise Beatrice Weder di Mauro warnte davor, dass eine Pleite Italiens zu einer sich selbst erfüllenden Prophezeiung werden könnte. Zwar sei Italien unter den entsprechenden Voraussetzungen in der Lage, seine Schulden zurückzuzahlen, sagte sie in Berlin. Wenn Rom aufgrund der Zweifel der Finanzmärkte aber über längere Zeit hohe Zinsen zahlen müsse, dann bedrohe dies die Solvenz des Landes.

 Enfants et ordinateurs : plut?t doués pour décoder les aboiements de chiens




Des chercheurs hongrois se sont livrés à plusieurs expériences pour mieux comprendre... notre compréhension des aboiements de chien. Il s&apos;avère que, dans ce domaine, les enfants et les algorithmes informatiques sont plus doués que nous.

Pe?ter Pongraacz et Csaba Molnar, de l&apos;Université Eotvos Lorand de Budapest, ont demandé à des enfants de 6, 8 et 10 ans, ainsi qu&apos;à des adultes, d&apos;écouter des aboiements de chiens enregistrés dans diverses circonstances - avertissement lors de l&apos;arrivée d&apos;un intrus, (...) , épisode de jeu, appel de solitude, etc. sans leur dire toutefois à quelle circonstance chaque aboiement correspondait. Puis ils leur ont fait associer ces cris canins à des images montrant des mimiques faciales (humaines) correspondantes.

Résultats : les enfants, http://www.sacslongchampspaschere.com , surtout ceux de 10 ans, se sont montrés plus performants que les adultes à ce petit jeu et ont attribué aux aboiements des mimiques faciales qui correspondaient davantage aux émotions exprimés par les chiens.&quot;Ceci montre que la capacité de compréhension des états émotionnels basiques des chiens à partir de signaux acoustiques est présente chez les humains à partir d&apos;un très jeune age&quot;, soulignent les auteurs.

Mais pour en savoir plus, les chercheurs ont également réalisé une autre expérience : soumettre au même exercice un algorithme informatique, avec 6.000 aboiements issus de 14 chiens différents dans 6 circonstances possibles : alerte, bagarre, promenade, solitude, (...) , (...) , jeu avec une balle, autre jeu. La machine a ainsi obtenu 43% de réussite (préférentiellement avec les sons&apos;alerte&apos;et&apos;bagarre&apos;), ce qui suggère une différence acoustique objective entre les différents signaux. Enfin, http://www.saclongchampifr.com/ , s&apos;agissant simplement de distinguer et reconna?tre la voix de chaque chien, l&apos;ordinateur a obtenu le score honorable de 52%, (...) , alors que les humains sont pratiquement incapables de le faire.

to solve the case from the incident, Wang Biao, frankly, the case incredible.


Accordingly, the only possibility is that an outsider crime, the office of the police surveillance video quickly became the place to start.




2005 One day in the evening 6:30, (...) , 11th floor office, colleagues are gone, little more than 20-year-old girl in (a pseudonym) left alone in the office on the QQ.






man took a small paper bag of cash and mobile phones, slipped.

mere 2 seconds of surveillance video, police started needle in the haystack in the vast sea, but surprised to discover that the suspect has been arrested; trial, the suspects confessed that he just want to find the money. May be why he office of the unknown to the girl brutal start, on impulse, or otherwise he was?


exclusive









But holding a glimmer of hope, or to several areas of drug addiction by the end, only the smallest, with only twenty or thirty people Panlong addiction treatment center. Panlong go to the treatment center, organized more than 20 strong ring staff view the video, but still nobody knows. was about to go home, ran into an addiction treatment center pull six or seven strong medical staff ring back. have gone, we did not hold any hope Take the video to show them I did not expect a strong warning staff said:&apos;This man I recognize! absolutely recognize! he is drug use, and it is I grew up with children of Lee Kun textile workers,&apos;really a surprise to all the police task force.




Lee Love was injured twice on drug absorption



by the police investigation, Lee is really a drug addict, and the days after the incident did not go home. friends and neighbors have been due to other things the Public Security Bureau arrested.


no drugs before, Lee was an ordinary worker, office of a girlfriend. Later, the girlfriend he was too poor economic conditions, left him. Lee suffered hurt feelings on the choice of online chat this spiritual sustenance. During his courtship with a girl Banna. They met a few faces in the real world, Lee is the girl dreaming. Stay together for the girl with Banna, Kunming, Lee quit his job, with money going to Banna. Unexpectedly, (...) , the girl&apos;s parents know that Lee is no fixed career, firmly opposed to her contacts with Lee.


After a few seconds, shut the door and crashed. Small text that is tracing out closed man&apos;s voice, but she did not expect a knife to her neck, directly wiping ... ...





lady just shouted: Guard pending further inquiries, a taxi to his gallop in front of the driver to the patrol police, said: Lee wanted to bugger off, the driver saw him no money, U-turn on a sharp turn back to the Lee place.


Little Man has a boyfriend named Little Ming (a pseudonym). Although small text often quarreled with her boyfriend, but still love the small heart Xiao Ming text. See Little Man did not come home late, the phone off, Bob is very angry, and 11 phone calls a small text friends, friends who can not and small text together. Later, the small text of my colleagues told Bob, we all leave the text is still small office Internet.


Kunming Police Force, the legendary thousands of cases. This month&apos;s




that Lee was arrested, how will it?












video can be seen by men thin stature, http://www.saclongchamponline.com , and some upper bodies bent hunched, wearing a difference. Police speculated that this person will not be drug addicts? For a little money to take such a big risk?


At this point, knock on the door outside the office rang. With the lock ring, a man&apos;s voice from behind:




Wang Biao, said that a few years, not many drug users in Kunming, the police have only a silhouette with this video just to please a home drug addiction treatment center to identify participants.








News



After analysis, the incident time should be 19:00 or so. Broad daylight, the suspect selected a crowded office there are certain risks of crime and crime suspects choose 11 floor, with small money and not in the text will not be an acquaintance of crime? However, after the small text lifetime relationships with colleagues in the investigation, they did not committed crimes.






chief correspondent Jing-Jing Liu



persuaded their parents, the girl offered to cut off contacts with Lee. The break up, Lee will no doubt be nothing abyss. Later, Lee low self-esteem on drug absorption, the original of savings to be spent, he began surreptitiously.






inauguration of the office next to the small text home banking. Day of the incident, Lee wanted to rob a person collect the money. At that time, (...) , he followed a wear gold and silver get money woman on the office elevator. Unexpectedly, the woman in the elevator with a man talking and laughing together in the 9th floor of the elevator. See the other two people, Lee is only 11 to the elevator downstairs, and a 11th floor office in front of the cruise. Sneaked into the office of a small paper, I saw only a small article in Lee ready Qiangdian things. Small text can come back, a look from the side - this is the Internet name of the girl, actually Ganchangcunduan Banna and his girl looks like a mold carved out like. At that moment, Lee brain blank, mysteriously, filled with anger, he pulled out a dagger stabbed to unsuspecting small text ... ...



police ruled out an acquaintance of crime





Kunming, a 11th floor office, a strange girl died. Is an acquaintance or a stranger from a murderous crime?


until more than 2 am the next day, Xiao Ming is still not found a small paper, went to look for office space, (...) , office space may have been closing the door. One night to find out had a small polished anger, and gradually transformed into anxiety. Little Man in the end gone? Will there be unexpected?

 Wittig urged UN members to support&quot;the strong and remarkable stance&quot;taken by the Arab League, especially its efforts to end the violence.



It went ahead with the suspension after rejecting Syrian amendments to its plan to send monitors to the country.



It is expected to be adopted when the committee, which includes all 193 UN member states, votes on Tuesday afternoon.



It would have been the first legally binding resolution adopted by the council since Assad&apos;s military began using tanks and soldiers against protesters in mid-March.



Wittig told the committee the international community must respond to the&quot;terrible atrocities&quot;in Syria, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , where the UN estimates that 3500 have been killed, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , and&quot;the current grave and systematic violations of human rights.&quot;



Ambassador Bashar Ja&apos;afari said Britain, France and Germany are&quot;suffering from Syria-phobia&quot;.



Wittig said 60 countries are co-sponsoring the resolution including Syria&apos;s fellow Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , Morocco and Bahrain, and neighbour Turkey, which has been outspoken in its criticism of President Bashar Assad&apos;s eight-month crackdown on civilians.



The draft calls on Syrian authorities&quot;to immediately put an end to all human rights violations&quot;and protect the population.



He spoke at a meeting of the General Assembly&apos;s human rights committee on Monday after Germany&apos;s UN Ambassador Peter Wittig introduced the non-binding resolution.



Germany, Britain and France turned to the General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, after Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution they sponsored last month that threatened sanctions if Syria didn&apos;t immediately halt its crackdown.



Wittig has said a General Assembly human rights resolution&quot;is no substitute for council action&quot;.



The draft resolution calls on Syrian authorities to implement the Arab initiative, http://www.louisvuittonborser.com , agreed to earlier this month,&quot;without further delay&quot;.



It calls for the withdrawal of government tanks from the streets, the release of political prisoners, a halt to attacks on civilians and allowing observers in.



Assad&apos;s regime blames the country&apos;s unrest on armed gangs carrying out a foreign agenda that seeks to destabilise Syria.



Syria&apos;s UN ambassador has accused European powers of declaring political and diplomatic war against his country by sponsoring a UN resolution that would condemn Syria&apos;s human rights violations.



Diplomats say that with the deteriorating situation in Syria, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , there may be another attempt to win approval for a council resolution.



It&quot;strongly condemns the continued grave a systematic human rights violations by the Syrian authorities, http://www.monsterbeatsn.com , such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters and human rights defenders...&quot;



Ja&apos;afari said the resolution was introduced&quot;in the context of declaring a political and media and diplomatic war on my country.&quot;



The European sponsors decided to press for the resolution after the 22-member Arab League decided last week to suspend Damascus over the crackdown and threatened economic sanctions if the regime continued to violate an Arab-brokered peace plan.





The uprising has been largely peaceful, but has grown increasingly militarised with army defectors fighting back and some protesters taking up arms.

 {RKEY},Face-to-face communication, heart-to-heart exchanges,{RKEY}Face-to-face communication, heart-to-heart exchanges By Li Weina (People&apos;s Daily Online)
Updated: 2010-06-22 10:30 2010-06-22 10:30:44.0Li WeinaFace-to-face communication, heart-to-heart exchangesStraits Forum,taiwan,exchange,Face-to-face communication, heart-to-heart exchanges,ties, http://www.achatdoudounemcler.biz/ ,fujian11036722Domestic Affairs2@webnews/enpproperty--&gt;
A week-long Second Straits Forum, http://www.classiquelvspeedy.biz/ ，which is in session from last Saturday through Friday (June 19-25) in the city of Xiamen in east China&apos;s Fujian province, http://www.mclerdoudounesoldes.biz/ , would have about 30 upcoming events in this east China coastal city and about eight other adjacent regions, known as the ancestral home of Taiwan compatriots. The eyesight of people across the Straits has set on the ongoing forum, and so the mainland&apos;s West Strait Economic Zone is truly worthy of a principal economic player.

When the second unofficial cross-strait forum was in its preparatory phase, http://www.bayswateralexa.biz/ , a sincere invitation letter was extended to various social strata in Taiwan and representatives at the grassroots levels, and Taiwan compatriots were urged to meet with their mainland peers at their ancestral home in late June. There has been an enthusiastic response to the invitation, which came from Taiwan compatriots, people in central and southern Taiwan, as well as Taiwanese aborigines and personnel from social groups.

Top official urges deeper cross-Strait ties

Moreover, the Second Straits Forum has become a hot&quot;feast&quot;for media coverage, and it has so far drawn more than 100 reporters from eight Taiwan media outlets.

The First Strait Forum, also held in Fujian province in 2009, http://www.doudounemclersoldes.biz/ , received more than 8,000 guests from Taiwan. A year later, about 80 percent of the Taiwan participants at the forum are non-officials and more than 60 percent are from central and southern Taiwan, http://www.popularlouisvbags.biz/ , according to earlier media reports. The Second Straits Forum has very rich contents, with 10 additional boundary markers as compared to its preceding one held in 2009, and people across the Straits are much more enthusiastic and mutually responsive in their cross-straits activities.

During the second&quot;carnival&quot;of cross-straits exchanges, many Taiwanese have come on their first trip to the mainland. Some have come to find their roots or renew ties, or to visit their relatives or friends, while some others have come for top attractions, scenic viewing, culture or entertainment. With a very lively, http://www.aveccoin.biz/ , joyous mood, more participants are fascinated in cross-straits exchanges, http://www.monogrammedenim.biz/ , and the scope of their exchanges have widened substantially.

Approximately 80 percent of Taiwan compatriots originate in the mainland&apos;s Fujian province. As a matter of fact, there is only a strip of water separating the mainland and the island province. Man-made impediments owing to by decades of confrontation after 1949 has, nevertheless, made people across the Straits drift apart and further alienating. This is not what people across the Straits want to see. Contact face-to-face can reduce or avert their mutual misunderstanding, and all bias will withdraw or be removed with heart-to-heart exchanges.

What is exactly the situation on the Chinese mainland today, and what are things like in Taiwan at present? Let people from across the Straits feel or experience themselves. Consensuses are much more likely to reach with each and every more encounter. Accumulations arising from the seemingly quantitative changes could be the basis on which to build the lasting peace as aspired by public sentiments across the Straits.

The week-long Straits Forum, now in its second year, would feature 25 activities. With this year&apos;s theme,&quot;Focus on livelihood benefits both sides of the Straits&quot;, the forum has gathered residents from across the Strait to renew friendship and discuss various aspects of cooperation and joint action plans on agriculture,Face-to-face communication, heart-to-heart exchanges, tourism, banking, investment, trade, communications and business management.

The resources in Fujian and Taiwan are highly mutually complementary, http://www.classiquesdoudoune.biz/ , and there is a vast room for their cooperation. For decades, http://www.achetersacgucci.com/ , the restrictive order of Taiwan authorities has contained the footsteps for cooperation and a win-win outcome between both players on both sides of the Straits.

Paces for across-Strait exchange and cooperation have turned increasingly wider, greater and faster along with vital changes having taken place in Taiwan in recent years, and new opportunities have arrived particularly with the promulgation of State Council documents in May 2009 to support Fujian to developed the economic zone west of the Taiwan Straits (i.e.&quot;Economic Zone&quot;). In such a situation, more and more Taiwan business people have their sights set on the Chinese mainland and come to seek opportunities that can be materialized.

How can industries on both sides of the Straits connect more directly, and the Straits Forum has provided a very useful platform to study the cross-Strait economic and trade cooperation as well as cross-Straits policies in this regard; even closer and more benign cross-Strait interaction will benefit people on the both sides of the Straits eventually.

Behind the mixed feelings of both surprise and joy evidenced at the forum, it is indeed the high evaluation and endorsement of the people across the Straits for their hard-won cross-Strait exchanges, and it is even more crucial to appreciate and understand fully their feelings and their longstanding expectations for the future.

A netizen told reporters on the Internet, all kinds of items at low prices, as long as the merchandise in the store to see, almost all found in the shop, and many of the same type of similar goods shop, shopping can be easily shop around.

Enjoy easy shopping.

traditional shopping more consumer protection


online shopping approach, while stylish, convenient, but it is also a University in Hefei, Wuhu girl Liu Ying said last month that he picked and chose the Internet to buy a book called genuine, hand delivery, after a look inside the book there are many typos, and even missing pages, and sellers return, the seller did not recognize the life and death is pirated.

industry sources, because online shopping is a new thing, and many other aspects of business and logistics related to the lack of legal constraints, some consumers purchase the network can not be guaranteed when the legitimate rights and interests, quality problems, but can not find a repair place or returned. Another example is sent over the network after the purchase of goods, found it a little something something, to get to business theory, put the blame on the business logistics companies, logistics companies to look for theory, logistics companies the responsibility back to business again, and finally lose the Only consumers.

 July 30, 2008 Weather remove

long time not update logs, and naturally some busy. Idle down a little tonight, and then began to jot this record, when, suddenly base that approximately half the time are stopped. Experience only one, I feel life slowly becomes full, began to feel that not enough time to complete. This seems favor a differ busy in Chengdu, Chengdu busy because of the workload of a certain duration of time, especially colossal, but here&apos;s a real feel as if enrichment is not so much time to this place for the Blackwater more things to do .

7 月 15 日 county resume, log on treatises referred to the security issues. July 22 -25, I use four days, not for the county in addition to BA Xiang Ci dissimilar school outside the township of all 16 basic and secondary schools, kindergartens conducted a safety inspection, but also facing the school difficulties and the need for a comprehensive scrutinize. Unlike in the past, this time with beyond example of some of my small village. Four-day tumble, very hard, every night back to town when his face was all mud. But studied a lot more than sand, Victoria ancient, ancient Seoul color, bar-nest, bright, Caron, Wabo, aloe, hemp nest these town&apos;s name carved into my mind, and Georgette, Qu W, two lumber, Japan Greenspan, Victoria fisheries, Zaki, etc. These have been curious for the first time the name of the village away from me so close.

sensibilities are deep, the car does not pass those to wade to reach the village, in the face of those easy village teacher, Tibetan children, moving is constantly not words to express. I only kas long asour teachers are still a small village with a picture of lumber and straw to spread their own bed, the children because of the lack of tents still standing Kezhuo Deng school when I was very wondered, I only know When a young village school teacher told me she needed a alarm when I rupture into tears, as one principal told me that he most wanted a stainless iron flagpole.

does no appear so shrewd that I need apt worry approximately a county, merely I decided apt go apt worry about. I tin no tolerate children and instructors are still dangerous in the lavatory, I do not ambition the small village of the harsh living conditions for their instructors tin not even watch the newspaper network, I do not want the babies and instructors to go 1 km away to kick domestic water.

back to town that weekend, I slender finishing with four days of harvest, most of these minutiae needs, in addition to lack of regular bed, so Kezhuo Deng, computers, printers, copiers is general lack of, the village school teacher needs satellite receivers, the heaters in winter, the school with the freezers, rinsing machines, etc., of course, lavatory repairs, the price of laying water pipes. After achievement the

really have dozens of need, join up always these villages need supplies or pooled funds can not a small sum. Only from the county chance asset to address is altogether unrealistic, is not so I asked for more of these needs in mind.

know these are not proposed to be entirely determined, but to try to solve. So I decided, in adding to some special safety needs urgent I have to fight for the county for presently as possible, additional extra essential, matter or fiscal level, I have through my own course to quest support.

way of way is the main unit through their own leaders, friends, to seek support for affair in early August, maneuvers to return to Chengdu, the hands have this menu can also be a purpose to escape a race nigh.

as a accessory, I muse the network. I am in my own label, charted a post, commissioned four friends Share Chengdu, virtually each learn I have got all the requirements. For me, the network is not only illusory but also true, at least for my network to cater a complementary channel, allowing the outdoor globe know more about Blackwater is the main purpose, even now this portion is to receive a small part of the favour and support, is a windfall. So, I chose open my personality, leaving my phone, QQ.

I do not know namely not a government lawful is not accustomed to using this outlet, I only kas long asI chose to do so. Today, fair an day, I received a lot of friend&apos;s phone, QQ message, expressed concern above the Blackwater schooling and goodwill to donate. Not many, but enough to make me push, even whereas today the light on the call most of the period spent, but I was quite moved. Really, thank you, thank you aid me friends Share my post, thank you to those who have queried to watch the situation after post friends, but thank you even if only a microcomputer, a scanner must too be donated to the Blackwater friends.

the inspire of the network is indeed large, however I do not know afterward what will bring me to consider not so much. WCC&apos;s journalist at the tel interview, suddenly I also talked about post was made public, there is support, there are doubts, there are criticisms, and asked what I feel. In fact, I do not know what I feel, because I did not see the back post, then friends, there is no need to go one along one to see all public assistance for a county is the attitude and attitudes, because I know my purpose, I want to use this channel for the network to secure some increased properties of black support it. Therefore, regardless of support, oppose or answer, I can only say to all concerned friends of this post are thankful. At least we know this place Blackwater, Blackwater knows earthquake, particularly the harm caused to black education, black education is relatively meager condition, with these, no matter how much support the last received, the number of materials, I think it is a harvest.

just, my center suddenly some uncomfortable, a relatively county to accept this alternative approach is not too appropriate. I am also not sure, at last, which if not so done the sometime.

But research last week http://chanelbagsonsale.net , when the thought of seeing those teachers, those children, agreed to try to go and fight for their own entity, whether it is in public and in personal, I ought go to go, preferably than care too much.

thought here, but it is full of lull and slow up, I just corner the name of a personal network, the only inconsistency is that in mandate to improve the authenticity of the situation, I disclosed his identity and adjoin message, I want to come to the past, no matter the final outcome, no matter how the final occasion of the kind of debate and even controversy, for my own commitment to those remote mountain village is not known teachers and children, I ambition not rue.

eventually to dark the past 2 months, and finally moved into their lasting address. The apartment is very alley, just let go a bed, TV is basically no marking, the tap leaking, repair it, who slowly, cling to the premier time more, ha ha ha ha.

 From the perspective of the physiological function of women&apos;s sexuality is almost unlimited. She is not the penis, like the men did not need to produce and maintain an erection and scheming. Especially women do not have physical So she can objectively high frequency of sexual intercourse at any time. Similarly, women in the sex life of the activity intensity only by the physical limitations http://www.chaquetabelstaffoutlet.com , it does not have to worry about the penis as a man as weak.
In addition http://www.stivaliitaliaoutlet.com , the female body surface of the more sensitive areas wider than men, so she can objectively change sex more than men concrete ways.
Finally, women can achieve an infinite number of continuous orgasm http://www.cheapferragamo.net , which is unmatched by men.
Confucianism and Taoism had discovered this. However, in order to maintain the prevailing male-centered society, they have full of deep fear. Confucian idea of ​​
These two cultural traditions have been deeply implanted in the hearts of Chinese women, women&apos;s sex is seriously distorted and alienated. Of the individual so that they always feel a double life of sexual repression.
Before the start of sexual life http://www.mulberrysingaporesale.com , women often can not help but think of a man&apos;s patent, a woman should not take the initiative to seek it. Even more happy sex life in this psychological break through the resistance, the women can not learn how to more fully enjoy their unlimited capabilities.
Unmarried women say themselves if there is sexual arousal, sexual dreams or sexual response, other men will certainly take advantage of this woman, but she found another woman is bound to be Result, women&apos;s wedding night has been ended up a
After marriage, women&apos;s sex is still considered only for the services of her husband, it seems that as long as never refuse her husband&apos;s sexual demands is a good sexual performance. If a wife say he still needs more orgasm, probably the lightest will be considered to be If the wife then they need some sort of special requirements, the husband will probably think that she International feminism that: men and women is the same quality and structure, but because thousands of years is always a male-centered society http://www.swarovskislovak.com , it created a variety of severely depressed female sexuality and sexual performance of the cultural system. Women themselves have been gradually training and training as
That feminism: women&apos;s emancipation and gender equality must include the nature, including the need to restore the original appearance of female sexual physiology http://www.billigralphlauren.com , so that women and men also, spontaneously, independently, consciously and self-regulation to go to the full enjoyment of their own born with sexuality and sexual pleasure.
If women are still afraid to recognize and use their unlimited capabilities http://www.gucciborsespaccio.com , she can not get proper sex equality and autonomy rights (not power!), Will not be able to get other aspects of social life equality.
The past, our theory of the international women&apos;s movement too little introduction. Therefore, part of the culture of the Chinese women seem to mention the physical nature of low-level driver is vulgar, is to deny the noble love, or even belittle women. In fact, it is precisely in those with full respect for the rights of female sexuality and sexual culture, love of flag flying higher than us. On the occasion of the Fourth World Conference on Women held, we should openly proclaim and spread this deep knowledge for the benefit of every sister in China.

 Plus sheepskin boots can be easily destroyed by chemical substances and other types of abrasions. Therefore avoid chemical purifiers. When you are cleaning for the reason that, bear in mind to use a gentle brush or towel and gently stroke the stain. If it does not help http://www.cheapugg-bootsoutlet.net , buy a cleaning product that is recommended for sheepskin. Put it on according to the instruction. By no means machine wash or even dry clean these kinds of sheepskin boots.
Whatever you happen to be wearing can be a spokesman for your style and approach to life. In order to make positive you will show your very best to the throng in any occasion, it&apos;s a must to keep aware about the latest fashion sense and always help make an accurate judgment all on your own fashion style. You will find too many stunning finishing touches available on today&apos;s industry. But of course http://www.cheapugg-bootsoutlet.net , not all of these people fit you. It i s a great idea to transform your appearance with some of the latest fashion sense used. But remember this anytime: it&apos;s always a fashion no-no to exaggerate anything. Additionally, to make you in the spotlight, it&apos;s necessary to be aware of some small equipment and also footwear you desire to add onto your system.
Nowadays sheepskin fashion trends happen to be extended. More fashion items made of tempting lambskin are available in a wide variety of styles and designs. Amongst these available choices, UGG purses surely rank among the most chic popular kinds. When referred UGG, you may soon remember its famous footwear lineup and it is also easy to picture that branded appearance as well as comfort to match virtually any fashion taste.

Although it is always easy to turn into elegantly fashionable using any downy sheepskin goods bearing this emblem http://www.cheapugg-bootsale.com , there would be few things like this brand handbag to give one&apos;ersus stylish look the downright vision with the endearing comfort along with unique taste. This is the magic of each this brand and degree from Australia.
Sheepskin is quite resilient and pretty much worry free. In the event you spill something on them, like soda or coffee, you can typically just wipe it off. If it dries, it&apos;s possible you&apos;ll be able to get it out having a damp cloth. Sheepskin doesn&apos;t soak up unsightly stains like fabric does. Liquid had a trend to just sit on prime for a period of time http://www.cheapugg-bootsale.com , prior to soaking in. Furthermore, they don&apos;t shed or even loose their wool because as you know, sheep have to be sheared.
Taking away excess thing from your sheepskin boots needs extra care, mainly because standard soaps are able to do more harm and in the long term destroy the sheepskin substance. Sheepskin cleaning kits that keeps the standard of your sheepskin shoes or boots are available on any kind of products section of any kind of shoes shopping shops. The packages typically has a brush that will divides the material to maintain the particular fiber make a difference from heading in the product rather all this eliminates foreign make a difference plus a specific kind of detergent to help take care of the sheepskin layer.

 Perhaps it was because the detentions occurred at the journalism department located along the avenue from the Kremlin. Or perhaps it was because those arrested were quite young women who, by any reasonable weigh, had each right to be in the building that day. It could too have been that numerous of the people covering the incident were themselves graduates of Moscow State University’s journalism department and therefore felt an unusual affinity with the detainees.







As a result, the same people who were teachers back in Soviet days are immediately the teachers of the babies born after the U.S.S.R. collapsed. Worse, they are instructing them the same things.



Masha Gessen is a journalist in Moscow. Her book, (...) , “The Man Without a Face,” will be promulgated afterward year.



MOSCOW — “The university is no area for spreading pamphlets or hurrahing out slogans.”



After former President Boris Yeltsin exiled the celebration, http://www.sacburberryfrstore.com , it quickly reconstituted itself for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. It remains a important political player to this daytime — as do hundreds of former Communist honchos. And, of way, Russia itself is run at a former K.G.B. colonel, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.





Many sometime Eastern Bloc countries, including Germany and the Czech Republic, banned former Communist Party functionaries and secret police proxies from state employment. But Russia shied away from such policies, partly because the sufferers and the executioners of the Soviet state were often the same folk. Even the youth liberal reformers of 20 years antecedent feared a hag hound that would tear separately Russian society.



It is the occasional offhand remark that tin make one fulfil, with a gasp, how bizarre Russian culture remains 20 years after the breakdown of the Soviet Union. This particular remark was made by Yaroslav Kuzminov, chancellor of the Higher School of Economics, (...) , without a mistrust, the best and maximum modern university in Russia. And but, if Kuzminov’s remark is any indication, its culture is utterly divorced from the plenary Western tradition of higher studying.



Whatever the reason, the episode excited a public controversy that has served to highlight a opener aspect of today’s Russia: Twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the country’s political mores has changed remarkably mini.



Three of the students, young women who had tried but weren’t allowed to join the audience, stood in front of the mansion holding letter-size sheets of paper with the questions they would have queried their chancellor. One of these was, “Why are you spending your time on Twitter when Khodorkovsky is spending his time in jail?,” a reference to the former fuel tycoon who has been backward bars for 8 years — and who is considered by Amnesty International to be a prisoner of rectitude.



Kuzminov made his remark emulating a highly proclaimed incident at a differ university, the older and more conservative Moscow State. Students at the journalism department arrived at that school on Oct. 20 to meet burly officers from the presidential guard, who rotated them away from the building, telling them classes were obliterated. The reason: President Dmitri Medvedev had chosen the journalism department as a venue for a public bbs on the heading of nationality. As is usual with such events, either the people in presence and the questions they would be asking were cautiously chose and vetted in advance by the president’s staff.



Take the journalism division by Moscow State. It has been headed by the same man since 1965. By all accounts, the 82-year-old Yassen Zassoursky is a amazing educator and a charismatic actuator. But he was named to the post and answered directly to the Central Committee of the Communist Party until the Party was compelled from power in 1991 — but even then he kept his job.



As soon as they held up their canvases of periodical, the young women were grabbed by the presidential guard and placed in a prisoner-transport traffic conveniently on hand. Four extra students, three women and a male arrested as a alike protest inside the creating, presently connected them. All 7 students bruise up creature held in detention for the rest of the day.

Such detentions are no unusual in today’s Russia, where the statute considers as a protester any human carrying a notice and requires that protests involving more than one human be removed with the authorities in advance. But someone about these catches captured the Russian media’s imagination: discussions on who was more wrong—the students, (...) , the police, alternatively the university’s administration— angered in the few neutral medium outlets and on journalists’ blogs for 2 weeks next.

 Buffalo has lost its last four games, devolving from surprise playoff contender to afterthought Bell at Pregame The Bears did realize what McCown brother they were calling, right?McCown knowing Martz&apos;s system didn&apos;t make his arm stronger or straighter during his first week of practice that, according to sources, made it easy to see why he was coaching high school football when the Bears calledJohnson fined: Bills receiver Stevie Johnson has been fined $10,000 by the NFL for mimicking shooting himself in the thigh during a touchdown celebration last weekend that mocked New York Jets receiver Plaxico Burress The Colts know this Its an incredibly disciplined pass defense, with just four interference penalties

And with the Patriots followed by Baltimore, Tennessee, Houston and Jacksonville on the schedule, let&apos;s just say it looks good for those speculating on purchasing blue and white Andrew Luck jerseys in the futureI know Dalton threw two picks in the fourth quarter against the Steelers, (...) , but he and the Bengals were still knocking on the door at the very end Francois, who had been inactive the previous five games, had an interception and four tackles in 2? quarters in place of Hawk The makeshift line didn&apos;t have much trouble opening up holes for the running game last week, (...) , as top back Ryan Mathews (717 rushing yards, 3 TD, 36 receptions) gained a career-best 137 yards on 22 carries He played with the Raiders for seven seasons, from 1960-1967&quot;We&apos;re not trying to do anything else

That&apos;ll be a challenge this week, though, as the Dolphins have held four of their last five opponents to 85 rushing yards or fewer, (...) , a primary reason for their recent success I think the Falcons have turned a corner, and the Bears&apos;schedule softens up just enough for them to survive the Jay Cutler injury If the Colts are forced off the field quickly, well, you know what&apos;ll happen7 Greer said it will be an opportunity to step it up against one of the best in the business and that now is the time to&quot;make your markHe chastised a reporter for inferring just that during a question-and-answer session on Wednesday

In rehab its more draining in some ways because there is not a whole lot of enjoyment Peyton Manning holds the season record for a rookie with 26 in 1998&quot;It&apos;s easier said than done, (...) , but certainly it&apos;s a point of emphasis when you&apos;re defending a player like himGabbert was pulled in favor of journeyman Luke McCown in the fourth quarter of that game after completing an off-target 13-of-29 passes for 136 yards and an interceptionWeaknesses: Stopping the Run&quot;Hes a drop-back quarterback, (...) , but he can also get outside the pocket

 me wrong friends her career



4 On 20 April, http://www.borseburberrysito.com , Yu Junming Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, discipline was After the prosecution phase of the investigation and prosecution and the court stage, he has repeatedly analyze the reasons for their life of crime, lessons learned, and confessed to his crime. Based on the confession of his order is made repeatedly.


Throughout my whole process of taking bribes, though the town in 1999 and served as party secretary, I started to make money for others, but the real money is in April 2003 when the deputy level cadres, the This extreme individualism with expansion I was not unrelated.


their former positions: Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, deputy secretary









pursuit of pleasure for me to choose a trading power for money



I was still living in 70 square meters of old houses, so my first thought is another big house. However, their savings at home only 10 million, (...) , so I had to have helped some of their busy owners to borrow, borrow that money to them and my own money is no different. After a year, I bought a second house, 180 square meters.


neglect of learning and expansion of individualism, I lost



committing crimes: bribery






Sina exclusive manuscript statement: This work (text, pictures, graphics and audio and video) for Sina to use, without authorization, any media, and individuals may in whole or in part.



However, I make money is to selectively collect the money, rest assured of one&apos;s money income, all of the people know that money is not received, for the past misdeeds of the people not to send money to the basic income, compared to the relationship between the iron tight-lipped people to send money to boldly closed. I am from April 2003 to April 2010, a total of more than 10 people received 19 times more than 60 million money and goods.


working, I have little regard for their own family and personal enjoyment, less demanding on the material, http://www.sacburberryfrstore.com , to contentment. 2003 was promoted to deputy division-level leadership positions, the result of years of hard work have finally, I think that to think about their families, too, should enjoy a little longer.




I miss the first job paid really friends, they support my career quietly, I do not figure their power, and still make good use of my attention right hands. Unfortunately, with the job promotion, I listen more and more friends of the truth, getting away from these real friends, friends into some ill-designed Just been placed, the investigators said to me: , not on economic issues when pigs fly.




to work since my career has been relatively smooth, despite seven years as vice level cadres has not been promoted, but the job than the one important power is also growing, indicating that the organization or I trust my care. So feel better and better, and sometimes I do not think that some work is not carried out, can not deal with the problem, solved. Thus, when the vice level cadres later, I have been smug, hot-headed, individualistic tendencies to a very serious problem, which lead to strict demands on themselves, do not pay attention to sections that rubbing mahjong, drinking, singing and looking for woman is a small problem, or even that every year some of my colleagues, business owners come to my house New Year to send some gifts to give my daughter some money, are quite common. Even the owner of the money collected, and I think they do for their trouble, which I should get.


recalled his contacts over the years various people, many of fraternizing with the boss of my friends. Especially when the vice level leadership cadres, I am more interested in making friends with entrepreneurs, with them too cool, and felt in front of them, (...) , he is very beautiful. In fact, the vast majority of these so-called friends are all with the purpose of my contacts, all eyes on my hands the power to work for them. Some of them were so-called long-term emotional investment, usually find you drinking songs mahjong playing, it looks like the relationship of iron, is dragging you into the water, the key moment of the first you are likely to also sell these


Looking back, his own path in life, both based on their own, dedicated, positive, enthusiastic course, there are also commonplace, passive coping, corruption and degeneration of the process, the formation of a vigorous and resolute in their work , aggressive, sloppy life, abuse of power on both sides of life. This one really thought I was promoted to deputy shift from division-level leadership cadres began.
















facts of the crime: Yujun Ming in 1999-2010 Dinghai Ma&apos;aozhen as party secretary, Dinghai District Government Office, Zhoushan Harbor Industrial Zone Management Committee, deputy director of Zhoushan City Land Resources Bureau, deputy Dinghai Secretary and deputy secretary of Politics and Law Committee secretary, for others to profit, bribes totaling more than 60 million.




I attended for 20 years, initially learning or attention, whether political or other knowledge of learning to learn, I more active. I think I can continue to progress this is a major cause of it. However, with changing jobs, increasing workload, especially after the Deputy level leadership cadres, I rarely have time to stop and read some books, the unit has organized largely by the Office of the learning experience or secretary do it, purely to meet. I was busy during the day to cope with handling matters night busy drinking entertainment, leisure weekend but also out of playing cards. Even as the district deputy secretary of the Political and Legal Committee, in charge of political and legal work, I have not seriously studied the relevant legal knowledge. Over time, life and values ​​on the error occurred, the ideological and moral decline, weak legal consciousness, life, loss of direction, and then onto the bribery crime.


confession by: Yujun Ming



verdict: 2010 September 16, Yujun Ming was Zhoushan City Intermediate People&apos;s Court of First Instance sentenced to eleven years.


addition to buy a house, I also like drinking songs playing mahjong, but also maintained an illicit relationship with several women, but also help in improving the living conditions of rural brother, all this needs money. So, I think the right hands, began to use bartering pay for their own pleasure. Time and time again in the engineering business undertaking, land planning, costs and hold over relief, policy coordination, migration and other aspects of household care and support given to others, (...) , again and again to receive their money.


2003 April, because I work for outstanding performance, the organization promoted me as Zhoushan Harbor Industrial Zone Management Committee, deputy director. At that time, I am happy with, begin with the ideological shift that like me out of the people from the countryside, there is no backing background, purely by their own efforts to dry deputy division-level leadership positions, has been very good, and then further on the very slim hope of promotion. So, for the work, I will not have a past too far behind to cope with the idea; for life, the pursuit of enjoyment, to take account of the family, (...) , the idea of ​​changing the lives of the poor more and more intense that last a life of crime by the law punishment. It is not accidental, but inevitable, but the deeper reason.




Zhoushan Zhu, chairman of a warehouse in order to undertake the project, hold over fee arrangements and land targets to get care and support, trying to close me, I opt for investment, in addition to outside gave me 200,000 yuan , will be ultra-cheap car to sell me, I move the occasion and give me a LCD TV. I have refused him money, but in the face of his promise Unexpectedly, after he took me into the betrayed. Alas, this was not his fault, Blame own greed, should not pay such a friend.

 Also true becomes false false true



Time slowly, things hastily, turned around and empty non-success, only to is difficult to achieve the kind of money out of the first extraordinary show of nothing more freely.
said there are too many people not only for others, http://www.nikefreeno.com , often use their own mask, http://www.northfacejakker.net , so it seems at least it has some relevance. I admit that the person is a mask, but the only good news is: not much. 51 small holiday for office workers, is an excellent opportunity to relax, but for me, May Day is still the usual date of the ordinary and nothing special. Meet friends call go out to play yesterday, though my heart around the corner, but still rejected the apology. Today the children to invite me out to play with their peers, I still smile rejected. I did not self-closed, not my unreasonable, http://www.nikefreeno.com , but used to this day to day monotony of life, accustomed to look with indifference the world to see things, used the first time to consider the feelings of others, always inadvertently add too strong for ourselves far-fetched reasons, although well aware of this so-called sacrifice may not be able to win with a great understanding of their loved ones, but they know that the character always seems to hide deep in the background and the flowing undercurrent of an unspeakable ... ...!
stream in the hustle and bustle of people world where everyone has a different personality, has a different way of life, has a different taste and opinion, have the same right to keep or hide their true colors, Maybe everyone has a mask to hide the truth, everyone is a Thousand Faces Because everyone is not possible to vividly illustrate each side in front, after all, sad tone is not light, nor is it pure joy, and always with a bitter smile, http://www.nikefreeno.com , laugh and tears also.
original Man I have been too simple to see people smile and be naive to think that someone else&apos;s heart is happy, do not know which will hide behind a smile hidden evil; see to others lookin tears, they simply believe that the hearts of others is miserable, and do not understand this is a way and cried.
like Guo described the passage, Later, I also think you really happy ...
and gorgeous in this busy stage of life, everyone has a different mask, but some people are the real face behind the mask of false deceive the miserable , while others mask the true face with his life as King also bridges.
perhaps a mask may be difficult if you do not speak and do things, but a real person who blindly, make their living very depressed, blind to use and very easy to lose self-mask, so life as usual, ignoring the neglect, and give up the abandoned, http://www.nikefreeno.com , the cherished treasure, of course, and occasionally their side in good faith to bring their own mask (such as continuous I had two days to bring the mask to hide his true inner thoughts and desires)
detached, it may also be an optimistic happy it!

 Send children leave



  Early yesterday, nine, his son left for Beijing to Beijing the next day Jifu the capital of the Latin American countries, Brazil - Brasilia, the way in the New York transit. Since then, the son of Chinese Embassy in Brazil started in a real sense of diplomacy, since also embarked on a diplomatic career glorious and sacred journey.
  because the care of her mother&apos;s sake, I could not accompany her son to send him to Beijing more than a ride, and because the spring tension, I did not even able to send him to the platform, were hastily packed railway station square in .
  and children waved goodbye to the moment, eyes filled with tears, my heart very sad, Mr. carrying off the crowd on one side secretly Ma Lei. Men do not cry easily, in my memory, sir, cried three times, the first time in my pregnancy to go to Beijing to visit him, back to Changsha, the day we were on the platform at the Beijing Railway Station, sir eyes red. The second is the President of the mother&apos;s death, he cried. This is my third time back to see his tears.
  recently often hear the words of praise, saying that my son live up to expectations, became the envy of diplomats, said this is my past life to the welfare of repair. In fact, ordinary people on the special nature of diplomatic work, or know little about. Listen son, said diplomats working at home and abroad to regular rotation, the foreign term is usually two to four years, at least more than 15 years working abroad. Moreover, nine Portuguese-speaking countries around the world, five in Africa, Lusophone&apos;s son said he learned of the next term is definitely going to Africa.
  weekdays to see the overall diplomatic work with large international conferences, grand diplomatic occasions inseparable, and shining the spotlight, greeting sent flowers, red carpet together, diplomats, a a suit, high spirits, and bright. But as far as I know, this is just one aspect of diplomacy, in fact most of the time, the diplomats to the motherland and the people&apos;s interests, to world peace and progress, are unknown to doing a lot of tedious, boring routine.
  Embassy heard some high-temperature hot all year round. West Asia North Africa Sudan, hair tower, Saudi Arabia and other countries throughout the year, six months above the temperature at 40 ℃, the maximum temperature of 54 ℃; some museum of various diseases prevalent in most of Africa I and consulates are in the epidemic prone areas; others such as Iraq, Pakistan Museum by war and the threat of terrorism. Living in highland areas of the Museum of severe hypoxia, some of the museum and even the most basic drinking water are not guaranteed. Poor living conditions of some museum, or even no television to watch, no network available, the librarian simply boring life, loneliness, stress is very large.
  son also told me that more than 240 embassies and consulates in China is struggling particularly hard and nearly 70. In addition, overseas work to family to lose. Children around the knee, family reunion, for the most enjoyable in terms of overseas workers is a vain hope. Due to frequent overseas work, the elderly advanced age, often several years according to attend a news is often bad news; spouses, because they can not get away with domestic work either, the couple apart, together from many; many children will be born diplomats working abroad, come back to visit the child actually alleging that it is his uncle. Unable to care for and nurture children to become the biggest pain the hearts of overseas personnel. The thought of these, I extremely anxious and worried.
  However, there may not have another career diplomat can do this like, always on behalf of national image and obviously fighting for national interests. Competition between countries backed by comprehensive strength, talent, intelligence as a fundamental, in the smokeless war, a vast international arena is everywhere diplomats wits battlefield. Diplomat&apos;s words and acts, reflects the image of China and the role of this developing country. In the diplomatic battlefield, love the motherland, to the people, not empty slogans, http://www.canadagooseoutlets.dk , but turned into a conviction, cast diplomats Sincere patriotic heart. The thought of these, the son of the motherland, to world peace and development of youth and blood sacrifice is worth it.
  Since the choice of turning back on, since departed, and would never back down. So I am glad that my son before boarding the last sent a text message: diplomatic career journey, but also embarked on a long journey through life.
  I wish my children a safe journey home, back good news!

 There are many disappointments in life, so my heart was always sad, always difficult to calm (...) , in front of me always seems a happy face (...) , but who knows what goes on in my smile back, how much bitterness buried and rogue.
then look like a sky thinking, like their own stories. Riverside on the road like a walk in the spring to see the surging river, watching the sun sets, but also to see breeze blowing, but prefer to ponder their own sustenance to those words ... ...
pale in every lonely night, alone knocked quietly at the screen numerous scattered broken language. Sometimes memories of the past, by recalling his own writing touch emotions, and sometimes their own future prospects, filled with the hope to describe in their own dream, to make their life more fulfilling than I am ... ...
believe in fate, believe in the vast sea of ​​people, there will always be a know me, know my people can help level the wounds of my soul, but the desire of the friends in the crowd is so epic proportions, the world turns out to be hard to find friends and alone, so I better to die, not guns!
inadvertently walked into your room that day, was deeply touched by your words, so the space in your footsteps gently left, you did not expect the network side, but online, see the footprints on the along the trail will soon pay a return visit to my space, and asking if I can add you to QQ friends ... ... so we know each other. You are asking questions like, when you heard that I like music, you sent me a lot of music, I do not know your carefully selected, or a mere coincidence, every one you send music are my favorite. So in every night, I will quietly enjoying those songs you sent, accompanied by music to enjoy the beauty culture, and my heart there is a yearning for the future ... ...
you are very sincere, very open, so as the passage of time, we talked about love from the text, from the child comes to education, became good friends with each other. With a sincere heart you touched me, you like to see my space I wrote the article, also from time to time to sent me an article I wrote again to me, in order to return your faith, I tell you - My website URL submission. You know, not believe in your sincerity, I will tell you how to talk to that place where my heart?
stop the passage of time, and our exchanges have more than six months, although the network is virtual, but the network on both sides of you and I are very sincere, so communication with each other, you have a more deep understanding: You are a talented person, personality naturally strong, often offended the others, he does not know why? Although you often told me that I am very grateful to you for my happiness and fun http://www.appwatches.org/ , will cherish the share of pure friendship, but it will not come into your life, because you live in a big city, and I live in town (...) , maybe metropolitan and There are many small town people are different, right! I though you older, but you are always in my heart a child grow up sun, you know?

 Collin managed to somehow deflect the ball off the back of his head and into the net, giving Sporting KC a 1-0 lead He tied aleague record with a 63-yard field goal during Oakland&apos;s opener in Denver onSept What it is is that the Bengals secondary, (...) , without cornerback Leon Hall in the secondary in the second half stopped Roethlisbergers three-game 300-yard streak, (...) , didnt allow a pass longer than 13 yards, and stopped all four of Pittsburghs third-down tries&quot;We understood that he was disappointed in himself at the end of regulation, but that&apos;s the kind of competitor he is, (...) , to rise up and make a play when he&apos;s called upon&quot;&quot;They&apos;re defending champions,&quot;said Sporting KC midfielder Roger EspinozaThe Bears come into this game as one of the hottest teams in the NFL

If you don&apos;thave a good offensive front, or if you don&apos;t have a good defensive front, you&apos;renot going to win in the National Football League Ten days after San Diego guard Kris Dielman sustained a head injury against the Jets and later suffered a seizure on the team&apos;s flight home from New York, the league&apos;s injury and safety panel issued the directive Wednesday&quot;They have to goform their own identity&quot;Tight ends Vernon Davis and Delanie Walker lead the team withfour and three touchdown catches, respectively&quot;You need to get him to the part where he&apos;s just coming offthe ball hard every snap, not feeling it, (...) , not waiting to see whathappens Asked if the lack of a contract extension affects his desire to stay with the franchise, Forte said: It does a little bit

I think that&apos;s all that matters They pay people who have performed for them, not people who have performed for others Mike Ditka, George Seifert, Jimmy Johnson, Mike Holmgren, Mike Shanahan, Dick Vermeil are the only six coaches to have coached another team after winning a Super Bowl&quot;If familiarity breeds contempt then it&apos;s no surprise that the New England Patriots and New York Jets share such a healthy dislikeTight end Delanie Walker caught a career-high six passes duringlast week&apos;s 27-20 victory over the New York Giants, becoming thefifth different player in San Francisco&apos;s nine games this season tolead the team in receptions 10

So the Patriots will win the division Fans in Denver aren&apos;t shy in showing their support of quarterback Tim Tebow&quot;Even so, (...) , Freeman practiced Wednesday with the thumb tapedInjury update: Defensive end Jared Allen, drafted as a longsnapper out of Idaho State in 2004, (...) , has taken reps for the injuredCullen Loeffler (shoulder) during practices this week Itbasically falls on the bad side for me, not making the big play All 50 or 60 of you can be replaced with guys that look and think just like you

&quot;If familiarity breeds contempt then it&apos;s no surprise that the New England Patriots and New York Jets share such a healthy dislike I asked him if he could promise the team that is breaking hearts this year can do some quick mending by next But the worst thing happened, now it&apos;s over Nothing cheap and everything within the rules Matt Cassel had only 77 net passing yards before leaving the game with a hand injury I have the mindset that I don&quot;t have to go in there and be a hero week in and week out

Here is the icon:

final note is: the name of each side is relative, for example, F is the front is holding the cube when the side facing you, if we imitate the rotation to the other side, then there is a new side in front.

good

1. the first side of the middle is the white block (the piece has a rubiks logo) facing the top, and then make a white cross at the top, that is, all other colors of the blocks to the appropriate position (small complex, see picture, note the subject of the above formulas Oh, did so correctly)

2. Then the white corner pieces into place (Cheats said complex, or plug-in easier to understand friends)
3. Then let the middle edge pieces into place.
the white face turned to the next, to find red and green side of the block, if the red and green on the top side of the block according to the top clockwise until the edge of the block diagram of one with the same situation, in accordance with the formulas rotating cube, so side of the block into place. If the red and green side of a block in the middle layer, but the wrong position or color error, the first block in the right side of the red and green position in front, and then re-spin in accordance with one of the following sequence 1.


4. Then the top (should be yellow) side of the block to adjust upward, making yellow cross. If the rotation in accordance with formulas 1, the top not a yellow cross, repeatable formulas by turning, until the yellow cross appears.

5. Then adjusted to cross the yellow blocks around the corner, a little difficult to see formulas prompted it.
7. Finally, the edge of the color and then adjust to the corresponding position. Done! ! Excited about the next.

There are two types, it depends on the method of extracting the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased and high frequency (HF) or radio frequency (RF) condenser microphones. Dynamic microphones work via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, at best not expensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them the best choice for live utilize. Ribbon mics utilize a light, generally corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically combined to the mic’s output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are alike to moving coil microphones in the sense that both make sound by means of magnetic induction. The inner elements of a mic are the principal source of dissimilarities in directivity. A pressure mic uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal vol of air and the environment, and responds constantly to pressure from all directions, so it is called omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient mic utilizes a diaphragm that is at least partially open on every sides. The pressure difference between the two sides makes its directional features. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone’s directional response. A genuine pressure-gradient microphone is in every way sensitive to sounds that arrive from back or front, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the 2.






microfonistrumenti musicali









A microphone (colloquially called a mic or mike) is an acoustic-to-electric sensor or transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. In 1877, Emile Berliner created the first mic utilized as a telephone voice transmitter. Mics are utilized in some applications such as tape recorders, telephones, karaoke systems, live and recorded audio engineering FRS radios, megaphones, (...) , in television and radio broadcasting and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, (...) , VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic checking or knock sensors. A lot of microphones at this time use electromagnetic induction (dynamic mic), capacitance change (condenser mic), piezoelectric production, or light modulation to generate an electrical voltage signal from mechanical vibration. The sensitive transducer part of a mic is called its capsule or element. A complete microphone includes as well a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to convert the output of the element to the equipment being driven. A wireless microphone contains a radio transmitter. Microphones are designed by their transducer characteristic, such as condenser, dynamic, etc., and by their directional characteristics. Often other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended utilize or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (side or end-address) of the mic are utilized to describe the mic. The condenser mic, produced at Bell Labs in 1916 by E. C. Wente is is defined as well a capacitor mic or electrostatic mic?capacitors were in history defined condensers. Here, the diaphragm does as one plate of a capacitor, and the vibrations generate changes in the distance between the plates.



The feature directional mode of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar shpaes are derived by creating a capsule that combines these 2 effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, (...) , features a partially closed backside, so its anwer is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient features. A mic’s directionality or polar pattern means how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis. The directivity illustrated above represent the locus of points that generate the same signal level output in the microphone if a certain SPL is produced from that point. How the physical body of the mic is directed to the diagrams relies on the microphone design. For big-membrane mics such as in the Oktava, the upward directivity in the polar diagram is usually perpendicular to the microphone body, typically known as “side address” or “side fire”. For small diaphragm mics such as the Shure, it normally extends from the axis of the microphone normally known as “end fire” or “top/end address”. A lot of mic shapes put together several principles in creating the desired directivity. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.

 Act, (...) ,act in the living Present!
And our hearts , though stout and brave.
And the grave is not its goal;
And things are not what they seem.
Art is long , and time is fleeting.
Be a hero in the strife!
Be not like dumb,driven cattle!
But to act,
Dust thou art , to dust returnest,
Find us farther than to-day.
For the soul is dead that slumbers
Funeral marches to the grave。
In the bivouac of Life,
In the world’s broad field of battle,
Is our destined and our way;
Learn to labour and to wait.
Let the dead Past bury its dead!
Let us,then,be up and doing,
Life is but an empty dream!
Life is real! Life is earnest!
Not enjoyment , and not sorrow,
Still , like muffled drums , are beating
Still achieving,still pursuing
Tell me not in mournful numbers,
That much to-morrow.
Trust no future.howe’er pleasant!
Was not spoken of the soul.
With a heart for any fate;

 La Dame de fer s’offre un lifting




Les Parisiens viennent peu à la Tour Eiffel – 10% d’entre eux tous les ans –, et le premier étage reste le moins visité, 50% des touristes ne s’y arrêtent plus. Et pourtant, c&apos;est de loin le plus vaste avec 5.000 mètres carrés. Il faut donc renforcer son attraction. Pour cela, la mairie de Paris, propriétaire du monument, a dévoilé mardi un vaste projet de réaménagement, le troisième depuis la construction de la tour de 324 mètres, en 1889, pour l’Exposition universelle à Paris.

Il va faire l’objet d’une rénovation complète avec le pari audacieux de remplacer une partie du sol par un plancher en verre autour du vide central, pour améliorer les conditions de visite du public .

?La Tour Eiffel c’est le symbole de Paris et de la France, http://www.sitomonclerdonna.com , il faut prendre soin de ce batiment, de cette grand dame, pour qu’elle vieillisse bien?, http://www.sitomonclerdonna.com , a souligné mardi Anne Hidalgo, première adjointe (PS) au maire de Paris chargée de l’urbanisme. C’est l’agence d’architecture Moatti-Rivière qui a été choisie pour cet ambitieux réaménagement. ?On s’est dit que si le 3e étage appartient au ciel, le 1er étage (à 58 mètres de haut) est une sorte d’urbanité pour voir Paris et la Tour Eiffel au plus près?, a dit l’architecte Alain Moatti.

Un plancher en verre

Au programme: reconstruction de trois pavillons dont une salle de réception; parcours ludique et pédagogique et surtout, découverte du vide au-dessus du parvis de la dame de fer. En périphérie du vide central sera ainsi créé un sol en verre avec des dalles de 36 mm d’épaisseur et un garde corps en verre oblique de 2,80 mètres de hauteur pour protéger les visiteurs, a précisé Moatti.

L’architecte a pensé à tout, même aux acrophobes, ils ne seront pas obligés de passer sur le sol en verre, on pourra s’approcher du vide central si on veut tenter l’expérience et l’effet de transparence sera progressif de l’intérieur vers le vide. L’esprit général de la rénovation consistera aussi à respecter l’architecture des puissants piliers inclinés de (...) Lire la suite sur Liberation.fr

 Most of us would be lost without our trusty vacuum cleaner to help around the house, and usually, http://www.moncleroutlet.org.uk , a domestic strength vacuum model is more than sufficient to meet our cleaning needs. While the typical type of cleaner that is used at home is of a power designed specifically with a home environment in mind, there are some times when a domestic vacuum can fall short. Should you invest in a commercial-strength vacuum cleaner?

Commercial vacuums were designed with an environment other than the domestic in mind. While normal home life usually involves a certain amount of dust and debris, this is very little in comparison to that created in more commercial environments. Whether this is a busy office or a factory floor, http://www.monclernewyork.us , commercial vacuums are manufactured with this in mind, http://www.inclearancenorthface.com , and are therefore more powerful, more durable, and more difficult to manoeuvre.

A commercial vacuum cleaner might be more appropriate if you have a large home to clean, or place particularly heavy demands upon your cleaner. This type of vacuum usually boasts a more powerful suction device than domestic brands, http://www.monclernewyork.us , allowing you to ensure your environment is kept as spotless as possible. While these types of cleaner might seem ideal for those with more rigorous hygiene requirements, such as those households that include someone who is ill, a breed of domestic cleaners has been developed that removes many allergens from your surfaces. These include a technology known as HEPA, (...) , and help keep your home as particle free as possible.

A commercial vacuum cleaner might be suitable for you if you run a business from your home that generates excessive debris, http://www.northfaceoutletsale.net , or if you have heavy traffic on your floors. A commercial cleaner is a good choice for those who are considering making a job of cleaning, http://www.moncleroutlet.org.uk , as domestic vacuums may fall short of the heavy use required in that situation. A commercial model can easily tackle office debris, (...) , such as staples and paper clips, while these might cause clogging in a domestic type, making an already physically intensive job even more demanding.

With its durability and power, a commercial vacuum cleaner is the ideal choice if your cleaning needs are greater than might be found in the average home. Investing in a commercial strength cleaner might seem steep, but it is a choice that can save you money in the long run.

 It seems a difference of $1 can make or break a promotion in the eyes of franchisees. When Burger King announced the $1 double cheeseburger in 2009, http://www.discountwarmcoat.com , franchisees sued, http://www.discountwarmcoat.com , saying they could not make a profit at that price. Franchisees, http://www.discountwarmcoat.com , represented by the National Franchisee Association, http://www.discountwarmcoat.com , and Burger King reached a settlement in April, http://www.discountwarmcoat.com , leaving the double cheeseburger on the Value Menu at $1.29.

Xu Feng, looked up, a layer of gray clouds covered the sky clouds.

Xu Feng shock, do not speed up the pace, still dragging feint step, before the rain the wind, blowing some of Xu Feng wine.



Xu Feng Xu Feng turned and saw the old man wrinkles his face, after years of tracking to see, not hear him under the eaves, but looking at the old man smiled: the. Smile appeared on his face, wrinkles are crowded together, not hideous color, but give people a kind:

Xu Feng, the first two steps, select the selected items on the old stalls, a 100-dollar bills for the elderly, the supply does not work .. a morning when 02 people who stick to the street, will have a hard life. Twenty-ten blocks, as he is, but for the elderly, may be their lives. Therefore, Xu Feng, and eight small booth supply STH, Xu Feng, even months as bargain girlfriend, Xu Feng, will stop her, and set up booths to bargain.

o Wallet: An important accessory for men. If your beloved is particular about his wallet, then choosing a branded wallet is surely going to fetch you the mentions. Choosing a fashionable and soft wallet material from the gift shop will do wonder to make him happy.



If you do not wear sunglasses or goggles when riding your motorcycle you should. Wearing sunglasses and goggles will help with protecting your vision, as UV rays are not good for your eyes and may cause cataracts or problems with your ocular lenses. Sunglasses and goggles protect your eyes from both UVA&amp;UVB rays, bugs, and the wind. Motorcycle sunglasses and goggles also have a shatterproof lens to protect your eyes from rock or gravel being thrown from the tires of cars in front of you. Polarized lenses help to prevent glare from wet road surfaces, which can impair your vision and the glare from other vehicles on the road.

 Couple alerte : Elisabetta Canalis recasée avec une star de True Blood ?




Mehcad Brooks, l&apos;un des personnages de la série True Blood, http://www.gafassrayban.com , pourrait peut-être bien devenir le prochain George Clooney... du moins dans le coeur de la jolie Elisabetta Canalis ! En effet, si Georgy s&apos;est vite recasé avec l&apos;ancienne catcheuse Stacy Keibler , suite à sa séparation avec la belle italienne, il semblerait maintenant que ce soit au tour de miss Canalis de rebondir !

Trois mois se sont écoulés depuis sa rupture, mais tout le monde continuait à penser qu&apos;Elisabetta était toujours anéantie d&apos;avoir perdu son célèbre amoureux de deux ans... Mais détrompez-vous, la starlette qui a récemment été éliminée de l&apos;émission Dancing With The Stars , est sur un petit nuage ! Et pour cause, selon TMZ, Elisabetta aurait retrouvée l&apos;amour dans les bras du fameux Mehcad Brooks, qui souvenez-vous interprétait le r?le de Matthew Applewhite dans la saison 2 de Desperate Housewives.

Tous deux ont d&apos;ailleurs été surpris lors d&apos;un d?ner au STK steakhouse à Los Angeles... Et après avoir savouré un bon repas, le nouveau couple est reparti ensemble à bord du véhicule de Mehcad. TMZ nous dévoile même une vidéo de ce petit rendez-vous, où l&apos;on peut entendre un paparazzi demander à Mehcad :&quot;Comment vous êtes vous rencontrez ?&quot;, http://www.gafassrayban.com , et ce dernier a répondu avec un grand sourire coupable...&quot;Nous n&apos;avons pas à répondre... Je n&apos;ai aucune idée de ce dont vous parlez&quot;.

Mais bien s?r, la tactique de l&apos;autruche on connait tous , http://www.raybans-wayfarers.com ! Mais on ne nous la fait pas à nous... Il y a anguille sous roche c&apos;est s?r !

Alors comment trouvez-vous ce nouveau couple ? Mignon, hein !?!

It is South Carolina, and the spirit of 1776 fills the air throughout the thirteen American colonies. Rebellion is brewing, taxation from the British crown is taking a toll on the American colonists, and a conflict with England is inevitable. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), (...) , a veteran of the French and Indian War, http://www.canadiangoosesale-ca.com , has renounced fighting forever to raise his family in peace. However, as his sons Gabriel (Heath Ledger) and Thomas (Gregory Smith) become young men, (...) , http://www.timberlandhomme.com , they get swept up in the American Revolutionary War movement to oust the Redcoats by force. But the brutal British Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) captures Gabriel and sentences him to hang. As Gabriel is being taken away, Thomas is shot by Tavington as he tries to free him, leaving Benjamin no choice but take up arms in the militia and the fight to give the young American nation its freedom.Rialto Channel

 The halt is a matter depending on the sounding-line, and not on the leadsman.
Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order, http:www.popularshoes2u.com , where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage in those vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to fling, still quivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light, http:www.fashionuggsalestore.com , that pustulous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows.
Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang.
It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool. One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares. One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, http:www.fashionuggsalestore.com , such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab. All this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of disorganization.
Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
Since when has malady banished medicine?
Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper, http:www.warmshoes4u.com , the bat, http:www.warmshoes4u.com , the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who would cast them back into their darkness, saying:
&quot;Oh! how ugly that is, http:www.popularshoes2u.com !&quot;
The thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart. He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result. What is slang, properly speaking?
It is the language of wretchedness.
We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is one way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who says:
&quot;Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality,&quot;the broker on&apos;change who says:

There is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses. The Hotel Rambouillet nearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles.
There is a slang of duchesses, witness this phrase contained in a love-letter from a very great lady and a very pretty woman of the Restoration:&quot;You will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why I should libertize.&quot;[40] Diplomatic ciphers are slang; the pontifical chancellery by using 26 for Rome, grkztntgzyal for despatch, and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI.

LOS ANGELES  – If films starring Jennifer Aniston, Ashton Kutcher and the lovelorn cast of&quot;Twilight&quot;left you dumbfounded, http://www.achatdoudounemcler.biz/ , you&apos;re officially in good company.


All are prominent contenders for the Razzie Awards, an annual competition honoring Hollywood&apos;s worst movies, actors and filmmakers, http://www.fashionlouisvbags.biz/ , its organizer said on Monday.


Now in their 31st year, the Razzies are run by California movie buff John Wilson&apos;s Golden Raspberry Foundation as an antidote to the self-congratulatory seriousness that engulfs Hollywood during Oscar season.


The winners, http://www.classiquesdoudoune.biz/ ,Aniston and Kutcher vie for Hollywood&apos;s worst awards, determined by 600-plus voters, will be announced during a Hollywood ceremony on February 26, http://www.fashionlouisvbags.biz/ , the day before the Oscars are handed out. Not surprisingly, most honorees do not attend. Notable exceptions included Sandra Bullock last year for&quot;All About Steve, http://www.cheaplouisvonline.biz/ ,&quot;and Halle Berry in 2005 for&quot;Catwoman.&quot;Coincidentally, http://www.lujobolsos.biz/ , they went on to win Oscars the next day, http://www.classiclouisvoutlet.biz/ , albeit for different films.


&quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, http://www.comprarbolsosbotas.biz/ ,&quot;the latest installment in the hit franchise about vampires and werewolves, http://www.modedoudouneonline.biz/ , led this year&apos;s Razzie field alongside&quot;The Last Airbender, http://www.monogramtaschen.com/ ,&quot;director M. Night Shyamalan&apos;s 3D martial-arts fantasy. They each received nine nominations.


&quot;Sex and the City 2,&quot;depicting the latest sexual adventures of four aging women, followed with seven nominations.


All will vie for worst picture along with Aniston&apos;s romantic comedy&quot;The Bounty Hunter, http://www.sacsdeluxeoutlet.biz/ ,&quot;and the critically reviled parody&quot;Vampires Suck,&quot;which both received four nominations.


Aniston will compete for worst actress on the strength of her roles in both&quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;and&quot;The Switch,&quot;another unloved romantic comedy. The&quot;Sex and the City&quot;foursome -- Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon -- received a collective nomination.


The field was rounded out by Miley Cyrus (&quot;The Last Song&quot;), Megan Fox (&quot;Jonah Hex&quot;) and Kristen Stewart (&quot;Twilight&quot;). For Cyrus it will be a family affair since her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, http://www.Monogramlouisv.biz/ , was nominated for his supporting role in&quot;The Spy Next Door.&quot;


Kutcher was cited for worst actor, http://www.damierhandtaschen.com/ , also for two movies --&quot;Killers&quot;and&quot;Valentine&apos;s Day.&quot;Aniston&apos;s&quot;Bounty Hunter&quot;co-star Gerard Butler, also made the cut, as did&quot;Twilight&quot;stars Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson.

 Bordeaux : ? Beaucoup d&apos;enfants ne sont pas vaccinés ?
, http://www.chaussuresconverse.com 



David bridier Le coordinateur de Médecins du Monde en Aquitaine tire la sonnette d&apos;alarme

Médecins du Monde vient de publier son rapport annuel sur l&apos;accès aux soins des plus démunis. David Bridier, coordinateur général de l&apos;ONG en Aquitaine, explique les problèmes rencontrés à Bordeaux.

Quels publics et pathologies rencontrez-vous le plus??

Depuis trois ans, les consultations augmentent de 15 % chaque année, soit 4?500 par an, sur Bordeaux. On voit beaucoup d&apos;enfants qui ne sont pas vaccinés, des femmes enceintes qui ne bénéficient pas de suivi de grossesse. Il s&apos;agit, http://www.todsmanshop.com/ , pour un tiers, de populations bulgares et roumaines. On soigne surtout des pathologies liées à la précarisation des populations, principalement des affections cardiaques, respiratoires et de peau. On observe aussi une recrudescence de la rougeole, de la tuberculose et de la gale.

Quels changements vous interpellent sur le terrain??

L&apos;aide médicale d&apos;Etat, destinée aux migrants, est soumise à un versement de 30 euros, ce qui complique son obtention. On constate aussi six mois de décalage dans la prise en charge des malades?: ils pensent d&apos;abord à se loger et à manger.

Le rapport fait un parallèle avec la situation dans les pays du Sud… Pourquoi??

On craint de glisser d&apos;une situation de crise sanitaire majeure à une crise humanitaire. Par exemple, lors de l&apos;expulsion du squat de Villenave-d&apos;Ornon, nous avons d? distribuer des tentes en urgence. Et, parmi les 600 à 800 Roms qui vivent à Bordeaux, certains font 4 km pour trouver un point d&apos;eau. L&apos;Etat se désengage et nous devons,par exemple, organiser des campagnes de vaccination.

Que demandez-vous

aux pouvoirs publics??

Il faut augmenter les moyens financiers des structures. A Bordeaux, http://www.chaussuresconverse.com , le 115 [numéro d&apos;accueil des sans-abris] refuse 150?personnes par jour. Les orientations des publics vers les PMI (protection maternelle et infantile) sont difficiles car elles aussi manquent de (...) Lire la suite sur 20minutes.fr

; The further inconsistency concerns death: WHY does one ie not only in the VR, http://www.zh89.com/ , but also in real life /? MORPHEUS: The body cannot live without the mind. ie to the mental universe into which you are immersed: so if you are in a VR and killed there, this death affects also your real body ... The obvious opposite solution (you only really die when you are killed in reality) is also too short. The catch is: is the subject WHOLLY immersed into the Matrix- dominated VR or does he know or at least SUSPECT the actual state of things? If the answer is YES, then a simple withdrawal into prelapsarian Adamic state of distance would render us immortal IN THE VR and, consequently, Neo who is already liberated from the full immersion in the VR shouls SURVIVE the struggle with the agent Smith which takes place WITHIN the VR controlled by the Matrix (in the same way he is able to stopbullets, he should also have been able to derealize blows that wound his body). This brings us back to Malebranche
Malebranche the coordination between the material and the spiritual substance, (...) , ie body and soul; how, then, are we to explain their coordination, if there is no contact between the two, no point at which a soul can act causally on a body or vice versa? Since the two causal networks (that of ideas in my mind and that of bodily interconections) are totally independent, (...) , the only solution is that a third, true Substance (God) continuously coordinates and mediates between the two, sustaining the semblance of continuity: when I think about raising my hand and my hand effectively raises, my thought causes the raising of my hand not directly but only which leads to my hand effectively being raised. If we replace), the relationship between soul and body is never direct, since the big Other always interposes itself between the two. Occasionalism is thus essentially a name for the of bodily (real) causality, for the fact that it is the big Other which accounts for the coordination of the two networks, so that, when my body bites an apple, my soul experiences a pleasurable sensation. This same gap is targeted by the ancient Aztec priest who organizes human sacrifices to ensure that the sun will rise again: the human sacrifice is here an appeal to God to sustain the coordination between the two series, (...) , the bodily necessity and the concatenation of symbolic events. priest sensation is caused directly by the apple: what gets lost is the intermediary role of the big Other in guaranteeing the coordination between reality and our mental experience of it. And is it not the same with our immersion into Virtual Reality? When I raise my hand in order to push an object in the virtual space, this object effectively moves - my illusion, of course, is that it was the movement of my hand which directly caused the dislocation of the object, ie in my immersion, (...) , I overlook the intricate mechanism of computerized coordination, homologous to the role of God guaranteeing the coordination between the two series in occasionalism. (7)
It is a well-known fact that the totally disfunctional placebo, (...) , which is placed there just to give the individuals the impression that they are somehow participating, contributing to the speed of the elevator journey - when we push this button, the door closes in exactly the same time as when we just pressed the floor button without its purest: according to Malebranche, we are all the time pressing such buttons, and it is God ...
For that reason, it is crucial to maintain open the radical ambiguity of how cyberspace will affect our lives: this does not depend on technology as such but on the mode of its social inscription. Immersion into cyberspace can intensify our bodily experience (new sensuality, new body with more organs, new sexes ...), but it also opens up the possibility for the one who manipulates the machinery which runs the cyberspace literally to steal our own (virtual) body, http://www.zh89.com/ , depriving us of the control over it, so that one no longer relates to one the gesture by means of which aa subject was stripped of its direct, immediate right to make decisions; the great master of political mediatization was Napoleon who left to the conquered monarchs the appearance of power, while they were effectively no longer in a position to exercise it. At a more general level , one could say that such a of signing and thus conferring the performative force on the edicts whose content is determined by the elected governing body. And does not, mutatis mutandis, the same not hold also for today is also more and more strictly homologous to that of God in the Malebrancheian occasionalism: since the computer coordinates the relationship between my mind and (what I experience as) the movement of my limbs (in the virtual reality), one can easily imagine a computer which runs amok and starts to act liker an Evil God, disturbing the coordination between my mind and my bodily self-experience - when the signal of my mind to raise my hand is suspended or even counteracted in (the virtual) reality, (...) , the most fundamental experience of the body as s hallucination of the divine rays through which God directly controls the human mind. In other words, does the externalization of the big Other in the computer not account for the inherent paranoiac dimension of the wired universe? Or, to put it in a yet another way: the commonplace is that, in cyberspace, the ability to download consciousness into a computer finally frees people from their bodies - but it also frees the machines from Fantasy
The final inconsistency concerns the ambiguous status of the liberation of humanity anounced by Neo in the last scene. As the result of Neo same time, Neo addresses people still caught in the Matrix as the Savior who will teach them how to liberate themselves from the constraints of the Matrix - they will be able to break the physical laws, bend metals, fly in the air ... However, the problem is that all these are merely gaining additional power to change our mental prison rules - so what about exiting from the Matrix altogether and entering the

 Falling For Celebrity Engagement Rings



Falling For Celebrity Engagement RingsThere are couples soon to be engaged who want to imitate celebrity engagement rings as a symbol of their future devotion for each other. Plenty of designs and kinds of stones are available in the market for their selection. Famous people consult designers who create expensive engagement rings. In choosing these engagement rings, jewelers advise couples to know what they want in terms of the cut, clarity, color, http://www.scarpehoganitaly.com , and carat. These four factors are basic when it comes to the final decision before purchase.

Since the cost of celebrity engagement rings is in the thousands up to millions of dollars, couples who are going to be engaged can have the stones be smaller and the bands less expensive. Sales personnel will always encourage the couple to purchase a pricey set of engagement sets. However, the couple must bear in mind the budget for the engagement rings and further expenses beyond the engagement. These include the wedding rings, wedding, family life, education, and home ownership among others.

Famous people normally want diamond rings to celebrate their future union together. In speaking of diamonds, 70 carats is modest for them. For common folk who want to create a replica of their favorite celebrities�� engagement sets, they can opt for at least a 3 carat diamond. The band or setting that holds the diamond stone can be in silver, gold or platinum. For celebrities, they often want their diamond rings to be put on a platinum setting.

The wide range of selection for the wedding rings includes bridal sets, wedding ring sets, diamond rings, and cultural wedding rings. Bridal sets consist of the engagement ring, coordinated wedding ring, and men��s wedding ring. For wedding ring sets, the prospective groom and bride have his own ring. The diamond rings have diamond stones and settings that endlessly sparkle. The stone on the ring and band can be chosen separately. While custom rings can be made, they are a lot pricier than the commercially sold ones.

Celebrities who had exceptional symbols of a future marriage are Lady Diana Spencer, Elizabeth Taylor, Melanie Krauss, http://www.rayban-gafas.com , and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Princess Diana possessed an 18-carat oval sapphire. For her third engagement, Elizabeth Taylor received an estimated 30-carat emerald cut diamond. The 12-carat emerald cut ring of Melanie Krauss gained attention for its estimated cost. In Catherine Zeta-Jones��s case, she wore a 10-carat diamond. Their anniversary rings as an engaged couple showed the world how much wealth their fianc��s possessed and the kind of financial status they can have as married women.

Possessing these kinds of anniversary rings in celebrity style entails utmost care. Showing these symbols of future lifelong commitment are the deepest forms of devotion to your beloved. To own replicas of celebrity engagement rings can make the groom and bride feel wealthy. The significance of these unique rings is more important for any engaged couple. Whatever gem stone is put on the ring setting and material that constitutes the setting, the money invested for each ring was worked hard for and earned.

 The color was released with the L’Oreal Summer Siren Collection I recently showed you but it was missing from the display I first saw but on a recent trip to Walgreens I discovered the color. There is also a bright fuchsia shade that might be interest a few folks.


















Anyone grab it yet?












My passion is coral, peach, and various shades of orange for Spring and Coral Reef fits the bill perfectly.



I kinda love Infallible Lipgloss and I kinda hate it. The color wraps lips in a nice, long wearing drench of color but it feels a tad uncomfortable to wear due to a strange silicone feel…I wish they could improve the formula as I think it would be a worthy gloss if they tweaked it a bit. But overall, (...) , I do generally like it.



I kinda sorta have a love hate relationship with L’Oreal Infallible Lipgloss but I knew I needed to grab the limited edition Summer shade, Coral Reef, on the double as it reminded me so much of my all time favorite MAC Lipglass, Pink Grapefruit.



Take a peek!



I’m not going to bother you with a huge review on L’Oreal Infallible Lipgloss since I’ve babbled them in a prior review which you can find by clicking here.



I will however sing the praises of this new shade.










It’s available now, for a limited time, (...) , at (...) worth a pick up in my humblest particularly if you love Pink Grapefruit.



Coral Reef was to good to pass up and a fine shade for Summer.






Do share!



The color is a fiery corally orange and looks a bit like Pink Grapefruit, (...) , not a complete dupe here but quite a nice shade if you missed out on MAC’s version by some chance or simply love it as much as I (...) This product was purchased by the Muse for review purposes.

 ?Ecrire sur la musique m’a semblé plut?t cool et dr?le?




Ryan Schreiber, 35?ans, est le fondateur de Pitchfork Media, basé à Chicago. Après quatre mails, entre deux réunions et deux avions, il a fini par répondre aux questions de Libération.

Janvier?1976, mois de votre naissance, Bob Dylan (Desire), David Bowie (Station to Station) et T.?Rex (Futuristic Dragon) sortent un album. Votre choix ?

Bowie a complètement possédé les années?70. Onze albums en une décennie. Presque tous des classiques, dont certains figurent encore parmi mes favoris de tous les temps. C’est la rock star absolue : une ambition démesurée, une remise en cause permanente, http://www.sitomonclerdonna.com , un style impeccable. Même quand il était moins bon, http://www.giubbottimoncler-sito.com , il a toujours paru au-dessus des autres. Tout le monde veut être Bowie.

Durant votre enfance à Minneapolis, http://www.giubbottimoncler-sito.com , quelle était votre relation à la musique ?

La seule chose remarquable dans mon enfance et mon adolescence tient à ce que j’étais obsédé de musique. Mes parents, eux, ne l’étaient guère. Ils devaient avoir trente albums à la maison et pensaient que quelque chose n’allait pas chez moi : à 3?ans, je passais mon temps assis devant la stéréo. Ils avaient raison. Mon alternative a ainsi été la musique ou l’ennui.

Vous créez Pitchfork en?1995. Pourquoi ?

Parce que les fanzines étaient un des rares moyens d’entendre parler de rock indépendant dans les années?90. Et Minneapolis possédait alors une culture plut?t riche dans ce domaine. J’en dévorais des tonnes. Les meilleurs étaient les plus rares. Je lisais aussi des tas de magazines. Mais la plupart d’entre eux marginalisaient la couverture de la musique indé : je vivais cela comme une grande injustice. Ecrire sur la musique m’a semblé plut?t cool et dr?le. Je n’y avais jamais sérieusement pensé jusqu’à ce qu’un de mes amis me montre le potentiel du Web. Il y avait alors très peu de publications musicales sur le Net, et aucune ne traitait la musique qui m’intéressait.

Pourquoi un webzine plut?t qu’un magazine ?

Cela n’aurait pas été réaliste de débuter avec un journal papier. (...) Lire la suite sur Liberation.fr

 “Yes, yes,” said Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrey. “I entirely agree with you, http://www.popularboots2u.com !”
The question that had been disturbing Pierre all that day, since the Mozhaisk hill, now struck him as perfectly clear and fully solved. He saw now all the import and all the gravity of the war and the impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the stern, grave faces of which he had had glimpses, appeared to him in a new light now. He saw, to borrow a term from physics, the latent heat of patriotism in all those men he had seen, and saw in it the explanation of the composure and apparent levity with which they were all preparing for death. “We ought not to take prisoners,” said Prince Andrey. “That change alone would transform the whole aspect of war and would make it less cruel. But playing at war, that’s what’s vile; and playing at magnanimity and all the rest of it. That magnanimity and sensibility is like the magnanimity and sensibility of the lady who turns sick at the sight of a slaughtered calf—she is so kind-hearted she can’t see blood—but eats fricasseed veal with a very good appetite. They talk of the laws of warfare, http://www.popularboots4u.com , of chivalry, of flags of truce, and humanity to the wounded, and so on. That’s all rubbish. I saw enough in 1805 of chivalry and flags of truce: they duped us, and we duped them. They plunder other people’s homes, issue false money, and, worse than all, http://www.warmshoestimes.com , kill my children, my father, and then talk of the laws of warfare, and generosity to a fallen foe. No prisoners; and go to give and to meet death! Any one who has come to think this as I have, through the same sufferings …”
Prince Andrey, who had thought that he did not care whether they took Moscow as they had taken Smolensk, was suddenly pulled up in his speech by a nervous catch in his throat. He walked to and fro several times in silence, but his eyes blazed with feverish brilliance and his lips quivered, as he began to speak again.
“If there were none of this playing at generosity in warfare, we should never go to war, except for something worth facing certain death for, as now. Then there would not be wars because Pavel Ivanitch had insulted Mihail Ivanitch. But if there is war as now, let it be really war. And then the intensity of warfare would be something quite different. All these Westphalians and Hessians Napoleon is leading against us would not have come to fight us in Russia, and we should not have gone to war in Austria and in Prussia without knowing what for. War is not a polite recreation, but the vilest thing in life, and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept it sternly and solemnly as a fearful necessity. It all comes to this: have done with lying, and if it’s war, then it’s war and not a game, or else warfare is simply the favourite pastime of the idle and frivolous. … The military is the most honoured calling. And what is war, what is needed for success in war, what are the morals of the military world? The object of warfare is murder; the means employed in warfare—spying, treachery, and the encouragement of it, the ruin of a country, the plundering of its inhabitants and robbery for the maintenance of the army, trickery and lying, which are called military strategy; the morals of the military class—absence of all independence, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all that, it is the highest class, respected by every one. All sovereigns, except the Chinese, wear a military uniform, and give the greatest rewards to the man who succeeds in killing most people. … They meet together to murder one another, as we shall do to-morrow; they slaughter and mutilate tens of thousands of men, and then offer up thanksgiving services for the number of men they have killed (and even add to it in the telling), and glorify the victory, http://www.officialcheapuggboot.com , supposing that the more men have been slaughtered the greater the achievement. How God can look down from above and hear them!” shrieked Prince Andrey in a shrill, piercing voice. “Ah, my dear boy, life has been a bitter thing for me of late. I see that I have come to understand too much. And it is not good for man to taste of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. … Ah, well, it’s not for long!” he added. “But you are getting sleepy and it’s time I was in bed too. Go back to Gorky,” said Prince Andrey suddenly.

 La confiance des ménages en hausse de deux points en octobre




PARIS (Reuters) - La confiance des ménages fran?ais a progressé en octobre, inversement aux attentes des économistes, http://www.longchampsacspaschere.net , montre une enquête mensuelle de l&apos;Insee publiée mardi.

L&apos;indicateur synthétique de la confiance des ménages ressort à 82, en hausse de deux points par rapport à septembre.

Les 17 économistes et analystes interrogés par Reuters prévoyaient en moyenne un chiffre de 79 et les estimations les plus pessimistes le donnaient à 78.

Tombé à 77 en octobre 2008, ce baromètre du moral des consommateurs était remonté à 91 début 2010. Il évolue depuis septembre 2007 en dessous de sa moyenne historique de 100.

&quot;L&apos;opinion des ménages sur leur situation financière personnelle passée et future progresse : les soldes correspondants gagnent chacun 2 points et les ménages sont également plus nombreux qu&apos;en septembre à considérer comme opportun de faire des achats importants&quot;(+3 points), souligne l&apos;Insee dans un communiqué.

&quot;Les ménages jugent que le moment est plus favorable qu&apos;en septembre pour épargner. Après la forte baisse de l&apos;été (-8 points entre juillet et septembre), (...) , http://www.saclongchampsboutique.com , (...) , le solde correspondant augmente de 2 points&quot;, (...) , ajoute l&apos;Insee.

En octobre, http://www.saclongchampsfr.org , les ménages sont également moins nombreux à anticiper une augmentation du ch?mage. Cet indicateur perd 12 points après une forte hausse cet été (+23 points entre juillet et septembre).

L&apos;enquête de l&apos;Insee est réalisée chaque mois (sauf en ao?t) par téléphone auprès d&apos;environ 2.000 ménages.

 A closer inspection revealed the forgery. The ersatz O’Neal, for example, claimed to be sending tweets from the bench during a game  a virtual impossibility.



Stone said this was the first instance of celebrity impersonation that he knew of. Twitter is considering ways to certify accounts, so fans know when they are hearing from, say, the real Britney Spears (who does, in fact, tweet).



O’Neal added: “It’s a fun thing. It’s a way for fans to connect.”







“It was a very good impersonation,” Hessert said.



“Andrew Bynum’s knee is like Erika Dampier ... fragile,” ShaquilleONeal wrote Sept. 30, dealing a two-fisted insult to the Lakers’ Andrew Bynum and the Mavericks’ Erick Dampier.



And he had a message for Andrews and any other sham Shaqs out there.




Shaquille ONeal has moved into the Internet territory of his impersonator, ShaquilleONeal.



The real Shaq  who could fill an almanac with clever quips  could hardly have said it better. Now he is. O’Neal opened his own Twitter account this week to connect with fans and to take back his identity.



New York Times reporters, columnists and editors take an off-beat and analytical approach to N.B.A. news.



A number of celebrities use the service, including the actor Greg Grunberg (“Heroes”), (...) , the singer Dave Matthews and John Hodgman (the “P.C.” in the Apple Computer ads).



In response to Hessert’s complaint, Twitter pulled the plug on ShaquilleONeal this week. (The archive of pitch-perfect tweets remains online, at twitter.com/notShaqONeal.)



The synthetic Shaq sounded a lot like the real O’Neal. His blurbs were whimsical, boastful and creative, even adopting O’Neal’s unique grammatical flourishes.



“My tweets are Shaqalicious,” ShaquilleONeal wrote Nov. 11.





Shaquille O’Neal had a problem. An Internet impostor using his name was sending messages to unsuspecting Shaq fans. So O’Neal did what any sensible, 7-foot-1, muscle-bound mammoth would do. He started tweeting.



Meanwhile, Shaquille O’Neal is tweeting with the unbridled zeal of a 12-year-old. He posted 17 times Wednesday, making references to Oprah, yoga, Kobe and fettuccine. He had 1,131 subscribers as of Wednesday night  up from 40 in the morning.



Hessert said she wanted to protect the O’Neal brand. A Twitter spokesman said that impersonating people violates the company’s terms of service.



“All the longtime followers, over 500 followers, they know it’s a joke, (...) ,” said Andrews, who owns a Phoenix design and marketing agency. “I really didn’t have any intent to pull people’s leg. It was just to entertain.”



“This is the real SHAQUILLE O’NEAL,” came the message from The_Real_Shaq, via Twitter.com, early Tuesday morning.



“We do allow parody,” said Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder. “If it’s not clear and there is some confusion, we do get involved.”



“I just want to say, ‘Nice job,’ but now let the professional take over,” O’Neal said in an interview. “There can only be one me. Uno más me.”



The faux Shaq account was discovered last week by Sports Media Challenge, (...) , a consulting firm that works with O’Neal. Kathleen Hessert, the firm’s owner, was initially thrilled. She had been pushing O’Neal to Twitter with fans. She found the oddball references to the Pythagorean theorem and the Big Cactus to be very Shaq-like.



That was the point, said the man who created the account. Ward Andrews, http://www.saclancel-fr.com , the 33-year-old Suns fan behind ShaquilleONeal, said he included the occasional outlandish claim as a tip-off.



A clarification was in order because, for the last several months, someone registered as ShaquilleONeal was sending frequent messages, or tweets, to hundreds of subscribers.



“Somebody out there was trying to use my language and trying to speak for me,” O’Neal, sounding more amused than offended, said Wednesday night in a telephone interview. “Rather than have that happen, I thought I’d do it myself.”

 The Alzheimer&apos;s Association has more on Alzheimer&apos;s and type 2 diabetes.









After 40 months, researchers tested the participant&apos;s cognitive functionand saw no difference in decline between the groups. The study did find, however, (...) , that intensive blood sugar control prevented brain shrinkage.&quot;What that means for the long term preservation of cognitive function of these patients, we&apos;re still trying to figure out,&quot;Williamson said in the statement.





For the study - published in the September 27 issue of The Lancet - researchers recruited 3,000 diabetics between the ages of 55 and 80, and assigned them to either an&quot;intensive&quot;program aimed at lowering their gluclose (A1c) levels below 6 percentor a&quot;standard&quot;program that attempted to keep glucose levels between 7 and 7.9 percent.




People without diabetes typically have blood glucose levels between 4 and 6 percent, according to WebMD.



(CBS) People with diabetes are known to be at increased risk for dementia, and scientists were hopeful that a full-fledged assault on blood sugar might stave off diabetes-related mental decline. But no such luck.



More than 25 million Americans have diabetes. Earlier this month, (...) , a study in Neurology found diabetics were twice as likely as non-diabetics to develop dementia, (...) , CBS News reported.





Pictures: Alzheimer&apos;s disease: 7 things that raise your risk



New research suggests&quot;intensive&quot;blood glucose control won&apos;t do anything to stop the cognitive decline that accompanies diabetes.







&quot;We know that people with type 2 diabetes have a much higher risk of dementia and memory loss than people without diabetes, (...) ,&quot;study co-author Dr. Jeff D. Williamson, chief of geriatrics and gerontology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., http://comunikas.org/pg/blog/uygy6876h , said in a written statement.&quot;Does the added cost and effort to control blood sugar result in a slowed rate of memory loss?

So what should diabetics do in light of the rather depressing new study?







&quot;Patients should follow standard therapy, because there is no additional benefit to following a more intensive strategy,&quot;lead study author Dr. Lenore J.

 {RKEY},{RKEY},{RKEY} OICQ {RKEY},{RKEY},{RKEY} MSN {RKEY},{RKEY},{RKEY},{RKEY} government should redistribute wealth more fairly among all its citizens.2011-08-05 14:29:54.0By Dai ZhiyongPower-oriented distribution jeopardizes common prosperitydistribution,china, http://www.lisseurbbliss.com/ ,common prosperity,properity,Power-oriented distribution jeopardizes common prosperityPower-oriented distribution jeopardizes common prosperityEditor&apos;s Pick/enpproperty--&gt;



Minor difference [By Jiao Haiyang/China.org.cn]



On July 23, 2011, the Chongqing government issued 12 measures that aim to promote common prosperity. They include: funding and policy support to small businesses for their innovations; building large public housing; ensuring that 30 percent of government revenues go to&quot;people&apos;s livelihood&quot;; and enlarging the scope and scale of mortgages and refinancing for farmers. If all these measures can be implemented,Power-oriented distribution jeopardizes common prosperity - China.org.cn, disadvantaged groups can expect short-term benefits.


A huge wealth gap in China is a reality. China&apos;s Gini coefficient, a commonly used indicator of wealth inequality, is over 0.5 – higher than that of the U.S., http://www.cheaplouisvonline.biz/ , which is very cautious about redistribution of national revenue, let alone Sweden and other high-tax and high-welfare European countries. Deng Xiaoping once warned:&quot;If there is polarization, http://www.bottesbaileybouton.biz/ , reform will have been a failure.&quot;


Attributing the severe polarization to the market economy is a common mistake. Many developed countries with free market economies do not have such a deep gap. In China, http://www.aveccoin.biz/ , the gap is a result of the powerful using their power to keep the wealth to themselves. Those with unlimited power have gained huge wealth by dominated production factors such as land and capital, as well as by setting up barriers to access to keep a monopoly on key industries. Those who lack power also lack materials.


Between 1997 and 2007, http://www.achatdoudounemcler.biz/ , the portion of the GDP that went to workers&apos;wages declined from 53.4 percent to 46 percent. Meanwhile, government revenues increased. Fiscal revenue increased 30 percent between 1997 and the first half of this year to 5 trillion yuan (US$777 billion). But the growth in revenues has far outpaced the growth in public services, http://www.fashionlouisvbags.biz/ , rendering any redistribution talks empty.


A strong state with weak citizens makes common prosperity possible only with an introspective and conscious government. But the government has its own interests and will not be neutral without supervision. Thus, common prosperity cannot be achieved only through government benevolence. History tells us that common prosperity can only be reached when the primary distribution is done according to market laws and the second distribution is controlled by taxpayers.


Now, China has a laid a foundation for a market economy. But the reform of power still has a long way to go. If the administrator is good,Power-oriented distribution jeopardizes common prosperity - China.org.cn, the public will benefit. But if the administrator is unreliable, http://www.modedoudouneonline.biz/ , people can only struggle for living. Only through clearly defined rights and legal protections will farmers not be undersold for their land and urban residents not denied compensation for their houses.


To obtain sustainable good governance, http://www.birkinkelly.biz/ , the government should deepen reforms, http://www.sacsdeluxepascher.biz/ , let the power, which is from the people, service the people and consciously accept public supervision. Common prosperity represents justice in wealth distribution and the expansion of freedom on ruling one&apos;s life by oneself. If not, we could not avoid a tragedy that our country will be divided by social classes in opposition to each other.

He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves.

My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee&apos;s feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R��v��rence! Tout le monde en place!
(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, http://www.nicebootstoyou.com , gold, rose, violet.)
THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they&apos;d left behind.

 GERMAN EXPOSURE, http://www.beatsjustin.com German officials said the failed auction did not mean the government had refinancing problems and several analysts said Berlin just needed to offer a more attractive yield.

But it was a sign that, http://www.beatsjustin.com , as the bloc&apos;s paymaster, http://www.moncler-femmes.net , Germany may face creeping pressure as the crisis deepens that may cause it to re-examine its refusal to embrace a broader solution.

Economy Minister Philipp Roesler of the Free Democratic junior coalition partner called for parliament to reject euro zone bonds&quot;because we don&apos;t want German interest rates to rise dramatically.&quot;

But some market analysts are convinced joint debt issuance will eventually have to be part of a political solution to hold the euro zone together.

 tonight, everyone will pay verbal tribute to ronald reagan, (...) , who might have some trouble winning the presidential nomination of the new grand old party these days. the debate will be carried live on msnbc at 5 p.m. pacific.



this was supposed to be the second gop panel for perry, (...) , http://www.saclancel-frs.com , the late-comer and new front-runner. but he pulled out of sen. jim demint&apos;s values forum in south carolina monday to fly home and be governor during the giant state&apos;s wild wildfires.



recent polls have confirmed perry&apos;s rapid surge to the front of the republican field. he appears to have most hurt bachmann, another tea party favorite who can be expected to attack. a gallup poll this week found perry and romney to be about equally well-liked among republicans (seven-out-of-ten).





eight republicans will line up for the debate in the shadow of ronald reagan&apos;s air force one in his presidential library this evening.



obama will be a certain target but less so because republican house speaker john boehner saved the democrat from himself. obama wanted to talk jobs tonight too to a joint session of congress. boehner suggested thursday was better and the president acquiesced.



cross-state rivals perry and paul have already been sniping at each other. the 11-term congressman has criticized the nation&apos;s longest-serving governor as not a real conservative and dismissing him as more of the status quo.







a larger question many ask is how good is perry at debating? put another way, how bad can he be? he&apos;s never lost an election.



“it will be interesting,&quot;a perry spokesman suggestively suggested,&quot;to hear rep. paul explain why reagan drove him from the party at tomorrow’s debate on the grounds of the reagan library.&quot;





tuesday perry&apos;s surprisingly well-organized camp fired a salvo at paul, http://www.sacburberyfr.com , citing his 1987 resignation letter from the republican party in which he criticized the president now entombed just steps from tonight&apos;s debate site.



and how big are the bundles being assembled by perry&apos;s reputed hundreds of newly-recruited, enthusiastic bundlers, http://friensome.com/members/home , including some well-connected folks in california, where perry will forage for cash all day thursday.















but the most interesting debate dynamic will likely be between the two texans onstage with the same pair of initials -- rick perry, the governor, http://www.borseburberrysitos.com , and ron paul, http://www.saclancel-frs.com , the representative.





but gallup&apos;s intensity score gives perry twice the rating of romney, http://www.uggbootoutletonline.com , 25-12.





it&apos;s still almost a year out from the gop convention in tampa. ahh, (...) , florida in august. who wouldn&apos;t want to wear funny hats in that weather?







mitt romney and jon huntsman will be asked about their jobs plans. michele bachmann, (...) , rick santorum, herman cain and newt gingrich will chime in. for an interesting look at the surviving gop field, (...) , (...) , check out chris stirewalt&apos;s perceptive rundown here.



related:





but this month is already crucial. it&apos;s the last in the second quarter of campaign fundraising. we&apos;ll soon see how big a money bump bachmann got for winning the ames straw poll. if paul&apos;s $1.6 money-bomb was a one-day explosion?





&quot;there is no credibility left for the republican party as a force to reduce the size of government, (...) ,&quot;paul wrote near the end of reagan&apos;s second term before paul ran for president on the libertarian ticket.&quot;that is the message of the reagan years.&quot;

 I am one of those people because I feel bad all summer long because I can抰 wear my cute winter boots Employing the internet to shop for footwear and boots is turning into increasingly well-liked as it not only saves time but travel dollars as nicely Strut your stuff with your boot now!Feeling dull with the monotonous type of boots? Then rose pink lace up winter wedge boots may paint your lackluster lifeAfter days of working inside, http://www.topbootssaleuk.com , cooped up and feeling a certain communion with my internet connection, I&apos;d had enough If you have snow falling around, just winter shows would not suffice Stylish in design, these winter boots have a nubuck upper and lacingAs I watched the game my thoughts were about Manteee Winter boots are available on different shops and websites, http://www.topbootssaleuk.com , but you can trust that we are the best choice for your winter boots collection

Do your toes touch in front when going down the incline? Do your ankles wobble? Can you raise your heel? Is there room to wiggle your toes? Are there any tight spots or rubs? Does the tongue lie where it should or does it shift to the side?If the answer to any of these questions is unacceptable, http://www.vipbootssaleuk.com , move on to a different size or try a different boot altogether Though snow boots are waterproof, it tends to trap excessive warmth inside the shoes

The popular notion that knee high boots are for the catwalk models or Madonna or Britney Spears is no longer true Quilted jackets are especially stitched for additional protection in opposition to the seams opening up These boots are available in different stuff like leather and rubber We parked, http://www.cheapuggbootsuk4u.co.uk , got out and started walking They look cute, there are many colors and sizes Even so, should you just want them for comfort and to add a casual appear for your ensemble then attempt for a organic colour or even blackcustom-choppers-guide Besides the style and cut of your footwear, do take your other style choices into consideration

I rarely fish in the early morning, in the winter, but if you can get a fogged over morning with nicely rising afternoon temperatures that reach in to the 40s, you have a day to hit the water!What to wear:A few years ago I switched to breathable waders and I actually have never been more comfortable while winter fishinginnerText; } v = v Much more, they could be obtained in neighborhood stores even though online retailers are already providing winter scarves to their buyersWaterproof: Now this not really a style for winter boot but really a most for any boot if you happen to be traveling through a lot of wet environmentsHow to Check if Ugg Boots Are Fake1 Before you head for the shoe stores, http://www.vipbootssaleuk.com , you also have to consider some materials used to adorn your boots beside the budget The cost of living is reasonable, http://www.vipbootssaleuk.com , I&apos;ve gone there many a time on a scarily small budget and returned home happy and with money to spare Get the tall lace-up Minnetonka moccasin look with the Minnetona womens tall fringed suede leather boots showcasing a distinctive over the calf moc design, suede leather fringed collar and cushion insoles for an unbelievable comfort fit! If affordability is not a consideration at a price of one grand plus, the Christian Louboutin Lace-Up Boots lends attitude to this suede-covered style

 “We can’t go down there and shoot ourselves in the foot and jump offsides and turn the ball over, http://www.discountwarmcoat.com ,” Ballard said. “You can’t do that against good teams. We know if we want to beat the Packers the defense has to play well and the offense has to score every time we get an opportunity to score.”

 journey home. Next they went to the Lapland woman, who had made some
new clothes for them, and put their sleighs in order. Both the
reindeer ran by their side, and followed them as far as the boundaries
of the country, where the first green leaves were budding. And here
they took leave of the two reindeer and the Lapland woman, and all
said- Farewell. Then the birds began to twitter, and the forest too
was full of green young leaves; and out of it came a beautiful
horse, which Gerda remembered, http://www.fashionuggsalestore.com , for it was one which had drawn the
golden coach. A young girl was riding upon it, with a shining red
cap on her head, and pistols in her belt. It was the little
robber-maiden, who had got tired of staying at home; she was going
first to the north, and if that did not suit her, she meant to try
some other part of the world. She knew Gerda directly, and Gerda
remembered her: it was a joyful meeting.
&quot;You are a fine fellow to go gadding about in this way,&quot;said
she to little Kay,&quot;I should like to know whether you deserve that any
one should go to the end of the world to find you.&quot;
But Gerda patted her cheeks, and asked after the prince and
princess.
&quot;They are gone to foreign countries,&quot;said the robber-girl.
&quot;And the crow?&quot;asked Gerda.
&quot;Oh, the crow is dead,&quot;she replied;&quot;his tame sweetheart is now a
widow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg. She mourns very
pitifully, but it is all stuff. But now tell me how you managed to get
him back.&quot;
Then Gerda and Kay told her all about it.
&quot;Snip, snap, snare! it&apos;s all right at last,&quot;said the robber-girl.
Then she took both their hands, and promised that if ever she
should pass through the town, http://www.uggsforcheapofficial.com , she would call and pay them a visit. And
then she rode away into the wide world. But Gerda and Kay went
hand-in-hand towards home; and as they advanced, spring appeared
more lovely with its green verdure and its beautiful flowers. Very
soon they recognized the large town where they lived, http://www.fashionuggsalestore.com , and the tall
steeples of the churches, in which the sweet bells were ringing a
merry peal as they entered it, and found their way to their
grandmother&apos;s door. They went upstairs into the little room, where all
looked just as it used to do. The old clock was going&quot;tick, http://www.uggsforcheapofficial.com , tick,&quot;
and the hands pointed to the time of day, http://www.warmshoes4u.com , but as they passed through
the door into the room they perceived that they were both grown up,
and become a man and woman. The roses out on the roof were in full
bloom, and peeped in at the window; and there stood the little chairs,
on which they had sat when children; and Kay and Gerda seated
themselves each on their own chair, and held each other by the hand,
while the cold empty grandeur of the Snow Queen&apos;s palace vanished from
their memories like a painful dream. The grandmother sat in God&apos;s
bright sunshine, and she read aloud from the Bible,&quot;Except ye
become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the
kingdom of God.&quot;And Kay and Gerda looked into each other&apos;s eyes,
and all at once understood the words of the old song,

&quot;Roses bloom and cease to be,
But we shall the Christ-child see.&quot;

And they both sat there, grown up, yet children at heart; and it was
summer,- warm, beautiful summer.


THE END

FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN
THE SNOWDROP
by Hans Christian Andersen

IT was winter-time; the air was cold, the wind was sharp, but
within the closed doors it was warm and comfortable, and within the
closed door lay the flower; it lay in the bulb under the
snow-covered earth.
One day rain fell. The drops penetrated through the snowy covering
down into the earth, and touched the flower-bulb, and talked of the
bright world above. Soon the Sunbeam pierced its way through the
snow to the root, and within the root there was a stirring.

 “Rhett, don’t use such vulgar words!” cried Scarlett. “You talk like I wouldn’t be glad to see the Democrats come back! And you know that isn’t so! I’d be very glad to see them back. Do you think I like to see these soldiers hanging around, reminding me of—do you think I like— why, I’m a Georgian, too! I’d like to see the Democrats get back. But they won’t. Not ever. And even if they did, how would that affect my friends? They’d still have their money, wouldn’t they?”
“If they kept their money. But I doubt the ability of any of them to keep money more than five years at the rate they’re spending. Easy come, easy go. Their money won’t do them any good. Any more than my money has done you any good. It certainly hasn’t made a horse out of you yet, has it, my pretty mule?”
The quarrel which sprang from this last remark lasted for days. After the fourth day of Scarlett’s sulks and obvious silent demands for an apology, http://www.nicebootstoyou.com , Rhett went to New Orleans, taking Wade with him, over Mammy’s protests, http://www.sheepskinsnowboots2u.com , and he stayed away until Scarlett’s tantrum had passed. But the sting of not humbling him remained with her.
When he came back from New Orleans, cool and bland, she swallowed her anger as best she could, http://www.uscheapbootsshop.com , pushing it into the back of her mind to be thought of at some later date. She did not want to bother with anything unpleasant now. She wanted to be happy for her mind was full of the first party she would give in the new house. It would be an enormous night reception with palms and an orchestra and all the porches shrouded in canvas, and a collation that made her mouth water in anticipation. To it she intended to invite everyone she had ever known in Atlanta, http://www.usa-uggbootsclearance.com , all the old friends and all the new and charming ones she had met since returning from her honeymoon. The excitement of the party banished, for the most part, the memory of Rhett’s barbs and she was happy, happier than she had been in years as she planned her reception.
Oh, what fun it was to be rich! To give parties and never count the cost! To buy the most expensive furniture and dresses and food and never think about the bills! How marvelous to be able to send tidy checks to Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie in Charleston, and to Will at Tara! Oh, the jealous fools who said money wasn’t everything! How perverse of Rhett to say that it had done nothing for her!

Scarlett issued cards of invitation to all her friends and acquaintances, old and new, even those she did not like. She did not except even Mrs. Merriwether who had been almost rude when she called on her at the National Hotel or Mrs. Elsing who had been cool to frigidness. She invited Mrs. Meade and Mrs. Whiting who she knew disliked her and who she knew would be embarrassed because they did not have the proper clothes to wear to so elegant a function. For Scarlett’s housewarming, or “crush,” as it was fashionable to call such evening parties, half-reception, half-ball, was by far the most elaborate affair Atlanta had ever seen.
That night the house and canvas-covered veranda were filled with guests who drank her champagne punch and ate her patties and creamed oysters and danced to the music of the orchestra that was carefully screened by a wall of palms and rubber plants. But none of those whom Rhett had termed the “Old Guard” were present except Melanie and Ashley, Aunt Pitty and Uncle Henry, Dr. and Mrs. Meade and Grandpa Merriwether.
Many of the Old Guard had reluctantly decided to attend the “crush.” Some had accepted because of Melanie’s attitude, others because they felt they owed Rhett a debt for saving their lives and those of their relatives. But, two days before the function, a rumor went about Atlanta that Governor Bullock had been invited. The Old Guard signified their disapproval by a sheaf of cards, regretting their inability to accept Scarlett’s kind invitation. And the small group of old friends who did attend took their departure, embarrassed but firm, as soon as the governor entered Scarlett’s house.
Scarlett was so bewildered and infuriated at these slights that the party was utterly ruined for her. Her elegant “crush”! She had planned it so lovingly and so few old friends and no old enemies had been there to see how wonderful it was! After the last guest had gone home at dawn, she would have cried and stormed had she not been afraid that Rhett would roar with laughter, afraid that she would read “I told you so” in his dancing black eyes, even if he did not speak the words. So she swallowed her wrath with poor grace and pretended indifference.

How would fans feel about watching the living legend walk out the door and return to Lucas Oil Stadium to beat the Colts at the helm of, say, the Cleveland Browns?

Giants: The offense may get a little help against Green Bay Packers with running back Ahmad Bradshaw possibly returning to the lineup for the first time since late last month This week its really a toss-up because of the success of kicker Sebastian Janikowski and punter Shane Lechler And as much as the talk in the Queen City has been about rookie quarterback Andy Dalton and his targets, more focus should be paid to what defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer has done with a group of no-names and relative afterthoughts The Dolphins have the leagues seventh-best run defense, allowing just 977 ppg) and 29th in total offense (295

NEW ORLEANS – The National World War II Museum rolled out the red carpet Tuesday for actor Tom Hanks and the stars of a new HBO miniseries set during that war.







Hanks is an executive producer of&quot;The Pacific, http://www.lujobolsos.biz/ ,&quot;a 10-part miniseries which follows three U.S. Marines fighting in the Pacific Theater during World War II.


Hanks joined the miniseries&apos;stars — James Badge Dale, Jon Seda and Joe Mazzello — for a screening of the first episode at city&apos;s convention center, followed by a reception at the New Orleans museum.


Hanks also teamed up with&quot;The Pacific&quot;executive producers Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman on HBO&apos;s&quot;Band of Brothers,&quot;a 2001 miniseries set in Europe during World War II.


&quot;The Pacific,&quot;which debuts on HBO on March 14, http://www.fashionlouisvbags.biz/ , depicts some of the war&apos;s bloodiest battles, including Guadalcanal, http://www.bottesclassiques.biz/ , Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Dale, http://www.cheaplouisvonline.biz/ ,Tom Hanks attends HBO miniseries screening in N.O., Seda and Mazzello each play real-life men who fought in the Pacific campaign.


&quot;There are three main characters that we follow, http://www.modedoudouneonline.biz/ , so therefore we got to be even more personal than we were in Band of Brothers. So in a weird way by focusing on less characters by number, http://www.damierhandtaschen.com/ , we were able to expand the scope,&quot;Hanks said while on the red carpet inside the convention center.


Before the 10-month shoot started in Australia, the cast endured a grueling 10-day&quot;boot camp&quot;under the direction of Dale Dye, http://www.monogramtaschen.com/ , an actor and military advisor whose screen credits include&quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;They also met with relatives of the men they portrayed and veterans who fought in the battles portrayed in the miniseries.


&quot;These are the guys we&apos;re doing it for,&quot;said Dale, who plays the late Robert Leckie.&quot;This is their story. These are the men who have been there.&quot;


Mazzello, who plays the late Eugene Sledge, said his grandfather fought in the Pacific and died during the miniseries&apos;filming.


&quot;Before he died, he got to know that I was going to be doing this and I was going to be honoring men like him,&quot;he said.


Seda downplayed comparisons between the two miniseries, http://www.zapatillasbolsos.biz/ , saying&quot;The Pacific&quot;shows a different side of war than&quot;Band of Brothers.&quot;


&quot;We&apos;re just trying to keep in line with what they started, http://www.damierlouisv.biz/ , which was to honor all the men on both sides, from the Pacific to Europe, http://www.rabattlouisvtaschen.com/ , and honor all the men who sacrificed,&quot;he said.


Sid Phillips, http://www.classiquesdoudoune.biz/ , 85, of Mobile, Ala.,Tom Hanks attends HBO miniseries screening in N.O., http://www.achatdoudounemcler.biz/ , who is portrayed by Ashton Holmes in the miniseries, was 17 years old when he fought on Guadalcanal. He said he was struck by how the miniseries actually captured what he remembers about the war, including the density and wetness of the jungle.


&quot;War movies are never accurate to war veterans but I think this is maybe the best one I&apos;ve seen so far, http://www.classiquesdoudoune.biz/ ,&quot;Phillips said.

 The extreme fall from grace prompted personnel changes early in the week at Colts headquarters, where defensive coordinator Larry Coyer was fired and second-string quarterback Dan Orlovsky was elevated to starter in place of the chronically-struggling Curtis Painter With Suh leading a powerful defensive line, the Lions have been able to field the league&apos;s sixth-ranked pass defense despite rushing four or fewer men on 79 It was stupidly expensive, I don&apos;t like the Bears, and never even loved Hester that much, so I don&apos;t know what convinced me that I needed this so badly Plenty of film study on Stafford and his tendencies could help create chances for this somewhat porous defense Not expected to play

 Colleagues said Dr. Old was esteemed as much for encouraging the research of others as for his own work. As scientific director of the Cancer Research Institute from 1971 until 2005, he was instrumental in awarding grants to hundreds of researchers in immunology, including five who won the Nobel Prize.




Cancer immunotherapy, also known as biotherapy, describes an array of treatments, most using cells from the cancer patient, (...) , to bolster the bodys natural ability to kill cancer and to make the immune system better at detecting cancer cells that avoid immunological surveillance.




His research focused mainly on deciphering the cellular codes by which the immune system communicates.




But colleagues said endurance was one of his strengths.&quot;He was a visionary,&quot;Dr. ODonnell-Tormey said.&quot;He could think long-term.&quot;


Courtesy of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center




The discovery also provided a new theoretical framework for cancer vaccine research. Since Dr. Old and Dr. Boyces discovery, vaccine research has focused on the premise that tumors avoid the bodys immune response by hiding their cell surface markers. Vaccines are being designed to trigger the immune response by injecting patients with markers that carry their cancers unique antibody-attracting signature.




Lloyd John Old was born on Sept. 23, 1933, in San Francisco to Edna and John Old. His father worked as a construction engineer.




Besides his sister, Dr. Old is survived by two nephews and a niece.



Dr. Lloyd Old&apos;s work led to acceptance of immunotherapy.




The cause was prostate cancer, http://www.louisvuittonborser.com , his family said.






The discovery led to the development of a cell classification system that is widely used in diagnosing cancer and other illnesses because every type of cell was found to have a unique surface marker.




Dr. Old, who held posts at a host of institutions in New York, including Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, was considered the patriarch and chief proponent of a nascent branch of cancer treatment known as immunotherapy.




Dr. Lloyd J. Old, who made seminal discoveries about the relationship between cancer and the immune system, and despite setbacks in the field steadfastly promoted the development of vaccines and other immunological means to fight cancer, died on Nov. 28 at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.




Dr. Old and a colleague at Sloan-Kettering, Dr. Edward A. Boyce, made a significant contribution to the field in the early 1960s with their discovery of so-called cell surface markers. These are antibody receptors on all living cells, healthy or malignant, that act as the on and off switches of the bodys immunity defense. The immune system reads the markers and, in the best cases, attacks malignant cells while ignoring healthy ones.




After graduating from Berkeley and the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, he began his research work at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, where he remained throughout his career.




Dr. Old was not a candidate for the treatment. But the agencys approval of Provenge and another immunotherapy called Yervoy, for advanced melanoma, http://www.poloralphlaurenitaliam.com ,&quot;gave Dr. Old a great sense of excitement,&quot;said Jill ODonnell-Tormey, executive director of the Cancer Research Institute.&quot;He felt the field was approaching another level.&quot;




It was considered unconventional bordering on fringe when Dr. Old began his work in the 1960s, but it is now a popular field and is listed on the Web site of the American Cancer Society as one of the standard options for cancer treatment, http://www.poloralphlaurenitaliam.com , along with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.




The violin was his first love. He spent a year after graduating from high school studying with several violin masters in Paris before returning to attend the University of California, http://www.louisvuittonborser.com , Berkeley.&quot;He always remained passionate about music, but realized, I think, that he was never going to be the best violinist in the world,&quot;said his sister, Constance Old.&quot;He wanted to try to be the best at what he did.&quot;




&quot;Without Lloyd Old, there would be one less therapy available to treat cancer patients,&quot;said Dr. Irving Weissman, http://www.poloralphlaurenitaliam.com , director of the Institute of Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine.&quot;He has kept a field alive that shows great promise.&quot;




He was the first to identify&quot;killer T-cells&quot;and&quot;helper T-cells,&quot;which search for and destroy malignancies. The discovery opened a broad field of study into ways of marshaling such cells to combat cancer and other diseases, including the many illnesses associated with AIDS.






He was often the first to concede a persistent gap between cancer immunology research and practical results. Early breakthroughs in the 1960s and 70s were widely portrayed as magic bullets when, in fact,&quot;the difficulties were underestimated, the timeline was unrealistic and the claims were overstated,&quot;he said in a 1995 interview with the journal Science, referring to one failed experiment among many.




Many researchers attribute the scientific coming-of-age to Dr. Old and the hundreds of scientists whose work he helped support when he led the Cancer Research Institute, a New York philanthropic group that has provided about $200 million for research and training in the field over the last four decades.




&quot;For a long time, this was not a very popular avenue of research,&quot;said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a professor of oncology and pathology at Johns Hopkins University.&quot;But Lloyd believed that the immense power of the immune response, rather than pills and drugs, was the best way to fight this horrible disease.&quot;




Last year, shortly before he receiving the prostate cancer diagnosis, Dr. Olds belief was at least partially vindicated by the Food and Drug Administrations approval of the first cancer treatment vaccine. Using research springing from the discovery of cell surface markers, the Dendreon Corporation developed the vaccine Provenge for certain patients with advanced prostate cancer.

 Stahl: When you were chosen, there was a lot of criticism. I saw a headline that said,&quot;The Job Czar from Hell&quot;because of how many jobs GE has outside the US.






























1 2 3 4 Next Page



Watch the Segment


The following script is from&quot;The Jobs Czar&quot;which aired on Oct. 9, (...) , 2011.








What he&apos;s doing is heading a council of CEOs, http://www.sacburberyfr.com , Wall Streeters and labor leaders to help the president come up with ideas for immediate and long term job growth.





No company has gone global more aggressively than General Electric, the conglomerate that makes everything from refrigerators to MRI machines to jet engines.



One of the reasons the president chose Immelt as his jobs czar is because he&apos;s actually building new manufacturing plants in the U.S.







General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt was charged by the president with a Herculean task: figuring out how to get big American firms to start hiring again. First, he says, we need&quot;a sense of national urgency around jobs&quot;and a government that&apos;s focused 100 percent on the task at hand. But can Immelt, a self-proclaimed globalist when it comes to running his own company, really help solve America&apos;s biggest domestic problem? Lesley Stahl reports.



Immelt: I think, Lesley, there needs to be a sense of national urgency around jobs that basically, if you just looked at how many hours a day do Republicans spend on job creation, do Democrats spend on job creation, and does the White House, it&apos;s nowhere close to 100 percent. We&apos;re not spending enough time on jobs.



GE&apos;s Jeff Immelt: The controversy over U.S. jobs

If you think the only initials on CEO Jeff Immelt&apos;s mind are&quot;GE,&quot;then think again. He&apos;s also big on&quot;R&amp;D,&quot;research and development













This past week, President Obama has been out around the country talking about creating jobs. To help him get Americans back to work, he&apos;s recruited a most unlikely jobs czar: the Republican CEO of General Electric, (...) , Jeff Immelt.



















Stahl: Not you, http://www.sacburberyfr.com !








(CBS News)






Can General Electric Chairman Jeffrey Immelt, whose company has been racking up big profits overseas, help create jobs in America? Lesley Stahl interviews the man President Obama chose to lead the crucial quest for more American jobs.



Stahl: We need to create 300,000 new jobs a month, just to get back to where we were before the recession.





All told he is adding 15,000 jobs in the U.S. - about half in manufacturing.



Immelt: You know, I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio and my parents are really right wingers. My dad watches like, five or six hours of&quot;Fox News&quot;every day and stuff like that. So I called home and said, (...) ,&quot;Hey, just to give you a heads up, you know, I&apos;m going to be with the President and he&apos;s asked me to lead this jobs council.&quot;And my mother said,&quot;Well, you said, (...) , no, of course didn&apos;t you?&quot;I said,&quot;No mom, that&apos;s not what I said.&quot;







Immelt: We&apos;ve got whole new generations of jet engines, whole new generations of gas turbines. We&apos;re spending a lot inside the US.













Jeff Immelt talked about his czarship at a recent gathering of GE managers.









Immelt: The mood is dark. People are pissed. Why not try to do better?







Andrew Metz is the producer.







He wanted to show us one: this new factory in Batesville, Mississippi, where they&apos;re making jet engines for the new Boeing Dreamliner.







Stahl: Does anybody know how many different parts go into that?





Immelt: I&apos;ve taken heat from the right and heat from the left. And it&apos;s been uncomfortable sometimes for me personally to be, to work with the president on this. And I&apos;m proud to do it.















Immelt: In this engine we probably have invested a billion and a half dollars as a company before getting the first, the first sale.







Immelt: Somebody does. I&apos;m not sure, if it&apos;s, it&apos;s not me!







Not since the Great Depression has unemployment been this bad for this long. And one of the reasons is that U.S. companies have gone abroad for their workers and their profits. Over the last decade, big American firms have cut around 3 million jobs in the U.S. while adding almost as many overseas.









In Louisville, Kentucky - where GE&apos;s Appliance Park has lost about 16,000 workers -- he&apos;s actually bringing jobs back from China and Mexico, where wages are going up.























[Immelt walking onto stage with President Obama, saying: Thank you]

 1, company background
A wholly foreign-owned food manufacturing companies to invest in China has six factories (not included in the OEM factories under construction), its four main brands, with annual sales of nearly 10 million.
2, (...) , the logistics of the company
Transportation Basic:
Company&apos;s major sales regions are still concentrated in the south, north and south roughly 7:3 ratio of sales (in the Yangtze River into North and South). As the production is a low-value-added glass canned food (being only a small part of the use of PET bottles), so the company has been paying more attention to the logistics costs. that the overall cost of sales logistics costs account for about 4%.
A number of plant per day shipping 300-500 tons. Automotive provincial distribution of the main use, and the port city of more use outside the province and then a short sea container calls to the customer. in the province over a period of time distribution is also free to use the vehicle, but considering the high cost eventually switch to third-party logistics vehicles.
Transportation management major tasks: monitoring the operation of quality; management contracts (price negotiations); daily review; provide shipping information to other relevant departments.
Freight settlement: auto transport prices set different standards for different tonnages collected (for example, the same destination 1-3 tons, 3 tons -8 tons, 8 tons -10 tons, 10 tons, denominated in units of yuan / ton ) order notice to every customer service team (transport provider), under orders from the supplier to send the vehicle to the factory loading, the specific vehicle scheduling done by the supplier (for example, where a few votes in a truck-mounted goods, or how much equipment per shipment .) vendor shipments based on a monthly reconciliation with the customer service department to confirm shipping.
Of the problem: if the company wants to reduce the transportation costs from those considerations or concerns what? (Currently mainly through the annual price negotiations with suppliers to reduce prices)
Initiate:
In this case, as the logistics sector managers only superficial attention to the issue price. as the transport price negotiations, if only a single way to reduce the effect is poor. The main reason is the transportation of logistics enterprises is difficult to clearly constitute the specific circumstances of what the cost, logistics companies insist once the price is the lowest, it will be difficult to talk about. Of course, companies can find other logistics providers to do reference price, http://www.budgetblankets.com/ , but because other companies do not operate over specific business enterprise, the enterprise is not about the actual logistics offer may be biased (for example: traffic, business characteristics , the line distribution, the frequency may affect the price); other logistics providers offer should also consider the size, operational capability and credit capabilities. So the collection of external prices, the study of back-up suppliers were logistics departments are very important. Here we want to talk about those key is not over. In the case, we note that the company&apos;s logistics scheduling management functions of the weak, actually send a single assist in the completion by the supplier, so no doubt lost an important management tool for price control order management and route planning. Order assigned by the supplier, that the settlement is undoubtedly settled by vote, (...) , route planning can not be achieved, but can not achieve economies of scale management, order was forced to have settled at least the base, so that enterprises may suffer (such as a 10 t truck, loaded the 3 ticket goods, including a car 2.5 tons to Zhongshan, 2.5 tons to Shaoguan, 5-ton to Jiangmen, so is +2.5 tons with 2.5 tons to Shaoguan, Zhongshan to Jiangmen +5 tons, and some are Price List in the relatively high price.
but the actual operation, more companies are using the vehicle to a point farthest point of the pricing unit Cadogan, of course, the distance between these points is not too far , and are on a line.
above is not necessarily the best way, part of the business through practice and communication with suppliers will be adjusted). to give up the initiative in scheduling, while, in fact, there are two disadvantages for order management, controlling the size of orders, orders not fully achieved the purpose of the time; and for the transport time control more difficult. As a logistics provider to consider is how most of the lowest cost, it is sometimes reasonable to consider the line arrangement less. Line unreasonable, therefore delivery times may lengthen. If the line because of logistics planning and inadequate business increased operating costs have to assume that this price is no doubt even more unreasonable.

BEVERLY HILLS, http://www.louisvforever.biz/ , Calif. – The Golden Globes remain Hollywood&apos;s second-biggest film honors. Yet they are not the weather vane they used to be for predicting which film might triumph at the Academy Awards.

The 68th annual Globes, http://www.rabattlouisvtaschen.com/ , whose nominations come out Tuesday morning, http://www.bottesbaileybouton.biz/ , will feature 10 best-picture nominees, five each in the dramatic category and the musical or comedy category.

The Oscars switched from five best-picture nominees to 10 last year and will continue with that doubled lineup, so plenty of overlap can be expected between Globe and Oscar contenders.

But only once in the last six years has the winner of one of the Globe best-film prizes gone on to win best picture at the Oscars — 2008&apos;s&quot;Slumdog Millionaire.&quot;

That came after a stretch of eight-straight years when a Globe winner in either the dramatic or musical-comedy category went on to claim the best-picture Oscar.

With two acclaimed dramas — the British monarchy tale&quot;The King&apos;s Speech&quot;and the Facebook story&quot;The Social Network&quot;— considered front-runners this time, there are prospects of another divergent year between the Globes and the Oscars, http://www.modedoudouneonline.biz/ , whose nominations come out Jan. 25, nine days after the Globes are presented.

&quot;The Social Network&quot;already has snagged two key prizes as both Los Angeles and New York film critics groups picked it as the year&apos;s best movie.

Other possible Globe drama contenders include the sci-fi smash&quot;Inception,&quot;the ballet tale&quot;Black Swan,&quot;the Western&quot;True Grit, http://www.louisvforever.biz/ ,&quot;the boxing saga&quot;The Fighter&quot;and the survival story&quot;127 Hours.&quot;

Among musical and comedy prospects are the lesbian-family tale&quot;The Kids Are All Right,&quot;the Lewis Carroll fantasy&quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot;the song-and-dance extravaganza&quot;Burlesque,&quot;the curmudgeon chronicle&quot;Barney&apos;s Version&quot;and the romances&quot;Greenberg,&quot;&quot;Love&amp;Other Drugs,&quot;&quot;How Do You Know&quot;and&quot;Cyrus.&quot;

The Globes and Oscars typically line up better on acting winners. Last year,&quot;Avatar&quot;won best drama at the Globes and&quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;took best picture at the Oscars. But all four Oscar acting recipients — Sandra Bullock for&quot;The Blind Side,&quot;Jeff Bridges for&quot;Crazy Heart,Golden Globes launch Hollywood into awards season,&quot;Mo&apos;Nique for&quot;Precious&quot;and Christoph Waltz for&quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;— also won prizes at the Globes first.

Clear favorites have emerged this season for best actor (Colin Firth in&quot;The King&apos;s Speech&quot;) and supporting actor (Christian Bale in&quot;The Fighter&quot;).

Annette Bening for&quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot;and Natalie Portman for&quot;Black Swan&quot;could wind up in a two-woman race for best actress, while the supporting-actress category is up for grabs among prospects that include Amy Adams and Melissa Leo for&quot;The Fighter, http://www.lujobolsos.biz/ ,&quot;Helena Bonham Carter for&quot;The King&apos;s Speech&quot;and 14-year-old newcomer Hailee Steinfeld for&quot;True Grit.&quot;

No matter how the two awards shows line up on winners, http://www.popularlouisvbags.biz/ , the stars generally can count on a good time at the Globes, http://www.mclerdoudounesoldes.biz/ , a more laid-back, http://www.classiclouisvoutlet.biz/ , dinner-and-drinks affair than the stately Oscars.

The Globes are presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 85 critics and reporters for overseas outlets. Actors Katie Holmes, Blair Underwood and Josh Duhamel will announce nominees.

Robert De Niro, an eight-time Globe nominee who won a best-actor prize there for&quot;Raging Bull, http://www.monogramtaschen.com/ ,&quot;will receive the group&apos;s Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement.

Ricky Gervais is returning as host of the Globes ceremony, http://www.classiquesdoudoune.biz/ , which will air live Jan. 16 on NBC.

 Barkley is genuinely conflicted about his decisionThe Colts have had a disastrous season without quarterback Peyton Manning, who has been out all year after undergoing neck surgery on Sept We don&apos;t normally do things like that&quot;That&apos;s a good defense, one of the top defenses in the league,&quot;Saints tailback Pierre Thomas saidAndy Dalton, (...) , the Bengals&apos;second-round pick out of TCU and who we&apos;ve taken to calling Ginger Power (nobody&apos;s asked Dalton&apos;s his thoughts on it but it has to be better than Red Rifle), has been more important to his team&apos;s success this season than Newton

The Bengals quarterback&apos;s ability to anticipate (in how he thew the ball before the receivers broke) really stood out to Roethlisberger 8WR Brandon Marshall: BenchThe road ahead doesnt look good, eitherI remember we had a double move on, and I underthrew it a little bit and he jumped over a couple guys and made the catch, Dalton said

 &quot;Ndamukong Suh will get his appeals hearing right away If the Colts are forced off the field quickly, well, you know what&apos;ll happen The truth is that they havent blacked a game out in nearly two years when nearby Tampa Bay has had every single game blacked out with the exception of one during the same stretch Now it&apos;s one of the most glaring mismatches in recent memory, with Indianapolis heading to the house that Tom Brady built as the first 20-point underdog since 2007, and the most obvious indicator yet as to how precipitously the franchise has fallen in the aftermath of Manning&apos;s career-threatening neck surgery We can&apos;t fall another game behind at this point

And it doesIt was nearly three years ago the Green Bay Packers were enjoying another Lions visit to Lambeau Field, as Detroit was losing yet again in Wisconsin 21-31 But a far bigger concern is Saints QB Drew Brees, who&apos;s been at his surgical best the past three weeks partially because his line hasn&apos;t allowed a sack since Brees was bagged six times in New Orleans&apos;last loss, a 31-21 upset at St So he sets the tone for the whole meeting with me throwing a hitch into the dirt and him screaming at me saying, (...) , Foxboro High School could complete this pass&quot;Just from a stature standpoint he presents challenges

Gabbert was pulled in favor of journeyman Luke McCown in the fourth quarter of that game after completing an off-target 13-of-29 passes for 136 yards and an interception Regardless, (...) , this game should offer a chance for the passing game to spread itself out and make some plays&quot;That punishment was swift and severe, which fits right in with the NFL&apos;s crackdown on violent hits during the past year Greer said it will be an opportunity to step it up against one of the best in the business and that now is the time to&quot;make your mark The pass defense has been better lately as well, (...) , with the Dolphins having garnered six interceptions over the past three weeks after snaring a mere two in the first eight games

Rather than pursuing perfection as they did through 14 games only two seasons ago, Indianapolis is desperately trying to avoid the ignominy of reversing that pursuit this season0 32 3:04One-Point GoalsFootball can have one-point goals, but only as a point-after-touchdown The Jaguars have won both of the games played in Jacksonville, however, posting a 27-21 triumph over San Diego in 2003 and a 24-17 decision in 2007&quot;I love Tedy and appreciate all those things when they are said, but I still feel like I have some more football to be played,&quot;he said

It could be that chapter Manning negatively influenced his legacy because of an ill-fated pass It says a lot about how far McNabb has fallen that the Bears would rather let Caleb Hanie lead them to the playoffs, and the Texans would rather let T Frazier said McNabb did not mention the possibility of retirement

There seems to be a growing divide between the Polians and their franchise QBThe Packers had hoped to bring Clifton back to practice this week and possibly prepare him to play during the final month of the season, but that is now on hold At 7-4, the Raiders hold a one-game edge on surprising Denver for first place In Tebow&apos;s only loss as a starter, the Lions committed linebackers to spy Tebow and forced him to stand and deliver in the pocket A lot of confidence in him, (...) , his ability, (...) , his upper-body strength, (...) , his smarts Suh said he had a better understanding of the rules after that meeting
