McDonald&apos;s Incident

 97 Specialk3749 posted 2 years ago 
Yesterday my husband went into McDonald&apos;s to get my son some lunch. He chose this place because of the Monopoly game, otherwise he would have gone somewhere else. He went through the drive-thru and ordered. When he got down the street he noticed that on his large cup, the game pieces had already been pulled off. He went back to the store and went in and asked for a manager. He told her he wasn&apos;t sure if he got a defective cup or a dirty one! The manager took his cup, yelled at the employees about making sure that there wasn&apos;t any defective items going out through the drive thru and handed back a new cup to my husband. No apology, no acknowledgement that there was a problem and she was going to handle it, nothing! When he got home, we made a complaint on the MD&apos;s website. Today we received a form letter telling us they would send us a free game piece. What do you think? Does this make up for the way the manager acted? Should we take it further and complain about getting a form letter?

How about not spending any more money with McDonalds?

He should have apologised but surely there&apos;s no need to take it further bearing in mind the&quot;nature&quot;of the incident and you have received a formal letter which I&apos;m sure would have apologised on his behalf.

I think the free game piece makes up for it. I don&apos;t know of anyone who hasn&apos;t got angry at work before - even if it was just once. No one&apos;s perfect. He might even apologise to you the next time you go - when he&apos;s in a better mood.

Check on who is the Franchise Owner, and then call McDonalds headquarters and complain about the Franchise Owner allowing the franchise to run that sloppy. Might have more weight that way.

Usualy they do not care, they figure if you go there you are looking for only cheep and fast, and they do not put much effort out, to keep it cheep. Its All about the profits, no vision for real folks or service. They figure if they loose one, its ok, they will get plenty more looking for (Cheep and fast). They know its not the food that brings you there!


PS First, check the game piece you may have won!....lol

I thought that the manager was out of character there; he should have been polite with the customer and his staff; but instead he was rude about the whole incident. I would have gone to the regional manager and speak about what happened that day. It is not fair to be submitted to that kind of treatment, period. Sorry that has happened to you.

Sorry to here that. Next time take extra few min to check items out before you pull off. Even if theirs a long line. Just make sure your food and items are right. They should have said sorry but at least they gave you another cup. Or go in the McDonald&apos;s I now we want the fast way out but sometimes its best to take extra time and go in then you can check food right their in front of them.

well I do think they owe you more than just another game piece. And the managers handling of the incident was inappropriate and not professional as they should have apologized to you to say the least.

having said that yes, I would follow up again with management. Ask to speak to the regional manager this time. explain your concern over the&quot;used&quot;cup and of course how the manager handled it.

Hey good looking kid! No but you can&apos;t really expect much when you consider the caliber of people they employ. That doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t some smart ones but in general they aren&apos;t going to be the brightest stars in the sky. They are typically unskilled labor or they are teenagers. When that boys a teenager ask that question again. My son&apos;s a chemistry major in college and doing ok and I love him to death but he still can be a moron.

You got an apology from McDonalds and an extra game piece why do you feel like you&apos;re owed anything more? What good is it going to do to take this further other then waste time you could spend doing something useful. It&apos;s a fast food restaurant not a five star joint you got what you paid for.

The old adage is so true - you get what you pay for.

I personally wouldn&apos;t take this any further, submitting a complaint in the first place is certainly sufficient. Just don&apos;t give them your business again, it&apos;s not the only place to eat. This is your best option. 

Trust me, McDonalds isn&apos;t going to change it&apos;s training policies or reprimand a manager from a singular customer complaint. Their model works, they&apos;re making money and irregardless of what they say, the folks sitting at McDonald&apos;s worldwide headquarters simply doesn&apos;t care about how you or I have been treated at one of their tens of thousands of restaurants.

MC Donald burger king fast food like that what do you expect there except a happy cheap meal. Everyone is paid like minimum wage and nobody cares about anything in those places. The meat is really bad for you and the kids. If you can afford a sandwich your better off. My girlfriend got poisoned at Wendie&apos;s. I expect that type of service in those places. Be careful and forget about it! thank god you all healthy. love all.

I used to work at McDonalds in high school. All of the employees were treated very poorly. It wasn&apos;t common for me to work-- as a 16 year old-- 9 hour shifts without more than a 15 minute break and sometimes no break; both are against the law. It has nothing to do with intelligence, it&apos;s motivation. You are payed pennies to work harder than people making twice what you make and being treated with respect. So, you can&apos;t expect anything from kids toughing it out at McDonalds long enough to have a decent resume for a better job.
What happened in your case-- most likely-- was that the employees got bored later at night when there was only one manager there and went back into the stock area and peeled off a bunch of the monopoly pieces.
The managers will demonstrate an immediate act of rectification to appease the customer but in the scheme of things two missing game pieces on a cup doesn&apos;t even make it onto the list of worries for employees. If everyone else is so perfect and thinks they are beyond human error, then they should go work at McDonalds and show the world that their sweeping generalities and conjectures aren&apos;t just ignorance.

How can anyone with kids avoid McDonald&apos;s? I&apos;ve tried, it doesn&apos;t work!
Being annoyed is reasonable but I wouldn&apos;t have done anymore EXCEPT that it crossed their minds that the cup may have been used. That is enough to make me want to do more but what can be done? It&apos;s worth following up but only as far as they went, don&apos;t see a reason for more. At least McDonald&apos;s gives teens a place to work before they have a clue. And it seems totally reasonable to expect the kids tore them off or didn&apos;t notice they were missing.

I&apos;m still waiting for my youngest to get tired of McDonald&apos;s and he&apos;s already fifteen! If you persuade a kid to enjoy going somewhere else, the next question is,&quot;So NOW can we go to McDonald&apos;s since we didn&apos;t get to last time?&quot;
 reply more→ report permalink 97 Specialk3749 posted 2 years ago 
Thanks for all your replies! McDonalds is NOT my favorite place to eat and I avoid it whenever possible. The only time my husband and I do go there is when they have the Monopoly game pieces. Something my family and I enjoy doing...lame I know! 

I can understand that there are kids working there and if it was just a kid that had done this, I would have understood. But, with it being a possibility of being a dirty cup and my husband talked with an&quot;adult&quot;manager, we expected it to be handled differently. 

I guess, I am from the old age that the customer is always right and if you want business, you make the customer happy. If I had been the manager, I would have apologized up and down plus given him his money back on the pop. Even just a sincere apology would have made my husband happier. 

Oh well, maybe we will win something with the game pieces they are sending! LOL

Poor service and bad handling of incidents are not relegated to fast food joints. I was served severely undercooked chicken at Wolfgang Puck&apos;s restaurant at the MGM in Las Vegas a few years ago. After alerting the manager and showing her the dish, she paid for our drinks and gave me her assurance that if there were any harmful bacteria in my chicken I would not feel the effects for 24 hours When I informed her that her timeline would have me projectile vommitting in a cramped jet somewhere over the Midwestern United States, she suggested changing flights just in case.

I still can&apos;t get over someone going to McDonald&apos;s just to play Monopoly. But, to each his or her own. Getting a new cup would have been enough for me to just let the issue rest.

It should not matter if you were served at McDonalds or any five star restaurant to expect an apology. You spoke to a manager as part of his/her job description they should be performing customer service. Changing your cup was a good start but most definitely you should of been offered an apology as well. It should not matter if the person serving you was sixteen or sixty. The person serving you was probably not the culprit for the missing piece so it would be understandable for the manager not to reprimand that employee. However had you been served a cup with a loose top and spilled the drink or something similar where the employee was at fault you might expect more. Kids work very hard at most fast food restaurants just to earn a little spending money and most can&apos;t expect much more. The lessons they learn from these mediocre jobs will be carried over to their future jobs. The manager is in a position to help them learn and the lesson learned that day was not complete. And some say you get what you pay for but you should always be treated with respect in a place of any business. People will always return to McDonalds or those like but that is no excuse for poor service or treatment.

It&apos;s Big Companies in general...thay have no idea how to create an atmosphere of customer service and respect from the top peeps to the bottom...so consequently with out effective leadership...the bottom&quot;front line&quot;staff fumble everytime. They are weak. In the past...your sales dropped with poor service...now...the helpless masses will just take all they dish out to us and pay for it...(and have you noticed: Not a one of them says&quot;Thank you&quot;anymore. Where I&apos;m from people try to be polite...I will naturally say&quot;Thank you&quot;...even if the cashier doesn&apos;t.)Shoot...maybe if the company screws up enough...they can get a bail-out...(Expletive entered here!)

I have started matching the personality of the counter person that waits on me...it&apos;s great fun! if they don&apos;t talk...I don&apos;t...If they are rude..I&apos;m rude...grumpy...I&apos;m grumpy and so on...However, I am very nice when prepared food is involved...don&apos;t want an extra&quot;loogie&quot;...being added on top of a hamburger! (Just havin&apos; fun writin&apos; on the topic )

I think you just shouldnt go to McDonalds anymore, nor should any children ever be fed that crap.

We get what we pay for, its not worth your time to pursue this any farther.

But as someone who did manage corporate restaurant chains, you can contact the franchise owner and regional office with your complaints and you will probably receive an entire book full of top-level coupons.

But thats not much of a prize in my eyes

Here in downtown chicago, theirs a mcdonalds less then a block away from my job. the girls there are always irritated, they role their eyes, have limited patience, and never apoligize when they make an error. I rarely ever see a customer be so difficult to enable this attitude. One time the girl behind the register actually laughed and i responded,&quot;wow you do smile&quot;she gave me a look and put on her serious face on. I dont understand if all mcdonalds are like this?
 reply more→ report permalink 94 Flightkeeper posted 2 years ago 
I think you should send McDonald&apos;s a follow up letter and let them know that the manager&apos;s behavior was the problem not the missing Monopoly piece. Just because they&apos;re a fast food joint doesn&apos;t mean they should have lower standards. They might be able to do something if they own the restaurant but if it&apos;s a franchise, they can&apos;t do much. In which case, you might want to find out who the owner of the franchise is and send them a letter. All this is if you really want to take the trouble.

By the way, if the manager treats her workers like that, I would not eat there.
