 Adipex Diet Pills Are a Disaster Waiting to Happen

 

Every dieter wishes for a magic wand to wave over top of a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, so that they can eat without consequences. Wouldn&apos;t it be nice? Well, wake up! You&apos;re dreaming! There&apos;s no such magic wand, no such magic pill. And if you do some research, you&apos;ll find that some of these &quot;magic pills&quot; are so dangerous that you&apos;re just asking for trouble if you take them.

 Adipex diet pills are addicting. You take them every day, and before you know it, you no longer even feel them working. Even if you take them only a few days at a time, you&apos;ll find that your original dosage will soon feel ineffective. While they work, you feel too full to eat - in fact, you may find yourself force-feeding yourself a meal because you know you&apos;re supposed to eat. Is this a good habit to impress upon yourself? What happens when you&apos;re no longer taking the diet pills ? You&apos;ve just taught yourself to eat even when your body says, &quot;No thanks.&quot;

So you want to lose weight? Who doesn&apos;t? And who hasn&apos;t wished for a magic diet pill to make them:

 less interested in food fully energized even without eating lose weight quickly and painlessly 

But the side effects of taking Adipex are enough to turn any mild-mannered person into a raving lunatic. They include:

 irritability vomiting diarrhea constipation (great combination, right?) nervousness (you&apos;re actually nervous for a good reason) headaches heart palpitations blurred vision 

Hey, but at least you&apos;ll be thin, right? Even if it worked, you&apos;ll be so unpleasant to be around that you won&apos;t even be able to stand your own company.

Instead of looking for the silver bullet for weight loss, try some common sense. Aim for healthier habits in the kitchen and outside where you can get some exercise. Put on a pair of sneakers and walk with your family after your healthy dinner. Run right past that fast-food restaurant, and drop the donut into the trash can.

Being fit is a fantastic goal, but not one you should place above your own health. Abusing your body by overfeeding it doesn&apos;t mean you should undo the damage by pumping it full of dangerous drugs.
