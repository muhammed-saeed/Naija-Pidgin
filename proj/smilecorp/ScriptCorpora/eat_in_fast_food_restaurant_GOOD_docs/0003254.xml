 Sipping the Heat Away 
 

 
During summers, there is nothing we’d like better than to sit somewhere cool with a cold glass of lemonade, iced tea or fresh fruit juice. Whether we go out to the beach, or to the swimming pool or even inside our homes, we want to be constantly drinking something. And since the heat has made us totally lethargic and lazy, we would rather be sipping the drink through a straw than making the effort of lifting the glass to our mouth!

This inherent laziness of ours has spawned a booming straw industry. What was earlier a utility item is now available in a range of designs and materials. Straws used to be a basic plastic tube to suck liquids with. They were usually clear or colorless.  As times passed, these started coming in various colors. Striped straws became common. Even the plastic used to make them was varied. There were straws made of thin plastic that would get blocked if you sucked too hard and there were better grade plastic straws that would hold their shape for as long as you used them.

Certain cocktails have to be served with straws, whether for functionality or for decoration. These triggered a demand for straws that had a bit of a design rather than a basic straight tube. That is when straws started twisting into strange and intriguing shapes. Even straight straws came with the option of being able to bend for easy accessibility with the help of a little ‘accordion’ pleating!

Now, the variety you get in straws is unbelievable! They are available in almost any colour you can imagine, in all sorts of designs. There are kiddy designs which are fun, with cute cartoon characters hanging from them. These straws help mothers get their children to drink that difficult glass of milk. There are straws in various shapes and sizes especially for cocktails. Straws are available in all sorts of materials, where plastic is just the beginning. You get plastic straws in various grades of plastic, where you can select one on the basis of your requirement and budget. You get metal straws that you can wash and reuse. For the environmentally friendly people, you get straws made of real straw or even bamboo! There are straws with in-built filters. The options are endless!

While you have a vast range of straws to pick from, you do have a little problem of storing them. Simple tube straws run the risk of rolling away everywhere, especially the light plastic ones. If you have guests over and want to keep straws for them in case they want any, a good presentation becomes important. An easy solution to this is a Drinking Straw Holder .

These containers are made to hold the straws and come in various shapes and sizes, from which you can pick the one you like, in the look you want. You get them in the open form, where it is easy for one to just pick out a straw, or the closed ones, which keep the straws covered from dust and dirt. As with the product they hold, the straw holders have a lot many material options to choose from. You can easily buy one at a store that sells household goods, or online where you can purchase one after comparing hundreds of designs and prices, from the comfort of your home!

 Hand Crafted Mardi Gras masks! 

Mardi Gras is usually celebrated by wearing a mardi gras mask. You don’t have to buy a new one for your children instead teach them how to make one themselves with just a few simple materials and a quick and easy procedure!
 
You can help your kids celebrate Mardi Gras by making up easy Mardi Gras Masks. For this you’ll need:

o Construction paper in several colors

o Scissors

o Glitter

o Glue sticks

o Markers or crayons

o Some loose craft feathers

o Straws

o Tape

These will be those half masks that you hold up to your face. First have the kids each pick out a piece of construction paper in the color that they like. Then, help them draw the outline of the half mask that they want and help them cut it out. Don’t forget to put eye holes in the right spots.

Once the kids have the construction paper masks cut out they can start decorating them. They can put drops of glue around the outside of their masks and line them with the fluffy colored feathers. The kids can also spread a thin layer of glue on their masks and sprinkle glitter on them. Let the glue dry and shake off the excess glitter for a sparkly feather mask.

You can create an eyeliner effect on the masks by carefully outlining the eyeholes with the marker. You can also draw in whiskers, freckles or any other design that you like on the masks.

To attach your half masks to their holders simply tape one end of a straw to one side of the half mask. If you want you can decorate the straw too by covering it in a thin layer of glue and rolling it in the glitter before you tape it to the mask.

You can also get more involved in the making of your Mardi Gras masks by getting some plastic beads and sewing them to the masks in elaborate designs. Try stringing up a row of beads and tacking them to the outside rims of the masks like a garland.

 Plastic cups: lifesavers! 

Are you a travel buff? Well one thing you should not forget to bring on your what to bring list are plastic cups you can use for drinking. Bring along a jug of water and viola! You’re all set for how long your road trip would take without even getting a bit thirsty!
 
My husband and I love road trips, short or long. We love exploring off the beaten track: gravel roads, dirt roads–any road that doesn’t suddenly creep toward extinction above the tree line, threatening to shove us over an unthinkable cliff, and let us plunge thousands of feet into the abyss. Yes, we traversed one of those in Montana, but that’s another story.

Road trips call for preparation, so our car trunk always holds an emergency kit with extra clothing, space blankets, and food snacks. The cup holders below the dashboard always hold water, even on half hour trips–and that’s where this story begins.

 Drinking Cups for Road Trips 

We used to carry bottled water in the car, refilling the bottles at home. Then we learned too much: about the rapid growth of bacteria in those bottles; about the leeching of plastic into the water; etc. We decided to replace the bottles with drinking cups.

The options were not good, however. Some drinking cups didn’t fit cup holders. Other drinking cups didn’t hold much water. Some didn’t allow for quick sips. Others didn’t close tightly. Some were much too heavy!

We needed light, plastic drinking cups with straws.

 The Discovery 

That’s when we found Tupperware drinking cups. More specifically, we found Tupperware plastic drinking cups with straws! The company makes a variety of drinking cups that work for car trips. Each one, of course, has a virtually liquid-tight seal on top–and each one is dishwasher safe, so no bacteria!

Some of their drinking cups are more for picnics or hiking, with seals (lids) that have no opening. Those are great in backpacks, even if they tip over. Other Tupperware drinking cups make provision for drinking without removing the lid, and were just what we needed for road trips.

1. The“Insulated Tumbler with Drip-Less Straw Seal”was our choice. This 24-oz. drinking cup has double-wall construction to keep beverages cold or hot for hours. It fits the console cup-holder, and doesn’t tip over. The great“Drip-Less”straw lid minimizes leaks, even on sharp curves. We loved the fact that you use disposable straws in it, so no worry about hygiene there! You don’t have to hand-wash a special straw, or risk putting it in the dishwasher. Any standard straw fits, so you can always stop in a convenience store for more. Of course, the drinking cup itself is dishwasher safe.

2. The“On-the-Go Tumbler”would be great for children on long car trips. This even larger, 32-oz. drinking cup has a tapered base that fits most vehicle cup holders, and the seal eliminates spills. The“On-the-Go Tumbler”has two designs, each with a different picture on the side. One design features a hinged pop-open drinking top. Children don’t have to remove the lid to drink. They simply flip the top open or shut. The other design features a seal with“drip-less”straw opening like the one in the insulated drinking cups with straws that we chose. The liquid-tight lid has a hole for a disposable straw. It would be worth taking these into a fast-food restaurant, and pouring the children’s beverages into them.

3. If you take babies or toddlers on your road trip (those days are gone for us), Tupperware’s“Sipper Seal Set”would be a good choice. For that matter, these drinking cups would be great at home, too. On a trip, you could pack all four, filled and sealed, in a cooler. When your baby (over 6 months) or toddler wants a drink, you simply change out the storage lid for a sipper seal that lets children drink without spills.

 The Guarantee 

Although I cannot guarantee you will like Tupperware’s plastic drinking cups with straws as much as we do, I can assure you that Tupperware guarantees the products. If you get one of their drinking cups and it gets damaged in normal use, they promise to replace it free of charge for the lifetime of the product. I’m not sure if the drinking cup’s lifetime will be as long as yours, but the guarantee sounds good to me.

If you love road trips as we do, or if you just like to be on-the-go around town, you may want to look into Tupperware’s plastic drinking cups with straws. If I weren’t so busy, I might consider becoming a Tupperware consultant so I could sell them.

 Have you ever lived in a haunted house? 

skrzych asked:


What kind of experiences did you have? I rented a place that was haunted. I think you have to experience it to really believe, but I do now! I had the sound of doors opening and closing, I had dishes rattling. I had the sound of breaking glass on my kitchen floor. I had a picture fall off the wall and land face up 10 feet away from the wall. (about 3 inches from where I was sitting on the floor) I had a mans voice saying my name. I had the sound of someone walking through my living room which my dogs also heard AND created a shadow, but couldn’t see anything there. I had MAJOR power issues. I had a glass candle holder fly off a shelf hard enough to put a hole in the wall across from it. My doorbell rang all the time. (and I live in the U.P. (upper michigan) so I didn’t have any neighbors within about a mile) Everyone I knew told me to move out. These things would happen even if I had company. The last straw my 3 yr old daughter said she didn’t like‘the people who live in the basement’
I will award best answer to whoever has the freakest story that they actually experienced themself.
I ALMOST FORGOT!!!

My niece and her boyfriend stayed there one time when I was gone, and they were sleeping in my daughters bed and heard a little kids voice whisper“your not supposed to be here.”and then giggled…. I hadn’t told them about the other stuff. (cuz’then my niece wouldn’t have stayed there) They both heard it, and left immediately.

 Sippy cuppy dilemna and using straw sippy cups for 11 mo old? 

lysistrata411 asked:


So, my son will not use a regular sippy cup at all, only a bottle or a drink from my own cup. Today my mom gave him water through a straw and he sucked it! He knows how to use a straw so, we tried a juice cooler and, again, he did it! So, I bought straw sippy cups and noticed they say 2+ yrs. Is it ok to use them with him? Or is there some reason I shouldn’t let him use it if he takes it?

 Creative Ideas For Halloween Decorations 

Phil Sikes asked:




With 36.1 million trick-or-treaters visiting homes in 2006, it comes as no surprise that we all want our homes to look as“Halloweenish”as possible for the big night.

Here are some simple Halloween decorating ideas that will make your home look festive but won’t break the bank.

Orange Lights

Change the light bulbs in your outdoor lanterns or house lights to orange lights. If you can’t find orange light bulbs, you can purchase inexpensive Halloween themed string lights (like Christmas lights) and hang them around your front door.

Make Your Own Luminaries

Place homemade Halloween luminaries alongside the sidewalk or walkway up to your front door. You can make easy and inexpensive luminaries with paper lunch sacks. You can either leave them the original brown or spray paint them orange.

On each bag, lightly draw in pencil a rough outline of a pumpkin, ghost or spider. With a sharpened pencil or nail, poke holes about every inch along the outline of the design.

Fill each bag with approximately 1

 Teaching Your Toddler To Feed Himself 

Cecilia Koh asked:




In the article on weaning your baby I suggested that from 10 months onwards, you could start offering other types of food to your baby but they must be cut up finely so that baby will not choke. By the time your baby is 1 year old he should be taking a variety of food so it would be easy to progress to eating adult food. By now he should have enough teeth to chew his food and if you have been sitting him at the dinner table during meal times he should have learnt from watching you, how to chew his food.

A few pointers to remember when feeding your toddler

o Never leave your toddler alone to feed himself. This is because most children will put all the food they see into their mouth which could cause choking or vomiting.

o Always check that your child has swallowed the food before offering the next mouthful. You can do this by asking your child to open his mouth. This applies even when he is able to feed himself.

o Finger food should be soft and easy to chew or dissolve in the mouth. Do not give big chunks or sticks of food for them to bite off until they are 2 years old. If they accidentally bite off a biggish piece it could cause choking or the food could slip into the airways and get lodged in the lungs which may require surgery to remove it. Believe me; I have seen many cases where children lose a bit of their lungs because of care takers’negligence.

o Never give infants or young children iced or refrigerated foods or liquids, because the coldness can damage the stomach and intestines, inhibiting the capacity to digest, assimilate, and eliminate. Liquids and soft cooked foods served warm or at room temperature are the most desirable and beneficial, especially when children are sick.

o Never give children cold drinks with their meals because the stomach should be warm to best digest the food and cold drinks will dampen the‘fire’needed to break down food.

o Do not give them fizzy drinks as this causes too much gas in the stomach. Did you know that you can use coke to remove stubborn stains in your toilet bowl? Imagine what it will do to your baby’s stomach if you let them drink coke!

o Never feed your child in front of the television. Children eat better when they have company so let your child eat with you.

o Never make horrible faces if you do not like the food that you see. Everything should be yummy.

All children go through phases of different eating styles.

The ferocious eating phase

This is the best phase when the child just loves eating everything that he sees. He would practically wolf everything down quick as a flash.

The keep the food in the mouth phase

This is when the child takes food into his mouth and just leaves it there without chewing or swallowing it. When he is satisfied that it has been there long enough, he will then chew and swallow it. It can take up to 1 hour to finish the meal which can be taxing if you are the impatient type of person. The possible reasons could be the child is not hungry enough or he is bored with the food, had too many snacks in between meals or he is testing your ingenuity on how to get him to eat.

The choosy phase

This is when the child decides he does not want to eat certain food. It is quite normal if your child suddenly refuses to eat a certain food that he used to enjoy, so just give him alternatives. Once the child is old enough I always ask them what they want to eat especially for breakfast. The other thing that I do is play on their vanity if I think that they should eat the food offered. I always tell them what food group the food is; for example vegetables contain Vitamin C and eating this will make their skin beautiful, eating proteins will give them strong muscles (show your strong biceps), eating vitamin A will make their eyesight strong etc. If they question me on why my skin is not smooth and beautiful, I always tell them it is because I was naughty and did not eat vegetables when I was young. They always believe me and finish everything on the plate.

The‘I don’t want to eat’phase

This is very common if they have just recovered from an illness and do not have any appetite. Let your child choose what he likes but make sure that the food is nutritious and not junk food. Make sure you do not have lots of junk food in the house and they will be able to make do with what you have. It could be a piece of cheese or a couple of biscuits instead of rice.

Now let us look at how to start teaching your child to feed himself.

It is best to first teach your toddler to eat using his fingers because he has been practicing putting things into his mouth since he was 2–3 months old. Use foods that are dry and easy to pick up, like bread and biscuits. Show your child how to pick up food using his thumb and first finger and let him practice as often as possible.

The next stage is to teach him how to use a fork. I like to start with a plastic fork as it is lighter and easier to handle. Now you can use cut up fruits and vegetables as these are easier to prod with the fork.

Once he has mastered using the fork it is time to learn how to use a spoon. It is better to start with a teaspoon which is lighter. Initially, he will not be able to balance the food on the spoon and will tip the food off the spoon but be patient. Once he has mastered the skill of feeding himself he will not want you to feed him anymore so let him be independent.

Cooking tips

o Remove your child’s portion before you add salt or reduce the amount of salt for the whole family

o Do not use monosodium glutamate in the food

o Add a little extra water when cooking rice so that it is slightly softer

o Use smaller fish because it has less methyl-mercury

From bottle to cup

Regardless of what other people say, I strongly believe that children should drink water starting from infancy. In our country, children tend to lose fluids through invisible loss and the drying effects of air-conditioners. If they have a fever or they are‘heaty’they will need slightly more to keep the internal system cool. If the children start drinking water early, once they grow older, they will not have problems drinking water. In fact you cannot find sweet fizzy drinks in my house. If the weather is very hot everybody has to drink extra water. The other drink which I encourage is barley with winter melon strips instead of sugar.

All the babies below 6 months must drink at least 60 mls of water per day. Normally I give a little after their milk feed to keep the mouth clean and the balance when they wake up from their sleep when the mouth may be a bit dry.

After 6 months they need to drink about 150–200 mls per day. If they refuse to drink from the bottle, I will spoon feed them

From 12 months onwards I like to give them water from a straw cup as there is no spillage.

From 18 months they learn to drink directly from the cup. I start by giving them an empty cup to practice putting to the mouth and once they have mastered the technique, I put a little water into the cup and slowly increase the amount.

I like the western concept of allowing children to feed themselves from an early age. Most Chinese families do not allow the children to feed themselves until they are 4–5 years old because it is messy. What is a little mess to clean up compared to the joy of achievement on your child’s face when he actually manages to eat by himself. When Marie started primary school I happened to pop into the school canteen during recess to pay the canteen fees and I was absolutely horrified to see several grandmas and maids sitting there feeding the 7 year old children because they did not know how to feed themselves.

I hope that you are like me in wanting your child to learn how to be self reliant from an early age.

o Personalized bottles of water are great for the summer heat. Put a beach saying, and shower information on the label.
o Serve your guests a tropical drink in a fancy glass. Let them take the glass home as their favor.
o Choose mini pails in your party colors. Fill with candy, and add a hang tag.
o Shell and starfish shaped chocolate candies. Candy is always well received.

 Do you just drink out of those cups or put a straw in it? 

don’t know asked:


Okay, so I went to this knda seven eleven-ish store and they had those little plastic cups with the little hole (not oval shaped but not round shaped; don’t know what shape it is ) and then i saw one those little straws. I know this may sound stupid but do you actually put straws in those? I usually only have cold cuppacinos or go to coffee stores and just started like drinking cuppacino and coffee…out of those stores.

 Science Fair Project Ideas That Win Awards Project #14–Static Electricity 

Aurora L. asked:




 Objective 

You will be making your own electroscope and testing the ability of various materials to conduct static electricity. You will also be making a list or triboelectric series which arranges materials according to their ability to conduct electrons.

 Introduction 

When and electric charge is built up in an object, it is called static electricity. Sometimes, this static electricity can be discharged suddenly, as seen in a lightning bolt across the sky. At other times, this static electricity causes a static cling that is seen on socks just removed from the dryer. Static cling occurs when two objects having different charges such as positive (+) and negative (-) come together. Static electricity can be produced as well as tested using various science fair experiments.

During science fair experiments, static electricity can be measured using an electroscope. You will build your own electroscope to test various materials and find out which ones conduct more static electricity.

 Materials 

foam plate, Balloon, foam cup, clay, drinking straw, aluminum pie pan, aluminum foil, thread, wooden ruler, masking tape, different materials for testing such as nylon, polyester, cotton, aluminum, plastic, copper, wool, tissue paper, saran wrap, and so on.

 Preparation 

 Making your electroscope 

Pierce a Styrofoam cup by pushing a skewer near the base and make holes for a straw to pass through. Put a drinking straw through the cup by putting it in these holes and push it till it sticks out on one side. Now invert the cup and stick it strongly with clay on an upright pie pan.

Make a few knots at one end a thread and make a marble-sized ball with a piece of aluminum foil at the knotted end. Now tape the free end of the string to the straw that is sticking out of the cup in such a way that the ball hangs from the straw and touches the rim of the pie pan. Secure the straw with a tape so that it does not move.

 Testing your electroscope 

One of the methods used in science fair experiments to create a static electric charge is to rub a Styrofoam plate with some wool. This produces a negative charge on the Styrofoam plate surface. Now lift your electroscope by holding the Styrofoam cup and place it over the charged Styrofoam plate. What happens? The aluminum foil ball moves away from the rim of the pie pan.

Why did this happen? When you placed the electroscope on the Styrofoam plate, the negatively charged electrons travelled to the pie pan and then to the foil ball. Since same charges repel, the ball moved away from the rim of the pan.

Now touch the pan and the foil ball with the tip of your finger and see what happens. The ball will return to normal as it was before, because the electrons were transferred to your finger and the pan and the ball were discharged.

 Procedure 

Now it’s time to test different materials.

Charge different materials with static electricity. You may use materials such as a plastic wrap, a woolen scarf, a fleece sweater, an aluminum sheet, a balloon, and so on. Now test each charged material with your electroscope. Measure how far the ball is from the pan with a ruler. Write down the distance in a table. Make a note of which materials can carry an electric charge and which ones do not. Since recording data is an important step in science fair experiments, you must arrange your data in order with the most charged ones followed by the least charged ones. This is called a Triboelectric Series.

Now that you are equipped with some great ideas, I’d like to give you something more in order to ensure your success. Here’s your free copy of“Easy Steps to Award-Winning Science Fair Projects”which you can immediately download from the link below.

 Transition Your Baby to Using a Sippy Cup 

Margaret Meade asked:




You think it’s time to transition your baby to a sippy cup but you are not sure how to go about it. Relax, transitioning to a sippy cup is relatively easy and all about physical maturity, fun and a bit of folly too! The key issue in transitioning your baby to a sippy cup and learning how to use a sippy cup, is the development of a good strong fist grasp and the ability to easily move things from the hand to the mouth. Ahh, your baby has been moving items from the hand to the mouth for ages now right? Using a sippy cup requires much more than simply picking an object up and putting it into ones mouth!

 How old should your baby be for introducing and/or transitioning to a sippy cup? The question of when it is a good age to transition baby to a sippy cup and to have baby begin to use a sippy cup has many different answers. We gave our babies sippy cups from the time they started solids and had a pretty good grasp–around 6 months old. The sippy cup at that age was just to allow the babies to practice holding and moving the cup around. Getting your baby acquainted with a sippy cup is a good idea prior to transitioning your baby to using a sippy cup! Ensure that baby plays with the cup and does not attempt to whole-heartedly“drink”from it as gas from sucking in air may occur! Our babies began to actually drink liquids from a sippy cup around 9 months of age.

 What do the“experts”say about introducing and/or transitioning to a sippy cup? The American Academy of Family hysicians notes“The sippy cup should be introduced at six months of age in preparation for weaning from the bottle or breast at 12 months”and further states that“common contributing practices that contribute to infant and toddler tooth decay include the following: propped bottles containing sweetened liquids, frequent consumption of sweetened liquids from infant and toddler-size“sippy”cups, and frequent snacking. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that you should“Teach your child to drink from a cup as soon as possible, usually by 1 year of age. Drinking from a cup does not cause the liquid to collect around the teeth, and a cup cannot be taken to bed. If you are concerned that a cup may be messier than a bottle, especially when you are away from home, use one that has a snap-on lid with a straw or a special valve to prevent spilling.

 Tips and Tricks for Introducing or transitioning your baby to a sippy cup 

Offer your baby the sippy cup as soon as baby is able to maintain a good tight grasp. Choose a sippy cup that is light weight and easy for tiny hands to handle. The Avent Naturally Magic cup is one that is highly recommended by parents! Allow your baby to play with and explore the sippy cup–yes, even if it means baby bangs and tosses the sippy cup around! Encourage your baby to hold the cup with 2 hands–a sippy cup with liquid in it may be too heavy for baby to hold&amp;maneuver with one hand. Show your baby how to use the sippy cup by example and help guide the sippy cup up to baby’s mouth. Water in the sippy cup is a great first liquid to add to the sippy cup. You may also add formula and/or breast milk. Formula and/or breastmilk in a sippy cup however, may not entice your baby with the wonder and excitement of a totally new experience. Many parents take introducing the sippy cup as an opportunity to introduce water and juice to their infants (see an article Juice for Your Baby to learn more about Juice and ALWAYS dilute juice!) Offer the sippy cup during Snack time and/or between feedings. Do NOT allow your infant or toddler to walk around the house all day with a sippy cup full of water, juice or formula! Do not allow your infant or toddler to“fill up”with liquid from the sippy cup. Your baby still needs the nutrients from breast milk and/or formula and sippy time should not interfere! We hope that these tried and true tips and tricks will help you with transitioning your baby to a sippy cup!

 Plastic Drinking Cups With Straws 

Anna Hart asked:




My husband and I love road trips, short or long. We love exploring off the beaten track: gravel roads, dirt roads–any road that doesn’t suddenly creep toward extinction above the tree line, threatening to shove us over an unthinkable cliff, and let us plunge thousands of feet into the abyss. Yes, we traversed one of those in Montana, but that’s another story.

Road trips call for preparation, so our car trunk always holds an emergency kit with extra clothing, space blankets, and food snacks. The cup holders below the dashboard always hold water, even on half hour trips–and that’s where this story begins.

Drinking Cups for Road Trips

We used to carry bottled water in the car, refilling the bottles at home. Then we learned too much: about the rapid growth of bacteria in those bottles; about the leeching of plastic into the water; etc. We decided to replace the bottles with drinking cups.

The options were not good, however. Some drinking cups didn’t fit cup holders. Other drinking cups didn’t hold much water. Some didn’t allow for quick sips. Others didn’t close tightly. Some were much too heavy!

We needed light, plastic drinking cups with straws.

The Discovery

That’s when we found Tupperware drinking cups. More specifically, we found Tupperware plastic drinking cups with straws! The company makes a variety of drinking cups that work for car trips. Each one, of course, has a virtually liquid-tight seal on top–and each one is dishwasher safe, so no bacteria!

Some of their drinking cups are more for picnics or hiking, with seals (lids) that have no opening. Those are great in backpacks, even if they tip over. Other Tupperware drinking cups make provision for drinking without removing the lid, and were just what we needed for road trips.

1. The“Insulated Tumbler with Drip-Less Straw Seal”was our choice. This 24-oz. drinking cup has double-wall construction to keep beverages cold or hot for hours. It fits the console cup-holder, and doesn’t tip over. The great“Drip-Less”straw lid minimizes leaks, even on sharp curves. We loved the fact that you use disposable straws in it, so no worry about hygiene there! You don’t have to hand-wash a special straw, or risk putting it in the dishwasher. Any standard straw fits, so you can always stop in a convenience store for more. Of course, the drinking cup itself is dishwasher safe.

2. The“On-the-Go Tumbler”would be great for children on long car trips. This even larger, 32-oz. drinking cup has a tapered base that fits most vehicle cup holders, and the seal eliminates spills. The“On-the-Go Tumbler”has two designs, each with a different picture on the side. One design features a hinged pop-open drinking top. Children don’t have to remove the lid to drink. They simply flip the top open or shut. The other design features a seal with“drip-less”straw opening like the one in the insulated drinking cups with straws that we chose. The liquid-tight lid has a hole for a disposable straw. It would be worth taking these into a fast-food restaurant, and pouring the children’s beverages into them.

3. If you take babies or toddlers on your road trip (those days are gone for us), Tupperware’s“Sipper Seal Set”would be a good choice. For that matter, these drinking cups would be great at home, too. On a trip, you could pack all four, filled and sealed, in a cooler. When your baby (over 6 months) or toddler wants a drink, you simply change out the storage lid for a sipper seal that lets children drink without spills.

The Guarantee

Although I cannot guarantee you will like Tupperware’s plastic drinking cups with straws as much as we do, I can assure you that Tupperware guarantees the products. If you get one of their drinking cups and it gets damaged in normal use, they promise to replace it free of charge for the lifetime of the product. I’m not sure if the drinking cup’s lifetime will be as long as yours, but the guarantee sounds good to me.

If you love road trips as we do, or if you just like to be on-the-go around town, you may want to look into Tupperware’s plastic drinking cups with straws. If I weren’t so busy, I might consider becoming a Tupperware consultant so I could sell them.
