I&apos;ve been coming to this in-n-out for almost a year. They hardly ever fail to get my order correct and the times they do mess up, the mistakes are so miniscule that I can easily forgive and forget.

My new favorite:
Cheese Burger w/
grilled onions
no lettuce, add pickles
chopped chilies
well done fries.

It doesn&apos;t get any better than this.
Maybe I will have a new favorite in a few months.

Yes, this is the In-n-Out that gets a shout-out in the Big Lebowski.  It&apos;s one of the old ones, with no indoor seating, so watch out in the summertime.  The line is often backed up into the street, but they&apos;re pretty good about sending someone out with a computer to take orders ASAP.   Or do it my way and park outside, order, then kill some time at the Goodwill across the street.

Not gonna lie though, this In-Out is slower than most.  Staff seems to spend a lot of time taking inventory instead of orders, but hey, lack of AC in that little booth would probably make me less efficient too.

I almost want to give less stars since In-N-Out is betraying us So Cal natives and branching out into the rest of the country. Stop. The east coast doesn&apos;t need this goodness.

If you want a mouth orgasm, try this on for size:

Double Double
w/Grilled Onions
Add Pickle

French Fries Well Done

Chocolate Shake

Spread
Ketchup
Sweet Peppers

Break those sweet peppers open, drizzle the juices into the meat and stuff whats left of that pepper into the burger itself. Grab some fries, slam that into the burger aswell.

Make 2 dipping areas. One is for spread. One is for ketchup. Take turns dipping your meat empire into one and your extra crispy potato snaps in the other.

You&apos;re welcome, world.

Definitely the shit. The line for the drive-thru is always ridiculously long, blocking traffic on the street at any given time, so I park my car on the side street and avoid the mayhem. For being cheaper than all the shitty fast food everywhere, it&apos;s worth standing in line for 10 minutes.

One of my favor places to go when I am out and about to get a burger real quick. The food is fresh and made to order. If you are CA person a must go to.

Then only thing the staff at this location needs to work on is the drive threw line and keep it moving.

I was away from In-N-Out for a long time so when I finally was able to go I was beyond excited. #2 animal style with animal style fries...! Great meal, there is some out door seating in the parking lot area with lots of birds awaiting your unprotected fries. Don&apos;t forget to check under your cup for your John 3:16 bible verse reminder.

Garbage. If this is what California thinks is a good burger, stick to tacos. Stale bun, bland fries, dry meat, shit service. I heard it was better than 5 Guys. It&apos;s not even better than McDonalds.
The only good thing was the sauce on the burger, but a 99 cent Big Mac will do the same. No thanks.

I can never talk ill about In-N-Out!

Their double double animal style is to die for (literally, enough of those and you will die!)

The one bad thing, and I&apos;m going to whisper this part, I dont want In-N-Out to hear me talking bad about them, however they need to figure out a way to speed up the take out line. There are two lines and still it takes 15-20 minutes to get your food (not really &quot;fast&quot; food) But that makes no difference, I will always return to In-N-Out!!

Its pretty ironic that thanks to the internet and loud fat guys, In n Out Burger&apos;s &quot;Secret Menu&quot; is hardly a secret to the average, SoCal resident. Still, I occasionally run into people who look really confused when i tell them about my Animal Style 3x3 with Animal Style Fries.

If that last line didn&apos;t make sense to you, let me explain to all the uninitiated folks out there about In n Out&apos;s off menu specialties

For one, a double double is not the biggest sandwich you can order at In n Out. You can order a 3x3 or even a 4x4! - 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese! Some places will even let you go higher, but be prepared to get the meat sweats!

If you&apos;re not a meat eater, you can order a &quot;Grilled Cheese&quot; for a burgerless burger. For all you carb nuts out there, you can order a burger &quot;protien style&quot; in which they swap out the bun and wrap your burger in lettuce. OR try &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; - 2 patties with cheese in the middle, and NO bun!

Then there&apos;s the heart and soul of the Secret Menu - &quot;Animal Style!&quot; Order your burger &quot;Animal Style&quot; and they completely change up the way you get your burger made! They cook the burgers with mustard for added flavor, they add grilled onions, as well as extra spread sauce for an awesome explosion of tastiness!

But you don&apos;t just &quot;Animal Style&quot; your double double - ask for &quot;Animal Style Fries&quot; too - and experience a mound of grilled onions, spread sauce and cheese on top of In n Out&apos;s already specacular fries!

Thats the majority of In n Out&apos;s &quot;Secret Menu&quot; in case you weren&apos;t aware before. Go Animal Style Today!!!

When I transferred campuses from Santa Monica to North Hollywood, I was the happiest girl in the world when I realized there was an In-N-Out right down the street from my school.

#2 Animal style burger with a pink lemonade.

I have no idea why, but for some reason this was the best In-N-Out I&apos;ve ever had in my life.  No Joke.  The fries were perfectly crispy and the burger looked just like the one in the picture.

In-N-Out will always be that go to spot when nothing else comes to mind when choosing where to eat.

In N Out, home of the BEST freshest fast food burgers around. Their simple menu (with the secret menu ;)) beats out most burger places that have large varieties (this includes fancier restaurants too). $2 for a fresh burger with all the fillings. TERRIFIC! The fries leave much to be desired, but are unique and addictive in a strange way.

This location is ALWAYS busy, so prepare to wait 10-15 minutes for your order. That said, In N Out simply rocks!

If i&apos;m going to eat bad, I tend to make sure that I eat good.  It&apos;s In-N-Out and as far as i&apos;m concerned, any fast food restuarant that is family owned is already amazing, but what really gives it a 5 star is the fact that this place is so pretentious that there is a hidden menu for us locals &quot;Los Angelinos&quot;...in fact, when friends visit from out of town I always warn them of 3 things:

1.  The line is going to bleed out into the main street no matter which location you go to, and no matter what time of day &quot;or night for that matter&quot; it is.

2.  Said line is completely worth it.

and

3.  When you order your food, tell them to give it to you &quot;------ style&quot;

and when I tell them the hidden menu code they are like &quot;are you serious, you are just trying to make me look stupid&quot; but then when they eat it then they usually text or call immediately to tell me how right I was lol.

I give In-N-Out noho 5 out of 5 stars

Its more like a 3.5 or low 4!!! Im a big big fan of milkshakes and how come every other fast food place puts whip cream and a cherry on top but In N out does not! At least they shakes have gotten thicker!

The food is okay...its always fresh  and made to order but Ive had better food at other places. It still satisfies that every once in a while need for In n Out though i guess...its not bad...just not something i need everyday!!! Like my MILKSHAKES! LOL

This place gets a 4 because if you ever go up to the walk up window and look at how hard they work! i mean they are moving extra fast and extra hard with those orders! i was suprised!!!!! that crew is a well oiled machine!!!!!!!

In N Out, an all time classic. Being someone who relies on establishments to provide gluten free options, I love that I can still eat at In N Out. They have a button on their register that notifies the cooks of allergies, and so they cook and prepare it away from the other burgers and buns. I recently discovered the yellow chilies which are a tasty addition to an already great burger. Double-Double protein style with onions and crushed yellow chilies, fries with spread and an Arnold Palmer. It&apos;s only 9am and I know where I&apos;m headed for lunch today.

In N Out is always busy, but the wait is never long cause they&apos;re on top of it. I frequently go to the Universal City location and sometimes the North Hollywood location on Lankershim.

If I could combine the flavor of my first kiss and my first taste of victory it would be great but still wouldn&apos;t taste nearly as good as this double double I just ate. Their burgers are prefect.

Pure ground beef
Hand leaf lettuce
Ripe red tomatoes
Crisp onions
Sweet pickles
And REAL cheese

These simple ingredients speak for themselves. Its basically perfection in a bun. No other fast food can compare. I don&apos;t know what else to say.

God Bless In-N-Out.

This is the location nearest my apartment, so my boyfriend manages to find an excuse to go here more times than I want to admit -- but I always end up glad we did. This one seems especially friendly and has especially patient staff.

Patient, you say? I should mention that the last time we were here, on a weekend afternoon, a woman (?) who looked like Nick Nolte&apos;s mug shot was behind the wheel of a huge hoopty that pulled in right beside of us (the space for the lines is a little short -- my one complaint), and she proceeded to start waving at us hysterically to let her cut in front of us. She was honking her horn and everything. Was surreal. This was all happening while In-N-Out dude was taking our order, and he acted like nothing phased him. Maybe he sees her here every day. She started revving her engine and coming closer until she actually bumped us on the back. She was waving her hands over her head like Animal the entire time.

I think it was only the sweet smell of In-N-Out, fresh in our hands, that kept us from pulling the heroin lady out of her Oldsmobile and beating the crap out of her. We decided to follow follow In-N-Out dude&apos;s example -- and be patient.

so this is an abridged version of In-N-Out---they&apos;ve cut out the indoor seating all-together. You can still park your pinto in a little old-school park-n-eat area behind the place (&amp;there&apos;s a few outdoor tables) but mostly this location is designed for drive-thru only.  It&apos;s got two drive thru lanes and when it gets crowded, both lines can stream out onto Lankershim--and then, like most In-N-Out&apos;s, a friendly-worker-peep will often come out and start taking orders if it gets that busy.

My only star knockoff for this location is the shake machines. on one occasion, say around 8:30pm, I ordered a strawberry shake with my goods, they had to wait for a bit while the machine froze up the stuff---which means, I guess that they had turned it off or refilled it or something. When I finally got it, it was a passable strawberry shake, but not up to In-N-Out standards, that&apos;s for sure. And then a couple days ago, upon ordering a chocolate shake, we got something that seemed more like a cross between a chocolate/vanilla shake (little melting pot action?) so I dunno what&apos;s up with the shake machine at this location but everything else has been standard In-N-Out good.

[update: this location definitely has some bad karma with their shake gods, cause their shake machine has been dead on two separate visits now. beware people. there is nothing worse than placing your hopes, dreams, aspirations on a strawberry shake, only to be slapped with soda instead.]

This place is perpetually packed, and for good reason. It&apos;s fast food, and I normally don&apos;t eat fast food, but it&apos;s just ridiculously good. Even Fast Food Nation gives In-N-Out the thumbs up.

Minus one star because I&apos;ve occasionally gotten a burger that was still rare inside (!) but I didn&apos;t get food poisoning so it&apos;s OK.

Fun fact: I&apos;m pretty sure this is the In-N-Out they&apos;re talking about in The Big Lebowski.

In-N-Out Burger, how do I love thee, let me count the ways. One, your delicious double-double, the best fast food hamburger that I&apos;ve ever had. Two, your scrumdiddlyumptious milkshakes that are always just large enough, so smooth and so sweet. Three, your perfectly carbonated sodas that, maybe it&apos;s the magic cups, taste better than other fountain drinks. Four, the hand cut french fries, that while I like very much, are my least favorite item on the menu. Five, the helpful bible verses on the bottom of your cups. Six, taking me in a time machine to the 1950s. Seven, being affordable. Eight, for your secret menu items that make me feel special for knowing about them.

And although I have wished for you to visit me in New York, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re not outside of California or Arizona, so I can want you that much more. In-N-Out Burger, I love you.

Excellent In-N-Out Burger.  Honestly, this is the best one I&apos;ve been to in LA.  The two drive thru lanes are nice, and the outdoor seating always can come in handy.  The staff at this restaurant is always friendly, and inside the store is usually very clean.  Oh yea, its always busy!

For some reason, I felt like writing after my visit there tonight... I went a little crazy tonight by ordering a :

3x3 Animal Style with a toasted bun and extra tomatoes.
Fries, well done.  Animal style.

Everything was cooked to perfection; well done burger, and crispy fries.

I love In-N-Out

I don&apos;t think they know how to cook the burgers at this branch. I&apos;ve noticed that the meat was still raw. Ew. And my boyfriend noticed the same thing about this place when he was there on a separate occassion. So I knew it wasn&apos;t my imagination.

So we just go to the Burbank in n out instead.

Avoid this place, but if you must eat at this branch, just order the fries!!

So we all know that In-N-Out the restaurant chain gets 5 stars.  Fine.

But my review is about the location.

It is a tiny hut with no indoor seating.  There are two drivethrough lanes, and an employee with a wireless handheld device taking your order.  If you are on foot or have the time to eat it there, they have a walk-up window you can order from, and some outdoor seating.  There&apos;s a good amount of seats, but if it is lunch time they can fill up quick.

I&apos;d recommend grabbing the food on foot and sitting down.  The car lines are always insanely long, sometimes pouring out into the street!

Despite that, the staff is always very friendly, and their tables and parking lot are always clean.

Even though sometimes you have to wait awhile in the car line, your food always comes out hot.

This is really, actually sort of gross.  I started using a vaguely similar review of mine for other in-n-outs, and I realized that I have eaten at almost every single in-n-out in the southland.  So... that is... making me go on a diet now.

Anyhoo...  I ended up here a couple times while lost and getting to know the city. I will tell you what... I love it.  I think it is one of the original looks for the biz, too.

Do you need my review of a burger joint after this many reviews?

WELL... frankly.. you got it.

Simple.

Single best hamburger in the world.  Not the best I have ever had, buy any means.  Hamburger stands, home barbecues, beach grills... all beat it out.  But it is the most consistent, exciting, delicious, and wonderful culture and history for (gulp) fast food ever.  Great shakes, I love watching the guys chop potatoes.  I love the huge safety pins.  AND ... I love ordering my #1 LMKO.  Always have.  And the joy I get from sharing it with midwesterner&apos;s, east coasters, and intrepid foreign interlopers?

Pure and total Joy.

I love me some In-N-Out for the obvious reasons...no need to say again what a ton of other people have already said.

I prefer the NoHo location for a couple different reasons:

- It&apos;s pretty much around the corner from my apartment which has led to a few too many late night meals...
- I know that not everyone likes to sit outside, but I love the retro style of this location.  It&apos;s not like all of the other locations and it has it&apos;s own cute little feel.
- Pretty much every time I go to the Burbank location, I see someone I know.  It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t want to see the parents of my best friend from elementary school who I haven&apos;t really spoken to for oh, I don&apos;t know...6  years? but I would rather enjoy my meal in peace, thank you.

August 24th, 2007. My second day in the city of Los Angeles. My new home.

I&apos;m surprised it took me almost 48 hours to go to In-n-Out. Kids from California talked endlessly about In-n-Out when I lived in Utah. Some even embarked on an eight hour round trip from Provo to southern Utah when the burger joint opened its doors in St. George.

My In-n-Out cherry was finally popped at this small stand.  I was told it would be in my best interest to order a double double, animal style fries and a milkshake. There&apos;s a reason why everyone makes a big freakin deal about their burgers-they are damn good for a fast food burger. Their beef burger tastes like MEAT. Prett-ay, prett-ay rare for fast food. The lettuce is crisp, the tomato is fresh and the onion has a bite. Plus, you can theoretically order as many patties and slices of cheese as you want! I maxed out at a 4X4, but I really like the idea of infinite burger.

But someone has to say it: the fries are damn near awful. The fry job leaves the real potatoes limp and rather tasteless (getting the fries animal style exacerbates an already soggy situation). Make sure you order your fries well done if you want some potatoes with a crisp.

Overall, the burger was good but did not live up to the hype. I still visited dozens of times during my time in LA. As I said a year ago ( http://www.yelp.com/user… ) and I&apos;ll say it again now: if Five Guys fully expanded to SoCal, it would surely wipe the smug smile off In-n-Out&apos;s face.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE In-N-Out.

They are as a whole, 5, 5, 5 stars!!  But this location stinks.  The lines are long and the food is not up to In-N-Out Quality.  Some people think I am crazy, but havin eaten at In-N-Out over 1000 in my life time in many location, I know which are good and which are not.  Go to the Studio City, Westwood, Sherman Oaks, or Hollywood location.  All better than this one...

Wow, a very old school In and Out. It&apos;s everything you have come to expect from the best damn burger place ever but I am going with one star off since walk up service takes for ever here (think 20 mins+) and it&apos;s just kind of small. Short of that it&apos;s still my go to for burgers. Silly overpriced Umami burger can suck it!

In-N-Out Burgers...no big deal! I guess the food is OK, but there is certainly nothing &apos;fast&apos; about this chain of burger joints.

I hate to not agree with most on this one, I&apos;ve tried to understand what people are raving about.

Burgers are good, but nothing extra special especially after waiting 15 minutes in a line of cars (and there is always a wait).  As for their french fries, I can&apos;t tell if I am eating the cardboard container or the fries.

And besides sodas and milkshakes, that is all they serve!  Which begs me to ask what takes them so long to fry up the patties and  fries--they already know what the next order is going to be?!  It boggles the mind. I tend to avoid In-N-Out.

Its DOUBLE DRIVE for GOD SAKE WHY WOULD IT TAKE SO LONG JUST TO GET ME THREE DRINKS ONLY!?. Yesterday came out to pick up something in North Hollywood and stopped here to get a drink because it was so freakin hot. My first job was working for IN-N-OUT and it was a double drive thru. There job is to make sure you get out within at least a minute, waited like 15 minutes in the drive for three drinks.

I&apos;ll probably add the fifth star to my rating of this IN-N-Out in the summer time when eating outside isn&apos;t a problem. They only have outdoor seating which makes eating in the cold and rain a little annoying.

Food&apos;s top notch though and they&apos;re maybe a little faster with the service than the sit down In-N-Outs in Sherman Oaks and Universal City.
