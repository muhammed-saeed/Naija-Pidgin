 Corn-free, store-bought confectioner’s sugar! 
 Posted by Michelle on April 20, 2010 
 

A few months ago, I was lamenting over not being able to find corn-free confectioner’s sugar since it is generally made with cornstarch as the non-clumping agent.  I was pretty well convinced it did not exist in store-bought form and resigned myself to only having the homemade option.  However, when browsing at Whole Foods the other day, I found some!  I’m not sure yet what exactly I’m going to make with it, but I have a few yummy ideas rolling around in my mind.  The only two ingredients in this 365 Organic Powdered Sugar are organic cane sugar and organic tapioca starch.  I couldn’t find it available online at Whole Foods website, but if you have one nearby, you can probably find it or have it ordered.  Let me know if you happen to come across any other corn-free brands!

 Nashville, Part 3: Eating Out 
 Posted by Michelle on April 15, 2010 
 

This last post in my Nashville trip series is all about“eating out”.  Thankfully I don’t suffer from severe allergic reactions (known as anaphylaxis), so my tendency in eating out is to try and eat as closely to allergen-free as possible and just assume I’m probably going to feel a little badly afterwards.  Similarly, when on vacation, although I prepare as much as possible through packing emergency snacks and attempting to find ready-to-eat groceries, I still generally eat out at times in order to have meat which keeps my hypoglycemia at bay or just because it is part of the fun.

 Sit-down Restaurants 

When we were in downtown Nashville one evening, we ate at a place called Big River Grille and Brewing.  We chose this particular place because steakhouses and grills are where I tend to find a complete meal (mostly) free of allergens.  Their menu had a Grilled Chicken Cashew Salad (with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, tomatoes, cashews, and balsamic vinaigrette).  I usually can’t have feta because it is most often derived from cow’s milk.  However, they also had a Hummus and Goat Cheese Salad, so I knew that I could have the feta replaced with the goat cheese.  I also asked the waiter to have my chicken grilled in olive oil with no blended seasonings and to just bring me oil and vinegar in place of the balsamic vinaigrette since I assumed it could have contained soy or corn.  I was excited to learn that the dressing was homemade from olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and basil all whipped together, so I could actually eat it.  The salad and dressing were both really tasty and I felt fine afterwards which means there weren’t any hidden allergens.

 Fast Food Restaurants 

 

Another night, when we were running late for dinner and my blood sugar was already dipping too low, we stopped at a McDonalds because it is all we could find.  Anytime I eat at McDonalds, I get a grilled chicken breast sandwich with no bun and no condiments, but still alway feel a little sick in my stomach and muscle-achy afterwards.  I have always had my suspicions that the chicken was cooked in soybean oil, but never took the time to research it.  After returning home, I googled McDonald’s grilled chicken breast sandwiches to see what they actually contain and this is what I found on McDonald’s Ingredient List :

 Grilled Chicken Breast Filet: Boneless, skinless chicken breast filets with rib meat containing: up to 12% of a solution of water, seasoning [salt, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, spices, whey, flavor (maltodextrin, natural flavors (vegetable source), dextrose, monosodium glutamate), partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils, Romano cheese [Romano cheese (milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes, calcium chloride], nonfat dry milk, disodium phosphate], parmesan cheese powder [enzyme modified parmesan cheese (milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes, calcium chloride), nonfat dry milk, disodium phosphate], xanthan gum, cheese flavor [dehydrated cheddar cheese (cultured pasteurized milk, salt, enzymes), maltodextrin, autolyzed yeast extract], extractives citric acid, soybean oil and sodium phosphates. 

Yuck!  I expected the soybean oil and possibly the msg, but cheese and milk!??  Why do they need to add dairy to everything?  No wonder it makes me feel gross!

We also ate at a Subway once, where I order the grilled chicken breast sandwich on“whole wheat”with spinach leaves, banana peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and oil&amp;vinegar (not the red wine vinaigrette dressing) and had similar experiences to those at McDonalds.  If you’re interested, here’s a Subway Ingredient List and Subway Food Allergen&amp;Sensitivity Chart which shows why I don’t feel great after eating there either.

And lastly, although we didn’t happen to eat at Burger King this time, here’s a link to Burger King’s Ingredient List for your use.  Their grilled chicken breast also contains soy, msg, and dairy along with corn.

Well, I hope this little peak into my attempts to eat allergen-free during my trip was useful to you.  Next time, I’ll remember to take photos of my allergen-free“adventures”!

 Nashville, Part 2: Grocery Shopping and a Cooler 
 Posted by Michelle on March 17, 2010 
 



After my arrival in Nashville, a friend met me and we drove to Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods, which I had found on the Natural Food Store Locator map prior to the trip.  Trader Joe’s was not exactly what I was expecting.  I had been to a huge one in Texas a few years ago, but this one was fairly small and did not have prepared meats or very many allergen-free selections in the granola bar/cookie department (generally a large percentage of my starches when traveling due to lack of necessary preparation and ease of portability).  However, I did find some plaintain chips(Trader Joe’s brand) that were super yummy, along with honey whole-wheat bread, apples, baby carrots, and goat’s milk.

Then we went to Whole Foods where I was able to purchase prepared chicken, allergen-free granola cookies, corn-free mustard, and a few gallons of water.  Thankfully, my friend had brought me a cooler to keep the meat, goat’s milk, and water cool.  We just kept refilling it with ice at the hotel.  I used this food for breakfast and other times when it was hard to find a place to eat.  We didn’t really have a cooler full of sodas, by the way.  I was just severely slacking in my photo taking.  I’ll do better next trip!

We did have one little oops with the chicken.  I didn’t think far enough ahead to bring extra ziplocks to store the chicken while it was in the cooler and I was too cheap to buy a few.  So, I opted to instead place the box of chicken inside of a huge 2-1/2 Gallon Hefty One Zip bag, which I happened to have with me.  The problem was that the zipper wasn’t actually watertight so water got into the bag and ruined the chicken.  It was a sad day, but we recovered. It taught me to make sure I bring along a few large ziplocks with me next time if I’m planning on purchasing meat, etc. in order to protect it while in the cooler.

We also had an unplanned stop at a little mexican store on my last day in the Nashville area, which my friend found when I was craving a grape soda, of all things.  I don’t drink sodas very often, but when I drink one it cannot have corn syrup in it.  When at home here in Colorado, I usually would purchase a corn syrup-free soda at a natural food store.  However, since mexican sodas are generally made of cane sugar, I can also find them at a mexican store or even the convenience store down the road which happens to carry mexican Cokes and orange Fantas.  This is good to remember when you’re in the middle of nowhere, craving a soda pop!

In a few days I’ll post the last installment of this series and share where I“ate out”and a few little things I learned related to that.

 Nashville, Part 1: Preparing for the Airport/Plane 
 Posted by Michelle on March 14, 2010 
 

I’m back from Nashville!  I had a great time and thought I’d share a little bit about my attempts to eat allergen-free food during my travels.  Over the next few days there will be a series of posts related to preparing for the airport/plane and finding food once you reach your travel destination.  Today I’ll touch on preparing for my trip to the airport and my actual flight.  I had a 3 hour direct flight from Denver to Nashville and left my house about 2-1/2 hours before the flight, so I needed to bring about 2 mini-meals with me (I eat small meals every few hours) since it can be pretty difficult, not to mention expensive, to find allergen-free food in the airport.

I packed grilled chicken breasts, apples, allergen-free granola cookies, and almonds in my backpack/carry-on for my plane trip to Nashville.  Keep in mind that it is generally a good idea to pack enough for at least one meal/snack beyond your actual travel time because you won’t always have allergen-free food conveniently accessible upon arrival.  I also packed some extra almonds, the rest of my cookies, and an empty Nalgene water bottle in my checked luggage for use once I arrived.  I chugged a bunch of water on my drive to the airport to cut down on the amount of bottled water I’d have to buy during my time at the airport and on the plane since airport water is so expensive!  I do miss the days when I could just bring water with me–however, I’m thankful for the additional security provided at our airports.

I ate the first portion of chicken fairly soon after arriving at the airport so I didn’t need to worry about keeping it cool.  I did need to keep the second portion cool, however.  After I made it through security, I purchased a cold bottle of water and stored it in my backpack next to the chicken.  I stored the pack on the floor during the flight because this area is generally cooler and the chicken has always remained cool for my flights of up to 3 hours.  Another option would be to bring a small ice pack with you, but if you can get by without one you might-as-well forgo the extra weight.

Once I landed, I had enough time to pick up my baggage, meet my friend, and drive to the health food store to pick up more allergen-free food before my next mini-meal.  Plus, I had leftover almonds, cookies, and an apple just in case the trip to the grocery store would not have been that quick or easy.  If you are hypoglycemic like I am, being just an hour or 2 late on your feeding schedule can make a huge difference in how you feel and can ruin the rest of the day!  I’ll fill you in on the trip to the grocery store in a few days.  See you then!

 Natural Health Food Store Locator 
 Posted by Michelle on March 9, 2010 
 

I’m going to Nashville this week for a conference and a mini-vacation with friends and family.  Since I haven’t been to Nashville before, I need to plan ahead and figure out where I’m going to find food that I can eat.  So, I thought this would be a good time to share this handy dandy Natural Health Food Store Locator with you.  I came across it a little over a year ago and it has proven to be invaluable anytime I am traveling to an area I’m not familiar with or where I do not know of a health food store in which to purchase some allergen-free food.

The site includes the big name stores like Trader Joes and Whole Foods, but it also includes the little mom n’pop stores.  It can prove pretty useful if you live in a more rural area too, since you might not know that the smaller, less well known natural food stores are even there. Of course, I can always find fresh fruits, vegetables, and usually plain nuts at any grocery store.  But when you are traveling, you can’t always grill yourself a hunk-o-meat or bake some fresh whole grain bread, with no hidden allergens.  And a girl can only subsist for so long on just veggies, fruit, and nuts.

The site consists of a map of the United States, with little markers letting you know which states have one or more natural food stores.  It even includes Hawaii and Alaska!  You need to click on the individual state though for the entire listing of health food stores to come up.  The only draw-back to the site is that it doesn’t include any countries other than the US.  Also, it is a good idea to scribble down directions for a few of the stores close to your travel destination because you never know what you may come across.  For instance, I once visited a smaller health food store while traveling, where almost everything was made out of soy–which is not helpful when I’m allergic to soy!

Well, I’m heading off to Nashville and am pretty excited that there is a Trader Joes and a Whole Foods right in town.  Take a drive around the store locator site and let me know what you think!

 My Millet Apologies 
 Posted by Michelle on March 8, 2010 
I do realize that I declared February to be Millet Month and then proceeded to only post 2 whole millet recipes, plus one tiny how-to on making millet“cornmeal”.   Although I am extremely pathetic, I promise to make it up to you.  I actually have a bunch of millet recipes just waiting on my hard drive to be organized into a post, but my life has been a little insane lately.   One of those recipes are for these cookies:

 

They don’t look too bad, right?  I had never made them before, but came across the recipe in one of my allergen-free cookbooks and thought it would be cool to add a cookie recipe made out of just millet flour to the mix.  Plus, it only used apple juice concentrate for the sweetener (if you don’t consider the chocolate chips which were optional).

 

The recipe described the cookies as“fragile, but delicious”.  So, I made them, and they were ummm…Not Good!  Seriously, they were nasty!  And my engineering tendency is to follow recipes to a T, at least the first time around, so although there is a possibility that some kind of user error occurred, I’m pretty sure it didn’t this time.  All this to say, I’m sad to not be posting an all millet cookie recipe for you.  I did find another cookie recipe that includes some other flours in addition to millet, which I have higher hopes for.  If it turns out, I’ll include it with the other recipes I will soon be posting–I promise!

 Seasoned Salt 
 Posted by Michelle on February 15, 2010 
 

In order to make your own seasoned salt, with no allergens (like corn or gluten), preservatives, or nasty things like msg, you’ll need (clockwise, beginning at“noon”) sea salt, white granulated cane sugar, paprika, turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, and arrowroot powder (to keep the seasoning from clumping).  Make sure to use pure onion and garlic powder (not salt) with no additives.

 

Mix it all together in a small bowl, crushing any of the clumps with a spoon (or a pestle, if you have one).

 

Pour the mixture into a jar with a shaker top to store.  If you are cooking for more than one or if you tend to use alot of seasoning salt, you can double or triple the recipe in order to fill the jar.  I use this in flavoring chicken, beef, fish, vegetables, fries, eggs, or whole grains (cooked millet quinoa, etc.).   This recipe is similar to Lawry’s Seasoned Salt, but without the preservatives and allergens (such as corn).  It is also alot less expensive than purchasing a similar blend at your local natural grocer.  Go ahead and experiment with the ratios or add other spices, such as corriander, dry mustard, black pepper, celery seed, parsley, etc.  Have fun and enjoy!

 Fudgy Black Bean“Brownies” 
 Posted by Michelle on February 13, 2010 
 

Fudgy Black Bean Brownies, looking all cute for Valentines Day.  Despite what you may be thinking, these actually are really good, moist, and fudgy in addition to being free of most allergens.  Don’t look at them as a replacement for a good old regular brownie, but instead as a healthy and tasty treat.

 

You will need eggs, unsweetened applesauce, baking powder, olive oil spray, coconut oil, black beans, vanilla, chopped walnuts, agave nectar (or honey), and cocoa powder.

 

First, preheat your oven to 350° F  and spray the bottom and sides of an 8″x8″glass pan with olive oil spray.

 

Then, dump the can of beans into a strainer and run under cold water until thoroughly rinsed and add to the blender.  Make sure the canned beans you use only contain beans and water (salt if you can’t find them without).

 

Next, crack one egg white and two whole eggs into a separate bowl to make sure there are no shell pieces.  I like to do the white first in case the yolk slips out, then I have a few more tries.  Add the eggs to the blender.

 

Measure the coconut oil into a small microwaveable dish and microwave on high for about 20 seconds.

 

Stir the coconut oil to melt the remaining solids.

 

Once it is clear and completely melted, add it to the blender.

 

Pack the cocoa powder into your measuring cup with the back of a spoon and heap it a little.  We want these things to be chocolatey.

 

Add the remaining ingredients (baking powder, vanilla, applesauce, and agave nectar) to the blender.  Make sure your vanilla contains no corn syrup and the unsweetened applesauce ingredient list should just include apples and erythorbic or citric acid.

 

Blend on low until smooth, then stir in the walnuts.

 

Pour the batter into your prepared pan and bake for approximately 40 minutes or…

 

until firm and dry in the middle.  Allow to cool, then cut into single-servings.

 

Keep the brownies tightly covered in the fridge.

 Fudgy Black Bean“Brownies” 

from the kitchen of: myallergenfreelifestylemanual.com

 C, CD, D, G, P, R, S, SF, WF, W 

 Ingredients: 

15 oz can black beans, rinsed

2 eggs

1 egg white

2 Tablespoons + 2 teaspoons coconut oil, melted

1/3 cup cocoa, packed

1-1/2 teaspoon homemade baking powder or 1 teaspoon storebought

1 tsp vanilla

¼ cup unsweentened applesauce

½ cup agave nectar (or honey)

½ cup chopped walnuts

 Directions: 

 Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray the sides and bottom of an 8″x8″glass pan with olive oil. Dump the can of black beans into a strainer and rinse with water, draining well when finished.  Then pour the beans into your blender. Crack  eggs into a separate dish (2 eggs and 1 egg white), then add to blender. Measure coconut oil into a small, microwaveable bowl and microwave on high for about 20 seconds.  Stir until completely melted and add to blender. Measure cocoa by packing into measuring cup with the back of a spoon, then add to blender. Measure and add baking powder, vanilla, applesauce, and agave nectar to blender. Blend on low until smooth. Remove blender lid and stir in walnuts. Pour brownie batter into your prepared glass pan and smooth with the back of a spoon. Bake for 40 minutes or until firm and dry in the middle. Allow to cool and cut into single servings. Store the brownies in the fridge, tightly covered. 

Yields 9 brownies.

 Millet“Corn”Bread 
 Posted by Michelle on February 9, 2010 
 

I can no longer eat true cornbread due to my corn allergy, but this“corn”bread made from millet actually tastes very similar to the real thing and is really tasty!

 

You will need millet“corn”meal , an egg, white whole-wheat flour, baking powder , white granulated cane sugar, wheat gluten, canola oil, olive oil in a mister, goat’s milk, and sea salt.

 

First preheat your oven to 400° F and then spray the bottom and sides of an 8″x8″glass baking pan with olive oil.

 

Next, measure the white whole wheat flour and wheat gluten and combine in a large bowl.   The Tablespoon of wheat gluten should be slightly heaped as shown.

 

Add the remaining dry ingredients and…

 

Thoroughly blend all the dry ingredients together.

 

Crack the egg into a small dish and beat well with a fork.

 

Mix the wet ingredients (milk, oil, and egg) together in your measuring cup.

 

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients…

 

And stir well.

 

Pour the batter into your prepared baking pan and smooth evenly with the back of the spoon.  Place in your preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or…

 

until golden on top.  Allow to cool for a few minutes, then cut into single-size servings.

 

This is best right out of the oven, so serve and enjoy!

 

When using this as part of a Make-Ahead-Meal, I generally package it in 1 cup containers and pop them in the freezer.   It tends to be a little drier the second time around, so I microwave it for a few minutes and put some coconut oil on it to moisten it up.

This is not gluten-free, so if any of you with gluten intolerances/allergies revamp the recipe to replace the white whole-wheat flour and gluten with a gluten-free alternative (that is not rice, corn, or potato) and still get a good rise, let me know what you did–then I can make it to share with my gluten intolerant friends!

 Millet“Corn”Bread 

from the kitchen of: myallergenfreelifestylemanual.com

 C, CD, N, P, R, S, SF, WF 

 Ingredients: 

1-1/4 cups white whole-wheat flour

1 (heaping) Tablespoon wheat gluten

3/4 cup millet“cornmeal” 

3 Tablespoons white granulated cane sugar

1 Tablespoon homemade baking powder (or 2 teaspoons storebought if you don’t have corn or potato allergies)

1/2 teaspoon sea salt

1 egg, lightly beaten

1 cup goat’s milk (or other milk substitute as your allergies allow)

1/4 cup canola oil

olive oil cooking spray

 Directions: 

 Preheat the oven to 400˚ F. Spray the bottom and sides of an 8″x 8″glass pan with olive oil. Mix together all dry ingredients in a large bowl. Lightly beat egg in a separate small bowl. Combine and stir the beaten egg with the goat’s milk and oil. Add the liquids to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour the batter into the greased pan and smooth the top with the back of your spoon. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Allow to cool for a few minutes, slice into single-size portions, and serve! Makes 9-16 servings, depending on how you slice it.

 Millet“Corn”Meal 
 Posted by Michelle on February 8, 2010 
 

Today, we are going to mill/grind millet to the consistency of cornmeal in order to use it as a cornmeal substitute.

 

All you do, is take some whole grain millet and…

 

Pour some of it into a grain mill.  Then, set the milling size to produce a cornmeal-like consistency.

 

This is what the scale looks like on the grain mill I have been borrowing from my friend Melissa.  Some day I will have to splurge and buy my own!  I marked a little arrow on some tape to show you which milling size I used.  Since there is no actual sieve size to convey to you and your grain mill is most-likely different than mine Melissa’s…

 

I attempted to show the comparison of actual millet grains to the milling-size I used.  The grains almost match all 5 of these sizes, but I chose the middle one so that the grain would actually be milled.  Sorry for the blur by the way.  For some reason, I have issues operating an automatic and my SLR is film-loaded.  It’s a good idea to run just a little bit of grain through the first time and then open up your flour bin to check that the consistency is like that of cornmeal before milling a whole batch.  Once you find the right size, make sure you mark it for future reference and mill-away!

 

Now you have corn-free“corn”meal that you can use in all of your favorite cornmeal recipes.  I store mine in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer to keep it fresh.   Tomorrow I’ll be posting a yummy millet“corn”bread recipe, which is one of the main things I’ve missed since I began to have reactions to corn.
