I was on Park Avenue in Winter Park last weekend, and I think I saw a sign that Bosphorous, near the southwest corner of Park and Morse will be open both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I’ve eaten there a couple of times and I really enjoyed it.

The Ale House in Altamonte is open starting at 3 pm on Christmas, and is a lot better than these snobby places.

Ale House better than the Boheme or Bosphorous? You gotta get out more often. The only reason one might call these places snobby is because they stick out like a sore thumb when they are there or because they just can’t afford it, which is what it is. You shouldn’t bash a restaurant because it is nice or considered posh, maybe if there food was overpriced and tasted bad or if the service was bad, but I can assure you that is not the case at either the Boheme or Bosphorous.
