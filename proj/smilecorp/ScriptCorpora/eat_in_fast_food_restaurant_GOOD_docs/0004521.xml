Does the Sharpe Ratio Work All the Time?
 Email Share Favorite RePublish article Tweet 
When analyzing different Mutual Funds for a specific Asset Class and trying to use the Sharpe Ratio to pick the best Fund, do you pick the one with the highest one? Which method would you use? Does the SR work all the time?

Let&apos;s imagine 4 scenarios:

Scenarios 1 and 2 will be on the positive Return side and 3 and 4 will be on the negative side.

I will analyze the Sharpe Ratio (SR=Return/Risk) for each Fund and then decide which one to pick. I am not considering the risk free rate as it will impact the numerator by the same amount on all options.

Scenario 1:
Let&apos;s hold Return of 20% constant
A. Risk of 15%
B. Risk of 20%
C. Risk of 25%
Which Fund to pick?
SR of Fund A: + 1.33
SR of Fund B: + 1
SR of Fund C: + 0.8
I will pick the Mutual Fund with the highest SR, namely Fund A.

Scenario 2:
Let&apos;s hold Risk of 15% constant

 Return of 10%
B. Return of 15%
C. Return of 20%
Which Fund to pick?
SR of Fund A: + 0.67
SR of Fund B: + 1
SR of Fund C: + 1.33
I will pick the Mutual Fund with the highest SR, namely Fund C.

Scenario 3:
Let&apos;s hold Return of -20% constant
A. Risk of 15%
B. Risk of 20%
C. Risk of 25%
Which Fund to pick?
SR of Fund A: - 1.33
SR of Fund B: - 1
SR of Fund C: - 0.8
I will pick the Mutual Fund with the lowest SR, namely Fund A.

Scenario 4:
Let&apos;s hold Risk of 15% constant
A. Return of -10%
B. Return of -15%
C. Return of -20%
Which Fund to pick?
SR of Fund A: - 0.67
SR of Fund B: - 1
SR of Fund C: - 1.33
I will pick the Mutual Fund with the highest SR, namely Fund A.

Conclusion:
Scenarios 1, 2 and 4 make sense as you are picking the Mutual Fund with the highest Sharpe Ratio. Scenario 3 is the one that comes with controversy, because you are tempted to pick the one Mutual Fund with the highest Sharpe ratio namely Fund C, picking the one with the highest Risk for the same negative Return. I, as an investor, would prefer to pick the one with the lowest Risk for the same negative Return, namely Fund A. Does this means that the Sharpe Ratio only works with positive Returns?

Here is the solution I propose for scenario 3 and 4 (negative Returns):
Let&apos;s try to pick a number lower than the negative returns we have on the Mutual Funds.
Let&apos;s pick 100.

Scenario 3:
Let&apos;s hold Return of -20% constant
A. Risk of 15%
B. Risk of 20%
C. Risk of 25%
Which Fund to pick? The Sharpe Ratio would then be calculated as follows:
SR of Fund A: (100-20)%/15%= + 5.33
SR of Fund B: (100-20)%/20%= + 4
SR of Fund C: (100-20)%/25%= + 3.2
I will pick the Mutual Fund with the highest SR, namely Fund A.

Scenario 4:
Let&apos;s hold Risk of 15% constant
A. Return of -10%
B. Return of -15%
C. Return of -20%
Which Fund to pick?
SR of Fund A: (100-10)%/15%= + 6
SR of Fund B: (100-15)%/15%= + 5.67
SR of Fund C: (100-20)%/15%= + 5.33
I will pick the Mutual Fund with the highest SR, namely Fund A.

Although this numbers have no real significance, this method helps decide the best Mutual Funds when you have negative Returns.
