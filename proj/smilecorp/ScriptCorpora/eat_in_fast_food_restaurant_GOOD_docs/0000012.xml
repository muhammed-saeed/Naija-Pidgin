 Chapter 1

Introduction

 The Family Transition Program (FTP) was a welfare 
 reform pilot project that operated from 1994 to 1999 in Escambia County, 
 Florida—a mid-sized county that includes the City of Pensacola. 1  FTP was one of the first welfare reform initiatives to impose a time limit 
 on the receipt of cash assistance—24 months in any 60-month period 
 for most recipients and 36 months in any 72-month period for the least 
 job-ready—and was the first program in the nation in which families 
 reached a time limit and had their welfare benefits canceled. In addition 
 to its time limit, FTP included an unusually rich array of services, mandates, 
 and financial work incentives designed to help welfare recipients prepare 
 for, find, and hold jobs. 

FTP was implemented more than two years before the passage 
 of the 1996 federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation 
 Act (PRWORA, P.L. 104-193), and it anticipated key elements of the federal 
 law. FTP also served as a model for Florida’s statewide welfare 
 reform program, implemented in 1996. 2  Thus, FTP provides important lessons on the implementation and potential 
 effects of more recent welfare reform initiatives in Florida and elsewhere 
 in the United States.

In 1994, the Florida Department of Children and Families 
 (formerly the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services)—the agency that administered FTP—contracted with the Manpower 
 Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) to conduct a multifaceted six-year 
 evaluation of the program’s effectiveness. MDRC is a nonprofit, 
 nonpartisan organization with a quarter century’s experience designing 
 and evaluating social policy initiatives.

This is the fifth and final report in the FTP evaluation. 
 The first report, completed in 1995, described FTP’s early implementation. 3  Three subsequent reports updated the implementation story; provided evidence 
 on how FTP was affecting patterns of employment, earnings, and welfare 
 receipt; described the process that occurred when participants reached 
 FTP’s time limit; and provided early data on how families were faring 
 after reaching the time limit. 4  

In order to assess what difference FTP has made, the evaluation 
 is comparing the experiences of two groups of people: the FTP group , 
 whose members were subject to the program, and the Aid 
 to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) group , whose members 
 were subject to the prior welfare rules. More than five thousand welfare 
 applicants and recipients were assigned to one or the other group through 
 a random process, ensuring that there were no systematic differences between 
 the groups when people entered the study. Thus, any differences that emerged 
 between the groups over time can reliably be attributed to FTP; these 
 are known as the program’s impacts .

This report summarizes the earlier findings and provides 
 new information in each study area. It follows eligible families for at 
 least four years after they entered the study, well beyond the point when 
 recipients began reaching the time limit, and uses data from a large-scale 
 survey to assess, for the first time, FTP’s impacts on key outcomes 
 such as food security and the well-being of participants’children. 
 In addition, the report provides new information from in-depth, post-welfare 
 interviews with FTP participants whose benefits were canceled at the time 
 limit. Finally, the report describes the results of a benefit-cost analysis, 
 which compares FTP’s financial benefits and costs for participants 
 and government budgets.

This introductory chapter describes FTP and the evaluation, 
 discusses the context in which FTP operated, and lays out the content 
 of the rest of the report.

 I. The Family Transition Program and 
 Its Policy Significance

The Family Transition Program was created by the Family 
 Transition Act, passed by the Florida legislature in April 1993. The program 
 began operating in February 1994 under waivers of federal welfare rules. 
 (These waivers were no longer needed after 1996 because FTP’s provisions 
 were permitted under the 1996 federal welfare law.)

The roots of FTP can be traced to a report issued by the 
 Study Commission on Employment Opportunities and Self-Sufficiency, which 
 was created by the Florida legislature in 1992 to develop recommendations 
 for reducing welfare dependency. The state’s AFDC caseload had more 
 than doubled in the prior three years.

FTP directly attacked long-term welfare dependency by imposing 
 a time limit on benefit receipt. At the same time, however, the program 
 recognized that many recipients were not currently equipped to support 
 their families without assistance. Thus, the program’s designers 
 envisioned a“pact”or“covenant”between participants 
 and the program“under which enhanced benefits and services are 
 provided in exchange for increased participant responsibility.”The program was intended to demonstrate a new model of individualized, 
 intensive service delivery. In addition, a variety of safeguards were 
 designed to protect families who made a good-faith effort to find jobs 
 before reaching the time limit, but were unable to do so.

This combination of features was designed not only to reduce 
 dependence but also to make participants better off, both financially 
 and emotionally (for example, by improving their“self-worth”). 
 Although the program was nominally designed to save money for taxpayers, 
 this goal was not strongly emphasized. In fact, as a relatively small 
 program piloting a radical—and potentially harmful—new 
 approach to welfare, FTP was given virtually unlimited funding to ensure 
 that participants had all the services and supports they needed to find 
 jobs or other income sources to replace welfare.

A. The Key Elements of FTP

The key components of FTP are described below and in Table 
 1.1. Chapter 2 discusses how each of these features was implemented in 
 practice.

The Key Differences Between FTP and AFDC Characteristic FTP Policy AFDC Policy Time limit on cash assistance receipt 24 months in any 60-month period for most recipients; 
 36 months in any 72-month period for the least job-ready. Exceptions 
 under certain circumstances. None Amount of earned income disregarded in calculating 
 cash assistance grants The first $200 plus 50% of any remaining earnings. First 4 months of work: $120 plus 33% of earnings;   Months 5-12: $120 disregarded; After month 12: $90 disregarded. Asset limit for cash assistance eligibility $5,000 $1,000 Value of vehicle excluded in counting assets for cash

 for work Two years of transitional child care assistance; eligibility 
 beyond that point depended on eligibility for other programs. One year of transitional child care assistance; eligibility 
 beyond that point depended on eligibility for other programs. Exemptions from employment-related mandates for recipients

 old. Parent exempt if caring for a child under 3 years old. Parental responsibility mandates Parents had to ensure that children attended school 
 regularly, and had to speak with teachers at least once each grading 
 period. Applicants with preschool children had to prove that children 
 had begun immunizations. None Employment-related, social, and health services Participants received intensive case management and 
 a range of social and health services; enhanced employment related 
 services. Participants were served by the pre-existing Project 
 Independence welfare-to-work program. 



 
 Time limit. Under FTP, most recipients 
 were limited to 24 months of cash assistance receipt in any 60-month 
 period. 5  Certain groups of particularly disadvantaged recipients were limited 
 to 36 months of receipt in any 72-month period (the time limit did 
 not directly affect eligibility for other programs, such as Food Stamps 
 or Medicaid). Certain groups were exempt from the time limit, and, 
 in addition, the program policies included a variety of safeguards 
 that could, in theory, lead to temporary benefit extensions for families 
 reaching the time limit, partial (rather than full) benefit termination, 
 or post-time limit subsidized jobs (these are discussed further in 
 Chapter 2). The AFDC group was not subject to a time limit (beyond 
 the one that always existed—a parent must leave welfare when 
 her 6  youngest child“ages out”and is no longer considered 
 a dependent).
 
 Financial work incentives. Under AFDC, recipients
 who found jobs had their grants reduced by $1 for each dollar they
 earned. 7  Many believed that this rule created a disincentive to work. Under
 FTP, the first $200 plus one-half of any remaining earnings were
 disregarded (that is, not counted) in calculating a family’s
 monthly grant. Known as an earned income disregard, this type of
 policy allows a greater proportion of working families to retain
 at least a partial welfare grant to supplement their earnings. Figure
 1.1 and Table 1.2 give examples of how FTP’s earned income
 disregard affected working recipients. Although FTP’s disregard
 was fairly generous, its ability to raise recipients’income
 was limited by Florida’s 
 relatively low welfare benefit levels (a maximum payment of $303
 for a family of three). In addition to the enhanced disregard, FTP
 allowed families to accumulate more assets and to own more valuable
 automobiles (relative to traditional AFDC rules) without losing
 eligibility for cash assistance. Finally, FTP participants received
 subsidized transitional child care for two years after leaving welfare
 for work, as opposed to the one year provided under prior rules. 8 
 
 Enhanced services and requirements. FTP aimed to 
 provide a rich array of services to help participants prepare for 
 and find employment. Most notably, FTP participants received intensive 
 case management provided by workers with very small caseloads. FTP 
 participants were also more likely than AFDC group members to be required 
 to participate in employment-related activities, and the program developed 
 some enhanced education, training, and job placement assistance services. 9  Finally, FTP sought to increase participants’access to a range 
 of other benefits, including social and health services, child care, 
 transportation, and other support services. In addition to increasing 
 funding for such services, FTP brought many of them under one roof 
 in the program offices (known as service centers) to make them more 
 accessible.


 
 Parental responsibility mandates. Under 
 FTP rules, parents with school-age children were required to ensure 
 that their children were attending school regularly and to speak with 
 their children’s teachers at least once each grading period. 
 New applicants for welfare with preschool children were required to 
 provide proof that their children had begun to receive the standard 
 series of immunizations. None of these mandates existed for the AFDC 
 group. Parents who failed to meet these requirements—as well 
 as those who did not comply with the employment and training participation 
 mandates described above—faced sanctions (that is, their grants 
 could be canceled or reduced). 10

 NOTES: The calculations use rules 
 that were in effect in 1997, roughly midway through FTP&apos;s implementation 
 period. Monthly net earnings are based on the parent&apos;s income from 
 employment minus any applicable payroll taxes (federal Medicare 
 and Social Security deductions). Florida does not have a state income 
 tax.
 The Earned Income Credit (EIC) amount 
 reflects 1/12 of the total annual credit, although most families 
 receive the credit in an annual lump sum.
The AFDC grant calculation disregards $120 of gross earnings, in 
 accordance with AFDC rules for the fifth to twelfth month of employment. 
 The FTP grant calculation disregards $200 of gross earnings and 
 half of the remainder. Both calculations assume no unreimbursed 
 child care costs or child support collections.
The Food Stamp calculation disregards 70 percent of net income. 
 Net income includes the AFDC grant but excludes 20 percent of gross 
 earnings, a $134 standard deduction, and up to $250 of excess shelter 
 expenses. This calculation assumes a monthly rental expense of $310.

FTP’s enhanced services and incentives involved a 
 substantial upfront investment. The program’s designers hoped that 
 this initial investment would be recouped when recipients moved off welfare 
 and into jobs, although, as noted earlier, budgetary savings were not 
 a central program goal.

B. FTP’s Policy Significance

The federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
 Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) made major changes in the structure and funding 
 of programs targeted to low-income families and individuals. There were 
 particularly dramatic changes in AFDC, formerly the primary cash assistance 
 program for needy families with children, which was replaced by the Temporary 
 Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. TANF gives states broad 
 flexibility to design welfare programs, but it also restricts states from 
 using federal block grant funds for several groups, including most families 
 who receive assistance for more than 60 cumulative months. States are 
 permitted to exempt up to 20 percent of the caseload from this federal 
 time-limit provision but may also impose time limits of less than 60 months.

Although PRWORA fundamentally changed the structure and 
 funding of cash assistance for needy families, many of the specific policies 
 that the law encourages states to adopt were already being implemented 
 under waivers of federal AFDC rules that had been granted to 43 states 
 prior to the bill’s passage. For example, more than 30 states had 
 received waivers to implement some form of time limit on welfare receipt 
 in at least part of the state. 11  

FTP was one of the most significant initiatives implemented 
 under waivers because it was one of the first to include a time limit. 
 Time limits have been among the most controversial features of state and 
 federal welfare reform efforts in the 1990s. Proponents argue that time 
 limits are necessary to send a firm message to recipients (and the system) 
 that welfare should be temporary; they maintain that the limits will motivate 
 recipients to find jobs or other means of support for their families. 
 Critics contend that many recipients face serious personal problems or 
 skills deficits that make it difficult for them to support their families 
 for long periods without assistance; thus, they argue, time limits will 
 cause harm to many vulnerable families.

Although time limits have been in place in a few areas 
 for as much as six years, there are still relatively few data available 
 to inform this debate. A key reason for the dearth of evidence is that 
 relatively few families nationwide have reached a time limit. Overall, 
 25 states (including the District of Columbia) have imposed a 60-month 
 time limit, and no families have reached those limits yet. 12  Another nine states—including several of the largest—have 
 not imposed time limits that result in cancellation of families’welfare grants (most of those states have imposed so-called“reduction”time limits, which eliminate the adult portion of the welfare grant but 
 maintain benefits for the children). 13  Together, these two groups of states account for about three-fourths of 
 the national welfare caseload.

On the other side of spectrum, 17 states—accounting 
 for about one-fourth of the national caseload—have imposed time 
 limits that could result in cancellation of a family’s grant after 
 less than 60 months of receipt. Six of these states (Florida is by far 
 the largest) have imposed lifetime time limits of less than 60 
 months. 14  

Even among these states, however, the specific rules and 
 their implementation vary tremendously. For example, in several of the 
 states, a large proportion of the welfare caseload is exempt from the 
 time limit. Other states have granted extensions to many of the families 
 who have reached the time limits. As a result, there are fewer than 10 
 states in which a substantial number of families have had their benefits 
 canceled at a time limit. A few of these states (for example, Connecticut, 
 Florida, Massachu-setts, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia) 
 are conducting follow-up surveys or other research on the families whose 
 cases were closed at the time limit, and an even smaller number are sponsoring 
 random assignment evaluations such as the one described in this report. 
 In short, it is clear that the FTP evaluation is one of only a few sources 
 of reliable evidence on the implementation and impacts of one the most 
 important recent changes in welfare policy (although FTP does not provide 
 evidence on the impact of a lifetime time limit).

In assessing the broader relevance of the FTP results, 
 however, it is important to consider the context in which the program 
 was implemented. As discussed further below, FTP operated far from any 
 large city, in a healthy economic climate, during a period when Florida’s 
 overall welfare caseload declined precipitously. In addition, because 
 the program operated in a state that pays relatively low cash assistance 
 grants, families whose grants were canceled at the time limit lost a smaller 
 amount of money than they would in many other states. Finally, as a relatively 
 small pilot, implemented before time limits were widely accepted, FTP 
 was generously funded to provide a rich set of services and supports for 
 participants.

On the one hand, these factors suggest that FTP was implemented 
 in quite favorable circumstances and that its results might thus be considered 
 a“best case scenario”for time-limited welfare. On the other 
 hand, the later discussion will show that, in large part because of these 
 same circumstances, members of the AFDC group were quite likely to find 
 jobs and leave welfare without FTP, leaving little room for the program 
 to generate large impacts on many key outcomes. Ironically, if the context 
 had been less favorable—for example, if jobs had been less plentiful—there might have been a greater likelihood that families would 
 be harmed by FTP’s time limit, but also a greater opportunity for 
 the program to make a difference.

 II. The FTP Evaluation

The FTP evaluation, which began in early 1994, was initially 
 required as a condition of the federal waivers that allowed Florida to 
 implement the program. The state elected to complete the evaluation even 
 though it was not required to do so under the 1996 federal welfare law. 
 In 1997, Florida was awarded enhanced funding by the U.S. Department of 
 Health and Human Services (DHHS) to support continuation of the study. 
 A second DHHS grant supported an expansion of the study to examine FTP’s 
 impacts on children.

A. Components of the Study

The FTP evaluation includes three major components:

 
 Implementation analysis. This part 
 of the study examines how FTP operated. Data on a program’s 
 implementation can be critical to interpreting its impacts and to 
 identifying practices that are associated with success.
 
 Impact analysis. This part of the study 
 assesses whether FTP generated changes in participants’employment, 
 earnings, welfare receipt, family income, and other outcomes, relative 
 to the AFDC system it replaced. The impact analysis is also examining 
 FTP’s effects on family functioning and on the well-being of 
 participants’children.
 
 Benefit-cost analysis. This analysis 
 uses data from the impact analysis and from fiscal records to compare 
 the financial benefits and costs of FTP for both taxpayers and individuals 
 subject to the program.
 

This final report describes results for all three study 
 areas. The specific data sources used in preparing this report are described 
 later in this chapter.

B. Research Design for the Impact Analysis

Welfare recipients frequently find jobs and leave the welfare 
 rolls with or without the assistance of special programs or policies. 
 This is particularly likely to be the case when economic conditions are 
 good, as they have been for the past several years. Thus, in assessing 
 the effectiveness of a program such as FTP, it is critical to separate 
 outcomes that are attributable to the new program from those that would 
 have occurred even if the program did not exist. As noted earlier, the 
 FTP evaluation uses a random assignment research design to address this 
 task. For purposes of the study, welfare applicants and recipients who 
 met the criteria for FTP (discussed below) were assigned, at random, to 
 one of two groups:

 
The FTP group , whose members were eligible 
 for FTP’s services and subject to its mandates, including the 
 time limit; or
 
The AFDC group , whose members were 
 subject to the welfare rules that existed before FTP was implemented—which included, for many recipients, a requirement to participate 
 in employment-related activities through Project Independence, Florida’s 
 pre-existing welfare-to-work program. 15  
 

MDRC tracked the two groups during a follow-up period lasting 
 four years and compared them on a number of measures, including their 
 employment and welfare receipt patterns, family income, and others. Although 
 this methodology has some limitations—for example, it cannot assess 
 whether FTP affected the number of people who applied for welfare in the 
 first place—random assignment is generally seen as the most reliable 
 way to determine what difference, if any, a program makes. 16  A later section of this chapter discusses how the unique context in which 
 FTP has operated may affect the study’s results.

Although the Work and Gain Economic Self-Sufficiency (WAGES) 
 program replaced AFDC statewide in Florida in late 1996, to facilitate 
 completing the study, both FTP and traditional AFDC continued to operate 
 in Escambia County until late 1999. 17  This situation presented Escambia County staff with the challenging task 
 of operating three different welfare programs simultaneously. (Beginning 
 in October 1996, new applicants for welfare in Escambia County who had 
 not already been assigned to the FTP group or the AFDC group were placed 
 into WAGES.)

C. The Random Assignment Process

People were assigned to the FTP and AFDC groups from May 
 1994 through October 1996. 18  Beginning in May 1994, all applicants for cash assistance who met FTP’s 
 eligibility criteria were randomly assigned either to FTP or to AFDC at 
 the time they applied. People who were already receiving assistance when 
 FTP began were phased in over time; they were randomly assigned when they 
 appeared for semiannual recertification interviews. 19  

Figure 1.2 illustrates the random assignment process. Whether 
 it occurred at application or re-certification, the process began with 
 screening: Staff went through a checklist to determine whether the applicant 
 or recipient met any of the criteria for an exemption from FTP. The following 
 groups were exempted upfront and were not randomly assigned:

 
Incapacitated or disabled adults;
 
Individuals under 18 years old who were attending school or working 
 30 hours or more per week;
 
Adults caring full time for disabled dependents;
 
Parents caring for children 6 months old or younger; 20  
 
Recipients 62 years old or older; and
 
Caretaker relatives whose needs are not included in the grant.
 

If there was no exemption, staff gave a brief description 
 of FTP and the evaluation and, through a brief interview with the applicant 
 or recipient, completed a one-page sheet called the Background Information 
 Form (BIF). The BIF included identifying information (name, Social Security 
 number, etc.), demographic information, and data on the individual’s 
 work and welfare history. Next, staff asked the individual to fill out 
 a brief, confidential questionnaire called the Private Opinion Survey 
 (POS). 21  Data from the BIF and POS are presented below.

Once these forms were complete, FTP staff members placed 
 a phone call to MDRC and read a few items from the BIF to an MDRC clerk. 
 Using this information, individuals were randomly assigned to either the 
 FTP or the AFDC group by a computer program on site at MDRC. Those individuals 
 assigned to the AFDC group continued their application or recertification 
 with staff from the traditional AFDC program; FTP group members were enrolled 
 into FTP.

 Figure 1.2
Florida&apos;s Family Transition Program
The Random Assignment Process 
[ D ]
 NOTE: a The following individuals 
 were exempted from FTP before random assignment: incapacitated or 
 disabled adults; individuals under 18 years old who were attending 
 school or working 30 hours or more per week; adults caring full time 
 for disabled dependents; parents caring for children six months old 
 or younger; recipients 62 years old or older; and caretaker relatives 
 whose needs are not included in the grant. 

A few aspects of this process are worth noting. First, because 
 of the up-front screening process, a segment of Escambia’s welfare 
 caseload was not included in the evaluation. 22  Thus, the results presented here may not provide information on the impact 
 of FTP for the full caseload—including, potentially, a hard-to-employ 
 segment of the population (for example, people who indicated that they 
 were incapacitated).

Second, welfare applicants were randomly assigned before 
 staff knew whether their application would be approved. Thus, as discussed 
 later, around 8 percent of the FTP group never received cash assistance 
 during the follow-up period, either because they did not follow through 
 with their application or because they were found to be ineligible for 
 benefits. Because people’s behavior may have been affected by FTP 
 from the time they first heard about the program, conducting random assignment 
 at this early point gave the study a better chance to measure the program’s 
 full impact. At the same time, however, the early point of random assignment 
 means that some FTP group members had only very limited contact with the 
 program.

Third, although staff screened out people who were exempt 
 from FTP prior to random assignment, some members of the FTP group were 
 also exempted after random assignment. When this occurred, the individual’s 
 time-limit“clock”was stopped (that is, while the exemption 
 applied, months of cash assistance receipt did not count toward the time 
 limit). Post-random assignment exemptions might have occurred because 
 an exemption slipped through the screening process undetected or because 
 an exemption did not exist until some point after random assignment (for 
 example, a participant may have become incapacitated after random assignment). 23  Individuals who were exempted after random assignment remained part of 
 the analysis.

D. The FTP Target Population

This section uses data from the BIF and POS to provide 
 a snapshot of the FTP target population at the point people entered the 
 study.

 1. Demographic characteristics. Table 1.3 shows information collected from the BIF for members of the 
 FTP and AFDC groups. BIF data are available for approximately 97 percent 
 of the report sample, which, as discussed below, includes single parents 
 randomly assigned from May 1994 through February 1995. (Appendix Table 
 A.9 and Appendix Table A.10 show these data separately for the two research 
 grou ps; as expected, there are few statistically significant 
 differences between the groups.)

 a parent&apos;s name.( back ) 
 

As expected, the vast majority of report sample members 
 are women. Their average age at the point of random assignment was about 
 29, but nearly one-third of the sample members were under 25 years old 
 when randomly assigned. Roughly equal proportions of the sample are black 
 and white; there are few Hispanics.

About half the sample members were applying for welfare 
 when they were randomly assigned, but only about 12 percent were first-time 
 applicants. Overall, about 53 percent reported that they had received 
 welfare on their own or their spouse’s case for a total of two years 
 or more prior to random assignment. Interestingly, however, less than 
 one in five grew up in a household that received AFDC.

These data provide some indication of the magnitude of 
 the task FTP faced in helping participants move to self-sufficiency. One 
 the one hand, the vast majority of sample members had at least some work 
 experience prior to random assignment. On the other hand, most had little recent work experience (less than 12 percent 
 had earned $5,000 or more in the previous year), and 40 percent had never worked full time for six months or more for one employer.

There is also evidence that many sample members had limited 
 earnings capacity. Nearly 40 percent did not have a high school diploma 
 or equivalent at the point of random assignment, and only 6 percent had 
 a post-secondary degree. Those who were employed at the point of random 
 assignment reported on average hourly wage of less than $5.00 (the minimum 
 wage was $4.25 per hour when these data were collected). 24  

Finally, while most sample members had small families, 
 more than two-thirds had at least one preschool child at the point of 
 random assignment, and more than 40 percent had at least one child under 
 age 3.

 2. Attitudes and opinions. Table 
 1.4 displays information from the Private Opinion Survey; about 92 percent 
 of report sample members completed the POS, which was optional. (Appendix 
 A shows these data separately for the two research groups.)

These data show that about 72 percent of the sample members 
 who were not employed at the point of random assignment reported that 
 they were facing at least one of five specific barriers to employment. 
 By far the most commonly cited barriers were related to child care and 
 transportation, issues with which FTP offered assistance. Nearly one-fourth 
 of the respondents said they could not work because they or a family member 
 had a health or emotional problem, and a similar proportion said they 
 were experiencing too many family problems. (There is some overlap between 
 these two groups: About 34 percent said they had either a health or emotional problem or too many family problems; this is not 
 shown in the table.) FTP offered counseling and health services designed 
 to address some of these issues.

A series of questions asked respondents to express their 
 preferences among five activities: part-time work, full-time work, basic 
 education, job training, and staying home to care for one’s family. 
 The largest share of respondents—just over 40 percent—said they would prefer full-time work. Another 36 percent preferred job 
 training. Only about 5 percent said they preferred to go to school to 
 study basic reading and math, and a similar proportion said they preferred 
 to stay home to take care of their families. 25

 NOTES: A total 
 of 234 sample members who chose not to fill out a POS are not included 
 in the table.
In most item groupings, individuals could agree or agree a lot with 
 more than one statement in the grouping. Therefore, percentages 
 may add up to more than 100.

 b Distributions do not add 
 up to 100 percent because some individuals did not indicate a consistent 
 preference. Multiple responses were not possible for this item.( back )
 c Full time is defined as 
 40 hours or more per week.( back ) 
 

In terms of their job preferences, the vast majority of 
 respondents said they would take a job that supported their families a 
 little better than welfare, even if they did not like the work (71 percent) 
 or if they had to work at night occasionally (77 percent). However, fewer 
 than half said they would take the job if it was at a fast-food restaurant 
 or if it took them more than one hour to get there. Less than 40 percent 
 of respondents said they would take a full-time job that paid less than 
 welfare. (Such jobs are likely to be rare; even a minimum-wage, full-time 
 job would pay more than the combined total of AFDC/TANF and Food Stamps 
 for most FTP families.)

Several of the responses indicate that respondents placed 
 a high value on health insurance coverage. When asked about their minimum 
 acceptable hourly wage, the average response was $6.69 an hour if the 
 job provided health insurance and $7.93 an hour if it did not. In other 
 words, respondents valued health insurance at about $1.24 per hour.

Although respondents probably knew little about FTP’s 
 time limit at the point the POS was administered, very few of them expected 
 to reach the“cliff.”Only 16 percent said they expected to 
 be receiving welfare in one year; 89 percent said they expected to be 
 working at that point.

E. Data Sources for the Evaluation

The following types of data were collected for all or some 
 individual members of the FTP and AFDC groups:

 
 Baseline data. As noted earlier, two 
 brief forms were completed for virtually all members of the research 
 sample. These data provide a“snapshot”of the characteristics 
 and attitudes of the two groups’members as of the date each 
 person was randomly assigned.
 
 Administrative records. The State of 
 Florida provided MDRC with computerized data on monthly AFDC/TANF 
 payments, monthly Food Stamp benefits, and quarterly earnings reported 
 to the state’s Unemployment Insurance (UI) system, as well as 
 UI benefit payments, child care subsidy payments, and Medicaid expenditures. 
 These data covered all members of the FTP and AFDC groups. The AFDC/TANF 
 and Food Stamp data cover the period from April 1993 (one year before 
 the first random assignment) to June 1999, while the quarterly earnings 
 data cover the period from April 1993 to September 1999.
 
 Four-year client survey. A survey firm, 
 working under contract to MDRC, conducted interviews with FTP and 
 AFDC group members in 1998 and 1999; the interviews were intended 
 to take place four years after each person’s date of random 
 assignment. All respondents completed a 35-minute“core”module, consisting of questions on employment, household income, material 
 well-being, and other issues. Respondents with at least one child 
 between 5 and 12 years old (as of the interview date) also completed 
 an additional 90-minute segment of questions focusing on child care, 
 the home environment, parenting, and child well-being.
 
 Post-time-limit survey. Working with 
 subcontractors, MDRC sought to conduct in-person interviews with all 
 FTP participants who reached the time limit during certain calendar 
 periods. Individuals were interviewed around the time their benefits 
 expired, and then 6, 12, and 18 months later. This report focuses 
 mostly on the results of the 18-month follow-up interview, a lengthy 
 open-ended discussion conducted by a trained ethnographer.
 
 Other program data. MDRC obtained data 
 on FTP group members’case histories and participation in employment-related 
 activities from FTP’s computerized tracking system (known as 
 CMS) and from two statewide databases—the FLORIDA system and 
 the WAGES system. In addition, program casefiles were reviewed for 
 subsets of both research groups on several occasions. 26  
 
 Two-year client survey. The two-year 
 client survey, including just over 600 FTP and AFDC group members, 
 was conducted in 1997. 27  Covering a broad range of topics, that survey was administered by 
 telephone in most cases, and in-person with those who could not be 
 reached by phone (the response rate was 80 percent). In addition, 
 a brief telephone survey of 81 FTP and AFDC group members was conducted 
 in 1995, about three months after people entered the study; the survey 
 was designed to assess individuals’awareness of the rules that 
 applied to their research group. 28  In 1996, MDRC also conducted several focus groups with current or 
 former FTP participants.
 

The study also used several other types of data to help 
 characterize FTP’s implementation and costs. For example, MDRC staff 
 periodically visited Escambia County throughout the study period to interview 
 line staff and managers and to observe program activities. In addition, 
 MDRC administered written surveys to 126 staff members in FTP and the 
 traditional AFDC program in mid-1996. Finally, a variety of fiscal and 
 other government records (for example, expenditure reports, contracts, 
 tax regulations, etc.) were used for the cost analysis.

F. Samples, Subgroups, and Time Frames

Because some of the individual-level data described in 
 the previous section are only available for subsets of sample members, 
 this report’s analysis does not always focus on all members of the 
 FTP and AFDC groups. The various samples and subsamples included in this 
 report are described below.

Figure 1.3 illustrates the time frames for which data are 
 available, and Figure 1.4 represents the samples used in the analysis.

 1. The report sample. As noted 
 earlier, welfare applicants and recipients were randomly assigned to the 
 FTP and AFDC groups from May 1994 to October 1996. A total of 5,430 people 
 were randomly assigned during this period. However, all the reports in 
 the study, including this one, focus on a subset of these people: the 
 2,817 single-parent cases that were randomly assigned from May 1994 to 
 February 1995. 29  This group, known as the report sample , 
 is depicted in Figures 1.3 and 1.4. It was selected because the random 
 assignment process was virtually suspended from early March to late October 
 1995 for programmatic reasons. The few individuals assigned during this 
 period were atypical—they were all applicants with no recent welfare 
 history—and thus inappropriate to include in the analysis. Random 
 assignment resumed from late 1995 to late 1996, but substantially less 
 follow-up data are available for the later assignees. 30  

As discussed earlier, administrative records of quarterly 
 earnings, AFDC/TANF payments, and Food Stamp benefits are available for 
 all members of the FTP and AFDC groups. The administrative data cover 
 at least four years after random assignment for each member of the report 
 sample. The follow-up period is illustrated in Figure 1.3.

 2. The four-year survey and child 
 impact samples. Data from the four-year client survey are used 
 throughout the report to examine topics that cannot be addressed using 
 administrative records. As illustrated in Figures 1.3 and 1.4, the“fielded 
 sample”for the four-year survey is a subset of the report sample, 
 including all 2,160 individuals who were randomly assigned between August 
 1994 and February 1995 (nearly 80 percent of the report sample). The survey 
 firm was able to locate and interview 80 percent of the fielded sample—a total of 1,729 people. This group is referred to as the four-year 
 survey sample. 

As noted earlier, all members of the four-year survey sample 
 completed a core set of questions, whereas only those with a child between 
 5 and 12 years old completed the special child impact modules. As illustrated 
 in Figure 1.4, this group, which includes 1,108 people, is referred to 
 as the focal child sample . It is used 
 in Chapters 5 and 6, which explore FTP’s impacts on children in 
 eligible families. (A limited number of child-focused questions were asked 
 of all survey respondents, referring to all of their children. Thus, some 
 sections of the child analysis include all children who were under 18 
 years old at the time of the survey interview.)

 3. The time-limit samples. Chapter 7 focuses specifically on the 237 FTP group members in the report 
 sample who reached the time limit and had their welfare benefits canceled. 
 Baseline data and administrative records are used to examine this entire 
 group, and the 136 of them who responded to the four-year survey are examined 
 as well.

Finally, as noted earlier, MDRC attempted to conduct four 
 interviews, at six-month intervals, with a subset of the people who reached 
 the time limit. As discussed further in Chapter 7 and Appendix F, MDRC 
 attempted to interview everyone who reached the time limit during two 
 specific calendar periods—November 1996 through May 1997 for those 
 subject to a 24-month time limit, and June 1997 through February 1998 
 for those subject to a 36-month time limit. In all, 89 people were identified 
 to have received their final welfare checks during those periods, and 
 70 of the 89 agreed to participate in the study by completing an interview 
 around the time their benefits expired. Of the 70, a total of 57 completed 
 the six-month follow-up interview, 49 completed the 12-month interview, 
 and 54 completed the in-depth 18-month interview (43 of the 54 interviews 
 were completed in time to be included in this report’s analysis).

 4. Subgroups. In addition 
 to assessing FTP’s impact on the report sample (or the four-year 
 survey sample) as a whole, the report also examines whether FTP’s 
 impacts differ for specific subgroups within those samples. Often, overall 
 results mask the fact that a program works differently for different types 
 of people. As discussed in Chapter 3, this report focuses mainly on subgroups 
 defined by the sample member’s risk of becoming a long-term welfare 
 recipient.

 III. The Context for FTP’s Implementation

In considering the broader applicability of the FTP experience, 
 it is important to understand the unique context in which the program 
 operated. This section describes the economic context, the welfare reform 
 environment, and FTP’s implementation schedule, and then it discusses 
 how these factors may affect the evaluation results.

A. About Escambia County

Escambia County is located in the panhandle region in northwestern 
 Florida, along the Alabama border. As Table 1.5 shows, Escambia is a mid-sized 
 county by Florida standards. It has a relatively large nonwhite population, 
 a fairly low median household income, and a poverty rate that exceeds 
 the state and national averages. Nearly one-fourth of the county’s 
 population lives within the borders of the largest city, Pensacola. 31  

In general, the breakdown of employment by sector is similar 
 in Escambia County and the State of Florida. The key difference is that 
 a much larger fraction of the Escambia County workforce is employed by 
 the government; there is a large U.S. Navy facility in the county. 32  There is also a large tourism industry, which generates many seasonal 
 jobs.

FTP was implemented in a healthy economic climate. Escambia 
 County’s unemployment rate was generally similar to or below the 
 state and national rates throughout the period of FTP’s implementation.

B. Implementation Schedule

FTP was implemented very quickly, with little time for 
 advance planning. As shown in Figure 1.5, pilot operations commenced just 
 10 months after the enabling legislation passed, and only 3 months after 
 Escambia was selected as an FTP pilot county. This meant that local planners 
 had little time to assemble the multi-agency structure needed to deliver 
 FTP’s enhanced service model, and, in fact, some key pieces of the 
 package were not in place when the first members of the report sample 
 were randomly assigned (disc ussed further in Chapter 
 2).

 Period

In addition, the study’s focus on early enrollees 
 means that the analysis targets people who entered FTP long before anyone 
 in the United States had reached a time limit. Staff reported that many 
 of these early enrollees expressed skepticism about whether the time limit 
 would really be implemented as designed (some staff also expressed uncertainty 
 on this point).

C. Welfare Reform and Welfare Caseload Patterns

FTP has been implemented during a period of extraordinary 
 change in state and federal welfare policy. As shown in Figure 1.5, about 
 one year after FTP began full-scale operations, the Florida legislature 
 voted to expand FTP to several other Florida counties. The legislature 
 then passed the WAGES act in May 1996, and Congress passed the federal 
 welfare law three months later. Both laws were enacted after highly publicized 
 debates. WAGES was then implemented statewide in October 1996, again with 
 heavy publicity. WAGES is based on FTP, but its policies are stricter 
 in some respects. For example, WAGES includes a 48-month lifetime time 
 limit in addition to the shorter fixed-period time limits (that is, 24 
 months in any 60-month period and 36 months in any 72-month period). In 
 addition, WAGES allows for fewer exemptions from its time limits. Finally, 
 although the implementation of WAGES varies across the state, the program 
 generally does not include FTP’s focus on intensive services and 
 case management.

Figure 1.6 shows that Florida’s welfare caseload 
 declined at an unprecedented rate during the period of FTP’s implementation. 
 After more than doubling in the period from 1989 to late 1993, the number 
 of families receiving cash assistance plunged by 71 percent from January 
 1994 to June 1999. The caseload decline began in 1994, but accelerated 
 after the implementation of WAGES in late 1996. Perhaps because the state 
 caseload reached such a high level in the early 1990s, the rate of decline 
 since that time has been much greater in Florida than in most other states 
 (the national caseload dropped by 49 percent during the same period). 
 The rate of caseload decline in Escambia County from 1994 to 1999 (69 
 percent) was similar to the statewide figure.

D. How the Context May Affect the Evaluation Results

Understanding the context of a program’s implementation 
 is always important in considering the broader applicability of its results. 
 In this case, the unusual context may also have mplications fori whether 
 FTP received a fair test.

 1. The start-up issue. It 
 is never ideal to evaluate a program during its start-up period, because 
 implementation problems are likely to prevent it from operating at peak 
 efficiency. This is particularly likely with a program such as FTP, which 
 was complex and innovative and was put in place very quickly. Indeed, 
 as discussed in Chapter 2, FTP experienced a variety of start-up problems 
 during its early months. In addition, initial skepticism about FTP’s 
 time limit may have reduced the likelihood that recipients would act in 
 anticipation of the limit, for example, by leaving welfare more quickly 
 to save or bank their available months. As a result, outcomes for the 
 FTP group might have been stronger—for example, recipients might 
 have found better jobs or left welfare more quickly—had the study 
 been conducted during a“steady state”period in the program’s 
 operational life.

Florida&apos;s AFDC/TANF Caseload: 1989-1999

 Website (www.acf.hhs.gov). 

 

 2. Welfare reform and the AFDC group. In light of the information presented above, one would have expected the 
 AFDC group to achieve relatively positive outcomes. In other words, in 
 a period of low unemployment and rapid caseload decline, one would have 
 expected many members of the AFDC group to find jobs and leave welfare, 
 even without FTP’s time limit and special services.

Table 1.6 examines this issue by comparing outcomes at 
 the end of the third year of follow-up for the AFDC group in the FTP evaluation 
 and for the program group in MDRC’s 
 earlier evaluation of Project Independence (PI). Conducted in nine diverse 
 Florida counties (but not Escambia), the earlier study randomly assigned 
 welfare applicants and recipients to PI (the program group) or to a control 
 group that was not required to participate in any welfare-to-work services. 
 As a result, the PI evaluation’s program group and the FTP evaluation’s 
 AFDC group were subject to essentially the same rules and received similar 
 services. But the context was quite different: The PI evaluation sample 
 was randomly assigned in 1990 and 1991, in the midst of a recession, when 
 Florida’s unemployment rate and welfare caseload were both rising 
 rapidly.

To make the two samples more comparable, they are broken 
 down into three common subgroups: first-time welfare applicants, applicants 
 and recipients who had received welfare for a cumulative total of less 
 than two years prior to random assignment, and applicants and recipients 
 who had received welfare for two years or more.

The results show the expected pattern: Members of the FTP 
 evaluation’s AFDC group left welfare much more quickly than did 
 members of the earlier PI program group. For example, among those with 
 less than two years of prior welfare, 45 percent of the PI program group 
 was receiving welfare three years after random assignment. The corresponding 
 figure for the FTP evaluation’s AFDC group was only 18 percent. 
 The rates of UI-covered employment are also higher for the FTP evaluation 
 AFDC group, although only modestly so.

The relatively high rate of employment and the very rapid 
 pace of welfare exits for the AFDC group represent a high hurdle and suggest 
 that FTP might have had difficulty generating large impacts. In other 
 words, if AFDC group members were quite likely to find jobs and leave 
 welfare without FTP, the program would probably have a more difficult 
 time making a difference.

Nevertheless, if the unusually strong AFDC group outcomes 
 were driven solely by external factors, such as the strong economy, there 
 is no reason to believe that FTP did not receive a fair test. If, on the 
 other hand, the AFDC group was affected in part by the publicity and community 
 discourse generated by FTP, then the study might not capture FTP’s 
 full impact. Similarly, if the AFDC group’s behavior was affected 
 by the state and national welfare reform debates, or by the implementation 
 of WAGES in Escambia County, then that group may not truly represent outcomes 
 under the pre-welfare refo rm AFDC/PI program.

MDRC’s monitoring of the random assignment process 
 indicates that local staff were quite diligent in maintaining the integrity 
 of the experiment; that is, few, if any AFDC group members were erroneously 
 enrolled into FTP. Nevertheless, data presented later in the report indicate 
 that the AFDC group is not totally“pure”—that its 
 outcomes have almost certainly been influenced by welfare reform to some 
 extent. For example, as discussed in Chapter 2, survey results indicate 
 that a minority of AFDC group members believed, erroneously, that they 
 were subject to a time limit on welfare receipt. Similarly, there is some 
 evidence that the AFDC group’s patterns of employment may have been 
 affected by WAGES late in the follow-up period. 33  

 3. Did FTP receive a fair test? The data presented above suggest that the evaluation represents a conservative 
 test of FTP’s impacts—that the program’s impacts might 
 have been larger if the AFDC group had been completely unaffected by welfare 
 reform and if the study had not been conducted during FTP’s start-up 
 period. This is likely to be particularly true during the latter part 
 of the follow-up period, after WAGES was implemented.

Nevertheless, the weight of the evidence suggests that 
 FTP received a fair test overall. Evidence presented in Chapter 2 shows 
 that FTP and AFDC group members had dramatically different experiences 
 while on welfare. FTP sent a sharply different message and provided different 
 services than the traditional program. If the program’s message 
 and services truly affected participants’outcomes, this would have 
 been reflected in program impacts.

Additional evidence can be drawn from county welfare caseload 
 data. As will be discussed in Chapter 3, FTP generated no impact on cash 
 assistance receipt in the first two years of the follow-up period (roughly 
 corresponding to the period from mid-1994 to mid-1996); that is, until 
 people began reaching the time limit, the FTP and AFDC groups had similar 
 rates of cash assistance receipt. If FTP actually generated a large decrease 
 in welfare receipt that was not measured because of AFDC group“contamination,”one would have expected Escambia’s caseload to decline much faster 
 than other counties’caseloads during this period. After all, until 
 early 1996, Escambia was the only county in the state implementing a mandatory 
 FTP program, and it is hard to believe that the publicity generated by 
 Escambia’s program dramatically influenced welfare caseloads throughout 
 a very large state.

Table 1.7 examines this issue by showing welfare caseload 
 figures for selected Florida counties during the first two years of FTP’s 
 implementation (the table includes all counties with at least 1,000 families 
 receiving assistance in February 1994). The third column shows the percentage 
 decline in the welfare caseload in each county from February 1994 (when 
 FTP began operating on a pilot basis) to February 1996; several other 
 counties began operating FTP programs shortly thereafter. As the table 
 shows, the Escambia caseload decreased somewhat faster than the state 
 average during this period. However, other mid-sized counties that were 
 not implementing FTP experienced caseload declines that were similar or 
 larger than Escambia’s. Although far from definitive, this pattern 
 suggests that FTP probably did not generate a large 
 impact on welfare caseloads in its early years of operation.

 IV. The Contents of This Report

The report is organized as follows: Chapter 2 summarizes 
 and updates the findings on FTP’s implementation, focusing on the 
 key factors that distinguished FTP from traditional AFDC (this is known 
 as the“treatment difference”). Chapter 3 uses administrative 
 and survey data to describe FTP’s impacts on the employment and 
 public assistance receipt patterns of eligible individuals. Chapter 4 
 uses survey data to examine FTP’s impacts on material well-being, 
 household income, and other issues. Chapters 5 and 6 discuss FTP’s 
 impacts on the well-being of children in eligible families. Chapter 7 
 describes results from the post-time-limit survey, and Chapter 8 describes 
 the results of the benefit-cost analysis.

 1 A second county, Alachua, also began implementing 
 FTP in 1994. That program, a voluntary version of FTP, was phased out 
 beginning in 1996. Several other counties also briefly implemented FTP 
 in 1996. ( back ) 

 2 Florida implemented the statewide Work and Gain 
 Economic Self-Sufficiency (WAGES) program in October 1996. In 2000, WAGES 
 was merged with the state’s workforce development system. ( back )

 5 The term“cash assistance”in this report 
 refers to the benefits previously provided under AFDC and currently provided 
 under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The term does not 
 refer to other public assistance programs, such as Supplemental Security 
 Income (SSI), that also provide cash benefits. ( back ) 

 6 This report uses feminine pronouns because the overwhelming 
 majority of the sample members are women. ( back ) 

 7 AFDC rules and 
 policies were in place in Escambia County prior to the implementation 
 of FTP. These rules also applied in the rest of the state (except for 
 the other FTP pilot counties) until the implementation of WAGES in October 
 1996. The rules also applied to the AFDC group for the FTP evaluation 
 until late 1999, when the demonstration ended. ( back ) 
 
 8 Under the Family Support Act of 1988, states were required 
 to provide transitional child care assistance and transitional Medicaid 
 coverage for one year to certain recipients who lost eligibility for assistance 
 due to earned income. FTP extended transitional child care for a second 
 year and also broadened eligibility to include people who withdrew from 
 welfare voluntarily after finding jobs (even if their earnings did not 
 make them ineligible for assistance). PRWORA ended the transitional child 
 care requirement, although states may choose to continue this policy. ( back ) 
 
 9 Under AFDC rules, recipients with a child under age 
 3 were not required to participate in Project Independence, Florida’s 
 welfare-to-work program. Under FTP, this exemption was narrowed to recipients 
 with a child under 6 months old. ( back ) 
 
 10 Until June 1997, sanctions for both the FTP and AFDC 
 groups involved reducing the welfare grant. Beginning in that month, both 
 groups became subject to“full family sanctions”that eliminate 
 the entire grant, at least temporarily, in response to noncompliance. ( back ) 
 
 11 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1997. ( back ) 
 
 12 All data on state time-limit policies were obtained 
 from the State Policy Documentation Project, administered by the Center 
 on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Center for Law and Social Policy. ( back ) 
 
 13 Seven of the states with no termination time limit 
 have reduction time limits (Arizona, California, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, 
 Rhode Island, and Texas). Some of these states have pre-TANF waivers in 
 place that supersede the federal time limit rules (until the waivers expire). 
 Michigan and Vermont have no time limit. ( back ) 

 14 The time limits of less than 60 months that are not 
 lifetime limits are“fixed period”time limits that limit 
 families to a certain number of months of benefits in a longer calendar 
 period—for example, 24 months in any 60-month period. In 1996, 
 Florida imposed, statewide, both fixed period time limits that resemble 
 FTP’s (24 months in any 60-month period for some recipients and 
 36 months in any 72-month period for others) and a lifetime time limit 
 of 48 months. FTP included no lifetime time limit. The other five states 
 with lifetime time limits of less than 60 months are Connecticut (21 months), 
 Arkansas (24 months), Idaho (24 months), Utah (36 months), and Georgia 
 (48 months). ( back ) 

 15 In early reports in this study, the FTP group was 
 referred to as the“program group,”and the AFDC group was 
 called the“control group.”( back ) 

 16 The study can only assess differences that emerge 
 after people were randomly assigned to the FTP and AFDC groups. Because 
 the random assignment occurred when people applied for welfare, there 
 is no way to determine whether the program affected the number of people 
 who took this step. However, because random assignment occurred early 
 in the application process, it can determine whether FTP affected the 
 number of applicants who completed their application and began receiving 
 benefits. ( back ) 

 17 FTP officially ended on December 1, 1999, when individuals 
 in the FTP and AFDC groups became subject to WAGES rules. However, distinction 
 between the groups began to blur in September 1999, when AFDC group members 
 were informed that they would become subject to WAGES in December. ( back ) 

 18 )FTP began operating in February 1994 with a small-scale, 
 three-month pilot. Random assignment and full-scale operations began in 
 May. ( back ) 

 19 In order to control the flow of people into FTP, only 
 a portion of those showing up for recertification went through the random 
 assignment process initially; the rest remained subject to traditional 
 AFDC rules. Specifically, from May to August 1994, 30 percent of those 
 appearing for recertification were randomly assigned. Beginning in August, 
 one-half of those showing up for recertification were randomly assigned, 
 and, beginning in December, all recipients went through the process. The 
 pace of random assignment was then slowed from March to November 1995. ( back ) 
 
 20 This exemption applied only to children conceived 
 before the mother entered FTP. A recipient screened out initially for 
 this reason, however, would likely be randomly assigned at a later recertification 
 appointment. ( back ) 

 21 A third form was used to collect contact information 
 for a later survey. ( back ) 

 22 Because precise records were not kept of the individuals 
 who were screened out, it is impossible to determine the size or characteristics 
 of this population. ( back ) 

 23 In addition, it is important to note that most other 
 Florida counties did not impose time limits until late 1996, when the 
 statewide WAGES program started. Thus, if a member of the FTP group left 
 Escambia County before that point and began receiving welfare in another 
 county, she was no longer subject to a time limit (unless she later returned 
 to Escambia County). After WAGES was implemented, however, an FTP group 
 member’s clock“followed”her into any district in the 
 state. Similarly, an AFDC group member who moved out of Escambia County 
 after late 1996 would have been subject to the WAGES time limit (starting 
 with month 1) if she started receiving cash assistance. ( back ) 

 24 As expected, 
 relatively few sample members—about 17 percent—were employed 
 at the point of random assignment. ( back ) 
 
 25 On another question (not shown in the table), 21.3 
 percent said that they“prefer not to work so they can take care 
 of their families full time.”The question shown in the table asked 
 respondents to express their preferences among the five activities. Apparently, 
 some people would prefer training or some other activity—but not 
 full-time work—to staying home full time. ( back ) 

 26 The largest case file review was in mid-1996, when 
 just over 200 sample members’cases were examined. ( back ) 

 27 The two-year survey was targeted to 750 people randomly 
 assigned between December 1994 and February 1995. ( back ) 

 28 Most of the individuals targeted for that survey 
 were randomly assigned in February 1995. ( back ) 

 29 Two of these individuals were dropped from the impact 
 analysis because of data problems. ( back ) 

 30 Results for the two-parent cases—who accounted 
 for about 11 percent of the cases randomly assigned from May 1994 to February 
 1995—are shown in Appendix B. ( back ) 

 31 Pensacola’s population is about 60,000, but 
 the population of the metropolitan area (which is only partly in Es-cambia 
 County) is about 378,000. ( back ) 

 32 The wages of federal government employees do not appear 
 in the UI wage records used in this analysis. However, the wages of individuals 
 working at a military facility for a private contractor would be included. ( back ) 
 
 33 This discussion focuses on the AFDC group, but some 
 staff believed that the implementation of WAGES also affected the behavior 
 of the FTP group. Prior to October 1996, FTP was seen as“tougher”than traditional AFDC owing to its mandates and time limit. After that 
 point, FTP started to be seen by some as more generous and service-rich 
 than WAGES. This may have motivated some FTP participants to take fuller 
 advantage of what the program had to offer. ( back )
