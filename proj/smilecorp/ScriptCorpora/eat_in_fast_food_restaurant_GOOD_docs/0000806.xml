Same favorite place - now with frills!
 
I’ve been eating lunch at“La Taqueria,”almost daily, for three years now. The myth will now be legend.

Taqueria La Mexicana has expanded both its space and its menu. This favorite local“hole in the wall”for authentic“cheap eats”now includes a higher-end dinner menu and a full bar.

You can still order your favorite foods and juice from the“taqueria”end of the space, but, now you can enjoy them in the vibrant new restaurant and cantina space, with 99 other people ordering margaritas and beers to wash down their tasty dish.
 
Dishes I tried:
 
Pork Taco Plate
 
 5.0 star rating           
 
Comes with rice and refried beans. This is one of my favorite dishes. Put a little hot sauce on each taco and wash it down with a mango juice.

This is a no-frills kind of place with really great, cheap Mexican food. As far as I can tell, the tortilla shells are homemade, which already is enough to set this place WAY above most Mexican places I’ve been to in Boston.

Great for Catering!
 
Roberto catered a party for us for 60 with fabulous food. He helped us choose the menu and made some off-menu veggies for us when we requested that. The chicken mole was a big hit. The food was delicious and plentiful. The price could…

Wow
 
Excellent Mexican food and right in the neighborhood. Not great seating or ambience, but its so cheap it&apos;s probably cheaper to eat here than cook for yourself. The people who work there are so nice and the food is simply delicious.…
