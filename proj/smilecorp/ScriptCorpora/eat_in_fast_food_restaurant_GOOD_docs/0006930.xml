Maybe I just like those indie type movies because the theaters at the Embarcadero Center Cinema are not state of the art.
The theaters aren&apos;t big but they&apos;re not too small either (like the Lumier) It&apos;s clean here, the snacks are pricey and the people are sometimes aloof but those are all secondary to the main event.
Typically I see films here that make me feel depressed about life or maybe a little cheery about being different but that&apos;s the indie movie agenda, isn&apos;t it?
I can&apos;t recall I went to this theater with another person, shit does that make me one of those people who sees movies alone? I guess I have a new identity now.

I really would like to love this place, but can&apos;t. I think their larger screens may be ok, but please (please, please!) do something about those freaky bright green exit signs.

Another reviewer mentioned the dim worn out projectors. Maybe that&apos;s part of the problem. I dunno. I just recall wanting to walk out of Malick&apos;s &quot;Tree of LIfe&quot; when, during the one of most the beautifully shot Cosmic sequences ever made, my eye was drawn to the freakin green exit sign - it was so much brighter than the movie - talk about your existential angst. Hey Malick! Ya wanna get a good angst reaction?  Ask Sean Pean to step inside this theater and watch his performance being overwhelmed by the specter of the bright Bright Green Exit. Aaaaaaahhhggg!

Ok, maybe I over reacted. Nobody knew. These were merely thoughts. Tried to invoke the spirit of the late great Don LaFontaine: &quot;In a world of Green Exit Sign, nobody can hear you scream.&quot;

So, yesterday, I thought I&apos;d try to watch &quot;The Artist&quot;. In beautiful Black&amp;White. Fortunately, in 4:3 aspect ratio. Far enough from the green sign, right? Maybe if I try to ignore it. Maybe if I hold my hands up like blinders on a horse. Wait a sec - did I just miss a plot point? I am soooo out here!

Thank goodness for the Embarcadero Center Cinema!

This isn&apos;t one of those super cinemas with stadium seating, large screens showing 3D movies and a sound system that will not blow your eardrums out.  For that head to the nearby AMC or Century cineplex.

This theatre shows mostly foreign, artsy and independent movies, has validated parking, pretty decent popcorn and attracts a crowd that knows how to behave while watching a movie - no loud talking, no texting, no phones ringing, no folks munching on smelly food brought in from outside.

This may not be the most hi-tech experience, your view of the screen may be partially obscured by someone with big hair and the seat may not resemble a barcalounger, but I&apos;m willing let all of that go for a pleasant, hassle-free movie viewing experience.

Plenty of restaurants and retail stores are nearby as well as a wine bar and a few sports bars/pubs.  Parking  with validation is downright cheap at night or on the weekends, if none can be found on the surrounding streets.

So glad places like this still exist - a nice, quiet cinema that plays indie movies and is relatively clean and comfy.  Its location also makes it a nice respite for a long lunch/afternoon playing hooky movie experience.

I appreciate that they play Movies that main stream theaters do not. But just be warned that the weekday parking validation means you still pay $8.

This theater is awesome purely for the fact that they were showing Pariah. I&apos;ve been wanting to see this movie ever since I saw the trailer attached to another film. If you&apos;re into queer cinema, go check it out. The movie was fantastic. After the film was over, some girl tried to flirt with me because she saw me come out of the same film. She was hot...so another 5 stars for random flirtation since being femme means I usually blend in with the straight chicks. Woohoo! :P

Lesbian tip for meeting women outside of the bars and clubs: go check out an independent film, preferably with a queer theme.

It&apos;s always wonderful to find a theater that shows independent films. I love the major blockbusters but there&apos;s enough places that cater to that. I also love the fact that this theater doesn&apos;t get crowded, it&apos;s clean, and there&apos;s tons of good food options nearby. Also very easy to get to on BART. It&apos;s just a short walk away from the Embarcadero station.

What&apos;s better than going to a top-billed film at a mainstream SF movie house on a Saturday night?

For me ... just about anything.  Clearly, this opinion is not shared by thousands of other folks, so I&apos;m not hatin, I&apos;m just stating a preference.

I&apos;d rather have my fingernails pulled off one at a time.

The Embarcadero is filled with enthusiastic movie-goers, just fewer of them.  And they keep their enthusiasm on the inside whilst seated in the darkened room.  I like that.  Maybe the joint induces this, like a structural tonic for relaxed viewing.

I&apos;ve not been here in a long time, but I can say with certainty that the distance between last weekend and when I go again is going to be measured in weeks, not years.  Fuzio the pasta restaurant is just across the way for a little supper and cocktails before.  The light fantastic is downtown or the F building or North Beach - all just a short stroll away.

Saturday night I saw &quot;The Skin I Live In&quot; with A. Banderas and others.  You like the psychological thrillers, twists of plot equal to Waters or Lynch (without the saturation of LSD)?  Then you really should go see this movie.

One of the best I&apos;ve seen in quite some time.

There you be.  A tip for the theatre and the film to partake once you&apos;re there.

Enjoy.

This is a great movie theatre - they have tons of awesome art house and indie films.  The location is great for after-work - even if you&apos;re going from the East Bay to SF (take BART!).  The popcorn is awesome.  The seats are comfortable. The staff are all lovely.  There&apos;s just not a bad seat in the house in any of the theatres and I never hear bleed-through like I do in some theatres (Piedmont comes to mind).

I saw &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; tonight as a special Frameline member presentation - we were busy with our lemon drops at Fuzio so got in late and ended up sitting right in the front - it turned out not to be too bad and none of us got neck aches so I count the whole evening as a &quot;win&quot;  :)

If you want to know what&apos;s up in the independent movie world - stay tuned to Embarcadero Center Cinema.

This cinema regularly showcases poignant independent movies and does so efficiently. It&apos;s located in a relatively quiet area - so you get a nice mellow crowd and while some screenings may occasionally have a line forming outside of it - once inside -you&apos;ll usually find a plethora of room and well cleaned movie watching facilities.

This place lacks the unique character and charm of The Castro and The Roxie - but it still manages to bring great cinema to San Francisco on a consistent basis with efficiency and with a good attitude.

Trust.

I&apos;m always really excited when a film I want to see is playing here, which is actually very often. On average, I&apos;d say the Embarcadero&apos;s selection of films is usually half foreign. Plus, a lot of the SFFS selections play here too.

I&apos;ve been to so many theatres that are way overdone and commercialized (think Metreon.) But I&apos;ve also seen a lot of facilities that are out-dated and not taken care of. Embarcadero falls in the perfect in-between spot. It&apos;s taken care of, but the theatres are not large and imposing.

Showings here feel so intimate. I think the general fray of people who come here help to contribute to that. Since it&apos;s kind of tucked away around fidi, I think a lot of people don&apos;t make a point to come over. But if that&apos;s the case, they&apos;re missing out.

Another cool thing: vegan sausage at concessions! And if i&apos;m not mistaken, there might also be alternative baking company cookies. If they could only switch out some of the plastic honest tea bottles with mango white acai...now that&apos;d be a party.

The location of this theatre is great for a Friday night stroll. However, we just finished watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi at the Embacadero, and then we were nauseated at the whiff of the men&apos;s bathroom located right next to the entrance.

The women&apos;s bathroom was not much better. At least the theatre should have had the decency to close the door so that smell would be contained.
I like the movies that are shown at this theatre, but I pay for the whole experience, and this one was just completely unappetizing.

This place has gone seriously downhill in the last year or two.  Projection and sound are getting sloppier all the time (in the years I&apos;ve gone here, the projection and sound has gone from pretty uniformly good to being atrocious about 50% of the time).  The projection is increasingly dim (they either aren&apos;t replacing the bulbs or they&apos;re turning the power down to save a few dollars) and the sound is increasingly muddy.  Speakers short out.  It&apos;s clear nobody&apos;s taking care of the equipment.

You should avoid any movie in Theater #3 because the screen is damaged and marred, so there&apos;s a huge blotch in the middle of the left half of the screen, visible and distracting in all but the darkest scenes.

At some point, they stopped caring if the movie experience was any good at all.  It&apos;s an unfortunate loss for independent and foreign film fans in San Francisco.

SERVICE:
Ah, not main-stream theatres, more personable workers, and where it&apos;s not so busy so they can recommend and talk about the movies with ya

ATMOSPHERE:
On the higher floor of Embarcadero shopping center, nice area, kinda dead at night... or in general it&apos;s usually dead right? But I like the area, and architecture uniqueness of the shopping center. The ground floor has some restaurants like OSHA or that other one on the rooftop level above OSHA. Also some other good restaurants that are in the area, so it&apos;s good for dinner + movie combo. The theatre itself, is comfortable, reminds me of an indie theatre but with better facilities. Movie screen is a little smaller thought, only 12 rows total.

Good amount of street parking after 6.
Seating was good, non-smelly, ample cushion and leg space.
And of course, the sweet indie movies they play here..

Easy to get lost in the maze of stairs and corridors though.

It may not be the fanciest schmanciest theater in town, but it has a lot of things going for it.

1) It is in the financial district and offers 5:30&amp;5:45 movies at a matinee price.  This means I can skip over after work and still be home in time to get some stuff done around the house and get to bed at a decent time on a school night.

2) My boyfriend does not work in the financial district so the validated parking (free for 4 hours after 5 M-F and after 10 am Sat-Sun) means that he can come meet me and then drive us home after!

3) They show independent films

4) It is an older crowd so I have yet to have the &quot;chatty teenagers in the back causing a ruckus&quot; problem at this theater

Every year, thousands of people with a vision and a talent for making films create amazing works of art that the mainstream, common moviegoer never sees; Hollywood movies and the like, with millions of dollars in budget and advertising, make sales in the dozens of millions of dollars, whereas independent films are blessed if a thousand people see it.

Came here the other week to watch &quot;The Whistleblower&quot; and I can&apos;t say I was overly impressed. The theater rooms themselves are fairly small. And after an hr and a half, my butt REALLY hurt from the not-so-comfortable seats.

They have a parking garage downstairs which, like most parking garages in SF, have really cramped spots. I paid $9 to park about 2hrs but I heard they offer free parking for the first hr if you spend $10 or more at the theater.

They show a lot of indie movies here. All the people working here seem chill, probably because it&apos;s always nice and quiet. Hoorah for uncrowded theaters! The seats aren&apos;t super plush stadium seating or anything, but they get the job done, I guess. For all you drivers out there, they validate parking, so be sure to bring in your parking ticket.

Also, they currently have a big box full of free movie posters if you feel like diggin around.

The armrests are immovable.

People who wash their hands should use the dryers to dry their hands instead of the paper towels.

I love Indie movies! I saw &quot;Even the Rain&quot; here last week. An EXCELLENT Spanish subtitled movie that was very inspiring. There were trailers in the beginning but it wasn&apos;t excessive like at normal theatres.

We got there 5 minutes before the movie started and could still find decent seating. The seats are all at the same level but they elevated the screen high enough so that doesn&apos;t make a difference.

There&apos;s street parking too if you drive around a bit! The food is outrageously priced so just bring your own snacks!

If a movie I want to see is screening at several places, I&apos;m most likely to see it here because it&apos;s comfortable and friendly, easy parking and--muy importante--the audio and visuals are consistently fine. They got a fine assortment of snacks, too.

I like these theaters. Sure, they don&apos;t have the comfy seats and lifting armrests that the spanking new Century Theaters have at the Westfield Shopping Centre nor the $6 first-show matinees that the Metreon have.

But the people who come here are... well, civilized. No marauding teenagers playing with their brightly lit, handheld video games as they sling their odorous feet on the seats in front of them. No screaming toddlers wondering out loud why they can&apos;t see &quot;Happy Feet&quot; again. No amorous couples suffering from third-degree burns due to excessive friction with their tongues.

Who you find here are people interested in experiencing a quality film who know... to shut up when the lights go down... not to kick your chair to the rhythm of the Bollywood-style Fandango commercial... not to continuously crinkle their bag of M&amp;Ms throughout the opening scene... not to belch after a tray of Velveeta nachos and foot-long dogs... not to answer their cell phones with &quot;WHASSUP, DOG?&quot; in the middle of the movie... and simply act like grown-ups who know that other people are watching the film in the same room. Is that too much to ask?

I&apos;m so sick and tired of viewers who treat a theater like a big-screen TV in their living rooms. Like Wanda Sykes, I just want to run my car over them...accidentally, of course... back again...and forward again...and back again...and forward again. Did that hurt? Gee, I&apos;m sorry. I think Barbra Streisand had the right idea. Right after sweetly singing how lucky people who need people are, she told a Republican heckler...&quot;SHUT THE F&amp;#% UP!&quot;...Works for me.

This is an art house compared to the other multiplexes and a much needed one in this town. Hell, this is MY art house. Watching films like &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, &quot;Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room&quot;, &quot;The Queen&quot;, and &quot;The Namesake&quot; has been all the more pleasurable thanks to the mature, sensitive audiences who come here. Yeah, I like these theaters...a lot.

My mom is pretty conservative.  She votes for Bush, donated to some Ronald Reagan memorial war ship in Southern California, and hates all that Hillary stands for.  She has a vendetta against Berkeley and San Francisco since she thinks they are the evil liberal cities that stole her children (my seester and I) away from our safe comfortable Southern California suburban life.

My mom and my aunt (her seester-in-law) were up here visiting last January.  Since I had to work, I suggested that they walk around downtown and enjoy shopping and dining and whatnot.  Of course, they end up at the Embarcadero Mall and then decide to go see a movie.  I personally enjoy the more &quot;indie&quot; of the indie movies (i.e. the weird European and Latin movies about priests molesting cats or whatever) whereas Embarcadero plays the more &quot;mainstream&quot; of the indie stuff (think Enron, Supersize Me, Inconvenient Truth, etc), but hey, I knew it was a big step for my sheltered mother.

Me:  What movie did you see?
Momma M:  Ohhhhhhhh.   We see da movie, da movie.  Ees about da gayy, and da gheyy, and da cowboy, and da gaayyy.
Me:  Oh, Brokeback Mountain.
Momma M:  Jes, jes, Broke-beck Mon-ton.  Ees sooooo sed.  Sooooo sed.
Me:  Yeah, I saw it too.  It was very sad.
Momma M:  Sooooooo sed.  Da cowboy, and dey gaaay and dey love eash other, but dey cannot be love.  Dey cannot be love!  Sooooo sed.  Soooooo sed.
Me:  So you liked it?
Momma M:  You auntie and I we go through whole box kreenex.  I cry so mush.  So Mush!!  Soooo sed.
Me:  Well, I&apos;m glad you liked it.  So now do you think gays should be allowed to get married?
Momma M:  Wha?!  Gaays marry?  No, ees not normal.  Ees not riiiight.

Well, thanks Embarcadero Center Cinema for at least making her cry.  Changing her political views, however, might be a more difficult matter.

This cinema is pretty awesome. I watched the GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE here (it&apos;s an indie about call girls). We went to the cinema at about 7:15 and the movie was playing at 7:30. There was a huge line - I guess people wanted to know more about call girls?

They have these kiosks - where you can buy a ticket with a debit/credit card. However, one was broken so everyone was waiting in line. However, I am very smart. So, I went up the kiosk to see if it was really broken. It was. BUT there was a note, in fine print, that said: &quot;There is another kiosk on the other side of the lobby.&quot;

I ran over the other side of the lobby. The kiosk was there. It was unoccupied. I ran over there, paid within a matter of 45 seconds, got my tickets and ran over to my boyfriend, who was still near the end of the line. I triumphantly waved my tickets in his face and said, &quot;I WON, honey, I WON!&quot;

I took his hand and we rushed into the 7:30 screening of the Girlfriend Experience. It was only 7:20. I felt relaxed. There weren&apos;t a lot of people. Good. The seat next to me was unoccupied, and I thought, &quot;great, I can have the arm rest!&quot;
Just then, a guy with a big hiking backpack plopped down on the seat next to me.

He was breathing really heavily. I don&apos;t know why - the movie didn&apos;t even start yet. He smiled at me. A lot. He took the armrest that I was going to use, and his big fat arm was resting there the ENTIRE movie. At times, his fat head seemed to tilt towards my (not-so-fat) head. He would glance over occasionally during some of the funny parts of the movie -- as if to illicit some reaction from me.

I wanted to tell him that this was a movie about call girls -- and that I was not part of the &quot;girlfriend experience.&quot;

Just remember two things when you go to this cinema.
1) look for the kiosks
2) INSIST on sitting in an aisle seat and make a friend sit in the seat next to you

Exceedingly pleasant employees, from the ticket salesman (who actually made eye contact,&amp;seemed genuinely interested in my upcoming enjoyment of the movie), all the way to the clean-up guy after the movie (more eye contact, and a &quot;thank you for coming to our theater.&quot;)  Seriously, is this a co-op?  These people all seem really proud and invested in the good reputation of this theater.  All I can surmise is that the boss treats them well, and that, well, this is a really excellent cinema.

Further arguments to support my 5 stars:
Public-transit friendly.
Specializing in unique/independent films.
Fast-moving concessions line.
Nutritional yeast and other flavor options, offered for your popcorn.
Clean, non-sticky floors.
Standard movie prices ($10.25 on a Friday night)

Fair warning: during showings of movies with political themes (a la Michael Moore), the audience does tend to have a running dialog with the screen.  (You know, lots of pompous hoo-hawing&amp;righteous grumbling, in the confines of a darkened theater surrounded by like-minded peers.  All to be instantly forgotten once the lights come back on.)  Although, something tells me that that&apos;s the case for all such movies shown in San Francisco.

The Embarcadero Cinema has the charm of an independent theater, with movie posters in the lobby, one cashier in the lobby, one snack/espresso bar and five screens.  It&apos;s in the heart of downtown SF, convenient to public transportation with validated parking (free four-hour validated parking after 5 PM Monday-Friday and after 10 AM Saturday&amp;Sunday at any Embarcadero Center Parking Garage, otherwise reduced rates apply).  They usually have postcards and reviews of the current movies in the lobby.

They still show 10-15 minutes worth of previews before the movie begins.  The crowd is usually much older and well behaved but twice I&apos;ve sat right in front of some senior citizen who talked during the movie.  This time it was a woman with a cane (argh).

I like Embarcadero Center Cinema&apos;s movie selection (I recently watched THE READER - an excellent, powerful movie about how secrets can change the course of someone&apos;s life - $8.25 bargain matinee).  Though the comfort of a new, plush chair, surround sound and a massive screen aren&apos;t there, I prefer the smaller screens at the older theaters.

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve purchased anything from the concession stand (except for coffee or soda when I&apos;m tired and need caffeine).  I can sit for two hours without snacking on something and there&apos;s something strange about eating in the dark.

I prefer the CineArts in Sausalito though (free parking, MUCH less crowded, haven&apos;t run into any talkers there yet): http://www.yelp.com/biz/…

If you love watching indie films, this is the place for you. I remember the first time I came here, Ghost in the Shell. Awesome movie at the time and still is.

Last night showing was the Sneak Peak at &quot;Donkey Punch&quot; Just another brilliant bizarre sexy killing thriller that made everyone covering up their eyes. &quot;Intoxicating, a real eye jointing experience!&quot; -Stanley K.

See you at the movies!

Five medium-size theaters with one lobby, built in 1995.

Yes, it&apos;s not a chop job.  This is the original design.  The lobby is small but comfortable, and the ticket crew is very nice.  The films are imports and art, which someone who is hooked on first-run big Hollywood movies may find irritating, but which always include great productions.

We just saw &quot;Mongol&quot; here today, at the Bargain Weekend Price of $8.25 per person.

&quot;I wondered at the last minute whether it would be in English,&quot; my date said.  Well, no, apparently it&apos;s in Mongolian, I couldn&apos;t say for sure, with subtitles.  It&apos;s still a great biographical drama, and now I know who Temujin was:  One tough mofo.  I can see why he forged an empire.

It&apos;s like the &apos;Whole Foods&apos; of movie houses - the movies they screen are good and good for you.

+1 star for Caffe Trieste coffee and IZZE sodapops at the concession stand. FREE 3 hr. parking is icing on the cake.

Sorry, 5 stars are reserved for the neighborhood/classic restored venues.

$10 for a movie?  I admit it, I&apos;m cheap.... err frugal.  You know, I remember when...  (Flash forward 55 years, when I&apos;m bent over and clutching my back).

If I can justify spending $10 at Starbucks in the morning (WTF?), I can justify spending the same on a movie.  Tonight,  I got to meet some very friendly Yelpers, taste some red licorice (not too hard, not too chewy), and sit up straight, with my hands politely folded in my lap, while not worrying about blocking the view of the popcorn crunchers behind me.

Unfortunately, I let the Yelpers see me cry a little near the end.  But, I can&apos;t hide that I&apos;m a crier.  I&apos;m also overly-sensitive and get excited over a lot of little things-which probably drives people crazy.  Oh, I also don&apos;t like to talk about my feelings, I&apos;d rather pretend things are &quot;fine,&quot; and my low self-esteem makes your correctly answering my &quot;do I look fat?&quot; question very important.

Hmm.. I suddenly feel much better.

To sum it up: Going to the Embarcadero Cinema helps you discover who you are inside.

Which is worth $10 and an anti-depressant.

I went to the Embarcadero Cinema intending to see &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; because I love German spy films.  I was about ten minutes late so I ended up seeing the &quot;Queen&quot;, which I enjoyed.  This is no century crazy whatever that new place is called.

You cannot move the armrest up to snuggle with your mate which actually worked to my advantage the other night but that&apos;s another story.  There are no coliseum (I&apos;m having a brain cramp after a 11hour nonstop workday, is that what they&apos;re really called?) seats but what you DO get when you go to the old school, sticky floored movie theater is less previews and better films!

Rah for that!

Artsy fartsy means non-glam movie theater and normally I&apos;m all glam, all the time but I&apos;ll slum for art house any day. . .seriously.  ;  )

First, being that this is my 500th review I thought long and hard of what to review. I had many options/choices..

1The store where the Peter Griffin lookalike was looking at me with that blank stare in the store and yelling at his wife and then looking back at me. I was going to ask him if he wanted a beer or something
2. Update one of my outdoor experiences
3 Do a fabulous BURGER review again(it was good too)but I will let you wonder where I went first.
4...or do something new

Of course,I decided on number 4,but number 1 would be an awesome story to tell because this dude looked just like Peter Griffin and was clearly..um a little impaired/drunk perhaps.

So I decide on Embarcadero Center Cinema..

I have to give this place 4.5 stars simply because it was a joy to come here and the watch films. Very good films I must add.

If you are a fan of foregin or independent films this place might be worth a try to see a film.

Easy location..located in the Embarcadero Center on the top level. You can catch bart,bus it or drive. I believe there is a parking lot too.

What I liked about this place is the service. When you go in you go to the left and purchase tickets. The guy was super friendly and talked to me about a movie I was interested in seeing. Price&apos;s reasonable.

So after purchasing tickets..sniff,sniff is that popcorn. Well got some popcorn and a drink(good). I believe/think they serve Hot Dogs from Top Dog too.

The people at the snack station were friendly,patient and well the prices for snacks were ok.If you are hungry like me at times you have to get a little snack while watching a movie.

So walking to the left from the snack stationI believe there are 2 screening films on the right and when you turn to the left there are 2 others down the hall. I think so,not quite sure of how many...As for the theatre overall most of the crowd was mostly adults and this is quite a different vibe/experience I got vs when you go to a much larger theatre and with a much younger/larger crowd.I am not saying there is nothing wrong with that,but you do notice the difference. All in all I thought it was nice to finally come here.

I did find the seats comfy,theatre clean,staff helpful and snacks edible.

I would say come here if you are in the area and are interested in foreign or independent films. I am a huge fan of independent films too.

Give it a try.

The experience overall was not bad. Quite nice and relaxing.

Having gone here twice in the last four days.... I like this place.

Positives: Nice selection of art house films, clean theaters and restrooms, will validate parking in the garage.

Negatives: High ticket and food prices (but what theater isn&apos;t?), not the most comfortable seats.

A solid four stars. Now when is the next show?

The Embarcadero Center Cinema plays first-run independent&amp;foreign films almost exclusively. It&apos;s a Landmark Theatre w/ five screens. The other Landmark Theatres in the City are the  Bridge, Clay, Lumiere,&amp;the Opera Plaza Cinemas. So if you like movies like &quot;Persepolis&quot;, Landmark theatres are pretty much your only chance to see them on the big screen before they are available on DVD.

Aside from during children-targeted films, I have never seen kids here. Its financial district location has a lot to do w/ this.

They also have advance screenings of independent/foreign movies, of course.

Yes, I just reviewed this spot two days ago, but I had to give an update due to freakin&apos; awesome customer service from one of the assistant managers named Wayne.

The vegan sausage I had was so good I emailed and asked what the brand was out of curiosity. Wayne replied back, in hours, letting me know the brand (Underdog!) as well an update that they just got in sauerkraut which can be requested at concessions.

On top of that, they keep soy milk in the house for any of their coffee drinks too, and they have nutritional yeast for on top of the popcorn instead of butter. If you haven&apos;t heard of the yeast thing don&apos;t freak, it&apos;s a good flavor alternative to butter and cheese as a topping. Plus it&apos;s called &quot;nutritional yeast&quot; so I like to pretend there is some nutritional benefit.

Wayne even asked me for vegan snacking suggestions as they&apos;ve been working hard to have these options. God I love it when places give a crap, wins me over every time.

Nice job Wayne and Embarcadero Cinema, I&apos;ll be spreadin&apos; the word.

I really like this theater, and I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s not just because I like the movies I&apos;ve seen here.

Good
-There aren&apos;t previews.
-There aren&apos;t children (the yelling variety), given the adult themes in most of the flicks shown here.
-The bathroom is really clean, though still on the wet side, as is every public bathroom in the history of the world.

Eh to Bad
-Serious tweendom-throwback theater lobby.
-Cinema elite; chill out. It&apos;s not cool to get vigilante and yell out rules about cell phones, as obnoxious as those are in movies. Not the theater&apos;s fault, but depending on the movie, it could very well be a part of your experience.

Guess who got the best seat in the house? Me! Well at least that&apos;s what Samsung told me. Little did they know that&apos;s false advertisement when you&apos;re sitting next to rommy g. WHY DO YOU LIE TO ME BLUE SEAT??

But besides that, I like this theater because it shows movies that aren&apos;t mainstream. Other than the movie selection and the blue seats this theater is about as standard as they come.
