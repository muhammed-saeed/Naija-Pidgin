STRATFORD -- A controversial request for a drive-through to accommodate a possible future fast-food restaurant at the site of the former Keating Ford car dealership at 1055 Stratford Ave. was withdrawn at a public hearing Wednesday night.

On the table is a development proposal by the property owner, Gary Genga of Properties of Armando Genga Limited Partnership, to convert the site&apos;s empty buildings into what Nicholas Owen of Sultan Realty Management, who is representing Genga, described as &quot;contemporary, village-style&quot; retail shops. The plan also includes the construction of a free-standing structure to house a restaurant.

About 20 residents turned out to the public hearing, which replaced a July hearing deemed invalid after town officials said the Connecticut Post failed to print a legal notice submitted for publication by the town.

No one from the public spoke in favor of the proposal to develop the parcel, known to locals as Hards Corner , described by members of the public as a &quot;strategic corner,&quot; &quot;cornerstone,&quot; &quot;keystone,&quot; and an &quot;opportunity.&quot;

 Zoning Commission member Robert Galello earned steady applause when he summed up the commissions&apos; major concern: &quot;We want the aesthetics of the Town of Stratford to go up ... and the only way to do it is to increase the value of our town -- not by putting up another drive-up fast food restaurant.&quot;

Midway through the hearing, Owen withdrew the request for a drive-through. But he noted that he may approach the commission about a drive-through in the future if the development is unable to lure a sit-down restaurant.

 George C. Mulligan , whose home borders the Keating Ford property, described the proposal, now stripped of the drive-through request, as &quot;a little bit better.&quot; But he argued that without a concrete roundup of potential tenants, the development plans remain vague.

&quot;As it stands right now, they still could put in an X-rated video parlor,&quot; he said.

In a prepared statement, Mayor John A. Harkins voiced his opinion on the proposal, while noting the property as a &quot;prime site for economic development.&quot;

&quot;Conceptually, I am in favor of utilizing this property for retail development as a means of expanding our grand list and combating blight,&quot; he said.

&quot;I have concerns with the application that is currently pending before the Zoning Commission, though I believe they can be resolved amicably. The plans as they are currently drafted are aesthetically deficient and not designed to attract the quality of retail activity I would like to see as part of redevelopment in the South End.&quot;
