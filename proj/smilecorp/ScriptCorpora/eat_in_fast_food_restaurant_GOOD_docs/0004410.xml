Wagamama - Victoria

Roof Garden Level, Cardinal Place (Off Victoria Street), London, SW1E 5JE
 Things seem to move fast at Wagamama - the Asian inspired, noodle restaurant chain that was started in 1992. As soon as you decide what you want to eat, your order is taken via a PDA, and wirelessly networked to the kitchen, so it can be made fresh and served right after. The restaurant chain does not believe in taking reservations, and all customers are seated on a first come, first serve basis. In fact, be aware that most of the tables are long ones and you will often be asked to share them. 
 The restaurants are modelled on traditional Japanese ramen bars that have been popular for hundreds of years - ramen are Japanese style noodles, served in a meat-based broth, topped with pork, dried seaweed or even corn.

As soon as you decide what you want to eat, your order is taken via a PDA, and wirelessly networked to the kitchen, so it can be made fresh and served right after. The restaurant chain does not believe in taking reservations, and all customers are seated on a first come, first serve basis.

The restaurants are modelled on traditional Japanese ramen bars that have been popular for hundreds of years - ramen are Japanese style noodles, served in a meat-based broth, topped with pork, dried seaweed or even corn. Chilli beef ramen, made of noodles in a spicy pork and chicken soup topped with a marinated and grilled sirloin steak and fresh vegetables, is hearty and satisfying.

Apart from ramen, you could opt for the coconut soup based kare noodles or teppan, cooked on a hot, flat griddle. They also offer many rice dishes like katsu curry, chicken fillet deep-fried in panko breadcrumbs, served with a lightly spiced curry sauce and sticky white rice. Vegetarians are definitely not ignored, as they can opt for saien soba, made using whole-wheat noodles in a soup topped with stir-fried vegetables, seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil and garnished with sliced spring onion.

Meat and vegetable dumplings, skewered chicken, deep-fried prawns and raw salads double as both sides and starters. Steamed green soya-beans, called edamame, go well with drinks - hold them up to your mouth and squeeze the succulent beans from the pod. If you&apos;ve noticed, Wagamama is more about eating healthy food fast and less about the order. Don&apos;t be surprised if you&apos;re served the main course before the side dish - order isn&apos;t important, the aim is, don&apos;t wait - just tuck in and share.

Wash down your meal with sake, plum wine or even a Japanese beer. Wind up your meal with coconut reika - three scoops of dairy coconut ice cream topped with a fresh, tangy mango sauce and toasted coconut flakes or the tamarind and chilli Pavlova, with a crunchy meringue base served with a raspberry and tamarind sauce.

At Wagamama, you can also shop for cookbooks, sauces, ramen bowls and t-shirts. The restaurant is all about enjoying genuine, reasonably priced, Pan-Asian cuisine in a sleek but informal setting.

 REVIEWS OF Wagamama - Victoria 
 
 Natasha Allen (19 June 2009)

Just the mention of Wagamama makes me yearn for their dish, catsu curry - it is wonderful. I am one of those unfortunates who always scan the menu wanting to try something new but then inevitably order my tried-and-trusted favourite dish because I just love it. I then sneak a peak at the person next to me and think, &apos;Oh, that looks great, I&apos;ll definitely order that next time&apos;, but you and I already know I won&apos;t! So, the catsu curry is divine and everything else always looks wonderful. The service is quick, the food is fabulous and the restaurant is full of bustle and chatter. At first I found the &apos;share a table-bench&apos; arrangement a little disconcerting, shy and clumsy oaf that I am! But actually, once you&apos;ve sat down, you barely notice that someone is sitting right next to you, other than to gawp at their meal, that is. The white chocolate and ginger cheesecake is to die for. I highly recommend it. Well, that&apos;s it, I&apos;m going to order the catsu curry to take away now, and just talking about it has made me desperate for it. I&apos;m sure I could squeeze in room for the cheesecake too. Oh, one thing I have found is that around the typical lunch time rush it is very busy, so go on a day your boss is in a meeting, in case you have to wait a little for a table and getting back before your hour is up is just too tight! Enjoy.
