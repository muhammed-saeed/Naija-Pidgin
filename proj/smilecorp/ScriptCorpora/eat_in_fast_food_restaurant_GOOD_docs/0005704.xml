 New Dining Out Habits Mean Increased Demand for Value 
 
 Economic Pessimism Changes Habits 
 
NEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--In April 2010, the Harris Poll® reported that more than two in five (43%) U.S. adults said they feel less secure 
 about their personal financial situation when compared to a year ago. 
 One of the outcomes of this sense of financial insecurity is that many 
 consumers have changed their dining out habits.
 
“Please think about the most recent visit you had to a fast food 
 restaurant chain and your dining experience there.  Howimportant 
 were each of the following when you chose to eat at that fast food 
 restaurant on that occasion?”
 
In fact, both casual dining restaurants and fast food, or quick service, 
 restaurants have experienced the same slow down in the past six months, 
 with 34% and 31% of adults respectively saying they have visited these 
 types of restaurants with less frequency than a year ago. Almost half of 
 Americans (45% and 47%) have respectively visited casual and quick 
 service restaurants at the same level as a year ago. On a more positive 
 note, 13% and 14% say they visited these types of restaurants with more 
 frequency than in the past year.

These are some of the results of The Harris Poll of 2,755 
 adults surveyed between April 12 and 19, 2010 by Harris Interactive. 

 Perceived Value Dictates Restaurant Choice 

Among those who have eaten at a quick service restaurant in the past 
 month, half (50%) said an extremely or very important reason in choosing 
 a particular restaurant was that the prices were in the range they were 
 willing to spend. This attitude is consistent among those who ate a 
 casual dining restaurant with almost half (48%) saying price was an 
 extremely or very important reason for selecting the restaurant.

This attitude is still paramount even among those who have increased 
 their dining out habits. Six in ten diners who increased their visits to 
 quick service (62%) or casual dining restaurants (57%) said prices were 
 an extremely or very important factor when choosing a restaurant. Those 
 who have decreased their dining out habits also hold the same attitude 
 about price - 58% said price was an extremely or very important reason 
 when selecting a quick service restaurant and 57% said price was an 
 extremely or very important reason when selecting a casual dining 
 restaurant.

 Price Dictates Menu Items Ordered 

Consumer’s sensitivity towards price also dictates the selection of a 
 menu item. More than four in ten (44%) quick service and casual 
 restaurant patrons said that the “price fitting into their budget” was 
 an extremely or very influential factor when ordering from the menu in 
 the past month. Price sensitivity is even more influential among those 
 who have increased their quick service restaurant visitations in the 
 past year with almost six in ten (56%) saying price was an extremely or 
 very influential factor during the ordering process. On the other hand, 
 price is less influential among casual restaurant patrons who have 
 increased their visits (42%), as compared to those who have decreased 
 their visits (56%) in the past year.

 So What? 

“While there are some indications that the economy is improving, we 
 still see one third of respondents dining out less than a year ago, and 
 there is a much smaller lift in respondents dining out more often,” says 
 Mary Bouchard, Vice President of Research for the Restaurant Industry. 
 “Regardless of how often they eat out, consumers are now expecting value 
 throughout the dining out experience. Although consumers have shown a 
 tendency over the past few years to move their dining out dollars to 
 lower price, quick service restaurants, any restaurant brand that 
 promotes good value as a reason to dine out and then successfully 
 fulfills consumer demand with price-conscious menu items are more likely 
 to draw a greater share of today’s smaller wallet.”

 Methodology 

This Harris Poll was conducted online within the United 
 States between April 12 and 19, 2010 among 2,755 adults (aged 18 and 
 over). Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and 
 household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line 
 with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score 
 weighting was also used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be 
 online.

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability 
 sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often 
 not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage 
 error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question 
 wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. 
 Therefore, Harris Interactive avoids the words “margin of error” as they 
 are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible 
 sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, 
 random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical 
 because no published polls come close to this ideal.

Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have 
 agreed to participate in Harris Interactive surveys. The data have been 
 weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the 
 sample is based on those who agreed to participate in the Harris 
 Interactive panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be 
 calculated.

 These statements conform to the principles of disclosure of the 
 National Council on Public Polls. 

 The results of this Harris Poll may not be used in advertising, 
 marketing or promotion without the prior written permission of Harris 
 Interactive.
