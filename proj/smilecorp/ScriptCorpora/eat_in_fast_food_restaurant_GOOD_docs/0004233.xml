 18 October 2009 
 Currently I’m riding BART back from the airport. We just returned from a tour of former homes, the wife and I. Last week we visited Washington DC for both a casual wedding reception and to participate in the GLBT community storming the mall.

The first leg of our trip brought us to Salt Lake City, where upon arrival, my dad advised that we be careful because they don’t like our kind there. Nevertheless, they let us use their toilets and buy their frozen yogurts. Next we flew to Baltimore. The timing of the flights warranted purchasing the airplane food seemed like a reasonable idea since we would not land until close to midnight eastern time. Reviewing the menu made me feel like a Californian who is so used to seeing inflated menu prices that paying four dollars for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich seemed like a darn good deal. As an Iowan, I know in my heart that this cost is ridiculous for two slabs of bread, a tablespoon of peanut butter and a squirt of jelly. Aware of this inner conflict, I knew there would be no pizza-ordering upon landing and it would likely be a straight-to-bed affair (even though it would be like nine or ten pacific time), I coughed up the four dollars for the sandwich, four dollars for a sandwich that can only be described as decadent.

Today is nine days later, and I’m taking the time to write about a sandwich that happened many many sandwiches ago. It was just that fantastic. I don’t know what they did to it, but alas the myths of overpriced shitty airline foods, for me, have been debunked.

We watched the movie My Sister’s Keeper, and while the movie was overall mediocre, the wife and I cried through the ending. When the movie turned off, the wife put her arm around me and I snuggled up to ponder life and death, and then I noticed a woman walking down the aisle to the bathroom with a giant grin and staring at us. I wondered what her problem was but didn’t bother discussing it with the wife. The rest of the flight was uneventful, and the movie seemed to waste a good portion of the wait until landing. When exiting the plane, that same woman was waiting for us on the walkway just after the airplane door and the‘ba-bying”flight attendants. This seemed odd, as though I should know this person, but then after the conversation was started, I realized that this was a queer person identifying us as other queer people and therefore desirable people to ask questions about geography. The wife told her how to get into DC and that we were staying in Maryland so we couldn’t share a cab. She and her friend walked off and wife said under her breath“See you on Sunday,”and then it dawned on me that we were probably in town for similar reasons.

The wife’s old work friend picked us up. The friend has a daughter who is seven years-old. The first time I met her was three years ago at a brunch, and while being well-behaved and quiet, she drew a picture of me and the wife, and she drew me with a stick-figure body and an enormous head, which amused me because I had taken some time out of my breakfast to consider how large her head is in comparison to the rest of her. I looked forward to meeting her again. On our ride back to the friend’s house, the friend told us that her daughter recently learned, in preparation for our arrival, that boys can marry boys now and girls can marry girls. Apparently after this revelation, the girl decided that now she wanted to marry her best friend Erica. When asked what happened to her crush on Jeremy, the girl explained that she didn’t know she could marry Erica, and she would prefer to marry Erica. This pleased me so, and I would be interested to hear what Erica’s mother thinks about all of this.

The next day we had a casual gathering of the wife’s friends and the food was delicious and the event uneventful. We moved on to staying with another friend in Virginia who has a fresh baby. Together we all visited the American History Museum and I was disappointed in the general glossing over of the slaughter of Native Americans and token mentions of other minorities while focusing on the tired tales of politicians and wars. I was mildly impressed to see the actual flag that inspired the national anthem and one of George Washington’s outfits was on display. That man had tiny legs.

On Sunday we attended the March for Equality. There were quite a lot of queer folk, and I was pleased to be a part of the fun. I was half looking for the ladies who approached us at the airport to wave, but in the midst of the tens of thousands of queer folks, I did not see them. Being around so many gays in one place, it seemed like I should run into someone I know–anybody–but the only people I recognized were the famous people making speeches at the rally. We were in the process of leaving the rally when Lady Gaga made her speech to the gays. I had thought she might be singing the disco stick song, but instead she screamed into the microphone to Obama“Can you hear me?”–which seemed to me more like a question one would direct to God during a desperate moment. This confused and disturbed me, and we decided she might be high and continued on our way. Nevertheless, it was nice of her to use her celebrity to promote a cause that I also support.

On Wednesday we rode on a bus from DC to Pittsburgh to visit my old friends. A couple weeks before I left my job in Pittsburgh, a consumer had told me and the woman who would take over my caseload a long tale about how awful the world has become because you can’t even ride a Greyhound Bus without risking getting your head cut off by another passenger. We nodded only to drive the conversation forward and move on with our visit, and after we left we laughed about the strange information people present to their case managers. Several days later I was lying in bed listening to NPR, and there was a mention of such incident, and I was immediately humbled and ashamed I had thought dementia and confusion produced such a tale. This was the first time I rode the bus since learning that story. I must admit that this concerned me some. The wife agreed that we could sit as close to the bus driver as possible, hoping that somehow this would keep us safe. Luckily, we landed in the seat immediately behind him, and aside from occasional concerns that the bus driver could also be crazy, I generally did not sense danger. The chicken nuggets from the fast food place we stopped at were probably the most dangerous entity on the bus.

We arrived in Pittsburgh with both our heads, and it was nice to reunite with my work friend S. Immediately I was brought up to speed with what has been happening in the office during the last year, and I yearned for an office environment where I have lots of friends and spend a fair amount of the work day socializing. At my current position, there are nice people at my office and we occasionally chat, but it’s not the same. Part of it has to do with how it’s useful to do work during work time.

Over the weekend we had what was called by my friend S a white-trash weekend. We dined at the $4.99 pizza buffet, which we had done many Friday nights before I left. The buffet has taken a turn for the worst when it decided to cancel Alfredo sauce. They removed the cheese-on-bread, which was quite popular. And their lettuce salads contained lettuce that was dying and filled with despair. Their desserts of brownies and cinnamon rolls and apple streusel pizza, however, remain slightly undercooked, gooey, and full of delicious sin.

Next we attended a professional wrestling match in McKeesport. This was not the sort of wrestling that the boys did in high school that involved starving and jogging the school halls in several sweat-suits to make weight, the kind that use steamy wrestling mats that reek of sweat and incubate fungal creatures that crawl into your skin, the kind that looks like boys wearing earmuffs and batting at each other much like cats boxing at each other with their paws. No, this is the Hulk Hogan sort of wrestling that involve leggings with stars on them, crazy long hair that is not contained by any sort of band, high-fives and/or threats made to the crowd. When we found our seats, S directed us to sit in the back row and not make eye contact with any of the wrestlers lest we unintentionally involve ourselves in the performance. And truly, it was a performance. There were some hints to the audience as to who were to be favored and who was to be booed based on whether or not the wrestler, in his entrance, gave high-fives to the children or if he declined the high-fives and then yelled“I hate children”into the crowd. Watching the drama between the wrestlers and their ladies that escorted many of them into the ring, it occurred to me that these expressions of masculinity and femininity is much like drag for non-queer folk. I was delighted by this connection, but then also ready to leave once one of the bad guys looked like a flaming gay with his glitter robe and feather boa and a gigantic package in his tiny panty-like wrestling outfit. While I heard no obvious remarks from the audience that offended my delicate sensibilities when it comes to gender and its bending, I was a bit disturbed that this display of flamboyance was this wrestler’s way to communicate that he was the bad guy, that the crowd, rather, should be cheering for the wrestler dressed like a clown. Clowns are spooky. The wife and I wanted the gay to win, even though he was cheating by distracting the ref while his buddy body-slammed the clown behind the referee’s back. In the end, the clown triumphed over the gay and the crowd exploded with good cheer and applause. This particular show was a benefit for children, and so there were many children in the audience who seemed to be buying the act. This is understandable since they are children. What amazed us were the adults that leaping out of their seats to trash-talk the bad guys and to high-five the winners. Unfortunately we could not manage to stay until the intermission–two hours of the show was quite enough.

Pittsburgh was rainy and dreary throughout our visit. The traffic continues to be a general clusterfuck and it takes far longer than it should to travel three miles even when traffic is light, but the trees were quite pretty and I tasted a hearty helping of autumn. The town continues to be attractive to me with its personality and its history, and I miss my friends who live there. For once, though, the trip to the airport didn’t feel like doom as it had so many times before - putting the girlfriend back on a plane to fly away from Pittsburgh and driving my sorry ass back into town alone and aching. It was nice to be able to go with her on the airplane this time. Posted by Sam Brighton at 9:45 PM 1 comment:

 Today was a good day. But those damn confidentiality laws makes it illegal to exploit the struggles and successes and breakthroughs of vulnerable people for the purpose of sharing an entertaining story on the internet.

I will say this though: The boneless buffalo wings at the Wendy’s are not worth the $3.99. Okay, I am really trying to stop buying crap during the day when I’m out driving around visiting people. This is difficult because usually I feel stressed and seek comfort and relief through buying fun things to eat. Today I had six appointments scheduled–I missed one due to traffic (and would have been forty minutes late) and canceled another to prevent brain explosion. Still, four visits in one day is a lot. During the few minutes that I was in the office here and there, I was frantically calling people and doing stuff. And this frantic behavior has been ongoing for some time, which has resulted in forgetting to bring home my lunch dishes from work. I take my lunch to work, usually dried soup, and any side-dish such as almonds or dried apples also go in other plastic containers with lids instead of baggies because I end up throwing away the baggies and it seems wasteful. Now my food drawer is overflowing with empty food containers and empty pop cans (which I don’t put into the recycling at work because I want to leave them on our sidewalk at home to support our local homeless can collectors). With all the food containers now at work, there are limited options for containers at home now, and this morning I was forced to agree that I would just have to eat out for lunch today, plus any snack I might need.

So a mircale occurred and I was able to conduct a visit quicker than I anticipated (it seems when you walk in the door and say“I have thirty minutes and then I have to leave”people actually believe you and moderate their chatter, even though you really have forty-five minutes, but you’ve given yourself a lil cushion), and I was at my next visit early. Since it was the first ten minutes of the day that I didn’t have to cram in a phone call or some other form of productivity, I thought it might be fine to go to Wendy’s. While there are selections there that I know and trust, I agreed to be adventurous and try the boneless wings. I like chicken and I like sauce, but I don’t like bones. I don’t like to eat animals that resemble living beings. I don’t like being able to identify the tissues that I am eating–which has been a curse ever since the cat dissection in my anatomy and physiology class. So a boneless chunk of meat covered in sauce pleasantly conceals the origin of my entrée. My assessment is this–if you pay a couple extra dollars at Panda Express, one can get way more chicken plus a bit of rice whereas the Wendy’s boneless wings required a fork, there wasn’t anything to balance the saucy chicken, and the cost was like 50 cents per hunk of chicken. To be fair, I did not get the combo meal, so maybe it’s not fair to complain about balance. While I regret this purchase, I now know for the future that this mistake is not to be repeated.

I never eat at Panda Express anymore, by the way, since it is an abomination and yet delicious. If they served brown rice, then it might be more difficult to resist.

While the moral of the story might be to clear out the damn drawer and bring home all the containers, this did not happen yet again.

 6 October 2009

The wife has returned home from Los Angeles. It was almost midnight before she finally called me last night to check in. Turns out she had slept through my twenty-eight phone call attempts and two text messages. Around 9:30 last night I was annoyed she hadn’t called me back because I wanted to go to bed, and by 10:30 I was pissed, and after eleven I was wondering how long I should wait before I start making panicky phone calls to others. Given time zones, I had decided I would wait until three a.m. before I called my parents because certainly if I hadn’t heard from her by then, something was definitely wrong. While trying to distract my imagination from horrific scenarios that could explain the lack of contact, which is quite out of character, I was trying to focus on Occum’s Razor and had decided she was either a) partying with peers and had left her phone at the hotel b) hooking up with a famous movie star c) she had become deaf and somehow forgot she has a anxious wife at home. And lo, the five o’clock power nap turned into like a seven hour nap.

My heart had been pounding for the last hour of uncertainty, so it was probably okay that I chose not to exercise that evening, and while quite relieved after she finally called, it took another hour to settle my shit down and go to sleep. Today I am tired.

Work is frustrating and busy. But I still like my job.

After work ended, I needed to pick up the wife from the airport. I jacked around at the mall for an hour, and oh how I hate the mall, and had meant to sit at the San Leandro marina and watch the wife’s plan land, since the flight path crosses the bay right in front of the marina. As soon as I pulled into the parking lot, she called to tell me had landed. I was disappointed that I had this brilliant idea so late in my killing of ninety minutes.

When we returned home, a magazine called The Nest was waiting for us in our mailbox, which is apparently presented by“the knot.”And apparently“the knot”has something to do with getting married. The wife registered us with“the knot”during our mad dash to put together a wedding because she wanted to view wedding cakes. So now we have this nasty hetero rag, and it’s quite amusing between it’s profiling of real-life couples who have sex once or twice per week (that’s what they said, I’m not making this up) to showing their“dream houses”that they built themselves because one shouldn’t“settle”for their spouse and neither should they“settle”for their house–so instead they built a giant ugly house. Next they predict your upcoming marriage problems based on what you fought over while planning your wedding. (I would just like to mention that there was no fighting between wife and I during the planning of our wedding–we effectively communicated and negotiated throughout the process–as evidenced by a wedding cake with a chocolate layer and vanilla layer. I guess this proves we will have no marriage problems whatsoever.)

My favorite feature of this magazine, however, was what caught my eye on the cover. It says at the top, above the title,“How to Date Another Couple, pg 21”and I thought“damn, what a progressive and inclusive magazine for newlyweds, respecting the polyamorous folks, very impressive.”Once I settled in for the evening, I flipped to page 21, anticipating that I would soon be reading about the importance of clear communication and honesty, concrete boundaries, and not waking the kids.

No. This was advice on how to be friends with other couples. Like just hanging out - with your clothes on. And I am confused. Why would there be tips for this? Is it really that complicated if you’re not getting naked?

The advice that is offered is this:

Do NOT
a) show off
b) move in on their friends
c) take them home with you on the first date (to avoid the horrors of making them sit on your couch and feel bored)
Do
a) ask questions but not the wrong ones
b) always pay for half
c) wait three days to facebook them

Yuck. I hope this isn’t some sort of nasty magazine subscription. Let it be a one-time fling. Posted by Sam Brighton at 9:34 PM No comments:

The wife is in Los Angeles this evening, and it’s after eight in the evening. She hasn’t returned my phone call, and I can only assume this means she is hooking up with a movie star. When I first heard of this trip, a work-related trip, my first impulse was to invite myself along–no matter what the inconvenience and no matter what the cost. I have lived in this state for over one year and still haven’t visited this magical land where 90210 comes from. While she works her day away, peddling study abroad programs and handing out brochures and candy, I could put on my fanny pack and scout out movie star mansions, perhaps become a contestant on the Price is Right. One look at my own bloated work schedule, however, ended that great idea. Since two of my three appointments canceled on me, I was so pleased to be sitting at my desk all day under artificial lighting instead of lying on the beach and sunning myself from knees to ankles and elbows to wrists.

My appointment that did happen involved touring a day program for one of my folks, a prospective patron of the program. Usually this involves me making sure the facility doesn’t smell like piss and talking funding while the staff seduce my consumer with some sort of snack (often a graham cracker–which I learned in my nutrition class was invented to cure insane people). Today my tour led me to sitting in on the calendar time activity. When it became clear this was an audience-participation sort of situation, I was briefly struck with fear that I would be called upon to talk about months in front of the group. Certainly, talking about my feelings and my humiliating moments to groups of alcoholics on a daily basis for the first year of sobriety has helped me with my public speaking skills, but still, I wasn’t in the mood to walk to the front of the room at stick a magnet that said“February”to the giant magnet calendar. To my relief, they skipped me when passing out the month magnets. After clearing up today’s date, we reviewed the days of the week and all the months of the year, in order. Due to running out of time, for the social interaction activity hour was approaching quickly, they rushed through months October through December and were not as willing to wait for the people who held those corresponding magnets to walk or wheel themselves to the front of the room or to discuss and anticipate the holidays these months contain. And as far as months go, the last three months contain the most exciting of them, and I’m not talking about Columbus Day–which is the only October holiday that staff person wanted to elaborate upon. (Wife says that in Berkeley, that holiday is called Indigenous Peoples Day–right on…) There was a lot of manuevering of wheelchairs–lots of pulling people out of the way, moving them here, then there, often by wheeling them backwards. It has been my understanding the wheelchair ettiquette involves asking the person if they can be moved and to always wheel forward, never backward, no matter how many three point turns this involves. I didn’t say anything because I’m not certain if this is actual ettiquette or if I am stretching to criticize (two weakness–being both overly critical yet not-trusting of my judgement/perspective). The longer I sat there, the more depressing the scene became, and I am not yet certain precisely why this disturbed me. We all operate at different levels, and some of us find spending twenty minutes orienting to time useful, and that’s fine. Perhaps it was the pressure to stay on schedule that made me uneasy. I suppose there could be licensing requirements to spend x amount of time doing y, but it seemed a bit unnecessary to rush the last three magnet-holders. Early into the discussion/lecture about the importance of social interaction, I left to return to my office so I could forget all about it and sing with the radio on my way back.

It’s almost 9:30 and the little lady still hasn’t returned my phone calls–she better be a glamourous movie star for putting me through this concern… Posted by Sam Brighton at 9:30 PM No comments:

 6 June 2009

In all honesty, as much as I promise myself that I will write in my blog more often, I likely will continue to update it every six to twelve months. At least I’m no longer looking for a job and am not afraid of getting googled, so that makes it easier to let loose online.

This is the first night that my wife and I have spent apart in our marriage, and I figured that since we spent sixty to ninety days apart on a regular basis, one night should be fine. But I miss her. Watching The Office just isn’t as funny without her. (She is at a wedding shower/bachelorette party/slumber party. I suggested that she buy the bride-to-be a mardi gras necklace thing with penises all over it, which would be awesome because the bride is a gay, which likely means there isn’t much involvement of a penis, but my wife thought that might be tacky and declined my suggestion. I still think it’s brilliant.)

Since September 16th, 2008 some things have changed. I’m now employed as a case manager and just recently graduated into becoming a permanent employee, which makes me feel better, like that will somehow save me from getting laid off. For now I’ve put the pursuit of a nursing degree on pause (which could change if I get laid off). All the prereqs for most programs are complete, and my GRE scores are good for another four years. No need to rush, and no need to be voluntarily not employed at this time.

At the end of May, girlfriend and I visited Iowa to celebrate my sister’s graduation. One week prior to our trip, we were lying on the beach and decided“what the hey, let’s get married while we’re there.”We had been planning to marry in 2010 so we could save sufficient money for the event and to hold out and see what the California Supreme Court would decide, and luckily we were impatient. We saved quite a bit of money by slapping together a tiny ceremony in less than two weeks, and it was still quite pleasant. Aside from the undesired absence of several of wife’s immediate family members, the day was perfect and happy.

I wasn’t sure how planning the wedding would go over in Iowa. I had heard there were some Iowans who frowned upon the new law, and perhaps it had to do with the economy, but all the vendors to our event were quite friendly. Some of them even said things to convey that they liked gays. The manager at the restaurant declared to us that she had gaydar and could tell that we were gays. The jeweler spoke to us as if all gay people know each other and asked if we knew so-and-so and what’s-her-face and hooked us up with the gay marriage special discount (even though the special had ended a few weeks prior). A man at the bowling alley took the time to share a monologue about how his niece is a gay and he thinks love has to do with two hearts being together. Upon entering more than one floral shop and declaring our need for a bridal boquet and boutineer (when answering the question“how can I help you?”), our statement was responded to with a look of horror and the question“you want this today?”- as if the gays don’t plan ahead. Certainly there’s the joke that lesbians bring a U-Haul on the second date, but the stereotype to rush into commitment doesn’t seem to translate into an inability to schedule events a week into the future. Once we told them our wedding was five days away, then we were greeted with an eagerness to assist. It did seem odd, though, that this happened twice at two different stores.

We married at the botanical gardens under an archway, farmland in the background. My mom knew a judge who has happily been marrying the gays, and it was nice for him to conduct our ceremony. It was a concise five minutes, which leads one to wonder why Catholics have to drag it out for at least an hour. Wife wore a traditional black dress and I a gray suit. Wife’s mom and sister were able to be present, as was my immediate family. We dined at the fanciest restaurant we could find in the Cedar Valley (and finding something fancier than the Olive Garden was no easy task), and we were served by a very tan man, at least very tan for Iowa. Afterward we bowled in our fancy clothes, and I learned that when wearing a suit, my average drops about one hundred points. If I ever go pro, I will keep that in mind. Later wife and I went to the local casino. The casino offered free soft drinks and the hotel room was clean and generally unremarkable. We had a romantic evening of eating burgers and watching“Jon and Kate Plus Eight.”(My sister watches it, so it seemed like a worthwhile watch. And I learned that I do not want eight children.)

As a child, I had always imagined that I would get really drunk and dance on tables when at my wedding reception. As glamorous as that sounds to this day, I’m glad it worked out the way it did in reality.

We have decided to refer to each other as“wife,”though I admit it feels awkward. But technically we ARE married, even if California doesn’t think so, and why should that term be reserved for the straights? Also our last name is now“Brighton”–a combination of our last names, sort of. The person at the social security office was very helpful and pleasant. Hopefully the DMV will be equally smooth. I have my doubts, though. It seems always to be a battle with those monsters. (It’s very likely that the Arizona DMV thinks my license should be suspended. I don’t have a good relationship with that organization.–They have erroneously suspended my license more than five times.)

Upon returning to Oakland, we had a small gathering at a restaurant/bar. Well, wife had a gathering, rather. I missed the entire ordeal due to a work emergency (which truly was an emergency) that lasted past nine in the evening. It was strange talking to my boss on the phone late at night while he was at the bar with my wife. He told me not to go to work the next day, and I was satisfied with this arrangement.

There were leftover cupcakes at the event, and during my unplanned day off, I managed to refrain from getting into the cupcakes. It wasn’t until a middle-of-the-night bathroom break that I devoured the frosting off four cupcakes. I really didn’t mean to do it, and I was reminded of it only when I found the pile of scraps on the counter this morning. It’s easiest to refrain from eating in the middle of the night if we keep only assembly-required food, which usually we do. Posted by Sam Brighton at 12:56 AM 1 comment:

 16 September 2008

To become a licensed driver in the state of California, I have to take a written driving test. Girlfriend picked up the Driver Handbook 2008 for me, and I was delighted to see on the first page the photograph of our governor, the Kindergarten Cop. There’s an ominous shadow on the left side of his face. What a fantastic picture selection.

While it’s nerdy, I look forward to reading the rule book. Giving my driving habits while residing in the state of Arizona, I had the opportunity to take multiple day-long classes about driving rules. While most of it entailed advice such as“be careful”and“pay attention,”I did learn some fun facts about traffic laws. I expect to do the same after reading this book. For instance, in California if you drive“for sight-seeing purposes”to the scene of a fire, accident, or other disaster, you can be arrested! I did not know that!

Yesterday I scheduled my first job interview for a job that pays big money. Then after reviewing the job notice with Girlfriend, I stumbled across a major buzzkill–it’s a part-time job limited to thirty hours a month. The wording was vague and I didn’t catch it the first thirty times I read the job notice. I even had to write a“proposal”in my cover letter. Naturally I assumed if the job is big-time enough to request a“proposal”then it must be a big-time full-time job with benefits. Nope. Pissed.

Last weekend Girlfriend and I went to a dyke dance party. It was actually at a nightclub whereas initially I thought it was a house party (and consequently I was nervous and uncomfortable). California prohibits smoking in bars. It’s sort of amazing to come home in the middle of the night, not smelling bad and not wanting to vomit my guts out. Not even needing to stop on the way home to get a taco.

Speaking of vomiting, I have found a wonderful steep hill in which I can walk up and down. I like to walk up and down six times–it’s a mega hill which results in a super workout, and by the end literally it feels like my brain, heart, and kidneys could all simultaneously explode. The first time I took on this challenge I literally thought I had somehow made my blood pressure so high that I popped my left eyeball open. The logic was related to the stinging and liquid (tears and sweat it turns out) than came from my eyeball area. (Sweat had dripped into my eye, hence the sting. And I’ve never heard of high blood pressure tearing open one’s vitreous humor, but you never know.) Yesterday I learned that eating a breakfast of scrambled eggs covered with red peppers is not an appropriate meal prior to walking hills. On a country road in Iowa, vomiting would not be a problem. After a cross country race, while not appealing, vomiting does happen. But in the middle of the city, when adults are walking children home from the bus stop, vomiting could seem unusual.

My favorite vomit story is as follows: When I worked at the mental health center in Arizona, I was driving back to the office one afternoon. While approaching a stoplight, perhaps¼of a mile ahead, the car directly in front of me began swerving across the center line. Then, the driver’s head appeared outside the driver-side window followed by a cascade of orange chunky fluid onto the road and onto the side of the car. There were about three rounds of this, and then the driver resumed normal driving in the correct lane, stopped at the stoplight, and proceeded as normal. I wished I had been driving with a video camera on the dashboard. This is a story I often think about when I’m trying not to cry because it always makes me laugh.

My dad likes to find good deals and spend little to no money. One current project in which he is engaged is the collection of Coke points (from caps and boxes of Coke products). This means he saves the points from the products he buys, and he takes it a step further by combing through the can-redemption centers. It’s both horrifying and refreshing to call your mother up on Saturday afternoon and hear her say“While I shopped for groceries, your father went digging through the dumpsters at Walmart and Target.”

He has recruited family and friends to save their own Coke points. This has become a good excuse to blow my money on things I don’t need–“buy the twelve pack, do it for Dad”–as if I am doing a good and generous thing. Lil Sis and I have, on several occasions, shared with each other the shame of publicly obtaining points from garbage cans of our own.–I admit that at school and at work trainings I have reached for bottles with red lids. The difference, though, is I don’t“dig”–if I see a point sitting on top of the pile, I will retrieve. It has become such a trained response that to pass a Coke point in the trash is equal to passing a lone crying baby in the trash can.–You can’t just walk by without responding in some way, not if you’re human.

The other day, after I dropped my car off at the transmission store and was walking to the grocery store, I passed a crushed 24-can box in the street. I felt ashamed, but I bent down and pulled off the points (the 24-can boxes have the most points, it’s like two babies), even though there were passing cars, and I sort of felt like a hillbilly, sinking to a new low.

In the end, though, my dad has collected on over $1700 worth of merchandise from the Coke points. Mostly he has purchased golf equipment, but there’s only so much golf equipment, and recently my sister, Girlfriend, and I received free Adidas products. My new shoes are reasonably attractive AND comfortable, two qualities that rarely appear simultaneously in a shoe. This was useful when hauling my belongings back and forth from the car to the motel room and then back again. While leading to moderately embarassing moments, the points can pay off.

Right now I’m sitting on the couch debating between watching the movie Clueless and the movie When a Man Loves a Woman. At the moment, Clueless is winning given its light-hearted flavor, although the commercials for the other movie involved an ad for some sort of powder you pour into your water, and the powder magically will make you lose weight. The commercial featured two cartoon humans and one cartoon dog sitting on the couch. The man cartoon lost weight by switching to Diet Cola, the dog lost by switching to water (which makes one wonder what the dog had been drinking before), and the woman couldn’t lose weight with water, but did so when she added the powder. Then, I promise, the fine print at the bottom of the screen stated that“Cartoons lose weight easier than people.”Other sentences were there too, but it went away too quickly.

The movie When a Man Loves a Woman is perhaps the only movie where, depending on my mood or state in life, I can start sobbing thirty minutes in and cry for the rest of the movie or I can be annoyed with Andy Garcia the entire time and not be able to finish it.

The commercials for Clueless advertise Barbie and the Diamond Castle dvd. I assume I am not the target audience.

Tonight is pizza night, and I am looking forward to eating pizza. I have not eaten pizza in well over a week. Girlfriend and I agreed that Friday is eat-at-restaurant night in effort to conserve money and to make eating at restaurants a special occasion. For dessert I whipped up a little something that contains two different flavors of pudding and graham crackers. It is taking every ounce of restraint not to get into the dessert before she gets home. It is just so goddamn delicious.

Tomorrow evening we are committed to attend a party in“the city,”and at the party there will be dancing and dykes. I have not been to a non-sober party with dykes since college. I don’t even smoke anymore. I fear I will not know what to do with myself. Posted by Sam Brighton at 12:29 AM No comments: 7 September 2008

It’s later now and last night we arrived to our destination, one day later than originally scheduled. It was my intention to update the highlights as the trip progressed, but internet time in the motels amounted to unloading the crap from the car, showering the filth that had accumulated from sweating in a car, climbing into bed, sleeping, then waking and loading the car and starting all over again.

From Arkansas to present, I have been suffering from some sort of ailment. To call it a“cold”seems to minimize the true misery that I felt, and it made me consider that when other people are sick with a cold, maybe they really do feel awful and aren’t just wimps after all. This“cold”made the heat feel intolerable, my nose was constantly spraying, and I felt generally disgusting. It’s so unusual that I get sick, and I’ve concluded that I do not like it.

So, to review the adventure, the only thing I remember about Arkansas was the colony of bugs crowding the interstate, splatting onto the windshield, and trying not to exceed the speed limit too much. There were giant signs upon entering the state that they do not tolerate speeding. It WAS Labor Day Weekend, there were cops around, and my driving record is almost clean.

In Oklahoma we dined at the greatest salad buffet in the world. We got lost trying to find it, but once we arrived, it was salad as far as the eye could see.

Texas declared upon crossing the state line that they were the proud of home of George W Bush, which prompted projectile vomiting. Generally I felt uncomfortable, but we managed to stay the night and eat breakfast and go to the store and get gasoline without anyone being mean to us.

New Mexico was amazing desert land. It was beautiful scenery but hotter than the devil and due to not feeling well, I agreed we could spend the extra money and use the air-conditioning. That made it a little better. Even the higher elevation desert felt hot, such as the Grand Canyon, but I suppose it is the end of the summer.

The check engine light came on between the Hoover Dam and Las Vegas, thus making me generally uncomfortable and unable to enjoy the glitter and glamour of Vegas. We stayed in the old skool section of Vegas, but unfortunately they were old skool enough that they wouldn’t let us use luggage carts without them being attached to a little man who expected money for his assistance. This entailed making three trips down the parking garage, through the casino, through the crowds of people who stare, up the elevator, and to the room. Since my crap was heavy, and large, and bulky, I got a bit sweaty and felt embarrassed. Not to mention pissed. While it would probably be fine to leave my crap in the car, it wasn’t worth the risk of not only losing the shit I’m moving across the country but repairing the broken window. By the time we left and we had to pack the car, I was so over Vegas and had decided fine, if you won’t let us use a luggage cart, then I’ll just carry giant objects through your lobby, and I will walk on the heels of the old couple before me who both wear red pants and move very slow and care-free, and I will sweat and you will stare and I won’t give a shit because I can’t afford to be lazy.

I had never been to Las Vegas and this trip satisfied that desire, and now I feel okay if I never return. While naturally I’m attracted to glittering and flashing lights and dinging noises, I am more-so repulsed by wandering idiot tourists. They walk slow. Furthermore, everything I had been lead to believe about Las Vegas turned out to be a lie. The buffets are NOT cheap - $9.99 is the cheapest we found–and it was neither delicious nor fancy. Also, I had been told that casinos have fountain drink dispensers available so one may fill her cup with Diet Coke for free. Not true. I paid $2.75 for a Diet Coke for Girlfriend. No free refill. And it was normal Diet Coke, not even spiked with rum or cocaine.

Certainly it was nice to stand outside at night and see the lights. And I was forced to present identification when playing Keno, and I was okay with that. I also liked having access to a Dunkin Donuts across the street, although the gentleman there called me“Sir”and then spent the next several minutes making a big deal about it when really I tried to explain that I didn’t care, I just wanted my damn coffee. My favorite thing was being able to gamble and obtain results from the comfort of the hotel room by tuning in to the keno channel. If you play more than twenty-one straight games of keno, you can walk away and return up to a year later and collect your winnings. So we did exactly this and won seventeen dollars. It was a net loss of twenty-three dollars, but it was nice to have some cash back in our hands.

The transmission mechanic said they didn’t know why the check engine light had turned on, but it was probably okay to drive to Oakland the next day, just try to avoid the air-conditioner given the mountains and the load in the car. When they took my car on their“road test,”the man held up my keychain and told me he has been clean for four years. I never realized how handy a recovery key chain can be, and this makes two individuals who have noticed it and have self-disclosed–the other being a parking attendant who quizzed me about some obscure passage in the Big Book (which I don’t have memorized). I felt this whole recovery kinship with the mechanic worked out because I looked him in the eye and asked him if it were him, would he trust the car to make it to Oakland, and his response seemed genuine. Even though he could be a seasoned liar, this gave me security.

So, we didn’t actually drive through“Death Valley”–the hottest spot in America, hot as in scorching heat, not as in hip and happening and fancy - but we drove next to it, and it was still goddamn hot. We packed extra water and ate sodium and potassium for breakfast in case we got stranded in the desert, and we found that cold water turned hot right quick.

Luckily, I recalled some of my nurse’s training, and expanding on the genius that is the sweating mechanism, we turned to pouring that hot water onto our heads and letting the desert wind blow through the car and cool it off. It felt amazing - like putting on a giant peppermint hat. Within ten minutes our hair would be dry again, which warranted a repeat. This made for some funny-lookin’hair when we went to the gas station, but at that point, it was too hot to give a shit. And everyone else looked heat-crazed and sweaty as well, so it worked out. We went to In and Out Burger in the middle of nowhere, and I was surprised to see that even in the middle of nowhere, In and Out Burger is still very busy.

Eventually we arrived in Oakland, the car still working and our hair crazy. It was nice to settle in a little. And now begins that great dreaded job search. Posted by Sam Brighton at 12:27 AM 1 comment:

At this very moment, my girlfriend and I are en route to California. Actually, at this very moment, Girlfriend is sleeping and I am watching the weather channel on mute and eating cold pizza and typing. We are in Little Rock, Arkansas, and I peaked out the window and am pleased to report that it appears my car has not been vandalized or robbed. My concern for my car has dramatically increased since the Wednesday before my Friday-departure-to-California I learned that my car’s transmission needed to rebuilt and that it would cost 2.5 thousand dollars (plus one dozen cookies). Pressed for time and lack of employment, I had no choice but to invest in the car I currently drive rather than to leave her for another younger, prettier, more efficient, sassier model. Originally, Mr. Transmission told me that he could finish the job maybe late Friday or Monday. (Which translates to Tuesday since he was talking“business days”and something told me that if they’re closed for the weekend, they probably don’t work on holidays either.) I told Mr. Transmission that I am moving to California on Friday, or that was the plan at least, and he laughed at me and said he would try his best.

The next thirty-six hours brought anxiety and suspense to involved parties, not to mention the last twelve of those hours also involved the uncertainty of Girlfriend’s air travel, and there’s no interesting way to metaphorically illustrate the experience. The conclusion of the story is on Friday morning, Girlfriend was in Atlanta as scheduled, and Mr. Transmission told me that he and his crew had worked late the night before and had come in at four in the morning to finish my car, and I was so overjoyed that I went to the bakery and bought a dozen assorted cookies to compensate them for the miracle they performed.

When it was time to pack the car, Girlfriend said“all of this will not fit in the car.”And I said“yes it will, with your masterful packing skills.”It took several hours, but the mountain of boxes and things in the yard all fit in the car except for the full-length mirror the old lady bought me two weeks after I got sober and the cooler that my dad and I bought during our trek from Phoenix to Pittsburgh. Ditching the mirror was bound to happen since the mirror is wider than the car.

We set out eastward towards Washington DC on our westbound trip to California. On this first leg, I learned why it is important to clean one’s windshield for night-time driving when driving in the eastern part of the country. It dawned on me that I never drive on the highway at night in Pittsburgh, whereas in Arizona and Iowa it was a way of life. In Arizona and Iowa the median between the opposing lanes of traffic is wide and unbothersome to a gal with a dirty windshield.–This turns out not to be the case in Maryland.

Some backstory on my mental health, I had been taking Wellbutrin for the last year. It served its purpose and it was fine. When I was crazy-mad-cranky-studying for the GRE, I somehow forgot to take my medication. (I also quit talking on the phone to people, didn’t sleep or eat much or put much gasoline in my car.) After I took the test, I realized I had been off the medication for about a week and decided I should just stay off it since my health insurance status is uncertain, and it’s not something you want to go off and on and off again. Even though I know it is obvious that maybe one should keep the psych meds stable when one is uprooting herself from one city and transplanting herself to another, I had decided that I am different than everyone else. Now, however, I have concluded that perhaps stopping was not a good idea. I know Wellbutrin doesn’t specifically treat anxiety, but I can feel quite a difference in anxiety while driving and now I fear that I will spontaneously choke on saliva and become unconscious and then drive my car under a semi truck or that the semi will explode when I am next to it, or that the semi will drive over another car in front of it and then shoot the crumpled car onto my windshield. So, after a while I made Girlfriend drive.

Over time, I have become more calm while driving and am now passing trucks on mild curves, so improvements have been made. After DC, we drove to Gatlinburg, Tennessee–located in the Great Smokey Mountains. We arrived in the dark and were delighted to discover that the Great Smokey Mountains actually smell like smoke.–Campfire smoke as opposed to burning marijuana or burning tires or burning car engine. Even more delightful was the neon and flashing lights and dazzle along the strip in Pigeon Forge. It was beautiful. Pigeon Forge makes me want to birth children so I may take those children to partake in such glory. (Girlfriend thinks the word“monstrosity”is a more appropriate word than“glory”in the previous sentence.) We could dress up like an old-timey family and have our pictures taken. Girlfriend and I struck up a deal–since we aren’t stopping to partake during THIS trip, we will definitely be returning with our children, definitely. Later I had a heart attack when I was told exactly how much our geriatric motel room (complete with enormous and numerous grab bars for the toilet and bathtub) cost, and the continental breakfast yielded half a mini-muffin and NO regular coffee.

Yesterday we departed from Gatlinburg and purchased gasoline outside of Knoxville where I overheard white people actually use the N-word in serious conversation while putting gasoline in their pick-up trucks. I was horrified. Then we pulled into Sonic, the fast-food restaurant that I have not laid eyes upon for some years. From my car, I ordered some breakfast burritos. Before I was done ordering, the order-taker thanked me and effectively ended the conversation, and I was not prepared for the conversation to end. Apparently, if you say“Goddamnit”the Sonic people can still hear you. Though embarrassed, I ordered the milkshake for dessert and felt satisfied.

Halfway between Nashville and Memphis we stopped at Loretta Lynn’s kitchen where I ate fried okra and turnip greens for the first time in my life. Delicious. I was tickled pink to be there. Loretta Lynn’s staff was accommodating and pleasant, and there was so much crap on the wall to gaze upon. When we were shopping through the gift store, an employee asked where we had come from, and I was amazed that they employees could tell we weren’t locals. Girlfriend and I had debated between photographing ourselves next to a mannequin with a wig (that resembled Loretta Lynn only in the sense that the mannequin possessed a traditionally“female”body shape and was presented in a context that Loretta Lynn might be found) or a painting of Loretta Lynn’s face that depicted creepy blue eyeballs. We chose the painting, and we posed quietly. After the picture was snapped, I noticed that we were being observed by a young lady who was standing in the gift shop. I watched her roll her eyes and shake her head and disappear behind the rack of Christian T-shirts. In the parking lot, she and another gentleman were staring at us as we were backing out of our parking spot. The gentleman had long flowing gray hair–which I mention only because I am not the only one here that is defying traditional gender appearance. As they approached their big rig, we exited the parking lot, and though I was huffy over the judgment cast in our direction, I was comforted in knowing that my car probably gets better gas mileage than the giant semi.

We passed through Memphis and drove by the King’s house, disappointed to find that the neighborhood wasn’t as kitschy as one might imagine, though there was an Elvis Presley Realty Company, but it seemed inappropriate to pass through Memphis without stopping by. In all, Tennessee was an impressive state. I enjoyed my time there and plan to return.

Another day stranded in the office, chained to my desk and staring longingly as the traffic drives through the slush and rain and car exhaust. A friend just gave me a giant pastry filled with sugary cream. Now I have powdered sugar stuck in the ridges of my corduroy paints, and when I turned to my cubicle mate to bitch about something, she informed me I had powdered sugar all over my face. I am very professional when it comes to managing pastries.

What disturbs me is that things haven’t changed much since kindergarten. Once I was eating lunch and took great care to eat the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, yet somehow I managed to get it on my hands, mouth, shirt, and pants, and some in my mouth. When I looked up the boy across from me was watching me with judgment and said“You are a really sloppy eater.”

A week ago, I was taking my morning shower when my boss called my phone, which was just weird considering it was 7:25 in the morning. I listened to the message and learned that my cubicle at work was an“official crime scene”and I was allowed to“touch anything”until the cops could“dust for prints.”She gave me the option of taking the day off or coming in to work and figuring something out. Like a fool, I went in to work, which I regret now. Someone broke into our office, which apparently is the fourth time in the last 18 months, and stole the new girl’s computer off her desk–which was even tied to the desk with a cord. It was her second day of work.

I took great joy in telling people that my desk was a crime scene, leaving them with the image of“crime scene”and not elaborating on the cause, at least not until they asked. My desk looked normal, though the picture frame containing a photo of my girlfriend and I mysteriously had moved from the back of my desk and out of the way to the middle of my desk, on my calendar, which is not a practical location. The mystery of how this picture moved was entertaining, and I enjoyed thinking about the bad guy trying to steal the new girl’s computer, then stopping and gazing at how pretty my girlfriend is, and since she is pretty, leaving my desk alone and returning my frame to my desk, standing it upright and making a decision not to steal my computer, thus sparing me the horrible task of informing my entire caseload that someone stole my computer that contained a bunch of their information on it, such as their continence status.

Turns out, it was the cops who moved the picture during their initial visit to the crime scene in the middle of the night, where they were shown that the computers are anchored to the desks with cords, and my picture happened to be concealing the place where the cord connects to the desk. Disappointing.

In other news, school is boring, and I haven’t yet been motivated to write one of the six papers that are required to pass. The class ends in five weeks. I simply don’t feel like it. And further, it doesn’t help that the professor has made proclamations such as“Alcoholism isn’t really a disease, it’s an excuse for behavior,”and“Our economy is really good right now with this war.”He refers snottily to the unisex bathroom as the“Everyone’s Invited Bathroom”which frosts my cookies. I appreciate the unisex bathrooms because then nobody accuses me in being in the wrong one. And the real pisser is that he says these things as transitional statements and without taking a breath moves into the next topic and doesn’t allow space to object. And mister fancy philosophy is always talking about how arguments need evidence, yet these he seems to be above following such rules. It’s not very AA-like of me to wish harm upon others, but it would be nice if he could have some sort of perspective beyond himself. Like if an Ebeneezer Scrooge situation happened or something.

This weekend is company bowling, and I look forward to rolling. Between last month and this month I have been taking great care to strengthen my tricep muscles so I may fling the ten pound ball with such power that it shatters the pins at the end of the lane. Damn right. Posted by Sam Brighton at 7:32 AM 4 comments:

In January my girlfriend made my television work again after I had severed the power cord with a falling picture frame.

Over Valentine&apos;s Day weekend, she not only made the sound on my television move over to my stereo speakers, she performed some moderate plumbing, and now both my sink AND my bathtub drain appropriately.

Dirty water was a-flinging. It was romantic.

 

 My girlfriend is a handy lady. Posted by Sam Brighton at 6:37 AM No comments:

My schedule is very busy at this time, but it shall be noted that I was at a training for the first two days of this week, during which time a magazine covered in solid black wrapping arrived at my office. Accompanying the magazine were two Netflix movies. When I pulled them out of my mailbox on Wednesday morning, there were post-it notes that had been applied by the receptionist who had sorted the mail the day prior. The post it note on the magazine said“Porn? High Times?”And then it appeared that she had peaked into my Netflix movies and found that I had rented the television series _Weeds_. This combination lead to perfect circumstantial evidence that I go home, smoke marijuana cigarettes, read about it in magazines, and watch television about it.

The magazine is the first issue of my new _Curve_ subscription which the old lady bought me for Christmas. The solid black wrapper disturbs me. The black wrapper draws far more attention than would K.D. Lang looking awesome in her glasses on the cover. My coworkers were disappointed to find there were no naked ladies contained within the black wrapper. Posted by Sam Brighton at 1:34 PM 3 comments:

 18 January 2008

Once again stranded in the office today, answering the telephones for the folks who are too impatient for voicemail messages. This required showing up early to work. I have my 23.5 oz JOLT lightning drink and my blood oranges and a glass of water–I am ready to work.

Yesterday I received my tax forms, and over my lunch break, I filed my federal, state, AND city income taxes, and they were all in the outgoing by mail early afternoon. This is a tremendous accomplishment. I have never done my own taxes before. At first I figured that my refund would be about three thousand dollars. After a quick review of what I could buy with three thousand dollars (almost a year of nursing school), I realized that this was probably an error.

Indeed I was, for I had been off by a decimal point while consulting the tax tables. I crossed off my error and then wrote an explanation to the IRS in the margin. That seemed a little suspicious though, and I don’t have the energy for an audit, so I started over with a fresh form. I found a more reasonable refund, and I have taken my first strides into actual adulthood! Like middle-aged adulthood!

Blood oranges are strange. I had never heard of them until yesterday when I bought them, and it’s my hope that the“blood”refers to the color rather that the ingredients used to make the orange. Not that I’m a vampire, but I’m eating one right now and it doesn’t taste like blood. Nevertheless, I’m not interested in contracting Hepatitis C, HIV, or malaria at this point in my life.

The blood oranges were purchased in a mad frenzy of shopping. I went to the store after work with the intention of buying a jug of yogurt and a jar of apple sauce. By the way, it’s worth mentioning that I have sworn a blood oath at the new year never to purchase things from Giant Eagle ever again, the grocery store from hell. The bulk of my groceries now come from Trader Joes, and what they don’t sell (Microwave Popcorn, Artificial Sweetner, FiberOne bars), I shall purchase from anywhere other than Giant Eagle.

So, before I even got to the yogurt department, I had filled my cart with nuts and seeds, salsa, corn chips, apples, blood oranges, broccoli. By this time, aware that I had already exceeded the budged $18 for the rest of the month, and in the great tradition of the alcoholic, since I’ve already ruined the plan, I might as well annihilate the plan. (In retrospect, I realize that as this logic was settling in, I still could’ve put everything back and not ruin the plan. This did not cross my mind. This never crosses my mind–like the opportunity for reason between ordering the first drink and receiving the first drink and taking a swig–never happened.)

The situation worsened when I found the frozen food department stocked with brand new items that I’ve never before seen. I purchased things I would never dream of purchasing. Breaded eggplant! I don’t even really know what eggplant is! I mean not really. I’ve heard of it, but what the hell is it? I just heard them talking about it on the Sopranos, so I bought it.

When I arrived in my home, I put all the groceries away and was quite satisfied with myself. I checked the mail and my grades from last term STILL have not arrived, and I’m beginning to believe that they never will arrive. I got invited to an honor roll dinner, so I’m assuming the grades are fine, though I’m still maybe a little bit curious.

Instead of going for a walk like I had planned all week, last night being an actual night without commitments, having to go somewhere and do something, but instead it seemed more important to lie on the couch and watch a television series. (I really enjoy getting invested into television series that are out on DVD. But only when out on DVD because this means I don’t have to wait a week to find out whether Dr. McDreamy will choose to be lovers with Meredith or with his wife.)

Five hours later, I spoke to my parents and told them that I want to become a carpenter instead of a social worker, and I was inspired to make brownies. Girlfriend made brownies the night prior, and the old lady was making them to celebrate Martin Luther King at work. Brownies seemed like fun. It’s funny because I have been wanting birthday cake lately, in this season of Martin Luther King, and recently I made the connection. When in elementary school, my mom brought birthday cakes to our classes with“Happy Birthday Martin Luther King”written in frosting, therefore forcing the teacher to educate the class about Martin Luther King.

So I mixed up the brownie batter and was chatting on the phone with girlfriend. When I opened the oven door to insert the brownies for baking, the oven was cold despite twenty minutes of preheating. The pilot light was not lit, and I was frightened. When I first moved in the apartment, this was also the case and I couldn’t figure out how to make it be lit, so I just lived the first year in my apartment without using the oven. My sister visited in July and very easily removed the bottom of the oven, reached in the back with a match, lit the sucker up and kaboom, I had a working oven. I could bake chicken.

So, I knew generally what to do to make it lit again, but earlier this week I met someone who had lit a match during a gas leak which exploded and melted his clothes and led to all sorts of unpleasantries. Luckily I did have girlfriend on the phone, which added some security to my plight. I removed my shirt, watch, glasses, and then I unchained the chain lock on my apartment door so the fire department could easier enter my apartment, and if I caused an explosion, girlfriend was to hang up the phone and call the police immediately.

Like most of my stories, a lot of dramatic build-up leads to no punchline: I lit the pilot light without incident, put my clothes back on, and baked my brownies. And let me say this: The information on the Splenda package promises that you can substitute it for sugar and you shan’t tell a different. Bullroar. I haven’t cast Splenda out of my life, it is delicious in coffee and it is a non-systemic sweetener and doesn’t enter your blood stream or cross the blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, it is not as good in brownies. The texture is a bit similar to eating foam rubber, and it’s not as sweet as I like my desserts to be. Still, though, I made a damn fine batch of brownies, and I will be eating them this weekend as I celebrate Martin Luther King and eat my breaded eggplant patties and watch my television and study for my test and write my paper.

 13 December 2007
Last night I finished my final exams for this term of school, and eighteen hours later I’m feeling progressively happy–so happy, in fact, that I actually pondered listening to holidays music during my drive to a work-related appointment. Upon digging through the collection of cd’s in my car, I couldn’t find anything and settled with“Music for Sweating”–a mix one could listen to while power-walking or otherwise sweating. It was a reasonable replacement given the mood–we started off with a fun bit of Spice Girls and moved on to other embarrassing music. Funny how 22 hours prior I was sitting in the therapist office crying like a damn fool. (I cry when tired, and there was really no reason to cry–except that I was tired.) As for the test, I’m sure I will pass the class one way or another, and that’s sufficient for me at this time.

The feeling of having nothing to do this weekend, not being committed to any labwork or reviewing of notes, is foreign–it’s okay to waste time again.–There will be no unsatisfactory consequences if I recline on the couch and talk on the phone all day.

Last weekend was the holiday party for my work. It’s funny how non-profit organization parties compare to for-profit Republican holiday parties–because really, one wouldn’t reasonably expect there to be a difference. Last year I weaseled out of the ordeal for a noble cause, or at least that’s how I got out of it, when really I didn’t want to go because I had no friends at work and I didn’t want to have to sit by myself then cry. Not to mention I don’t play any games that involve moving, no matter what the prize–which was on the agenda.

So this being my first-time party, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Frankly I had considered weaseling out again in anticipation of studying for finals. For all the build-up I’m giving this party, there’s not a lot of“kaboom”to my story. I actually decided to attend because I could then hang out with work friends and not have to wear fancy work clothes while doing so. (I had decided to wear jeans and defy the dress code, but then it was announced that it was okay to wear jeans, my defiance turned to conformity, and so I was disappointed. But comfortable.) Beer and wine was free, and of course I did not partake, though it was fun imaging what kind of trouble I would get into if I had partook, and instead I drank about seven cups of coffee and three or four pops. So even without alcohol I was all jazzed up and managed to engage in inappropriate laughter.–Bursting into laughter when nobody else was laughing. (I was imaging something funny.) Several people looked at me and I tried pretending I was coughing.

To compare it to the Republican Caucasian Christmas, the attitude was a bit relaxed, and there was no treating any“owners”like“Jesus”or“the King”when making introductions. The door prizes were far better–non-profits know how to party right. The Republicans gave me Target-brand“drinking chocolate”whereas here I won a giftcard to the bookstore containing a handsome amount of twenty-five dollars. The bonuses here are twice the amount as with Replicans, there are no health insurance premiums, fear and punishment is not used as a supervisory style, plus I’m not working for the devil–I’m quite satisfied with my career move.

By the way, it’s worthwhile to mention that after spending six hundred dollars on my car, it drives like a dream. I don’t know exactly when my car started rocking back and forth when in motion–the first time it actually made me nervous was while driving on the parkway (which is Pittsburgh speak for the big four to six lane highway that shoots through Pittsburgh–“interstate”if you’re an Iowa,“the 279”if you’re in Arizona) and it frightened me, so I avoided the parkway in case a tire exploded off my car, that way I wouldn’t be moving so fast upon collision. That was September. So I’ve been cringing while driving for over two months now, and it’s so nice to glide gently down the streets. Truly, it makes me not want to drive like a maniac. I’ve settled down a great deal while driving these last two days.

Plus, it’s nice not fearing the police, once again, and having updated inspection stickers. Posted by Sam Brighton at 10:22 AM No comments:

 8 November 2007

I left my desk for two hours and already I have six voicemail messages. But, that’s not my problem at this moment as I dine on my lunch. Yesterday I put $1400 on my credit card, and this morning I worked on figuring out how to recover from such, and I think it will take about six months if I spend money on only enough food that will keep me alive for the next six months and quit drinking pop. And eating candy. And cake. And brownies. And pizza. Luckily I quit smoking, otherwise that would be bad news. So promptly I have defied my plan and for lunch I purchased a sandwich from the East Coast. They heat up their subs so they’re crispy, which is fine, but it takes forever and leads to clogging the passageway around the cash register/drink dispenser.

When you place your order, you give them your name, and every time I say my name is Heather, and then immediately I am pissed that I didn’t use a pseudonym. (Fredricka. Heaven. Cookie.) So they were bundling up what I assumed to be my sandwich and the gentleman behind the counter looked at my receipt and was confused that I was next to be called but I had a girl’s name when I clearly I am a“dude.”It’s that time of year where I wear coats that conceal the shape of my body.–This always happens come winter when my hair is short. My hair is actually long (for me) these days, and I was surprised to overhear this conversation. The gentleman’s coworker then explained that I’m a girl, and they went back and forth, back and forth, confusion, huh? No way. And I just wanted my sandwich. So yes, I’ve concluded that I should change my name when ordering sandwiches to names even more inappropriate to my appearance, like Bambi, Candy, that is, when I can afford to buy sandwiches again after six to eighteen months.

I spent fourteen hundred dollars mostly on my car. Car insurance is due and this should be the least premium I pay with my DUI jacking up the rate. DUI is scheduled to fall off at the end of December, after which I might go celebrate with a couple of beers and drive around honking and hollering at people. In addition to car insurance, on Monday morning I had left the office in a rush to a consumer’s house. First I had to get gas because the car was a little sputtery when I started her engine. Upon squiring gasoline in my tank, I noticed that my tire was flat, not low but like super flat. The tire air machine was blocked by the construction crew jack hammering away at the cement, so I decided I’ll at least just go buy something, get cash back in quarters so I can go somewhere else. (Like Arizona, Pennsylvania gas stations charge money for compressed air, unlike Iowa.) I go in and buy energy drinks, can’t buy just one, have to get two, and when I ask for cash back they refused my request. Pissed and swearing never to step foot in Giant Eagle or any of their gas stations EVER again, I mean it, they can go to hell, I proceeded to visit three more gas stations with my totally flat tire and didn’t find a working air machine AND quarters until the fourth gas station–and even that fourth gas station involved buying crap I didn’t want and withdrawing money from an ATM that charged me four extra dollars. And gas stations aren’t a-plenty in Pittsburgh, at least not this area, so I was very tardy for my appointment and not really close to where I was going, not to mention pissy, although I secretly like messing with my tires–dragging a hose around and operating a tire gauge–makes me feel so butch. Upon filling my tire, I broke my pressure gauge and my blood pressure soared, and therefore I had to eyeball it–which my father told me never ever to do. And I got my hands all dirty. So I arrived at my visit all sweaty, but quickly I forgot about my tires problems, and by the time I left of course it didn’t seem like quite the crisis I originally thought. So I calmly drove back to the office and made plans to get my tire looked at, possibly replaced, and while I’m at it, my state inspection is way overdue and I need an oil change.

Turns out I needed three new tires and had totally destroyed one of them. The nice mechanic next door told me my tire should’ve exploded, and he took me into the big fix-it room and showed me what I had done. I don’t know much about tires, but even I could I identify that the tire was“fucked.”So, four new tires and some other car part were purchased, and there goes six hundred dollars.

Plus I went shopping online and spent a bunch of money for work clothes. That also cost a lot of money.

And after spending all that money, I went to class and failed the quiz I didn’t study for, so naturally this made me edgy as well. I should have studied. Straight A students don’t get Fs.
But today’s a new day, that all was just a minor set-back, and I will raise enough money to pay for school and I will study more and it’ll be okay. And now that I have no money to buy my happiness (in food), I guess I’ll just have to focus on the“intangible happiness”that money can’t buy anyway. Posted by Sam Brighton at 10:16 AM 1 comment:

 We lost. Only had three votes - two of which came from our own cubicle. These people don&apos;t know what awesome is. Posted by Sam Brighton at 1:01 PM 4 comments: 31 October 2007

Even though I’m at work, I don’t feel like working today. First of all, it’s the long-anticipated pumpkin contest. Second, there are treats that involve Halloween that are being set up. Three, yesterday girlfriend decided I needed to join the rest of the world and set up a my-space page for me, and it’s awesome. Fourth, it’s pay day and I wish I brought my bills so I can pay them online.

This morning I ironed my sailor suit and practiced singing my sea songs (Popeye, Row Row Row Your Boat, In the Navy), but at the last second decided not to wear it because then I can’t wear it next year. I didn’t want to waste it. So instead I have dressed with the bottoms of a pant suit, topped off with a sweater vest with the sleeves sewn on, and shoes made from imitation-flesh of cattle.

As for the pumpkin, pumpkin number three, cubicle mate and I walked to another coworker’s home last night and carved our pumpkin while basking in the narrative of America’s Biggest Loser - another contest of a different sort. (I learned about this show the night prior in my Nutrition class. The nutrition professor does not think the show is a good idea and refuses to watch, just btw.) Being that I’m awesome, I forgot the stencils that I had invested so much time deliberating over, and so we were left to wing it from scratch. By ten o’clock, we had an awesome cannibal pumpkin chomping on a screaming lil’pumpkin. Pure awesome.

By the time we walked home (several miles), I felt the day’s candy treats were justified–if only I could walk six miles every day. The pumpkin at this moment is on display for judging. Our pumpkin is the only actually“carved”pumpkin. Clearly we are the most skillfull and delicate with the hand.

Something else I learned last night is that pumpkin-carving tools make the journey of pumpkin-carving far less bumpy and dangerous to my fingers as opposed to using the gigantic rusty knife from Ikea. I selected that knife due to my discomfort with using it to slice actual food, so it seemed the most appropriate tool for carving. Nevermind that it’s rusty–I just updated my tetanus shot when I started nursing school so I’m in the clear. Besides, I destroyed the fork I had been using–one prong is bent backwards–and that silverware wasn’t cheap so I’m not throwing it away but haven’t yet been able to form it back into place. This means you must be very careful when eating with it.

The judgment takes place in thirty-two minutes. I wait on the edge of my seat. Posted by Sam Brighton at 5:59 AM 1 comment:

Okay, the pumpkin contest is tomorrow, and when I got home last night and checked on my pumpkin creation, which was nestled in the fridge between the crockpot and the eight bags of cheese I accidently bought, to my horror the pumpkin had wilted. Pieces that had been disconnected by a careless slice of the knife were now curled up behind the pumpkin rather than neatly staying in place, the disconnect unnoticeable. The pumpkin featured Gizmo from the Gremlins on the left side and to the right was Stripe, the bad Gremlin. Gizmo’s belly has separated from his legs, and Stripe looks like he got rammed in the face with a shopping cart. This clearly cannot be entered in a contest.

To understand the disappointment, the context of this pumpkin’s creation is that all evening Saturday, late morning Sunday, and Sunday afternoon I sat on the couch and carved the pumpkin. We’re talking more hours than are contained in a traditional working day. And I screwed that sucker up. There were no lines to distinguish Gizmo’s leg from belly from arm from paw from ear from background. Stripe’s nose accidently got transferred from the pattern between and above his eyes instead of below, and with one careless move I severed his entire lower jaw, and he looked like he had the mouth of a blow-up doll. With great disappointment in the work I had created, I sent a text message to my fellow contestant from my cubicle to tell her that I destroyed our pumpkin. She responded that we can still call it Britney Spears since she’s pretty screwed up anyway. With uneasiness, yet comforted by her response, I embarked on a four mile walk to work off the frustration and rage.

Toward the end of my walk I ran into a woman I know, and I told her about the pumpkin. She told me she had just bought a pumpkin at Trader Joe’s for cheap. Quickly I ended the conversation, power walked back home, jumped in the car without changing out of my sweaty walkin outfit, and I raced to the store. A new pumpkin, a fresh start. I knew now where I had gone wrong, I could do a new one better, one that shall win the contest. And a better one it was. I scraped all the innards out of the pumpkin–not just the seeds and guts–but I thinned down the skin until you could see the outside layer from the inside. From there I traced the pattern, carefully, and then carved out the intricate spaces from the pattern, and by eleven that night I had a finished pumpkin with both Gizmo and the Gremlin side by side.

Yesterday morning, I arrived at work and I looked at my sister’s pumpkins from last year of the same patterns. Clearly hers were far better than what I had created - for I had thinned out the skin too much which gives it that extra shade of orange, the extra texture, the extra pretty. Plus a coworker accidently saw what my sister had created, coworker admired it, and I couldn’t just show up two days later with a crappier version of what she had just seen. There would be no shock and awe value, I had already ruined it. I needed to carve yet another.

Given that I do go to school, to work, get all pissy about getting enough sleep, it was suggested that taking on yet another pumpkin is not necessary. I have two tests next week and another biggin test the week after and I haven’t cracked open the microbiology textbook since the last exam. Since I failed to impulsively race to the store to buy a new pumpkin right after work, there was time for reason to set in, and during class last night I had concluded that it’ll be okay if I present that pumpkin in the contest, it’s still far better than what anyone else at the office would or could create–that is until I found it all sunken in last night.

Pissed. And with all this drama and tragedy, we better goddamn win. Posted by Sam Brighton at 5:52 AM 1 comment:

 29 October 2007

Something exciting has happened. But first, some back-story: I am terrified of cooking chicken. I can handle browning ground beef, but that’s the extent of my experience cooking meat–only because my mom made me brown it when I was in high school, once she expected us to cook and trusted us with warm appliances. But chicken has always been dangerous due to the risk of salmonella. Last weekend I spent Sunday afternoon baking three slabs of chicken breast. Baking chicken is certainly something I’ve never done before. I’ve cooked it in a frying pan twice, but I imagine I could go healthier than frying chicken in oil that you can’t even really taste and try the baking. There were even instructions on the package. Nevertheless, I had to consult girlfriend, repeatedly, for instruction and reassurance that I was doing chicken right and cooking thoroughly. Any shade of pink made me nervous, but apparently there is some degree of pink even in well-cooked chicken. This whole ordeal supported my consideration of skipping the hornet’s nest altogether and just go vegetarian. Plus, parts of chicken are kind of gross, and I had to dig those parts out. I don’t like eating food that bears evidence that it once was a living creature, walking around on the farm. I wasn’t fond of the blood vessels that I had to rip out. Plus, I was psychotic about trimming all the fat. Over an hour later, I ate a sliver of the chicken (by then I wasn’t hungry anymore, for I had eaten something else instead while waiting for it to be overbaked.) It tasted fine and it didn’t taste like poison or contamination or salmonella. Later that evening, since I had survived the initial sliver without illness, I felt safe to go ahead and pull out a larger chunk and microwave it up. It was delicious.

The next morning I woke up and staggered into the kitchen looking for cookies when I found that bowl of chicken still sitting on the counter. I left it out overnight, and I was pissed, pissed at God for letting me waste three breasts of chicken. I put the chicken back in the fridge just to see if maybe I could talk my mom into thinking it’s a good idea for me to eat it anyway. Turns out I was unsuccessful and she strongly encouraged me to just cut my losses and throw it out. I had been sick earlier in the weekend, barfing everywhere, which is an unpleasant combination with a microbiology lab where you grow stank-ass bacteria that smell stinky. (I suspect I poisoned myself by not cleaning out my water bottle.–I was sort of tempted to drink again what I suspected to be contaminated water just to see if that’s what made me sick, but since it would involve barfing all over again if I were correct, I dumped the water instead and cleaned the bottle.) The point was that I had been sick already, let’s just give it a rest. I told my mom that I was going to talk to my microbiology teacher and see what she says. My mom said“go right ahead and talk to her.”She called my bluff, and I didn’t talk to her.

So, I told girlfriend the whole story and she suggested the chicken was just fine to eat despite sitting out overnight. But I told her what my mom had said. Girlfriend walked me through the logic in that I probably killed any salmonella during the initial thorough over-cooking, and the bacteria that infested the chicken overnight would have come from my kitchen. Since it was in an airtight covered container, the bacteria would have come from the bowl/lid instead of climbing in from the counter. And furthermore, given what I’m learning in school, the bacteria would likely have to be anaerobic or facultative bacteria due to the lack of oxygen supply, and therefore they would have to ferment to metabolize, and yeah, meaning that cuts out a good lot of bacteria that would be able to survive–at least the strict aerobes. So, I cut the chicken into teensy pieces and microwaved the hell out of them–six minutes plus microwaving later immediately before use. Girlfriend suggested I was going overboard and drying out the chicken in the process. So I slathered the chicken in olive oil. (Which, I was trying to avoid in the first place by baking, but I’d rather eat oiled chicken than dry chicken, and dry chicken is better than poisonous chicken. Plus I can justify the oil for it’ll carry away the cholesterol my body produces.) And here we are, two days later, I’ve eaten the chicken and have not gotten sick! I am so excited not to have wasted the chicken, and once again, the veils are being lifted.–My parents are overly cautious, especially when it comes to poultry and airports. And sometimes it’s good to take risks.

A bit of an update on the pumpkin carvin&apos; festivities. I&apos;m the one in the cubicle that has taken on this issue of pumpkin decoration and therefore am in complete control. After becoming a membership of an exclusive pumpkin stencil website, I now have stencils ranging from Britney Spears to Michael Landon to Edward Scissorhands to Animal from the Muppets to John Wayne, among others. I&apos;m taking the stencils home and shall carefully deliberate, contemplate what I want our pumpkin to say about us as a cubicle. We are competing to either be the funniest, the scariest, or the most creative. Prizes for the winners are promised though it doesn&apos;t specify the exact prize, so I&apos;m not sure how obsessed I want to become with the pumpkin carving.

In other news, I tried on the sailor suit Halloween costume and am considering wearing that to work. It looks really gay, but that&apos;s sort of the appeal. I&apos;ve worn it to several other Halloween celebrations in the past, but I did spend fifty dollars on it, and the useful thing about moving around the country is the freedom to debut the same costume year after year. Or, someone else suggested I go as Jake Gillenhall from Brokeback Mountain. I do have a cowboy hat. No boots, but I don&apos;t recall that they showed his feet much in the movie, so he could&apos;ve been wearing red sparkling clogs for all we know. Posted by Sam Brighton at 10:09 AM 1 comment:

 Soon our office is having a pumpkin-carving contest for Halloween. Last year I didn’t know what to expect, and neither did I care about the contest, for I was a new employee and didn’t want to draw attention to myself. What happened was I found patterns on the internet depicting cats and bats and spider webs, printed them, and left my coworkers to do the dirty-work of carving and cutting fingers.–This reaped a mostly blank pumpkin with one spider web (with about three rings of web–about six inches in diameter) and one cat, also no bigger that six square inches. We did not win. Not even close. People here go crazy with pumpkin-decorating, a very elite group of competitors. Now that I’ve been here a year and I’m establishing myself by bragging that everything I do is awesome, I’ve made some announcements that our cubicles pumpkin will indeed be awesome. It’s a new cubicle with new cubicle mates, and I’m feeling fresh with the spirit of Halloween. I don’t have any plans, and I don’t plan to make plans, so really, the office celebration is the only Halloween excitement I have going. We must win the contest.

I may or may not dress up for Halloween at work. I was thinking of centering a costume around wearing jeans so I could get away with wearing jeans to work, but nothing clever is coming to mind. I mean, I could be a cowboy, but big wow, and I don’t even have boots. Cowboys don’t wear Sketchers. The only catch is I see the therapist on Halloween, so any outfit I put on, I must be willing to wear in public and into the therapist building. I kind of want to paint a beard or a mustache or something manly on my face because it’s easier to get away with cross-dressing on this day.

In other news, with my current status of nursing school student, to some people I’ve become the one to go to regarding health/medical issues. I have found so far that I have no idea how to answer such questions and we look it up on wikepedia. It saddens me that eight weeks of Nutrition and Microbiology has not yet made me an expert in medicine. Posted by Sam Brighton at 11:13 AM 3 comments:

 21 September 2007

This morning I awoke at 7:35, and given my employer excepts me in the office at 8:00, I had to engage in some rushed preparation for the day. I managed the shower, the pit-stick, the vitamins, and the putting on of clothes, but I forgot about my sack lunch. So, as sort of a reward for sleeping in and still making it to work on time, I felt a purchased lunch was justified. So, I just consumed eight inches worth of artichoke sub sandwich. It was delicious, and now I could nap, but alas, I still people to visit this afternoon. Since it’s a pain to eat and write on the computer at the same time, I looked at the Democratic candidates for the 2008 election to see who I want to support, if anyone. I’ve decided Dennis Kucinich is my guy–his proposal for health care is to take the for-profit element out of it–(pharmaceutical companies, health insurance companies)–resulting in a truly universal healthcare system. I’ve come to loathe the for-profit anything because it warps what’s important. I hope never again in my life to work for any for-profit outfit–I did that in Phoenix, and it was horrible.

In other news, this week I had my first microbiology exam, and I found it to be quite difficult.–It’s not a good sign when you are reading words on the exam and know you’ve never seen them before (which probably means I should’ve been more thorough in my reading of the textbook). At least other people in my class were flipped out right along with me after the test. Not that I want other people to fail (no curve grading). The class is getting difficult, but I love it.

Nutrition is my other class where I learned about the revised food pyramid. Talk about complicated–now a simple vegetable group isn’t enough–there’s like four or five sub-categories. And now there are no servings recommended, you have to calculate your appropriate caloric intake and then follow a grid recommending weights and sizes of food one should eat. An assignment I have is writing up a menu for a moderately active seventeen year-old girl. I worked really hard on it, and then comparing it to my food intake of that day (approximately a dozen cookies), I realized I have some changes to make if I want to more closely adhere to the new food pyramid (in the old pyramid I found the term“sparingly”is subject to interpretation).

Like a fool, I screwed up my back wearing a backpack while walking. Normally the backpack is fine for a four mile walk. Apparently seven miles was too much. Getting into my car and making left turns has become the most painful activities of my day. So, I’ve decided that I’m not ever going to wear a backpack ever again. Ever.

So, week two of nursing school and I’m already a tiny bit behind with my homework. This is because I spent the weekend laying around watching movies and talking on the phone and eating cookies in the dark instead of turning on some good reading light and opening the textbook. (I worked 46 hours last week plus attended six hours of school which I believe warranted some sloth time over the holiday weekend.) I did trouble myself to read forty pages last night, and really, reading more would’ve been unproductive I imagine, so I felt justified in stopping and watching a teensy bit more television. The subject of microbiology is quite fascinating, though, and to read the textbook during my lunch break at work is a pleasant escape from the world of ringing phones and deadlines and having to soothe people.

Something fascinating that I read was the first landmark event in the history of microbiology is that the Egyptians invented beer in 1500 B.C. Three thousand years later, the second landmark event was in 1546 A.D. some Italian dude suggested diseases may be caused by invisible organisms. Really, going three thousand years without any progress in the field of microbiology? Luckily the rate of discoveries picked up after that, otherwise we would all be infested with polio and reubella, and smallpox would be alive and well. (I didn’t know smallbox was actually eradicated in 1980. What a great year!) This of course is the bonus information that we will not be tested on–which I chose to read and remember. Nevermind all that other crap.

In other school-related news, I don’t have to wear a uniform for another fifteen months, and there will be no nurse hats for the graduation pictures. (I am so pissed.) We have to wear pins, but no hats. I wanted a hat. That’s the only reason why I wanted to become a nurse.

So, the Birthday Fiesta went well, now that it’s in retrospect. I am so happy the month of August is over and I’m no longer responsible for celebrating any events such as birthdays, births of babies, and leavings of jobs. While I heard some noise about not having a cake, I did hear a general consensus that I did indeed select good candy with which to fill the piñata. This is because I have wonderful taste.

Overall I heard no complaints, which is a good thing, because by the time it was over, I didn’t give a rat’s ass what anyone thought about it, the important part was that it was over.

My dad continues to search through recycle bins for the discarded and unused Coke points so he may get his free golf club. While not the same extent, I find that I’ve been infected with the craze of collecting points to help him. This means that I’ve been buying Coke products lately, which I need to stop immediately because I cut pop out of budget for a reason, a financial reason. Last week I was walking down the street and saw a plastic Coke bottle that had been crushed, presumably run over by multiple automobiles. I stared at it for a long time as I waited for the stoplight to change, debating whether or not to rescue the crushed cap and try to make sense of the code. I let it go, but still, later I felt a sense of guilt. Now in the store I find myself comparing prices, not only considering unit cost per ounce, but which offers the most points as well. The obsession has struck me too. Mostly it struck because my close friend salvaged forty codes from Coke boxes (which are like the gold of the coke points, they carry far more weight than the crappy old red caps) for my father, effectively winning a special place in his heart. Forty. That’s four hundred points. I was inspired to at least make an effort, even if half-assed. Posted by Sam Brighton at 10:19 AM 1 comment:

Just a quick entry to express new developments in my life. Number one: my Netflix movies have been sitting in post office for over three weeks now. Last week I received a threat from Jeff my mailman that if I don’t pick them up within three days they will return them. I decided that was fine, saves me the trip of going there, picking them up, and then having to put them back in the mailbox. Besides, I need to cancel that service anyway so avoid temptation when I need to be studying. Because valedictorians don’t become valedictorians by watching six movies per week (twelve hours of television plus forty hours of paid employment plus eight hours of class plus fifty-six hours of sleep per week leaves only 52 hours of the week left for studying, and I definitely need the 64 hours to be the best in my class).

So anyway, I seem to have gotten side-tracked, but this information is worthy of a new paragraph…I called Jeff’s bluff. I sat back and folded my arms and crossed my legs and said“Fine Jeff, send them back, see if I care.”Well, guess what appeared in my mailbox yesterday. That’s right, a big red envelope, which did fit in the mailbox mind you, and inside the big red envelope was Wanda Sykes. I beat Jeff at his own game, and by Jeff I really mean the US Postal Service, and when I refer to the US Postal Service, I really mean the federal government. Yes, I am that good.

In other news, I got a letter from the city of Pittsburgh reprimanding me for not paying over one hundred dollars worth of city taxes, so not only do I owe them money, but now I also have to pay a penalty in addition.

The other news, which is not so exciting, is that today we purchased the groceries for the best birthday party ever, scheduled for tomorrow. My empenadas got scrapped. Decorations, it’s been decided, are more important. Sure I can pay for them myself and make them, but there will be no support for the birthday fund. I’m trying very hard in the planning of this ordeal to keep in mind that this is not the Heather Show and I am not the boss of everything, even though my ideas are better.

 21 August 2007

This is my last week of freedom from studies for the next four years, and so one would think I should spend it wisely. Instead, I spent last night sitting on my couch reading my new microbiology text book (about the“father of microbiology”and how he earned that name). Even more interesting, I read the biographies of all the authors of the book. It’s a darn shame we won’t be tested on that content. In the spirit of jacking around, which I can certainly appreciate, one author filled hers with sarcasm. Hopefully her teaching of microbiology will also include sarcasm. I also read what has been added to warrant a fifth edition. One fancy feature of edition five is that it includes cartoons.

Also last night I watched the movie _White Noise_ again. I rented it over the weekend–I had been seeking a movie that would be“thrilling”–something entertaining and spooky. I had heard that this movie would afford me such thrills. I hated the movie, actually, at least from a story-telling perspective it made no goddamn sense. The bad guy was shown for three seconds early in the movie, and aside from a quick flash of his image during a transition which you would have to pause to identify who it was, the bad guy didn’t appear again until the end of the movie (and they had to flashback to remind you who it was–I didn’t know who the fuck it was), and they specified no motive, no connection, no reason why he was in business with the ghosts, or why Michael Keaton’s wife was targeted to die. They also used the theme of 2:30 (in terms of time–everyone died at 2:30). While watching the director comments, the director confirmed that he had used that consistent time, and he went on to say that many people had asked him why 2:30. His response:“I don’t know, I’m just the director.”It seems to me that if you’re going to bother with a theme, give it SOME sort of significance.

As far as spooky goes, the movie used those tricks where it’s all silent and then a cell phone rings, shrieking into the quiet. One where when you view the movie in a theater, people scream in response even though it’s quite obvious that when it’s dark and silent, they’re going to throw in something stupid that makes noise. Aside from that, there was potential for some gruesome and horror, but I felt at liberty to keep my eyes open, riding in the comfort that this is only a PG-13 movie.

Why did I watch the movie three times if I hated it so much? (Irochka asked me such question.) Believe it or not, it was a lighter more jolly film than the other two I had rented. Plus I like to sit around and think about how stupid movies are, how I could do it better, and then bask in how smart I am.

In other news, this week is the birthday party featuring Mexican food that my cubicle is hosting. Yesterday I was struck with the bright idea to make empenadas for the feast, in part to live up to my best-birthday-party-ever promise. When I lived in Venezuela, we were immediately fed empenadas, which there were called“pastelitos.”And I wondered why everyone went crazy over crappy“pastelitos.”–Fried dough around cheese, big wow. By the end of my Venezuelan experience, I was hoarding them.

So, I emailed my mother basically to inform her that I had this idea and to inquire if I am advanced enough in cookery skill and is the cooking process easy enough for me to handle, for me to actually thinking about embarking on this journey. She wrote back with some encouraging words, stating I could likely handle it, then warned me not to make the grease too hot, don’t spill grease in the open flame, and don’t get burned. I’m twenty-seven years old and she’s advising me not get burned. I’ve been frying all kinds of things this year–it’s a new activity of 2007–frying crap in olive oil. (I even fried English Muffins a while ago because I didn’t have a toaster and didn’t want the microwave to make them all soggy and wet…in case you’re wondering, I’ve not fried English Muffins in olive oil since.) So I feel confident in my ability to fry some empenadas.

During our phone call last night, though, the old lady seemed really nervous about me taking on this task and advised me to have someone with me when I fry them. And I say, the trouble with having people in your house is that once they’re there, then you have to get them out of your house, and that’s a lot of trouble. Plus, the top of my stove and behind my toilet look disgusting, and I’m just not ready to clean either. So then she quizzed me on what I do if there’s a grease fire. I said throw flour on it. That was wrong. Sugar? No. Salt? No. Cocaine? No.–Baking soda–apparently. I knew it was a white powder. Somehow I smoothed her over and we hung up. Fifteen minutes later, I was in bed, and she called again. I let it ring into voicemail because I was done talking for the day and ready for bed. This morning her message advised me to go out and buy a heavy cast iron skillet before I take on the task, my Ikea frying pan is too shallow, and to have a friend with me, and to not try to dump out the hot oil when it’s still hot. An iron skillet - all of this for a work function that nobody will remember the day after, for pastelitos that not many people will probably eat…

This morning I found a recipe that involves baking rather than frying. The old lady thought this was an excellent idea. Posted by Sam Brighton at 10:53 AM 2 comments: Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
