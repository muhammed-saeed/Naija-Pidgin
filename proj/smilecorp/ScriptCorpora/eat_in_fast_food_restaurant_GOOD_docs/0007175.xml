Most people will visit a fast-food restaurant at least once in their lives. However, other than opening our pocketbooks to pay, do we ever stop to think about the price of the items on the menu? What determines how much we pay for a burger and fries? Fast-food restaurants utilize many different pricing tactics, but the most common strategies include value pricing, penetration pricing, customary pricing and bundle pricing.
 
Value Pricing

Value pricing assumes that customers see price as a primary indicator of a product’s value. Value pricing occurs when a company increases a product’s benefits while either maintaining or decreasing the price. A great example of value pricing is the ability to “super-size” drinks and fries at a fast-food restaurant. The value of the drink or fries is increased because a customer can get significantly more of an item for a fraction more of the cost.
 
Penetration Pricing

Penetration pricing is the act of setting the initial sales price far lower than what the normal selling price would be in order to infiltrate the market. The goal behind penetration pricing is to appeal to a broader audience and increase market share. Fast-food restaurants often utilize penetration pricing when introducing a new menu item. For example, a restaurant may set the initial sales price of new item at 99 cents. After the introductory period, the sales price will increase significantly.
 
Customary Pricing

Customary pricing is established by tradition or competition, and fast-food restaurants employ customary pricing on a regular basis. For example, if the majority of fast-food restaurants are selling cheeseburgers for a dollar, every other fast-food restaurant has to sell its cheeseburgers for a dollar, too, or risk losing sales to the competition.
 
Bundle Pricing

Bundle pricing is the act of marketing and selling two or more products as a package with the intent of saving the customer money. Fast-food restaurants engage in bundle pricing quite frequently. They may call it a value meal or a meal deal. A customer can purchase a sandwich, fries and a drink as a value meal for far less than the price of purchasing each item separately.
