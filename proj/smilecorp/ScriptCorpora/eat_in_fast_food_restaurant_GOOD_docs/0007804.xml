Located near Lakota West, Cornerstone was really the only mid-priced, non-chain restaurant in that area (right off the expressway). I&apos;ve frequented this restaurant for almost 7 years, but over time, the restaurant has declined. Sure, they still offer an impressive selection of sandwiches served on artisan breads, and their vegetarian offers go beyond the standard&quot;bean sprouts, portabello mushroom, roasted red pepper&quot;combo. They offer a variety of salads and usually four soups.

While the food hasn&apos;t really lost anything, it was the service that really disappointed me after the recent ownership change. Those behind the counter were standoffish, a bit sharper and condescending when telling me that they&quot;no longer had&quot;the sandwich I wanted to order. I asked&quot;Then why is it still on the menu?&quot;and there was no response. They were also surprisingly slow in making my order. Salads shouldn&apos;t take 10 minutes, really, and they seemed confused as to what to put in the salad. Even more annoying was the exasperated look I got when I asked for the homemade croutons for my soup to go; understand that these croutons are served with dine-in orders but for some reasons, never with carry-out orders.

I used to dine here frequently--probably once a week--since it was close to my office. However, with the decline in service and the change in ownership, I haven&apos;t dined there in three or four months. Pity, because they used to be good.

This is a great little local place with a wide variety of food (pizza, sandwiches, soups, etc.). It&apos;s under new management as well - and from reading other reviews, they do not use the wood tray things anymore, it&apos;s very clean and the service is always good. They are always running a special each day (free cookie day, free bottle of water with purchase, etc.) and $5 meals. Love the local places - avoid the chains and get great food!

I went back to this place after a long time and all the problems that it had, seemed to have gone. They used to have bad service and it used to be very dirty....but no more. The place looks so nice. It&apos;s been re-done, the food is much better and the service is excellent. I ordered a pizza and enjoyed a nice glass of wine with it....it was great! They also have internet access now. If you haven&apos;t been there recently, I would recommend checking it out.

Cornerstone Cafe provides easy access from I-75 and the food is very good. However, as a local resident, I have a complaint which I have mentioned to the owner but customer input is aparently not important - They serve their food on wood platters with paper over the platter - food is placed on the paper; platters aren&apos;t real sanitary - They don&apos;t appear to get washed frequently. Also, the last impression a customer has when leaving a fast food restaurant is the ease of which disposal of cups, napkins, etc. - Everyone hates having to touch a dirty waste container. At cornerstone, their waste baskets are Nasty!!! and they require that you touch the cover wich is always dirty. As a local, I no longer go their - they have some cleaning-up to do before I will return.
