I love Chick-fil-a, their food is probably the most delicious, flavorful, and consistent available in a fast food joint. This location is consistent with the Chick-fil-a experience found round the country.

As mentioned in my check-in tip, I love the availability of the healthier grilled chicken nuggets at no additional cost. Excellent for those watch calories, fats, or carbs but still wanting a high protein meal that is cheap, quick, and convenient. Additionally, with the grilled nuggets being remarkably healthy, if you order the combo with fries and unsweetened tea you can have a decent meal for under 650 calories.

I suffer from Chickfilaitis, a condition where i only crave ChickfilA on Sundays.  Anyways, i usually get the grilled chicken sandwich and enjoy the mustard that comes with it.  Also, I like trying their shakes and different sauces to go with the waffle fries.  The only thing about this location is it&apos;s a mess sometimes trying to get out if there during a busy time.

Great place!  This is the Cadillac of Fast Food restaurants.

I love this place.  People are friendly and polite.  I love that when I say &quot;Thank You!&quot;  I always get a &quot;My Pleasure&quot; as an answer.  I love that the bathrooms are always clean.  I love that employees help carry my tray to my table when my hands are full.  I love that occasionally my kids get balloons and stuffed cows.  I love that the chicken nuggets seem to be made of  . . . get this . . . chicken ! ! !

This is what fast food should be.  Real food.  Polite employees. Clean store.  Tasty.  Best milkshakes ever.  I cannot beleive that I am giving a fast food restaurant a 5*.

Don&apos;t miss the breakfast bagel with egg and cheese and chicken.  Wow!

Everyone knows Chick-fil-A has amazing food, but this particular Chick-fil-A has outstanding staff.  Like all Chick-fil-A&apos;s, they always respond with &quot;My Pleasure&quot; when you thank them for something.  The manager is extremely kind and has walked around to people&apos;s tables asking them how their dining experience has been.  They also have very friendly staff who ask whether you need refills or for your trash to be thrown away. This past Christmas, this location allowed me and my friends to hold a bake sale and sing Christmas carols outside of their restaurant in order to raise money for African missions projects.  Not a lot of restaurants allow things like that, and it made a huge impact on my loyalty to this particular location.  They get my business often! :)

Give the company a royal bow for honoring a long tradition of service to the customer with basic happiness and courtesy.  It&apos;s so refreshing to see people who are happy to be working and remember that DOING a good job is always more important than HAVING a good job. Thank you!
And it&apos;s nice to get a movement of the classic car and bike during the summers to encourage people to get together outside and check out the hot rods and crotch rockets!

I looove Chick-fil-A, the waffle fries are excellent, the people are quick and very friendly.  They always kindly accommodate my order of just a little bit of ice in my sweet tea.

I haven&apos;t had anything on the menu that I haven&apos;t liked.  I have to admit I&apos;m also a fan of the cow in the costume.  :-)

I love pretty much all chick fil as.  They speak English, are polite and always get your order correctly.  Plus their chicken is amazing, waffle fries are delish and Polynesian sauce is yummo.  They are even gracious when getting your free drink refill.  The best fast food chain hands down!

Great food for a fast food place. The quality of the food I would compare to Red Robin. (It&apos;s not great food but for fast food that&apos;s awesome!) My chicken sandwich wasn&apos;t like a nasty processed patty like at McDonalds. It was thick and juicy. Great prices too!

I love chickfila&apos;s food and will always be a fan. There is no other fast food like this and the staff is always friendly (as in ALL chickfila locations).

My favorite is mixing the sweet tea with lemonade!

I would like to preface by saying that any racial views and observations below are in no way meant to be racially nor stereotypically negative. Any traces that may show through my words are the result of having achieved a level of vocabulary comparable to a newly born infant of a cavecouple that has lived their entire lives in isolation from society in the cavernous caves if Northeastern Wyoming. No cows or children were hurt during the writing of this review
***

Five stars for this Chick-Fil-A.

Some people think it&apos;s a waste to review chains. I disagree. Yes, chains carry the same items for the most part, and some food establishment chains may also get cooked/frozen/packaged from corporate kitchens and warehouses. However, service, cleanliness, and the quality of these precooked/preprocessed foods differ from store to store. Employees differ, which is an important note because they are the face of the franchise at that moment in time.

As this is only the 2nd Chick-Fil-A that I&apos;ve been to, I can&apos;t say how all other locations are. But gosh darn it if this isn&apos;t the absolute best fast food chain establishment that I&apos;ve ever been to.

Every time I get into the parking lot or drive-through line:

- I can&apos;t help whistling the &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; song in my head
- This leads to self conversation between Beaver, June, and Eddie Haskell
- My mood gets better
- My belly seems smaller
- My wii-wii seems bigger

All this happens every time I come here, which is during lunchtime when this place is *ALWAYS MASSIVELY PACKED*. There&apos;s no avoiding the huge crowds here during weekday lunchtime.

Every employee I&apos;ve been in contact with or even just seen has been super duper nice. Always a smile on their face. Truth be told, it creeps me out a little how nice everybody here is because, in this day and age, it&apos;s rare to see people even act that happy while working. Kinda like Southern hospitality had a baby with Midwest values.

They all do their jobs with commendable pride, which is sadly lacking in every other fast food chain that I&apos;ve been to. They all genuinely look like they&apos;re happy working there. That&apos;s a little creepy too.

On top of that, the vast majority of the employees here are white. I&apos;ll say it again: the vast majority of the employees here are white. And the 2 Latinas that I saw were behind the counter. The Asian lady was the order-put-togetherer. The white employees were cleaning the tables, taking out the trash, handing out samples of fruit parfait, etc. AND they looked happy doing it.

You know what? Even my food always tastes &quot;nice&quot;. Like June Cleaver nice. And happy. Like gay, but not gay as in gay, but gay as in happy. I guess it&apos;s like the belief that well cared for animals produce better meat due to the lack of bad toxins that reside in animals that are scared or stressed all the time. I don&apos;t think anything beats an Original Chicken Sandwich with 3 packets of high-fat mayonnaise. Or a Chicken Club with 3 packets of mayonnaise. Or the chicken nuggets dipped in 3 packets of mayonnaise. I wish portion size was a bit bigger, but I&apos;m not gonna further complain as long as the service doesn&apos;t change.

I swear, coming here is like therapy. It&apos;s like I come here for douchebag detox. Because of the employees, I can&apos;t help but to be nice myself. And smile a little bit more. Like what I said about whistling and feeling happier and feeling skinnier, that feeling stays with me for the rest of the day. I even think that any bad tensions between people can be cured by some douchebag detox at this Chick-Fil-A.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++­++++++++++

Shit. I read Nick E.&apos;s review after I wrote mine. I should have just plagiarized

Many people might not think that fast food joints deserve props on Yelp, but I have to review based on experience and service. The Chick-Fil-A in Sterling next to Lowe&apos;s near the Dulles Town Center Mall is one of the most exceptional fast food restaurants that I have ever experienced. Food quality and order accuracy is always wonderful. The employees are extremely courteous, well mannered and speedy. Even if the store seems a bit busy when you first enter the door, you will be served much faster than you would expect. The store is always kept very tidy and clean.

This is one of the few businesses where you&apos;ll walk away thinking that the people working there actually like their jobs and enjoy their work. Strange isn&apos;t it?

Forget the fact that this place is a fast food restaurant.
The service is always, always excellent every time we&apos;ve eaten there.

Their chicken strip and waffle fries are tastier than the chicken from the other fast food places in the region.

Their staff is always friendly and helpful.  Great place for kids.

Plays upbeat and positive Christian music in the morning. A great start of the day.

The chicken biscuit is delicious and the tater rounds are different from other fast food chains. Fruit cups are outstanding!

Service always with a smile. Sit down restaurant at fast food prices. Love it!

And when you say, &quot;Thank you!&quot;, the employees reply, &quot;My Pleasure!&quot; Now that&apos;s a sign of respect and good management training! :)

What can I say, but I love Chick-fil-A.  The food is always good and fresh and the people are always fast and friendly.  I really like the spicy chicken biscuits and sandwich and love their waffle fries.  This location seems very well run and they seem to hire good people to work at it.  They even had people offer to refill me drink while they were out cleaning tables.  How&apos;s that for service at a fast food restaurant?  I only wish they had a Chick-fil-A closer to where I live so I didn&apos;t have to seek them out when I travel.

I don&apos;t really go to McChristian a lot.  And I am certainly not one who would give fast food spots high ratings.

The food here is decent.  Not worth the 4 stars I gave, but still pretty good.

What earned this Chick-Fil-A a 4 star rating from me was the demeanor and pleasantness of the staff when I visited.  The manager was very friendly with us when we ordered.  Moreover, I witnessed one of the employees nicely ask an elderly patron who was eating at a table if he would like a refill on his drink.  I was impressed with that, and so was the elderly patron.

Oh my gosh!  They have the most PLEASANT people working the drive thru.  I have never experienced more efficient and friendly people at any other food place.   Based on this and the fact that I am obsessed with their lemonade and the delish waffle fries with my choice of yummy dips, they get 2 thumbs up from me!

If I HAVE to complain about anything, it is just a personal thing - sometimes the chicken on the sandwich is a little too plump, which kinda creeps me out.  But the all important pickle usually overshadows any doubt I have!

Chick-fil-a is great to begin with, but the one in Sterling/Dulles by the Lowes is superb!  A few weeks ago my boygriend and I used the drive-thru there for lunch.  Three employees were waiting outside at the entrance with reflective vests on, which worried us at first.  Turns out their speaker system was out of service so they were taking orders in person.  One girl showed us a laminated menu and we just pointed at what we wanted.  She spoke it through her headset and immediately had the price ready for us.  We drove on to the pick up window and our order was waiting for us!  Fastest service EVER.  They had the drinks filled and lidded and all the food in the bad along with straws and napkins before we could even drive up (and we were the only car in line).  Phenomenal.

Before we even got home, my boyfriend had called their customer service number to compliment the service there.  We were genuinely impressed.
