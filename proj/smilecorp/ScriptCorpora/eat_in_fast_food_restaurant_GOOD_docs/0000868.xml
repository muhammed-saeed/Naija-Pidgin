 British Columbia 
British Columbia (B.C.) (, C.-B. ) is the westernmost of Canada&apos;s provinces and is known for its natural beauty, as reflected in its Latin motto, Splendor sine occasu (&quot;Splendour without Diminishment&quot;). Its name was chosen by Queen Victoria in 1858. In 1871, it became the sixth province of Canada.
 http://wn.com/British_Columbia Canada 
Canada () is a country in North America, extending from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west and northward into the Arctic Ocean. It is the world&apos;s second largest country by total area. Canada&apos;s common border with the United States to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.

Kaifeng (; Postal map spelling: Kaifeng), formerly known as Bianliang (), Bianjing (), Daliang (), or simply Liang (), is a prefecture-level city in eastern Henan province, People&apos;s Republic of China. Located along the southern bank of the Yellow River, it borders the provincial capital of Zhengzhou to the west, Xinxiang to the northwest, Shangqiu to the east, Zhoukou to the southeast, Xuchang to the southwest, and the province of Shandong to the northeast.

North Burnaby is a general name for a large neighbourhood in the City of Burnaby that includes a number of smaller ones. It stretches from Boundary Road in the west to Burnaby Mountain with Simon Fraser University in the east and bounded by Burrard Inlet to the north and the Lougheed Highway to the south. It is a desirable place to live for many local and immigrant families which is reflected by real-estate prices that keep climbing and have almost doubled in the last 15 years.

&apos;&apos;&apos;Tom&apos;s Restaurant&apos;&apos;&apos; is a diner located at 2880 Broadway on the corner of 112th Street in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, New York, United States. Frequented by students and faculty of nearby Columbia University, it has been owned and operated by the Greek-American Minasizoulis family since the 1950s.

Seinfeld was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment and distributed in association with Columbia Pictures Television and Columbia TriStar Television; Sony Pictures Television has distributed the series since 2002. It was largely co-written by David and Seinfeld with input from numerous script writers, including Larry Charles, Peter Mehlman, Gregg Kavet, Andy Robin, Carol Leifer, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer, Steve Koren, Jennifer Crittenden, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Charlie Rubin, Alec Berg, and Spike Feresten.
