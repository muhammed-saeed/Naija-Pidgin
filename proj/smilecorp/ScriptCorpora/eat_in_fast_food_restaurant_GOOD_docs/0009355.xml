 Throw the takeaway menus in the bin and get in the kitchen 

 Advantages: fantastic healthy versions of takeaways that taste great
 Disadvantages: no recipe for KFC gravy


...Wow!!!!!

We try to limit our take aways to once or twice a week, but this still adds up over the month. We decided just before christmas that we were going to cut down on our orders.

I came across the book The TakeAway Secret on the Martin Lewis money saving website, I am a great believer in what Uncle Martin says. It had a few small reviews but I wanted to give it a go myself.

I decided it would be a great stocking filler for my other half, however I hunted high and low and could not find a copy any where it was totally out of stock, I managed to drop on a copy early in January it cost me a little over 3, I wrapped it up and gave it to my other half as a late christmas gift.

The paperback book is a little plain and boring at first red and white stripy cover and no pictures, but we all know what our favourite takeaways look like any...

Review of The Takeaway Secret: How to Cook Your Favourite Fast-food at Home - Kenny McGovern 
 
 Takeaway taste without the takeaway price! 

 Advantages: Taste
 Disadvantages: High in salt


...These pizzas are my favourite and whenever I spy them on offer in the supermarket I&apos;m ashamed to admit I get quite excited! 

The box is huge and I had trouble fitting it into a carrier bag. It is mainly black in colour and is designed to look like a takeaway box. Half of the box is taken up by a Chicago Town Takeaway logo. The other half has a picture of the pizza. The pizza is frozen and although I usually opt for chilled pizzas I was very keen to buy this. Being frozen, it takes a little longer to cook than chilled pizzas. You need to bake it at 190 degrees for about 25 minutes. Sure enough, after 25 minutes the cheese was bubbling and it looked ready to devour! 

The pizza is absolutely covered in pepperoni, of both a small and larger size. I found the smaller ones to be more spicy and each one was cooked to perfection, there were no...

Review of Chicago Town Takeaway Pepperoni Pile Up 
 
 Takeaway Pizza? Stuff It! 

 Advantages: Large size, cooks well to blend sauces&amp;cheese, crust stuff adequately, tasty
 Disadvantages: Pricey


...I love the snuggled up evenings in with my boyfriend, munching pizza and watching a film from my awful collection. I&apos;m not a big fan of sauces, but Takeaway do some tasty varieties that are very filling and that little bit more special so it&apos;s something I&apos;d recommend if you&apos;re a fan of pizza. This review is for the Takeaway Stuffed Crust, predominantly the pepperoni one.

Chicago Town are one of the bigger names when it comes to pizza and they now have quite a wide range of American influenced pizzas to suit various appetites and taste preferences. The Takeaway Stuffed Crust comes in a few different varieties, including Limited Edition ones (such as for the X-Factor), Four Cheese and pepperoni. It stands out from the crowd in part because it&apos;s quite big, but mostly because of the stuffed crust. I know that other producers have since...
