Scripture: Mark 3:20-35 (NRSV)

Context
 
In the Gospel of Mark, events move rapidly from one thing to the next.“And immediately”is a much used phrase.

This Gospel begins with  the news of Jesus’ministry rather than with birth narratives as in Matthew or Luke or a great cosmological paean as in John. It starts instead with the appearance of John the Baptist in the wilderness as he proclaims“a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins”(1:4).

Jesus is baptized and driven into the wilderness of Judea, where he spends forty  days being“tempted by Satan and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him”(1:13). Jesus’actual  ministry begins far to the north in Galilee, where he preaches, calls his first disciples, and then begins a ministry of healing. He goes on a preaching tour of Galilee, engages in more acts of healing, calls Levi, and responds to rumors and accusations.

Moving on, Jesus heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, cures great numbers of people, and then appoints twelve“whom he also named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to proclaim the message, and to have authority to cast out demons”(1:14-15).

Jesus returns to Capernaum, where he is nearly mobbed by the crowd of people coming to see him. Then comes a“book-end”passage, with Jesus’concerned family framing the episode.

His family–including his mother, his brothers, and apparently his sisters–have come out of concern for him. The word is that Jesus  is“out of his mind,”perhaps because he is forgiving sins which was a prerogative of God alone.

As the family of Jesus shows up, the focus shifts to how he deals with the growing out-of-town opposition that claims he is essentially an instrument of the devil. As he makes his case, he references the so-called“unforgivable sin,”which is attributing to the demonic what properly belongs to God.

The passage then closes by renewed attention to Jesus’family and his enigmatic words that“‘Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother’”(2:35).
 
Reflection Questions

 What is it like to be accused of doing evil when you are seeking to do good? How do you cope with false or unfair accusations? Is your relationship with family ever strained, broken, or tested because of your faith commitment? How do you understand yourself to be part of God’s“eternal family,”made up of those who seek to do the will of God? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us keep on doing good, even when our efforts are misunderstood or misinterpreted.  Help us always to seek to know, to follow, and to do your will as you give us grace, strength, and courage to do so. Thanks you for making it possible for us to be part of Jesus’family and to make a lasting difference in the world. Amen.

Scripture: Acts 1:1-11 (NRSV)

Context
 
These are the opening verses to the so-called“Acts of the Apostles,”which is actually a companion volume to the Gospel of Luke. According to early church tradition, both books are written by Luke, a physician and associate of Paul (see Col 4:14, 2 Tim 4:11, and Philem 24). However, such authorship is nowhere claimed in either volume. It is fair to say, according to the notes in the HarperCollins Study Bible , that the author is apparently a“gentile Christian who has received a good  education and has made careful study of Jewish scriptures.”(p. 2057).

Like the Gospel of Luke, the book of Acts is dedicated to“Theophilus,”which means simply“Friend of God”or“Lover of God.”This may actually be a specific person, or it could represent a category of persons such as recent converts or Roman officials.

Whereas the Gospel of Luke focuses on“all that Jesus did taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven,”(Acts 1:1), the book of Acts deals with the story of the early church, including the continuity of the church with Israel. The book is never actually named“Acts of the Apostles,”but that is how it came to be known.

The first verses of the Book of Acts recount Jesus’ascension into heaven, which took place on the fortieth day from the day of his resurrection. The location is not specified in the Book of Acts, but it is identified as Bethany in the Gospel of Luke (24:50). In both accounts, the apostles–as they are termed in Acts–are instructed to remain in Jerusalem. In each account, there is a promise of power that will come upon them from God.

In Acts, the apostles evidence their continued lack of understanding of Jesus’words when they ask,“Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”(1:6).  Jesus does not give them an answer except to remind them that this is one of those things that“the Father has set by his own authority.”(1:7). Instead, they are to wait for power from God to be with witnesses“in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and tot he ends of the earth”(1:8).

According to Acts, Jesus was“lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight”(1:10). In Luke, Jesus“withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven”(1:51). In Acts, the apostles gaze upward until they are visited suddenly by“two men in white robes”who assure them that Jesus would come again in the same way that they saw him go into heaven.   There is no mention of such a visitation in the Gospel of Luke. Instead, the apostles“worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy; and they were continually in the temple blessing God”(24:52-53).
 
Reflection Questions

 When and where have you experienced Jesus“disappearing from sight,”leaving behind unanswered questions and continuing bewilderment? Who shows up to remind you about Jesus’promise? In what form or shape do they appear? How do you understand the“promise of power”in this day and time, as compared with the time of Jesus’ascension? Where has Jesus directed you to wait? How do you know when the promised power has come? How do you do“in the meantime?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, bless us as we wait for the promise of power that is for us as well as for the early believers. May we not become so comfortable in waiting that we fail to notice the work of the Holy Spirit among us, within us, and through us. Help us to live“in the meantime”in faithfulness and with integrity. In Jesus’name we pray. Amen.

Scripture: Numbers 21:4-9 (NRSV)

Context
 
For me, this is one of the odder episodes of the Exodus. It is a story of disobedience, death, and despair that ends–surprisingly enough–with help, healing, and hope.

The people of Israel were complaining–again. There was always plenty of subject matter. Sometimes it was the lack of water. Sometimes it was the lack of food. Sometimes it was the quality of the food. Almost always, it had to do with the matter of their leaders–primarily Moses.

The people continue to wander in the wilderness, with years yet to go. They are doing so primarily because they had earlier refused to believe the possibility–indeed, the promise–that they could  overcome the obstacles that stood in the way of their entry into the Promised Land (See Numbers 13-14).

And so they wander. As they do so, they cannot keep from complaining, even though their situation is a result of their own lack of faith and foresight.  This time, it is not just about their human leadership but about“against God and against Moses”(21:5).

Suddenly,“fiery snakes”are unleashed among them,  biting people indiscriminately so that“many Israelites died”(21:6). In response to their petitions and Moses’prayer, God provides a remedy–instrucint that an image of their affliction might be affixed on a pole and“lifted up,”so that“everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live’(Numbers 21:8).

What might be called a“ Snake on a Stake ”proves to have remarkable healing powers. This odd episode might have faced into obscurity except for one thing. It becomes the incident that Jesus cited in his conversation one night with Nicodemus, as recounted  in the Gospel of John.

“And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,”Jesus said,“so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life”(3:14-15).
 
Reflection Questions

 Do we usually  blame others for our situation or take responsibility for the fix in which we find ourselves? Do we  blame God for the bad things that happen to us–or to those whom we love? How does“facing our fear(s)”bring help, healing, and hope for us? How can God lift our eyes–and our hearts–to find healing and hope in the midst of desperation and despair? 

Prayer

Gracious God, we sometimes find ourselves wandering aimlessly in the wilderness of our lives, not even recognizing that our own failures in faith have brought us to this point. When bad things happen to us, let it become an opportunity to return to you and find healing and hope in the midst of desperation and despair. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 1:9-15 (NRSV)

”In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.’  And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.

Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.’“

Context

The Gospel of Mark begins abruptly with news of the coming of John the Baptist, in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah.  Matthew and Luke each give two chapters to other subjects before arriving at the story of John the Baptist. Even the Gospel of John, which expresses no interest in the birth stories of Jesus, has a  cosmological poem of praise before recounting the appearance of John the Baptist(1:1-19).

In Mark, the story begins with the sudden–and apparently unannounced–appearance of John the Baptist in the wilderness,“proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins”(Mark 1:1:4). His message is one of repentance and anticipation. He baptizes with water, but the one who is coming“will baptize you with the Holy Spirit’”(Mark 1:8)

With no more introduction than that, Jesus comes into the picture. No mention is made of geographical location, although it is evidently at the Jordan River in Judea. As is typical in the Gospel of Mark, things move“immediately”from one thing to the next.

In a few short words, the Gospel of Mark recounts Jesus’baptism at the hands of John, Jesus’temptation in the wilderness (and the angels’ministry to him), and the beginning of his own ministry. The speed with which the story is recounted almost takes the breath away.

Underscoring it all, however, is the affirmation that Jesus experienced at his baptism, as he both saw and heard God’s validation of him, even before he had done anything.“‘You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased’”(Mark 1:11).

And so, without elaboration or discussion, the story of Jesus’ministry begins, as he proclaims,“‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.’“

Reflection Questions

 Does God tend to work gradually or suddenly in your life? Who is the one who has“paved the way”for you in your journey of faith? What experience of God’s affirmation or validation sustains you in times of difficulty? How would you summarize the message God has given you to share with others? 

Prayer

O God, we thank you for the odd and peculiar people that you sometimes send before us. Help us not to be embarrassed by them but blessed by them. May their words and actions help us understand more of who we are and more of who you are. And may we move into our own ministry with a clear conviction of what to say and what to do, how to live and what to give. Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 13:1-9, 18-23 (NRSV)

Context
 
Chapter twelve in the Gospel of Matthew is given over to controversy and increasing conflict. The controversy has to do with violations of the sabbath, first the issue of picking grain on the sabbath (12:1-8) and then  healing a man with a withered hand on the sabbath(12:9-14).

Then comes an expansion of Jesus’healing ministry, with the admonition to those healed“not to make him known”(12:15-16). A demoniac, who is also blind and mute, is then brought to him, as opponents more or less up the ante to see what happens.

To a mixture of amazement and dismay, Jesus meets the challenge, so that the individual is not only cured of possession but can then also see and hear.  This provokes messianic speculation among the crowds and resentment among the religious authorities, who allege that Jesus is essentially an instrument of the devil(12:22-24).

The remainder of chapter twelve is given over to Jesus’response to this accusation (12:25-32), commentary about“a tree and its fruit,”conversation about“the sign of Jonah”(12:38-42), and concern about“this evil generation”(12:43-45). It closes with the poignant picture of Jesus’mother and brothers, standing outside and waiting to speak with him. It is entirely possible that, as in the Gospel of Mark, they are afraid that he is out of his mind (3:20-21; see also Mark 3:31-35).

The thirteenth chapter is the beginning of Jesus’third discourse (out of five altogether in the Gospel of Matthew). Unlike other occasions when he preaches or teaches, Jesus uses a boat to gain a little distance from the crowd and presumably be heard by more people. He is seated, which is the traditional posture for a teacher.

He uses the example of a farmer who went out to plant seed, using the method of sowing that would have been familiar to those in the crowd. At first hearing, it sounds like the sower wasn’t particularly proficient–sowing seed on the path, rocky ground, and among thorns as well as on good soil. But the point is not proficiency but in the extravagance of the sower, in spreading seed all possible sorts and kinds and varieties of soil!

And extravagance is also seen in the results–though not in three of the four instances. According to one knowledgeable authority (Joachim Jeremias in The Parables of Jesus), a first-century harvest would have been seven-fold to ten-fold. Thirty-fold would be bountiful, and a hundred-fold amazing!
 
Reflection Questions

 How has this parable been interpreted for us in the past? Has there been a temptation it to be moralistic, i.e., that we are responsible for“becoming good soil?” Do we ever think of ourselves as the ones“sowing the seeds,”or do we think it is only Jesus–or someone officially in charge of things? Do we realize the extravagance of God’s grace–and the promised results? 

Prayer
 
Lord, we often want to limit the extravagance and generosity of your grace. We want to confine your grace to predictable areas. But your grace is such to be extended far beyond what we would have expected or imagined. Help us be open to your extravagant grace and to rejoice in the promised harvest. Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 11:16-19, 25-30 NRSV

Context
 
This passage takes place after Jesus completes his directions to the disciples as he sends them forth on their mission(Matthew 10). Perhaps unexpectedly, he does not go with them or wait for them to return. Instead, he continues his own itinerant teaching mission, presumably in the cities of Galilee(11:1).

By this time, news of Jesus’ministry has come to John, then in prison. John sends his disciples to ask Jesus a key question,“Are you the one who is to come, or are to wait for another?”(11:3). There is apparently some  doubt in John’s mind about Jesus’status as messiah(cf. 3:13-17). So he dispatches emissaries to ask Jesus, essentially in code, his messianic status or identity.

Asked a question in code, Jesus responds in kind. He tells John’s disciples to go and tell what they see and hear(11:4-6), i.e.,“the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.”This list dovetails clearly with the testimony of Isaiah (35:5-6) about what will characterize the“return of the redeemed to Zion.”The inference is that the evidence in plain sight should be convincing and compelling, but John will have to decide for himself–just as we do.

Jesus then begins to speak favorably about John, asserting that, for those“willing to accept it, he is Elijah”. . . that is, the forerunner of the messiah.  Neither Jesus nor John, however, has received the kind of welcome that should have been expected, at least from the religious authorities of the time. The complaint about John is that he is too strict. The complaint about Jesus is that he is too lenient.  People are upset with each of them, though for opposite reasons.

Jesus’frustration is vented in the five verses not included in this week’s lesson (11:20-24). They are words of rebuke for towns in Galilee that should have responded to Jesus’ministry with repentance and thanksgiving, but instead have gone their own self-absorbed way.

After these words of reproach, the focus of the passage changes dramatically. It moves from disgust with the proud and haughty  who reject Jesus to appreciation for the lowly and humble who accept him. It closes with a powerful invitation for all those who are“weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest”(11:28).

Rest, of course, is not a permanent condition. It is meant to be a time of refreshment and renewal. We are not exempt from carrying a burden; instead, we are called to share it with one who knows the situation best of all. We are not freed from the yoke of obedience; we are partnered with one who knows us and desires the best for us.
 
Reflection Questions

 When are we like the proud and haughty who live like they have no need of Jesus? When  are we like the humble and penitent who know clearly  their need of Jesus? What is most burdensome to us in the life of faith? What weighs us down? What wears us out? What would the rest promised by Jesus look like? What would it feel like? What would it sound like? What would it taste like? When are we at our best in meeting the opportunities and challenges of faith? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us not to live as though we have no need of you. Help us to live humbly. Help us to live wisely. Help us to hear your invitation to come to you and find rest. May we take your yoke upon us and learn from you. Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 10:26-42 (NRSV)

Context
 
The Gospel of Matthew receives sustained attention in the“ Season after Pentecost ,”the longest season in the liturgical year. It begins with Trinity Sunday, the first Sunday after Pentecost, and continues through Christ the King Sunday, the last Sunday before Advent.

The Gospel of Matthew represents a fusion or synthesis of different elements. It follows the geographical outline in the Gospel of Mark in which Jesus’ministry moves from Galilee to Jerusalem.

The Gospel of Matthew has birth stories at the beginning and resurrection appearances at the end. It begins with the genealogy of Jesus, traced back to Abraham through David (1:1-17). It ends with the“Great Commission,”delivered on an unspecified mountain in Galilee (28:16-20).

The Gospel of Matthew contains five major“discourses,”each concluded in much the same way. [See 5:1-7,10:5-42, 13:1-52, 18:1-35, 24:3-25:46.] This may be a way of recalling the five books of the Torah, with Jesus understood“as a new Moses offering a new Torah that fulfills, yet supersedes, the old (13.52)”( The HarperCollins Study Bible , p. 1858).

In this passage, Jesus is addressing the disciples, named individually in 10:2. He gives them“authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every sickness”(10:1).

Jesus specifies their mission (10:5-15), and he speaks of coming persecutions. He sends them out“like sheep into the midst of wolves,”so they are to be“wise as serpents and innocent as doves”(10:16).

Despite the ordeal facing them, the disciples are to“have no fear”of those who so vigorously and violently oppose them”(10:26a). After dealing with the“cost of discipleship,”Jesus then turns to the issue of“the reward for hospitality.”

The reward is not given to the disciples–or to Jesus for that matter. The reward is for those who respond in welcome and hospitality for those coming among them in the name of Jesus.

The reward is not anything monetary or magical.  It is being acknowledged by Jesus before God in heaven (10:32-33). It is seeing and hearing what“many prophets and righteous people longed to see . . . but did not see it, and to hear . . . but did not hear it”(13:17). It is shining“like the sun in the kingdom of their Father”(13:43). It may even mean suffering–and dying–for the sake of being faithful(23:29-39).
 
Reflection Questions

 Do we expect to be exempt from suffering when we follow Jesus? What instructions or guidance does Jesus give us today? What is the reward that we expect for following Jesus? What’s in it for us? What’s in it for others? Is there any cost to the discipleship that we are called to practice? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to follow the path that you set before us. Encourage us, guide us, bless us. In Jesus’name we pray. Amen.

Scripture: Acts 1:1-11 (NRSV) 

Context
 
This passage opens the Book of Acts, which is the companion volume to the Gospel of Luke. They are both apparently written by the same individually, traditionally Luke–a physician and associate of Paul (Col. 4:14, 2 Tim. 4:11, Philemon 24). However, neither book specifically attributes authorship to a particular individual.

The book is addressed to“Theophilus,”a name that means“lover of God.”This may have been an actual person–”perhaps a recent convert asking for instruction or a Roman official whose tolerance the church seeks”( The HarperCollins Study Bible , p. 2057). It is also possible that the book is intended for anyone who“loves God,”whoever that person may be.
 
The opening verses recount the ascension of Jesus into heaven, a reality also reported in the closing verses of the Gospel of Luke (24:50-53). The description in the Book of Acts is more extensive that what is found in the Gospel of Luke.
 
It specifies that Jesus appeared to the disciples (now called“apostles”) during a period of forty days. He instructed them to remain in Jerusalem for an indeterminate time, waiting“for the promise of the Father”(Acts 1:4). He alluded to the coming baptism of the Holy Spirit,“not many days from now,”but he did not specify what that meant.
 
Jesus’teaching about the kingdom of God was clearly not something that the disciples understood.  They still thought that it meant some sort of earthly kingdom, and they wanted to know when it would occur.  Jesus told them–and us, if we listen!–that it is not for us to know. Instead, our task is to wait expectantly for the coming of the Holy Spirit.
 
Jesus did leave his disciples with specific promises. One, they would receive power, when the Holy Spirit came upon them. Two, they would be witnesses for Jesus“in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth”(1:8)
 
Reflection Questions

 Do we consider ourselves“those who love God?”How is that evidenced in our lives? What is it that we most want to know from Jesus? How do we handle the reality that there are some things that we will never know–at least not in this life? What would the power of the Holy Spirit look like in our lives? Where is God calling us to be witnesses? How is God calling us to live our lives“in the meantime,”that is, between where we are now and the promised coming of the spirit on–and in–our lives? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to hear your words–again and again, if needed–about how we are called to live and what we are called to do. Keep us from being dissatisfied with not knowing all the details. Keep alive in us the promise of the power of the Holy Spirit, and empower us to be witnesses wherever you may send us. Amen.

Scripture: John 10:1-10 (NRSV) 

Context
 
This passage comes immediately after the healing of a man born blind(9:1-41) and just prior to the raising of Lazarus (11:1-45). These two“signs”of Jesus’power are the last in a series that began with Jesus turning the water to wine at the wedding feast in Cana of Galilee (2:1-11) Then came the healing of a royal official’s son (4:46-54), the healing on the Sabbath at the pool called Bethzatha (5:1-18), the feeding of the five thousand (6:1-14), and Jesus walking on the water (6:15-21).

Jesus’words about shepherds and sheep are directed specifically to the Pharisees, who were upset at his healing the blind man on the Sabbath.  In these verses, Jesus does not explicitly identify himself as the“good shepherd.”That will come later–in verse 11.

Instead, Jesus outlines the qualities of a true shepherd, including entering by the gate, calling“his own sheep by name,”leading them out, and going ahead of them (10:3-5). The Pharisees, he infers, are shepherds without faithfulness or integrity, but“they did not understand what he was saying to them”(10:6).

Aware of the Pharisees’cluelessness, Jesus goes on to make his point more specifically. He offers one of the“I am”sayings that are scattered throughout the Gospel of John, saying,“Very truly, I am the gate for the sheep”(10:7).  With verse 11, his claim will become even more specific, affirming“ I am the good shepherd”(10:11). [See also John 6:35, 8:12, 11:25, 14:6, and 15:1 for the other &quot;I am&quot; sayings.]
 
In the closing verse of this passage, Jesus highlights one of the themes of the Gospel of John about the purpose of his life and work.“I came,”he says in verse 10,“that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”[See also 1:4, 3:16, 4:14, 5:26, 6:27, 6:40, 6:47, etc.]

These is an extraordinary claim, but its power can be diminished by familiarity. The translation by Eugene Person in The Message makes it more compelling,“I came so they can have real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of.”
 
Reflection Questions

 How is Jesus the means by which we find shelter, strength, and safety? How do we hear Jesus calling our name? What happens when we put ourselves in charge of our journey and choice of destination? How do we experience Jesus’gift of life,“more and better than we ever dreamed of?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, thank you for caring for us. Forgive us for not recognizing your presence in our lives. Help us to hear your voice and follow you, without complaining about the journey or arguing about the destination. Help us to know your gift of life,“more and better than we ever dreamed!”Amen.

 Guide to Prayer and Study for May 8 
 May 4, 2011 
Text: Luke 24:13-35 (NRSV) 

Context
 
May 8 is the third Sunday of Easter. The season of Easter lasts fifty days, from Easter Sunday until Pentecost. It encompasses the forty days that Jesus spent with his disciples until ascending into heaven and the ten days from the Ascension until Pentecost.

This Sunday’s reading continues the pattern of resurrection appearances, though now from the Gospel of Luke rather than from the Gospel of John. The story of the two disciples“on the road to Emmaus”is recounted only in the Gospel of Luke. The physical location of Emmaus is not known, although there are several possibilities .

This account tells the story of two disciples, one named Cleopas and the other unnamed, and their encounter with Jesus. The name, Cleopas , is not used anywhere else in the New Testament. It is an abbreviated form of“Cleopatros,”a common name of the time meaning “son of a renowned father.” The other disciple is never named, and his (or her) identity has never been decidedly determined.

These two disciples are traveling together, dejected and despairing over what had happened in Jerusalem that week. Jesus himself comes near,“but their eyes were kept from recognizing him”(Luke 24:16). They travel together, with Jesus admonishing them and then unfolding the message of scripture to them about the Messiah (24:25-27).

In a traditional gesture of hospitality, the two disciples insist that their still unknown companion stay with them, since the day was nearly done. At table with them, he takes bread, blesses and breaks it, and gives it to them.

These are almost exactly the same words used to describe Jesus’actions at the Last Supper (22:19). They are the same actions used in the feeding of the five thousand (9:12-17). They are what the host at a meal would do in the home. In this ordinary act,“their eyes are opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight”(24:31).

After the fact, they realized that Jesus had been with them all along. Indeed, as they reflected on their experience, they recalled that their“hearts [were] burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us.”(24:32). Undeterred by their fatigue or the lateness of the hour, they return the seven miles to Jerusalem to share the remarkable news.
 
Reflection Questions

 What are the things that“keep our eyes”from seeing the presence of Jesus with us? How often do we not recognize Jesus’presence with us until the moment is past? In what common, ordinary actions do we suddenly (and unexpectedly) experience the presence and power of Jesus? With whom have we shared the glorious good news of Jesus’resurrected reality? 

Prayer
 
Lord, forgive us when we do not recognize the reality of your presence,“walking and talking”with us. Help us to see you in the common, ordinary actions of life. Bless with a commitment to urgent hospitality, rather than letting convenience or custom get in the way. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 10:35-45 (NRSV)
 
James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And he said to them, “What is it you want me to do for you?” And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” They replied, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”

When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. So Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”
 
Context
 
Jesus and his disciples are on their way to Jerusalem. At the beginning of the journey, Jesus cured a blind man, though it took him two tries to get it right (8:22-26). During the journey, the disciples are the ones who appear unable to see or understand anything clearly–despite Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi (8:27-30) and the Transfiguration of Jesus (9:2-8).

Jesus spoke  clearly about  his impending death (and resurrection)–not just once or twice, but three times. However, the disciples managed only to argue about who among them was the greatest (Mark 9:33-37), complain about someone else casting out demons in Jesus’name (9:38-42), and try to keep people from bringing little children to Jesus for his blessing (10:13-16).

In this passage, James and John try to work out a private deal with Jesus so that they can be assured places of prominence and prestige in the coming kingdom.   They clearly do not (yet) understand what Jesus is saying and are looking out primarily for themselves.

The two disciples claim naively that they can“drink the cup”that Jesus will drink and be“baptized with the baptism”with which he will be baptized. They have no idea what this commitment will really mean, but Jesus does not scold them or chastise them for their lack of understanding. Indeed, he tells them that they will, indeed, go through what he has gone through.
 
Reflection Questions

 What“special privileges”do we expect in being disciples of Jesus? Exemption from suffering? Healing from illness? Long life? Prosperity? As we grow in the faith, how does Jesus help us understand more fully what it really  means to walk with him? How do we find ways to serve others authentically? 

Prayer
 
Lord, thank you for your patience and your guidance. Continue to walk with us in our journey of faith. Strengthen in us the commitment to“drink the cup”that you drink and be“baptized with the baptism”which you experienced. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 10:46-52 (NRSV)
 
They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” Jesus stood still and said, “Call him here.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; get up, he is calling you.” So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “My teacher, let me see again.” Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has made you well.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.
 
Context
 
Jesus and his disciples continue on his journey to Jerusalem. He has told them of his coming death and resurrection three times (8:31-9:1, 9:30-31, 10:32-34), but they seem not to grasp what he is saying. The disciples quarrel along the way which of them was the greatest (9:33-37), and James and John try for special treatment (10:35-40).

As they come to Jericho, a large crowd has become part of Jesus’entourage. The excitement–and apprehension–were mounting. Jerusalem–and the triumphal entry–is literally the next stop. Just as they are leaving Jericho, a blind man–without even his own name–calls repeatedly  for Jesus to have mercy on him.

“Bartimaeus”isn’t actually a name, even though that is how it appears to us. It simply identifies this man as the“Son of Timaeus.”Regardless of his namelessness, he knows precisely what he wants. He wants to see–not for the first time, but again. Without any further ado, Jesus announces the fact of his healing. And this unknown and unnamed man follows Jesus on the way to Jerusalem.
 
Reflection Questions

 Do you ever find yourself in spiritual darkness? What keeps you there? What brings you forth? Does Jesus’healing of this blind man bring questions to your mind? If so, what are they? If not, why not? What is the“light at the end of the tunnel for you?” What does Jesus need to say or do for you to follow him on his way? 

Prayer
 
Lord, give us the courage to call for help in the midst of our blindness. Give us the faith to believe in your power and purpose for our lives. And grant us the commitment to travel the path with you. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 12:28-34
 
One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the first of all?” 29 Jesus answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” Then the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that ‘he is one, and besides him there is no other’; and ‘to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength,’ and ‘to love one’s neighbor as oneself,’ —this is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that no one dared to ask him any question.
 
Context
 
Jesus has arrived in Jerusalem. According to the Gospel of Mark, he has entered the city in triumph-riding on a previously unridden colt (11:1-11), cursed a fig tree (11:12-14), cleansed the Temple (11:15-19), interpreted the withering of the fig tree (11:20-26), dealt with challenges to his authority (11:27-33), told the parable of the wicked tenants (12:1-12), handled the issue of paying taxes (12:13-17), and responded judiciously to a question about the resurrection (12:18-27).

Jesus’time of testing continues with the arrival of a scribe who asks an apparently innocent question about the greatest of the commandments–a traditional point of conversation or debate.  Jesus responds by citing not one commandment but two, what we have come to call the“Great Commandments.”They come from Deuteronomy 6:4-5 and Leviticus 19:18.

Perhaps surprisingly, the scribe concurs with Jesus’assessment. Jesus concludes with a word of affirmation that the scribe is“…not far from the kingdom of God”(12:34b).
 
Reflection Questions

 How do we deal with Jesus’presence in the midst of our lives? Do we seek to argue him into submission, or do we listen to what he has to say? What are truly the“greatest commandments”for us? How do we love God with all our heart and soul and mind and strength? Who are the neighbors whom God gives us? 

Prayer
 
Lord, thank you for coming among us and responding to our questions. Help us to live by the great commandments, as we seek to grow in our love of God and love of neighbor. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 12:38-44 (NRSV)
 
As he taught, he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets! They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”He sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which are worth a penny. Then he called his disciples and said to them, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”
 
Context
 
Jesus continues teaching in the temple, challenging the scribes with questions they cannot answer and then denouncing them for their pretentious and self-serving ways.

Jesus is situated in the the“ Court of the Women .”There would have been both men and women there. It was named in this manner because this was as far as women could go in the temple grounds.

In the latter portion of the scripture, Jesus is situated across from the temple treasury . From this vantage point, he could easily see people putting their money in the offering receptacles, which were metal and shaped like trumpets. There were thirteen of them, designated for a variety of purposes. It would have been easy to hear the sound of coins being dropped into them, with the size and kind of offering being readily obvious.

There were those who would have made a great show of how much they were giving. Their generosity would have been readily apparent. The“poor widow,”however, had only two small coins to offer. The more generous gifts are not condemned, but hers is clearly commended.
 
Reflection Questions

 What behavior of the scribes does Jesus condemn? Is it their wealth, or is it their pretension? Whom do we seek to impress with our giving? What do we seek to accomplish with our giving? How does this woman’s gift exemplify John Wesley’s teaching in his sermon,“ The Use of Money ,”that we are to“earn all we can, save all we can, [and] give all we can?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, we are more wealthy than we realize. Help us to be generous, without having to have the attention of others. Amen.

Scripture: 1 Samuel 2:1-10 (NRSV)
 
Hannah prayed and said, “My heart exults in the Lord; my strength is exalted in my God. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in my victory. “There is no Holy One like the Lord, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength. Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn. The Lord kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up. The Lord makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts. He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and on them he has set the world. “He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail. The Lord! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.”
 
Context
 
The two books of Samuel cover the transition in the history of Israel from the time of the Judges to the inauguration of the kingship, with Saul and David being the first rulers. These books begin, appropriately enough,  with the story of their namesake.

Samuel’s birth comes about as a result of apparent divine intervention. His mother, Hannah, is one of the two wives of Elkanah. His father’s other wife, Penninah, has borne several children to her husband, and she mercifully makes fun of Hannah for her childlessness.
 
The rivalry, tension, and bitterness between the two women becomes nearly intolerable. Finally, after extensive and intensive prayer, Hannah is at last granted her desire and blessed with a son, whom she names Samuel. The name is a play on the Hebrew phrase,“I have asked him of the Lord.”
 
Hannah had made a vow to the Lord that her son would be dedicated to the service of the Lord. Once the child is weaned, she takes him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh and gives him over to the Lord“for as long as he lives.”
 
The song in the second chapter attributed to Hannah is one of exultation and celebration. It is a ringing affirmation of the power and the purposes of God.
 
Reflection Questions

 When you are disappointed with your life, does it lead you closer to God or farther away from God? What would bring you to such intensity of prayer that those who observe would think you were intoxicated? How do you give over your loves ones to the service of the Lord? How is God a“rock”in your life? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to exult extravagantly in your power and presence in your lives. May we build our lives on the rock of your salvation, for there is truly no one like You! Amen.

Scripture: John 18:33-37 (NRSV)
 
Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?” Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?” Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.” Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
 
Context
 
This Sunday is the last one in the annual cycle of the Christian Year. The new year will begin, as it always does, with the First Sunday of Advent. On November 22, we celebrate the reality of“Christ the King.”

The asigned passage features the dialogue between Pontius Pilate and Jesus recounted in the Gospel of John. Jesus has been betrayed by Judas and arrested by a detachment of Roman soldiers in the garden(18:1-11). Jesus has been taken before the High Priest (18:12-14, 19-24). Peter has denied Jesus three times, as Jesus had foretold (13:36-38, 18:15-18, 18:25-27).  Jesus is handed over to Pilate, with the clear implication that he is to find Jesus to be deserving of the death penalty.

There had been speculation about Jesus as a possible king since early in his ministry (John 6:15). Now the issue is joined clearly.  But, even though Pilate and Jesus are talking to one another directly, they are communicating at different levels.
 
Reflection Questions

 What question would you ask of Jesus if he were standing in front of you? What is your greatest hope–and your greatest fear–about Jesus as King? How can Jesus rule over a kingdom“not from this world?” How are“listening to Jesus”and loyalty to Jesus related? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us learn to listen to you and hear your quiet voice of truth. Help us learn to live as faithful people in Your kingdom. Amen.

Scripture: Jeremiah 33:14-16
 
The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called:“The Lord is our righteousness.”
 
Context
 
The prophet Jeremiah came from Anathoth, a village in the tribal territory of Benjamin. This tribe was located to the north of Judah, the southern kingdom.

Jeremiah was a descendant of Abiathar, one of the chief priests of King David. Jeremiah was active as a prophet in the late seventh and early seventh centuries B.C.E. Before the Babylonian Exile of 587 B.C.E., Jeremiah typically spoke oracles of judgment. After the exile, he spoke of hope.

Jeremiah’s words of hope in 33:14-16 promise the restoration of the royal line of David and the priesthood. While they have specific historical application, they also offer hope to persons in all kinds of desperate situations.
 
Reflection Questions

 Is it harder to believe words of hope than words of judgment? How do we know whom to believe? whom to trust? Do we live more often by hope or by judgment? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us hear–and believe–your word of hope especially when our circumstances are anything but hopeful. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 1:68-79 (NRSV)
 
“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has looked favorably on his people and redeemed them. He has raised up a mighty savior for us in the house of his servant David, as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us. Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors, and has remembered his holy covenant, the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham, to grant us that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins. By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us, to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
 
Context
 
These prophetic  words–traditionally called the Benedictus–come from Zechariah, who is the father of John the Baptist. They are the first words that he speaks after having been struck mute for expressing disbelief about the news from the angel, Gabriel, that he and his wife, Elizabeth, would have a son (Luke 1:5-23).

Zechariah spoke not a single word from that moment until the time came for his son to be named. The neighbors and relatives thought that the child would be named after his father, but his mother said that his name was to be John. They then asked his father, and Zechariah wrote on a tablet“His name is John”(Luke 1:63), and immediately he was able again to speak.

Zechariah’s words begin with a word of blessing for the Lord God of Israel. They hearken back to the promise to Abraham, and they look forward to the child’s becoming“the prophet of the Most High…”(Luke 1:73-74).
 
Reflection Questions

 Have you ever been temporarily“unable to speak,”perhaps from stunningly bad news or, conversely, stunningly good news? Have you ever doubted or disbelieved the promises of God? What impact or effect has it had on you? What is hardest to believe about“good news,”however and whenever it comes? Do we really prefer“bad news,”since it is more likely to conform to what we view as reality? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us truly to prepare our hearts, our minds, and our lives for the stunningly good news of the coming Christ. In his name we pray. Amen.

Scripture: Colossians 3:12-17 (NRSV)
 
As God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
 
Context
 
The letter to the church in Colossae is purportedly from the Apostle Paul, but  this is probably not the case. The letter is sent to a gentile congregation in western Asia Minor. It is fairly near Laodicea, slightly east and across the Lycus River to the south.

At the heart of this letter is a“Christ hymn,”found in Colossians 1:15-20, that focuses on the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ. The author uses this passage to support claims about Christ’s identity and purpose.

The particular passage for Sunday, December 27, focuses on what it means for believers to live a“new life in Christ.”It is both a matter of getting rid of whatever is earthly and putting on the virtues and attributes of Christ.
 
Reflection Questions

 What do you need to“take off”to follow Christ more  faithfully? What do you need to“put on”to follow Christ more  faithfully? What holds you back? 

Prayer
 
O God, we pray your blessing on us–and others–at this season of the year. Bless all of us, so that whatever we do might be done“in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.”Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 25:14-30 (NRSV) 
 
For it is as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them, and made five more talents. In the same way, the one who had the two talents made two more talents. But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. Then the one who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; see, I have made five more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ And the one with the two talents also came forward, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
 
Context
 
This is one of three major parables that come at the close of Jesus’ministry, at least in the Gospel of Matthew. Each of them focuses on the coming of the Son of Man for final judgment. The Parable of the Ten Bridesmaids (25:1-13) emphasizes the need for readiness. Even when the bridegroom is delayed, it is the responsibility of the bridesmaids to be ready“no matter what.”

In the Parable of the Talents (25:14-30), the one given five talents and the one given two talents are commended for their willingness (and success) in taking risks with what been entrusted to them. The one who“played it safe”is, unexpectedly enough by our standards, condemned. Those who made something of what was entrusted to them are given responsiblity for even more.

In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats (25:31-46), Jesus depicts the Son of Man honoring those who fed the hungry, refreshed the thirsty, welcomed the stranger, clothed the naked, cared for the sick, and visited those who were in prison. As they had done it“to least of these,”they had done it unto him.
 
Reflection Questions

 Do you consider yourself a“five talent,”“two talent,”or“one talent”person? What makes it more likely for us to“play it safe”in our life of faith? What does (or would) it take for us to take risks for the sake of the kingdom? Do we understand fully that our actions (or lack of them) truly have consequences? 

Prayer
 
O Lord, deliver us from the perpetual temptation to“play it safe.”Keep us from being paralyzed with fear at the possibility of failure, and give us the courage to use what you have entrusted to us for the sake of the kingdom. Amen.

Scripture: Acts 16:6-10 (NRSV)
 
 “They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. When they had come opposite Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; so, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. During the night Paul had a vision: there stood a man of Macedonia pleading with him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” When he had seen the vision, we immediately tried to cross over to Macedonia, being convinced that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them .” 
 
Context
 
The Book of Acts is the companion volume of the Gospel of Luke, even though the two books do not appear consecutively in the New Testament. In the Gospel of Luke, the author“wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven…”(Acts 1:1-2). The book of Acts outlines the development of the early church, following the gift of the spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-10). It ends with the Apostle Paul living in Rome, awaiting trial and“proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance”(Acts 28:31).

The name of the book,“ Acts of the Apostles ,”does not appear anywhere in the earliest text. The title was actually first used by Irenaeus late in the second century. The name points to the reality that the focus in the book is on the work (acts) of those chosen or designated apostles , which simply means those sent out as messengers (on someone else’s authority).

The author of Luke and Acts is traditionally understood to be Luke, a physician and associate of Paul. However, such an identification is not made in either book. According to the HarperCollins Study Bible , the writer appears to be“a gentile Christian who has received a good education and has made careful study of Jewish scriptures”(pp. 2056-57).

In the sixteenth chapter, the Apostle Paul is on one of his missionary journeys. He has just parted company with his longtime friend and companion, Barnabas, with each of them going separate ways. He then gains another traveling companion, Timothy, and they are traveling through Asia Minor. One night, Paul has a vision of“a man of Macedonia,”who asks them to“‘Come over . . . and help us’”(Acts 16:9).
 
Reflection Questions

 Do we understand our journey in life to have a purpose? What kind of obstacles do we encounter in our journey? How do we respond? What dream or vision has God laid upon our hearts and lives? Who is inviting, exhorting, pleading, or asking us to“come . . . and help them?” 

Prayer
 
O God, we trust that you are always at work in our lives, even in the obstacles and opposition that we encounter. Help us to have a new and fresh vision of your purpose and direction for our lives. In Jesus’name we pray. Amen.

Scripture: 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 (NRSV)
 
It is necessary to boast; nothing is to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat. On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. But if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me, even considering the exceptional character of the revelations. Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.
 
Context
 
2 Corinthians is one of the letters that is undoubtedly from the Apostle Paul himself. According to the HarperCollins Study Bible , it is“perhaps the most difficult to interpret”(p. 2164). The various sections of the letter differ significantly in content and tone. Scholars have put forth the idea that the letter is actually composed of several fragments. In any case, it contains a variety of styles and elements.

Paul established the church at Corinth and thereafter carried on an extensive correspondence with the Christians there. They wrote him at least once, and he wrote them four times. His relationship with the church at Corinth was complex, sometimes bringing him deep pain and grief.

In the twelfth chapter, Paul continues an extensive passage about his own life experience and his calling as an apostle. He highlights both the ecstasy and the agony of his experience of faith. He mentions the“thorn in his flesh,”that tormented him. He contrasts his weakness and the power of Christ, and concludes,“whenever I am weak, then I am strong”(12:10).
 
Reflection Questions
 What is there about you that you wish were different? Have you taken it to the Lord in prayer? What has been the Lord’s response? How has your life been touched and blessed by the transcendent joy of faith? How do you understand those prayers that have seemingly not been answered? How and when do you experience most deeply the power of Christ? 
Prayer
 
O gracious and mighty God, help us to find the strength that we need in the midst of weakness. Help us to experience the power of Christ dwelling in us–not just for a moment or even for a season but our whole life long. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 10:13-16 (from“The Message,”by Eugene Peterson)
 
The people brought children to Jesus, hoping he might touch them. The disciples shooed them off. But Jesus was irate and let them know it:“Don’t push these children away. Don’t ever get between them and me. These children are at the very center of life in the kingdom. Mark this: Unless you accept God’s kingdom in the simplicity of a child, you’ll never get in.”Then, gathering the children up in his arms, he laid his hands of blessing on them.
 
Context
 
This coming Sunday, February 21, is the first Sunday in Lent. It is a time of forty days, not counting Sundays, that stretch from Ash Wednesday (February 17) until Easter Sunday (April 4). It recalls the time of Jesus’temptation or testing in the desert (see Luke 4:1-13).

Our scripture readings during Lent this year, however, will not follow the typical pattern. Instead, we are using materials that focus on“A Journey to Hope,”with scripture and suggestions provided by the“Rethink Church”campaign of The United Methodist Church. The idea during Lent is to look at the various ways in which we are equipped to start–and continue–on“A Journey to Hope.”

This Sunday, the focus will be on“traveling companions.”The scripture reading is taken from the Gospel of Mark, coming at a time when he is coming closer to Jerusalem. It comes after Peter’s confession of him as“the Christ, the Messiah”(Mark 8:29) and the Transfiguration (Mark 9:2-8). He has already spoken of the importance of honoring and valuing children. (Mark 9:36-37). He has gone to an area of Judea on the east side of the Jordan river, where he continues to teach to a large crowd.

People are bringing children to him, hoping that he might at least touch them. The disciples are shooing them away. But Jesus interrupts and makes sure to welcome and bless the children.
 
Reflection Questions

 Who brought us to Jesus? Who have been our“traveling companions”along our journey of faith? What is so important that we sometimes create impediments for others to come“face to face”with Jesus? What kind of“traveling companions”are we for Jesus? Do we bring people closer, or do we keep them away! 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to recognize the need for persons to come close to Jesus–and to bring others with them. Help us not to stand in the way but to invite and involve others in our journey to hope. Amen.

 February 22, 2010 
Scripture: Mark 11:1-11 ( The Message , by Eugene Peterson)
 
When they were nearing Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany on Mount Olives, he sent off two of the disciples with instructions:“Go to the village across from you. As soon as you enter, you’ll find a colt tethered, one that has never yet been ridden. Untie it and bring it.  If anyone asks,‘What are you doing?’say,‘The Master needs him, and will return him right away.’”They went and found a colt tied to a door at the street corner and untied it. Some of those standing there said,“What are you doing untying that colt?”The disciples replied exactly as Jesus had instructed them, and the people let them alone. They brought the colt to Jesus, spread their coats on it, and he mounted. The people gave him a wonderful welcome, some throwing their coats on the street, others spreading out rushes they had cut in the fields. Running ahead and following after, they were calling out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in God’s name! Blessed the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in highest heaven! He entered Jerusalem, then entered the Temple. He looked around, taking it all in. But by now it was late, so he went back to Bethany with the Twelve.
 
Context
 
This coming Sunday, February 28, is the second Sunday of Lent. We continue together on“A Journey to Hope,”that began on Ash Wednesday and will conclude with Easter Sunday.

This Sunday’s reading is typically shared on Palm Sunday, the week prior to Easter. However, it comes early in our journey, as a precursor of what is to come.

People viewed Jesus in many different ways, depending on their particular point of view. For the disciples, he was their teacher and, according to this passage, their“Master.”As I understand it, this was a term of respect and relationship not of distance or difference. For the people, he was believed to be the long hoped for messiah, and his arrival in Jerusalem was greeted with exuberance and enthusiasm.

But Jesus is his own person, not dependent on the view of others for who he was or how he acted. He is more than capable of surprising–and disappointing–those who follow him and those who welcome him. Yet neither the surprise nor the disappointment keeps Jesus from moving forward according to God’s guidance.
 
Reflection Questions

 What description or title of Jesus is most meaningful–Master? Teacher? Savior? Lord? Son of God? Son of Man? Friend? Brother? What do we most hope that Jesus will do for us? in us? through us? How has Jesus surprised us–or disappointed us–in the past? 

Prayer
 
Dear Jesus, help us to go where you say and do what you direct. Help us to welcome you into our hearts and lives, not just in the excitement of the moment but in the deep down difficulties that we sometimes experience. Amen.

Scripture: Mark 10:35-44 (From The Message by Eugene Peterson)
 
 James and John, Zebedee’s sons, came up to him.“Teacher, we have something we want you to do for us.” “What is it? I’ll see what I can do.” “Arrange it,”they said,“so that we will be awarded the highest places of honor in your glory–one of us at your right, the other at your left.” Jesus said,“You have no idea what you’re asking. Are you capable of drinking the cup I drink, of being baptized in the baptism I’m about to be plunged into?” “Sure,”they said.“Why not?” But as to awarding places of honor, that’s not my business. There are other arrangements for that.” When the other ten heard of this conversation, they lost their tempers with James and John. Jesus got them together to settle things down.“You’ve observed how godless rulers throw their weight around,”he said,“and when people get a little power how quickly it goes to their heads. It’s not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant. Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. 
 
Context
 
James and John, sons of Zebedee, were among the first to be called as disciples. (Mark 1:19-20). Jesus gave them the name“Sons of Thunder”(Mark 3:17). They had seen Jesus“up close and personal”from the very beginning, including the healing of Simon’s mother-in-law (Mark 1:29-31), the raising of Jairus’daughter from the dead (Mark 5:35-43), and Jesus’transfiguration (Mark 9:2-7).

Following behind Jesus, the disciples are coming closer to Jerusalem. Jesus had repeatedly told them that this is where he would suffer, die, and be resurrected. Like the others, James and John are completely oblivious about what is to come. It seems they can only think of visions of glory, when Jesus will come into his kingdom. They try to make a separate deal with Jesus, so that they will be at positions of power when he comes into his glory.

Amazingly, Jesus does not rebuke or chastise them for their failure to understand. Instead, he says that they will, indeed, drink the cup that he drinks and be baptized with the baptism with which he will be baptized. They undoubtedly continue to misunderstand what he means, and they may well think that their separate deal has been successfully concluded.

The other disciples are equally clueless, venting their anger at James and John–perhaps envious or resentful that they had beaten them to seek places of privilege. But privilege is the exact opposite of what Jesus sought–or that disciples are to seek.
 
Reflection Questions

 What expectations of reward do we have as followers of Jesus? What does it truly mean for us to serve the needs of others? How do we respond to those who“beat us to the punch”in seeking recognition or reward? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to follow faithfully–hearing your word and following your way, even when that word is hard and the way is difficult. Amen.
 James and John, Zebedee’s sons, came up to him.“Teacher, we have something we want you to do for us.” 36 “What is it? I’ll see what I can do.” 37 “Arrange it,”they said,“so that we will be awarded the highest places of honor in your glory–one of us at your right, the other at your left.” 38 Jesus said,“You have no idea what you’re asking. Are you capable of drinking the cup I drink, of being baptized in the baptism I’m about to be plunged into?” 39 “Sure,”they said.“Why not?” 40 But as to awarding places of honor, that’s not my business. There are other arrangements for that.” 41 When the other ten heard of this conversation, they lost their tempers with James and John. 42 Jesus got them together to settle things down.“You’ve observed how godless rulers throw their weight around,”he said,“and when people get a little power how quickly it goes to their heads. 43 It’s not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant. 44 Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.

Scripture: Mark 14:32-40 (From The Message , by Eugene Peterson)
 
They came to an area called Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples,“Sit here while I pray.”He took Peter, James, and John with him. He plunged into a sinkhole of dreadful agony. He told them,“I feel bad enough right now to die. Stay here and keep vigil with me.”Going a little ahead, he fell to the ground and prayed for a way out:“Papa, Father, you can–can’t you?–get me out of this. Take this cup away from me. But please, not what I want–what do you want?”He came back and found them sound asleep. He said to Peter,“Simon, you went to sleep on me? Can’t you stick it out with me a single hour? Stay alert, be in prayer, so you don’t enter the danger zone without even knowing it. Don’t be naive. Part of you is eager, ready for anything in God; but another part is as lazy as an old dog sleeping by the fire.”He then went back and prayed the same prayer. Returning, he again found them sound asleep. They simply couldn’t keep their eyes open, and they didn’t have a plausible excuse.
 
Context
 
This takes place on the Thursday evening of what we call“ Holy Week .”Jesus shared Passover with his disciples (Mark 14:12-21), letting them know that one of them would betray him (Mark 14:12-21). He shares the bread and the cup with his disciples, thereby instituting what we have come to call the“ Last Supper “or the“ Lord’s Supper ”(Mark 14:22-25). After they sing a closing hymn, they leave for the Mount of Olives . To their probable bewilderment, Jesus tells the disciples that they will all desert him and that Peter will deny him (Mark 14:26-31).

They arrive at a“place called Gethsemane,”and Jesus asks all of his disciples to wait while he prays. The Garden of Gethsemane is located, according to tradition,  on the lower slopes of the Mount of Olives. It was familiar territory for Jesus and his disciples.

Jesus then takes Peter, James, and John with him for a time of anguished prayer , in which he asks God–whom he addresses as“ Abba ”or“Daddy”–to keep him from having to go through what lies in front of him. Despite Jesus’request that they remain awake as he prays, the disciples just can’t keep their eyes open. It was a simple request, but they just could not do what he asked.
 
Reflection Questions

 Which is more to our liking–to do something great and heroic for Jesus or to do something ordinary and simple? Why is it difficult for us simply to“sit, wait, and watch?” What simple things has Jesus asked us to do that we seem unable to do? 

Prayer
 
Lord, we mean well when we say that we always serve you faithfully. But our good intentions are not always matched by what we actually do. Help us to be more humble in the claims we make about serving you. Help us to be more aware of your presence near us. Help us to be more able to“sit, wait, and watch.”Help us do the simple things, aided by your presence and power. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 24:1-12 (New Revised Standard Version)
 
But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in, they did not find the body. While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.” Then they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.
 
Context
 
This is Luke’s version of events on the first day of the week. Like Matthew and Mark, the first to hear the news of Jesus’resurrection are women. [In the Gospel of John, it is Mary Magdalene alone.] There is no  account in Luke of how the stone was rolled away from the entrance to the tomb.

As in the other gospels, the women have an encounter with angelic or heavenly beings that is bewildering, perplexing, or frightening. In Luke, they are asked what sounds, on the surface, like a ludicrous question:“Why do you look for the living among the dead?”(24:7a)

The“two men in dazzling clothes”exhort the women to remember what Jesus had told them. Accordingly, the women“remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest”(24:8-9). The fact that the disciples disbelieved them must have been aggravating, but there was at least the satisfaction of knowing they had done what they could.

Unlike the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark, the women have no personal encounter with the risen Christ. The first reported meeting is with the two unnamed disciples on the road to Emmaus that afternoon (24:13-35) and with Simon (24:34). In the Gospel of Luke, the women are the first witnesses of the empty tomb but not of the risen Christ.
 
Reflection Questions

 What words of Jesus do you most clearly recall? What words about Jesus are etched into your memory? What song concerning Jesus most readily comes to mind? How, when, and why do we tend to“look for the living among the dead?” How do we deal with the reality that Jesus sometimes seems to show up in the lives of others more readily–or more quickly or more obviously–than in our own? 

Prayer
 
Lord, we thank you for the reality of the risen Christ. Keep us from looking for“the living among the dead.”Help us to share the witness we have been given, even though others may not believe. And may we be blessed by how the risen Christ works in each of our lives. Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 3:1-13, 20-21 (New Living Translation)
 
I, Paul, am a prisoner of Christ Jesus because of my preaching to you Gentiles. As you already know, God has given me this special ministry of announcing his favor to you Gentiles. As I briefly mentioned earlier in this letter, God himself revealed his secret plan to me. As you read what I have written, you will understand what I know about this plan regarding Christ. God did not reveal it to previous generations, but now he has revealed it by the Holy Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets. And this is the secret plan: The Gentiles have an equal share with the Jews in all the riches inherited by God’s children. Both groups have believed the Good News, and both are part of the same body and enjoy together the promise of blessings through Christ Jesus. By God’s special favor and mighty power, I have been given the wonderful privilege of serving him by spreading this Good News. Just think! Though I did nothing to deserve it, and though I am the least deserving Christian there is, I was chosen for this special joy of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available to them in Christ. I was chosen to explain to everyone this plan that God, the Creator of all things, had kept secret from the beginning. God’s purpose was to show his wisdom in all its rich variety to all the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms. They will see this when Jews and Gentiles are joined together in his church. This was his plan from all eternity, and it has now been carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord. Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come fearlessly into God’s presence, assured of his glad welcome. So please don’t despair because of what they are doing to me here. It is for you that I am suffering, so you should feel honored and encouraged.

Now glory be to God! By his mighty power at work within us, he is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope. May he be given glory in the church and in Christ Jesus forever and ever through endless ages. Amen.
 
Context
 
The author of this letter identifies himself as Paul (1:1, 3:1, etc.). It is sent to“the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus”(1:1b), but some early manuscripts do not have“in Ephesus.”

The letter may have been a“circular letter,”intended for several churches and not just one. It is not written in response to any particular problem or challenge. Instead, it seems to be written to help its readers understand more clearly and fully the purposes of God. It is apparently written while Paul was under house arrest, perhaps in Rome.

In the third chapter, the focus is on the“mystery”(NRSV) or“secret plan”(NLT) that God has made known to Paul. While the words sound egotistical, they are actually the opposite.

Paul (or whoever is writing in his name or spirit) is humbled and overwhelmed by what God has shared with him. What is now revealed for all to see, understand, and grasp is that the promise in of God in Jesus Christ is intended not only for the“old timers”in faith, i.e., the Jews, but also the“new comers”in faith, i.e., the Gentiles.

This is a remarkable thing, absolutely unprecedented in the history of God’s dealing with the chosen people. Because of what has been accomplished in Jesus Christ,“we can now come fearlessly into God’s presence, assured of his glad welcome”(3:12).
 
Reflection Questions

 In your faith journey, are you one of the“old timers”in faith or one of the“newcomers?” If you are an“old timer,”how does it feel for“newcomers”to have an equal share? If you are a“newcomer,”what is it like to be part of a fellowship that includes“old timers?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, whether we are long experienced in the faith journey or just newly arrived, guide and bless us with understanding, compassion, and excitement as we continue our journey in Jesus Christ together! Amen.

Scripture: John 13:31-35 (NRSV)
 
When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”
 
Context
 
These few verses occur in the extended account of the Passover meal that Jesus celebrates with his disciples (John 13:1 ff.). There is the account of Jesus’washing the feet of the disciples (13:1-20) and then the foretelling of his betrayal (13:21-30). Immediately after Judas Iscariot leaves, Jesus begins the first of several“farewell discourses.”

In this passage, Jesus speaks of a“new commandment.”This is translated  as“mandatum novum”in the Latin version called known as the Vulgate.“Mandatum Novum”is the basis from which the name“ Maundy Thursday ”is ultimately derived.

In John’s gospel, the command to“love one another”seems to be restricted to the disciples. In other Gospels (Mark 12:28-34, Matthew 5:43-48, and Luke 6:27-36), the appeal or command to love is not restricted or focused in this way. Perhaps Jesus is underscoring the importance for the disciples really to care for one another in the times of difficulty, despair, and devastation that will soon come upon them. It will be all too easy for them to turn on one another in blame and accusation.
 
Reflection Questions

 Is it easier to love someone far away or close at hand? Who is difficult to love among the band of believers where God has placed you? How do you love those whom you may not particularly like? What difference does it make that we are to love others just as Christ has loved us? 

Prayer
 
Lord Jesus, thank you for loving us enough to bring us to eternal life. Help us to love others–close at hand or far away–as you have loved us. Amen.

Scripture: Acts 2:1-8, 12-21 (New Revised Standard Version)
 
When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.

Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 8 And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?

All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” But others sneered and said, “They are filled with new wine.” But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o”clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: ‘In the last days it will be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist. The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day. Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’
 
Context
 
Pentecost, in its original setting, was a Jewish festival. Also known as the“Feast of Weeks,”it is commonly understood as coming“fifty days”after the celebration of Passover. Pentecost is one of the three pilgrimage festivals that faithful Jews would have been expected to attend. There should thus be no surprise that Jews from a wide variety of places in the known world were found in Jerusalem when a“holy hulabaloo”broke out.

The disciples had been specifically instructed by Jesus, just before his Ascension,“not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father”(Acts 1:4). No time frame was given, so the believers (numbering about 120 by then) returned to Jerusalem. They were“constantly devoting themselves to prayer . . .“(Acts :14). They decided to choose a replacement for Judas. The lot fell on Matthias,“and he was added to the eleven apostles”(Acts 1:26).

The believers were“all together in one place”when the Spirit of God came upon them–with sounds and sights unlike anything they had ever witnessed!
 
Reflection Questions

 How hard is it for you to“wait upon the Lord,”either individually or as part of a group of believers? What is the longest that you have ever“actively waited”on someone or something else? How long can you“wait upon the Lord”before giving up–or beginning to give up? 

Prayer
 
Our gracious God, help us learn to“wait upon the Lord”with active anticipation. Help us not to get ahead of you but to wait faithfully for the power that you have promised in and through our lives. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 1:1-14 (NRSV)
 
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight he has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God’s own people, to the praise of his glory.
 
Context
 
The Letter to the Ephesians was not precipitated by any singe“event or crisis”( The HarperCollins Study Bible , p. 2192). It is sometimes regarded as a“general letter intended for many churches,”a view that is supported by the absence of a place name in 1.1 in some early manuscripts. It can be appropriately understood as addressed to us in the 21st century as well as to believers in the first century.

There is some question as to whether this letter was actually written by the Apostle Paul. Scholars generally believe that it was written by a disciple of Paul, but that it was in his name and his spirit. This possibility does not make the letter less valid in any way.

This letter deals with a remarkable array of subjects, including a“cosmic picture of God’s plan,”the place of believers in that plan, the role and mission of the church, relationships in the household, and each believer standing“battle-ready in God’s power”( The HarperCollins Study Bible, p. 2193).

Of particular importance in this week’s passage is the phrase,“in the fullness of time”(Ephesians 1:10). The word used for“time”is the Greek word, kairos ,meaning“the right or opportune moment.”It has a qualitative rather than a quantitative nature, and it denotes significance and opportunity rather than just the passage of time.
 
Reflection Questions

 How do you understand this letter to be addressed, at least symbolically, to you (and others) as the“saints”and the“faithful in Christ Jesus?” What is the difference, if any, between God’s plan and God’s purpose? How specific is God’s plan? How general is God’s purpose? What moments in your life have been“kairos”moments? What is the promise of our“inheritance”as“God’s own people?” 

Prayer
 
O God, thank you for including us among your“saints,”even though we seldom feel saintly. Give us a sense of the breadth and height and depth of your glorious blessing in Jesus Christ. Help us to let your plan come to fruition in our lives. May we recognize“kairos”moments when they come, and may we  lead lives blessed by your grace. Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 3:14-4:6 (NRSV)
 
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.
 
Context
 
The letter to the Ephesians, which may have originally been a“general letter”to all the churches, did not originate out any specific issue, controversy, or problem. It is attributed to“Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,”but it was likely written by a disciple writing on his behalf or in his name. The passage from 3:14 through the end of the chapter is a prayer and a doxology. It uses expansive imagery that is still applicable with a 21st century understanding of the universe. It speaks of strength and power in vigorous and striking ways.

In the first six verses of chapter four, believers are urged to lead lives“worthy of the calling”to which we have been called, and we are reminded of the importance of“making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace”(4:3). This section concludes with a sevenfold recitation of unity–”one body and one Spirit . . . one hope . . . one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all . . .“
 
Questions

 Are our prayers characterized more by strength and power or by passivity and acquiescence? What are the disciplines or practices that help strengthen us in our“inner being?” How does God motivate us to lead lives“worthy of the calling to which [we] have been called?” What is the biggest challenge for us in maintaining“the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to understand ourselves as more than meek and mild, more than compliant and cooperative, more than passive and acquiescent. Give us inward strength by the power of your Holy Spirit, and help us to live life fully as your disciples and not just as polite facsimiles. Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 4:7, 11-16
 
But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift. . . The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.
 
Context
 
The fourth chapter of the Letter to the Ephesians begins with a thoroughgoing emphasis on unity. It is a call for believers to lead genuinely worthy lives. We are called to make every effort“to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace”(4:3).

An emphasis on grace and gifts begins with the seventh verse of the fourth chapter. This is often an area with which mainline (or oldline) church members may be uncomfortable. We were typically taught when growing up (or at least I was) not to identify ourselves as gifted–spiritually or otherwise. That was deemed presumptuous and egotistical.

However, the New Testament concept of gifts reflects a fundamentally different orientation. The gifts that are given (to“each of us”and“all of us”) are not for our benefit but for“building up the body of Christ.”If we choose to deny, subvert, or misuse those gifts, then we have done a disservice to ourselves, to the church, and ultimately to Christ himself.

There is an emphasis on the corporate reality of the church as the“body of Christ.”We are called to“grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ”(4:15). We are inextricably linked together–again not for our personal or individual benefit but for the good of the entire body.
 
Reflection Questions

 Which of the gifts that are listed (apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor and teacher) are most clearly yours? What other spiritual gifts do you believe God has given you? (See Romans 124-8 and 1 Corinthians 12:4-11) How are you using the gifts God has given you for building up the body of Christ? Where are you in the process of“growing up”into Christ–becoming closer to Jesus and more like Jesus? 

Prayer
 
Lord, it is sometimes hard for us to believe that we are gifted. We do not always recognize the gifts you have given us, but we are keenly aware of the gifts you have given others. Help us in our continuing journey to grow more into the likeness of Christ. Help us to work together, as we seek to build up and encourage one another in love. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture Ephesians 4:17, 22-5:2 (NRSV)
 
Now this I affirm and insist on in the Lord: you must no longer live as the Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds.

For surely you have heard about him and were taught in him, as truth is in Jesus. You were taught to put away your former way of life, your old self, corrupt and deluded by its lusts, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to clothe yourselves with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. So then, putting away falsehood, let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors, for we are members of one another. Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not make room for the devil. Thieves must give up stealing; rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands, so as to have something to share with the needy. Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful for building up, as there is need, so that your words may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption. Put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven you.

Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children, and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
 
Context
 
This passages follows the pivotal discussion of“spiritual gifts”that are intended to“equip the saints”and for“building up the body of Christ”(Ephesians 4:7-16). In the subsequent verses, attention is turned to the contrast between“the old life and the new”and then to“rules for the new life.”

The point is clearly made that the way in which the believers at Ephesus used to live is no longer acceptable. There is no softening of the expectations of a Christian way of life.  The way in which they formerly lived is clearly unacceptable. The believers at Ephesus have clearly been taught to live differently.

I am not so sure that we do nearly as well in our contemporary contest. Most of us–at least in The United Methodist Church in the United States–still view church and culture as vaguely supportive of one another. We do not always see a clear distinction between how we were raised in the culture and how we are to live in the church

Our culture is at least superficially churched, but more and more people are functionally unchurched. People may pay tribute to the trappings of the faith, but they do not often or always experience a living and vital faith.
 
Reflection Questions

 What difference is there in the way we lead our lives as believers, as compared with others around us in the culture? What is the greatest difficulty for us?…speaking the truth?…being angry but not sinning?…letting no evil talk come out of our mouths?…forgiving one another? What are the disciplines, practices, and habits that help us learn to“live in love”(Ephesians 5:2)? 

Prayer
 
Lord, you call us to“live in love,”but so often we would rather just get even. Give us the grace, the courage, and the joy to live the life to which you called us. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 5:6-10, 15-20 (NRSV)
 
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be associated with them. For once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light— for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true. Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.

Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil. So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
Context
 
This portion of the Letter to the Ephesians continues to lay out the expected behavior of those who have decided to follow Jesus Christ. There is a contrast (5:88 ff.) between the darkness in which the Gentiles once lived and the light in which they now live. The“fruit of the light”is to be found“in all that is good and right and true”(5:10).

The contrast between darkness and light continues to be with us today. Sometimes spiritual darkness is an inner shadow that gradually grows deeper until it threatens to block out all evidence of the light. Sometimes it is an outward reality in a congregation that diminishes people’s capacity to experience the risen Christ.

In the midst of darkness, we continue to be called to“live as children of light.”One of the things that calls us back to the light is the gift of song, through what Ephesians calls“psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.”[Cf.  Colossians 3:16.]

We are not sure exactly is meant by“psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,”but they are clearly part of the worship life of the early church (and early Christians). We can be assured that not every believer was (or is) equally blessed in being able to carry a tune! However, all can be blessed by singing, for it is a way of“giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”And, most importantly, bringing us back to the light.
 
Reflection  Questions

 What shadows come unbidden into your life that dim the light of the Lord? How do you recognize and respond to their presence? What are the songs that God has given you that bring you back to the light and help you give thanks to God? 

Prayer
 
Lord, sometimes the shadows of life threaten to keep us from seeing the light of Christ in our lives. When that happens, bless us again with“psalms and hymns and spiritual songs”that bring us back to you. And help us again to“live as children of light.”Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 6:10-17 (NRSV)
 
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness. As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace. With all of these, take the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
 
Context
 
The Letter to the Ephesians is drawing to a close. In these verses, the writer is admonishing the Christians at Ephesus (and everywhere, for that matter) to use all the resources at their disposal to stand firm in the face of evil. The writer uses imagery from the Roman military, which was then the most sophisticated fighting entity in the world.

We may think of the imagery of spiritual battle as being outdated, but it is real. For me, the spiritual forces often seem to come as“D-words,”e.g, difficulty, discouragement, disappointment, defeat, disaster, and death–to name a few! It is temptingly easy for me to think that I need to cope with these experiences out of my own resources. But we are called to“be strong in the Lord”and not rely on our own strength.

In facing our own spiritual battles, we need to seek the best available resources so that, after all is said and done, we might“stand firm.”These verses in Ephesians lift up the primary components of a Roman soldier’s equipment, including the“belt of truth,”the“breastplate of righteousness,”the“shield of faith,”and the“sword of the Spirit.”In today’s imagery, we might speak or write of force fields or light sabers or some other kinds of remarkable weapons or armor .

There are two other aspects of this passage that I find striking. One is that the battle is essentially a defensive one. The purpose is not to defeat or destroy the“cosmic powers of this present darkness”(6:12). Rather, the goal is that we“may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm”(6:13). There is no shallow optimism that evil can be annhilated, at least not until the coming of God’s kingdom.

The other aspect is an unspoken (or unwritten) aspect of“put[ting] on the whole armor of God.”That is, Roman soldiers never fought individually. They were not solitary warriors. They were highly organized, with the smallest unit being a squad of eight soldiers and perhaps two servants.  In simplest terms, they looked out for one another and made sure that every member of the unit had all that was needed or could be provided.
 
Reflection Questions

 What are the spiritual forces that threaten to undo your life or undermine your faith? Are they obvious, or are they subtle? What disciplines and practices make up the“whole armor of God”for you? Who are your“comrades in arms,”looking out for you as you look out for them? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us not to rely on our own strength but on yours. Deliver us from the pride that leads us to believe that we can handle whatever life brings our way. Help us to use all the resources at our disposal–including prayer–so that we might“stand firm”in faith. Guide us to look out for others, as they look out for us. In Christ’s name. Amen.

Scripture: Ephesians 6:18-24 (NRSV)
 
Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints.

Pray also for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I must speak. So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus will tell you everything. He is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord. I am sending him to you for this very purpose, to let you know how we are, and to encourage your hearts. Peace be to the whole community, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all who have an undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
Context
 
These are the closing verses of the Letter to the Ephesians. The Apostle Paul–or whoever is writing in his name–first speaks of the need to pray (not once, not twice, but three times). The author describes himself as an“ambassador in chains,”which is consistent with Paul’s experience on more than one occasion. (See also Ephesians 3:1.)

After the admonition or appeal to prayer, the author writes of Tychicus–”a dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord”–who will tell the Ephesians“everything”(6:21). Tychicus is a little known name for most Christians, yet he is mentioned in five books of the New Testament (Acts, Ephesians, Colossians, II Timothy, Titus).

Tychicus is presumably from in or near Ephesus. He is described as a close friend and a faithful companion of Paul , who is entrusted with important tasks and whose word is trustworthy. He is also one of those people blessed with the gift of encouragement.

The letter closes with the blessing of peace, which is the active presence of God, and grace.
 
Reflection Questions
 Who are the persons that you ask to pray for you? What message does God give you that calls for more courage than you have? Who is trusted friends on whom you depend? Have you told them how much you value them for their faithfulness? Who encourages you? Whom do you encourage? When leaving a situation, how do you do so with the blessing of peace and grace? 
Prayer
 
Almighty God, we confess that we sometimes leave prayer to the very last thing. Help us to turn to you at the beginning as well at the end. Bless those who are trustworthy and faithful in their dealings with us and others. Thank you for those who encourage us, and help us to encourage others. May your peace and grace be at work in us–and through us. For Jesus’sake. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 14:1, 7-14 (NRSV)
 
On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath, they were watching him closely.When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. “When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, ‘Give this person your place,’ and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher’; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” 12 He said also to the one who had invited him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”
 
Context
 
In this part of the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. By this time, Jesus has already been involved in three conflicts over observing the sabbath (6:1-5, 6:6-11, 15:1-2). Though omitted in the selected text, this is the fourth conflict–as Jesus heals a mean of dropsy on the sabbath(14:2-6). That healing, however, is not specifically addressed.

The setting is a meal eaten at the house of a leader of the Pharisees. Jesus watches“party protocol”at work in how guests select their places–the more prestigious sitting closer to the host. Jesus then tells the parable about a wedding banquet, which is not just an incidental choice. It refers to the anticipated feast in the kingdom of God (See 13:28-29).

Jesus first calls attention to the importance of humility rather than the pretense of pride for those coming to the banquet. It is better to choose a lower station and then be asked to move up rather than the other way around.“For all who exalt themselves will be humbled,”he reminds his audience–then and now,“and those who humble themselves will be exalted”(14:11).

But it is not just seating arrangements that concern Jesus. He meddles with the invitation list, making it expansive rather than restrictive, far reaching rather than narrowly focused. Those invited to the banquet are not just those who are supposed to be upright or righteous for but those whom society ordinarily considers unacceptable–”the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.”)

The kingdom of God is clearly more expansive and extensive than anything that anybody else had considered at the time. It is a view that deepened his difficulty with the conventionally religious of his time.
 
Reflection Questions

 How much attention do you pay to“who sits where?”Do you have a particular place at worship that you consider“yours?”What if someone else sits there? Are you more likely to humble yourself or exalt yourself? Are you“proud”of your humility? Whom do we tend to regard as“unacceptable”to be part of the church? What difference does it make when we realize that Jesus extends the invitation specifically to them? How expansive or extensive is your view of who is invited to be part of the kingdom? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to hear your gracious call of invitation to“come to the table.”Give us strength to come in genuine humility. Enable us to welcome others whom we had not expected to see–and even to be welcomed by those who turn out to be closer to you in their journey of faith. Amen.

 September 3, 2010 
Scripture: Luke 14:25-33 (NRSV)
 
Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and said to them, “Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’ Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. 33 So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.
 
Context
 
Jesus“set his face to go to Jerusalem”(Luke 9:51), and he continues on the way. He has another conflict with the religious leaders about healing on the sabbath. He speaks of the importance of humility and widening the welcome to include“the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind”(Luke 14:14). He reiterates this list when telling the“parable of the Great Dinner”(Luke 14:15-24).

In this Sunday’s passage, Jesus’words are surprising, shocking, and even offensive. There is the appearance of popularity, as“large crowds were traveling with him”(Luke 14:25).  Undoubtedly, many of them anticipated his going to Jerusalem as a joyous thing to be anticipated–a moment to be savored and celebrated. They are not thinking of defining priorities or making hard choices. Pain and loss are the farthest things from their minds. They anticipate a crown, but Jesus points them to a cross.

Without warning, Jesus suddenly speaks harshly about what it takes to be his followers. He even uses the“h”word–”hate.”He insists that people must“hate”those closest to themselves–and even life itself–if they are to be his disciples.

These  are confusing and startling words. Aside from exaggeration, Jesus’talk of“hate”is not meant to be taken literally but to emphasize the radical priority that discipleship must have in people’s lives.

Jesus then speaks of carrying the cross (interestingly, not“a cross”but“the cross”) and following him.  This reiterates a message already given earlier in this gospel(Luke 9:23-27). It is a message that is intended to confront rather than comfort, to make clear instead of to soften the demands of the gospel.

And, in case people cannot figure out the blunt nature of these words, Jesus concludes with the necessity for persons to“give up all [their] possessions, if they are to become his disciples(Luke 14:33).

Such teachings are scarcely designed to“win friends and influence people!”Indeed, they are more likely to have the opposite effect. They are a sobering reality check for those who give in to the temptation to make this matter of discipleship palatable and popular.
 
Reflection Questions

 How do Jesus’words strike you? Do they seem harsh? Are they more than people can“reasonably”be expected to bear? What have you given up in order to follow Jesus Christ? Do you hold your possessions tightly . . . or loosely? When and how are you“giving them up?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, we are startled–and even discouraged–by the severity of your words about discipleship. We would so much rather settle for comfort and convenience. And yet, we know you are right. Help us to love you more than even life itself. Help us to“carry the cross,”and give us the courage to hold our possessions loosely. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 15:1-10 (NRSV)
 
Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him. And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, “This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.” So he told them this parable: “Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.’ Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. “Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ Just so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
 
Context
 
These are perhaps two of the most familiar parables of Jesus. They are linked with–and lead up to–a third, the parable of the prodigal son (or“waiting father.”).

The parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin are essentially parallel. Each features a character who would have been readily family to those hearing the stories. Neither would be regarded as heroic or noble. Both were common and ordinary at best. Yet they each unexpectedly become the lead character in one of Jesus’parables.

These stories are told in the context of the peculiar and unsavory company that Jesus chooses to keep, i.e.,“tax collectors and sinners.”This led the traditionally righteous people–”the Pharisees and the scribes”–to grumble and complain. Their complaints, I suspect, were just loud enough to be overheard but not so loud as to be overly obvious.

The theme in each parable is the persistence of the lead character in seeking–and finding–that which had been lost. Conventional wisdom would expect the shepherd to continue with the remaining ninety-nine sheep, when it is discovered that one has wandered off. However, this is a kingdom story–where the rules are upside down.

The story of the woman seeking for the lost coin–perhaps part of her dowry–is less unconventional. But simply the fact of a woman being the main character in the parable may be the point that Jesus is making. The kingdom is equally open to all persons, regardless of their gender or social status.

In both instances, the recovery of that which was lost results in joy that cannot be contained but which must be shared. Friends and neighbors are invited, and a party breaks out! Just so, there will be joy in heaven when“even one sinner repents”(Luke 15:10).
 
Reflection Questions

 How are we like those who point out others’faults, foibles, and failures? How are we like those who are lost and in need of repentance, redemption, and restoration? How are we like those who risk themselves to seek that which is lost? How do we share the joy of repentance–others’or our own? Or do we? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us not simply stand by and point out the faults, foibles, and failures of others. Help us be among those who seek out those who have wandered away–or perhaps who never been part of a fellowship of faith. Give us the joy of celebrating repentance, redemption, and restoration. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 16:1-13 (NRSV)
 
Then Jesus said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. So he summoned him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.’ Then the manager said to himself, ‘What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.’ So, summoning his master’s debtors one by one, he asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ He answered, ‘A hundred jugs of olive oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.’ Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He replied, ‘A hundred containers of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and make it eighty.’ And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.

“Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.”
 
Context
 
This is a challenging story–with perhaps multiple conclusions or applications. On the surface, Jesus seems to be commending fraudulent or dishonest behavior–scarcely attributes that are usually considered admirable. And yet the“shrewd [if not dishonest] manager”is commended. Perhaps he has only eliminated his commission from the transaction, but he still takes remarkable liberties with what doesn’t belong to him.

If nothing else, the manager is resourceful and creative. Jesus uses the parable to make the contrast with the humdrum and ordinary manner in which the“children of light”generally function–in the 1st or the 21st century. We are called–not to dishonesty in anything but to resourcefulness and creativity in advancing the kingdom!
 
Reflection Questions

 What startles us most about this parable? Do we settle for the ordinary, the routine, and the humdrum in our efforts for the Lord? Are we most creative and resourceful when serving our own interests or when focused on the things of God? What are the“true riches”promised by Jesus? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us not to settle merely for the ordinary and the routine in our efforts to be of service. Bless us with resourcefulness and creativity in our work for you. Help us to be faithful to what is entrusted to us, even though it may not seem like much. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 17:11-19 (NRSV)
 
On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee. As he entered a village, ten lepers approached him. Keeping their distance, they called out, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” When he saw them, he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were made clean. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He prostrated himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus asked, “Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” Then he said to him, “Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”
 
Context
 
Jesus continues on his way to Jerusalem, where he will encounter a cross instead of a crown. This is supposed to be the“third phase of the journey”(HarperCollins Study Bible, p. 1993). However, it does not appear that he is making much progress–geographically speaking. He is reportedly in what amounted to a“no man’s land”between Galilee and Samaria .

It is not surprising for a group of lepers to keep at a distance. That was  the prescribed practice (See Leviticus 13:46; Numbers 5:2-3). What is surprising is that one of them turns out to be a Samaritan. Ordinarily, Samaritans and Jews had nothing to do with one another (See, for example,  John 4:1-42). However, their common isolation and alienation seems to have brought them together.

It is also not surprising for the lepers to call out for mercy. What is surprising is that they recognize Jesus, call him by name, and use the  term“Master.”Significantly, the word used here  for“master”is otherwise only used by the disciples in reference to Jesus. The word can also be translated“rabbi,”which would be a clear term of respect.This group of lepers, living in“no man’s land,”felt  free to call Jesus“master”and to ask for mercy.

It is not specifically clear that the lepers are asking for healing. An appeal for mercy could have meant many things. Jesus took it, however, as an implicit request. Without providing any specific guidance or information, he simply directs them to“go and show yourselves to the priests”(17:14).

This is exactly the prescribed procedure to verify a cure of skin disease(See Leviticus 13:2-8 and 14:2-3). We are not told where the ten are headed to validate their cures, but only one turns back–and that one is described with derogatory affection as“this foreigner.”
 
Reflection Questions

 Do we ever spend any time with Jesus in the“no man’s land”between the conventional and unconventional, the religious and the irreligious, the acceptable and the unacceptable? Are we surprised, offended, disappointed, or gratified that people unknown–or perhaps even unacceptable–to us seem to know Jesus at least as well as we do? How often do we genuinely thank Jesus for what he has done for us, in us, and through us? 

Prayer
 
Lord, you work in my mysterious ways–or at least ways that are a mystery to us. Thank you for your gift of healing and wholeness that comes to us unexpectedly in the midst of other activities. Remind us–powerfully and forcefully, if needed–to thank you. . . again and again and again. Amen.

Scripture: Luke 18:1-8 (NRSV)
 
Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart. He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’ For a while he refused; but later he said to himself, ‘Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.’” And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them? I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”
 
Context
 
This passage comes in the Gospel of Luke after a discussion of“The Coming of the Kingdom.”(See Luke 17:20-37). With deliberate ambiguity, Jesus drops hints of what will come to pass in these days. For those looking for outward signs, he says that“the kingdom of God is among you.”This must have been confusing at best  to those who first heard his words. He warns his hearers (and readers) against quick or easy answers about what the coming of the kingdom, except to refer to the“days of Noah”and the“days of Lot.”

The parable of the“Widow and the Unjust Judge”is introduced by telling the hearers the point of the story, i.e.,“about their need to pray always and not to lose heart”(Luke 18:1). It is almost as if the teaching is so important that he doesn’t want to run the risk of people not understanding its meaning. He has already taught about the importance of persistence in seeking what we genuinely need. (See Luke 11:5-13). Here, he makes the point even stronger.

The widow is in a vulnerable position–without much in the way of social, political, or economic resources.  She has no one to speak for her, and she has no one to go with her. She has no advocate, protector, or comforter. But she has the power of unparalleled persistence that even wears down a judge“who neither feared God nor had respect for the people”(Luke 11:2). She does not give up, give in, give out, or go away. Ultimately, she is granted her request.

However, the implication is clear that this kind of persistence is something rare. The passage closes with wondering, in terms of the coming of the Son of Man, whether there will be“faith on earth.”Perhaps it will be as scarce and unusual as this widow.
 
Reflection Questions

 How easy is it for us to advocate our own cause? Is it easier to speak up for our wants or our needs? How do we determine determine what is truly justice? How persistent are we in prayer? How often do we give up, give out, and give in? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us to have the courage of our convictions. Let us be persistent in prayer. Help us not to give up, give out, and give in. Instead, lead us forward into your justice. Amen.

Scripture: Isaiah 2:1-5 (NRSV)
 
﻿﻿﻿The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. In days to come the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it. Many peoples shall come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord!
 
Context
 
Isaiah is one of the great prophets of the Old Testament–or the First Testament, if you prefer. His ministry, according to the opening verse, is during the reign of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah as kings of Judah.This is in the latter part of the eighth century B.C.E. (Before the Common Era).

Isaiah’s ministry began as early as 738 B.C.E., the year of Uzziah’s death. It continued until as last as 701 B.C.E. And perhaps later.

The work of Isaiah is rooted in a tradition that“celebrated God as the great king of heaven and earth, Jerusalem (Zion) as the  city God chose to be his royal dwelling, and the kings of the Davidic line as God’s anointed vice-regents on earth”(HarperCollins Study Bible, pl. 1012). The opening verses of the second chapter highlight this understanding.

With the beginning of Advent, these verses point for the Christian not only to the coming of Christ but also to the return of Christ. They are words of prophecy, power, and promise–as yet not finally or completely fulfilled. In the meantime, we are called to walk together with others“in the light of the Lord”(Isaiah 2:5).
 
Reflection Questions

 Is there a place in your life where God seems to be most real? How often do you go there? As you anticipate the celebration of Christmas, what are your deepest hopes this year? How do you typically experience the“light of the Lord?”Brightly? Dimly? Intermittently?Who is it that walks with you“in the light of the Lord?” 

Prayer
 
“When we walk with the Lord in the light of his word, what a glory he sheds on our way! While we do his good will, he abides with us still, and with all who will trust and obey.

Trust and obey, for there’s no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.”

(United Methodist Hymnal, # 467)

Scripture: Isaiah 35:1-10 (NRSV)
 
The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom; like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the Lord, the majesty of our God. Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who are of a fearful heart, “Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you.”Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert; the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes. A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way; the unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for God’s people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray. No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it; they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
 
Context
 
The 35th chapter of Isaiah is a breath of fresh air in the midst of defeat, disaster, doom, and gloom. The 34th chapter speaks of a thoroughgoing judgment on the nations, which is characterized by devastation, destruction, and death. The 36th chapter speaks of the pending siege of Jerusalem by the forces of Assyria. Between them comes the ten verses comprising the 35th chapter.

The HarperCollins Study Bible interprets the 35th chapter as originally belonging to the body of literature in chapters 40-55, and that would certainly make sense. Like these chapters, it seems intended to“comfort the afflicted”rather than to“afflict the comfortable.”Whatever the reason for its placement, it is a resounding affirmation of the power and purpose of God, pointing to the coming reality of gladness, abundance, and joy where there has been wilderness, desolation, and despair.

There is a message of hope to those nearly overwhelmed by circumstances, those with“weak hands”and“feeble knees”and having“a fearful heart.”The promise is that, despite all appearances, God will“come and save you.”

Indeed, the way back to the land of promise is one that will prove to be a spacious and safe highway, right through the midst of the wilderness. It is where the“redeemed shall walk,”without fear and with everlasting joy.

This passage is a stunning witness to the power of hope in the midst of the most desperate circumstances imaginable.
 
Reflection Questions

 How hard is it to receive a word of hope in the midst of desperate circumstances? Where is the dry and weary land for you this Advent season? Do you find yourself tempted to give up, give in, and give out? What shakes you to the core of your being? How do you receive a word of promise and hope? Where does the highway lead for you? Back to where you have been, or forward to where you have never been? 

Prayer
 
Lord, thank you for your powerful, even stunning word of hope in the midst of desperate and difficult circumstances. Strengthen us where we are weak, and give us the courage to see the path you set before us. Let it be for us a highway that we travel safely–not just back to where we have been but forward to where you already are. Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 2:1-12 (NRSV)
 
In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, “Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.” When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet: ‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.’” Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.”When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.
 
Context
 
The Gospel of Matthew, appearing first in the New Testament, has its own story of Jesus’birth. Unlike the Gospel of Luke, there is no appearance of an angel to Zechariah to tell of the pregnancy of Elizabeth or the birth of John. There is no angel appearing to Mary, telling her that she had found favor with God. There are no shepherds to be found, nor is there any angel who spoke to them or the“host of angels”that joined in praising and glorifying God.

In fact, Matthew begins with a contrived genealogy, tracing Jesus’ancestry back through David to Abraham. Any angelic communication in the opening chapters of this Gospel is directed to Joseph rather than to Mary.  Time and again, Joseph responds promptly and obediently, without comment or complaint. An angel, of course, is simply a“messenger from God,”not necessarily appearing in the winged form that we have come to expect.

We have a time frame for Jesus’birth–”in the time of King Herod”–and a place,“Bethlehem of Judea.”King Herod is Herod I or the so-called“ Herod the Great .”His“most famous and ambitious project”was  expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. He also becomes famous, if that is the right word, for the“ massacre of the innocents ,”in the wake of being fooled by the wise men. Herod the Great died in 4 B.C. (or B.C.E.) at the age of seventy.

The place for Jesus’birth, of course, is“ Bethlehem of Judea .”This is the ancient home of David, onetime King of Israel. It is the location cited by Luke and Matthew as the birthplace of Jesus. It is the home of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world.

The“ wise men ,”as they are termed in the New Revised Standard Version, are most likely astrologers. They come from“the East,”meaning an area that we would now term Iran or Iraq.  There are at least two of them since they are referred to in the plural, but the exact number is unknown. We do know that they brought three gifts–each of which was portable and valuable. These gifts were presumably used on the Holy Family’s subsequent escape to Egypt. The names, the ages, and the origins of the“wise men”all come from much later  tradition.

The coming of the“wise men”speaks of the importance of the birth of Jesus for all people, not just for a particular group. The Gospel of Matthew, which begins with the birth of Jesus being recognized by the world eventually ends with Jesus’commandment to his disciples for them to“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations”(28:19a).
 
Reflection Questions

 Who has been“messengers from God”for you? How and when do they show up? Are we more likely to respond to messages from God with skepticism or with faith? With delay or with obedience? How hard is it for us to ask directions? When and how do we ever do so? When, where, and how are we ever“overwhelmed with joy?” 

Prayer
 
Lord, in this new year, may we be blessed by unexpected moments when your messengers not only visit us but provide guidance. May we learn to follow, and may we discover joy in so doing. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 5:1-12 (NRSV)
 
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

“Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

“Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

“Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.

“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. 1 

“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

“Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
 
Context
 
In the gospel of Matthew, Jesus has just begun his ministry. It gets under way when Jesus hears the news of John the Baptist’s arrest [at the hands of Herod]. Or at least that is when Jesus relocates from Judea, where he has experienced baptism and temptation, to Galilee, where the bulk of his ministry will be carried out.

He makes his home at Capernaum, situated on the northwest coast of the Sea of Galilee, rather than at Nazareth where he grew up. He begins preaching,“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near”(5:17b).

He calls two sets of brothers as his first disciples–Simon Peter and Andrew, and then James and John. He ministers to many, and his notoriety or fame becomes widely known almost immediately.If there had been You Tube at the time, video clips of his success would have“gone viral.”

Seeing the crowds, Jesus goes“up the mountain,”which is not so much an actual mountain as a symbolic one. The writer of Matthew makes a conscious effort to equate the experience of Jesus with that of Moses, who also went“up the mountain”at Sinai. Jesus then“sits down,”which is the traditional posture of a teacher. Again, the writer of Matthew has a continuing emphasis on Jesus as a teacher.

Then comes what is traditionally known as the“Sermon on the Mount.”[In the Gospel of Luke, it is the &quot;sermon on the plain.&quot;] For Matthew, this is the first of five great discourses, again paralleling the life and times of Moses and the Torah.

The Sermon on the Mount begins with what we have come to call“The Beatitudes.”The Greek word for“blessed”is makarios. It ordinarily means“good fortune”or“fulness of life.”It is the kind of blessedness that consists of“trust in God, forgiveness of sins, righteousness even in affliction, and final deliverance”( One Volume Theological Dictionary of the New Testament , p. 548). The word is sometimes translated“happy”of“joyful,”but neither of these words is adequate. In my judgment, contentment begins to get at the meaning, but it doesn’t get us all the way there. Perhaps“blessed”is still the best translation, even though we tent to think of blessedness in material rather than spiritual terms.

The list of beatitudes is fairly straightforward and appears reasonably manageable until the last one, dealing with being reviled, persecuted, or spoken of falsely. This is the kind of thing that we ourselves would scarcely consider any kind of blessing, yet Jesus pushes us to a new depth of understanding.
 
Reflection Questions

 How does Jesus make himself known in your life? How do you learn to listen to him and to learn from him? What is the difference for you between blessedness and happiness? Between blessedness and joy? Between blessedness and contentment? Are the beatitudes a“guide to life,”or are there simply left-over ideas from a long ago age? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us learn to listen as you teach. May we stop and take the time to hear what you have to say–not just with our ears but with our hearts and in our lives. Guide us toward you in all things. Give us a sense of blessedness that is far beyond any happiness or joy or contentment than we may have known. In Jesus’name. Amen.

Scripture: Matthew 5:21-37 (NRSV)
 
‘You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, “You shall not murder”; and “whoever murders shall be liable to judgement.” But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister, * you will be liable to judgement; and if you insult a brother or sister, you will be liable to the council; and if you say, “You fool”, you will be liable to the hell of fire. So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister * has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, * and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court * with him, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.‘You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.” But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.

‘It was also said, “Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.” But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

‘Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, “You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.” But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let your word be “Yes, Yes” or “No, No”; anything more than this comes from the evil one.
 
Context
 
This is the portion of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus moves, as an old preacher once said,“from preachin’to meddlin’.”That is, he is no longer dealing with the lofty words of blessedness nor the somewhat vague admonition to be“the salt of the earth”or“the light of the world.”

Instead, Jesus is putting in specific and unmistakable terms the high standards of authentic belief. He does not lessen the expectation, but instead he seems to go out of his way to make these expectations beyond any reasonable (or unreasonable!) hope of accomplishment!

It would be easy to be overcome by the impossibility of what is set before us. You can almost see the jaws drop when those gathered on the hillside first heard what Jesus said. Our jaws drop as well, though perhaps not literally. However, Dick Donovan, offers this viewpoint in his exegetical account of this passage in this week’s scriptural treatment available on SermonWriter.com 

“As we read through these antitheses, we will become increasingly aware that we have failed miserably to meet Jesus’standards. He has set the bar impossibly high, so that we must despair of ever reaching it. We could respond in one of two ways. One way would be to lapse into despair–to give up–to say that we can never meet these impossible standards. The other would be to allow ourselves to fall backwards into Jesus’arms–to acknowledge our guilt, but also to trust in the work of Jesus and the grace of God  to bring us forgiveness and a clean slate.”
 
Reflection Questions

 Which of Jesus’admonitions seems the most unrealistic to you? Which is the most realistic? Is it easier to give up in despair or to actively receive the gift of God’s grace? Who is called to take the initiative in reconciliation? How do you experience the power of words? How do they hurt? How do they heal? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us not to be overwhelmed by the expectations of Jesus. Help us learn to repent of our own sins and to acknowledge our own shortcomings, painful as this may be. Help us to rest  fully and completely“in the arms of Jesus.”Help us to find strength and courage to move beyond what is superficial to a real relationship with Jesus. Amen.

Scripture: John 20:1-18 (NRSV) 

Context
 
This is one of the traditional stories of Jesus’resurrection, typically read on Easter morning. The story in John differs in detail but not in substance from the accounts in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

The setting is the garden where the body of Jesus had been laid to rest on Friday. (See John 19:38-42.) It is Sunday, described as“the first day of the week”and not as the“third day after Jesus’death or burial.”It is“still dark,”i.e., before sunrise. This may be a reference to the continuing theme of light and darkness in the Gospel of John.

The story features Mary Magdalene, mentioned earlier in the Gospel of John as a witness to the crucifixion of Jesus (19:25) and described in Luke as a woman“from whom seven demons had gone out”(8:2).

Mary Magdalene has come to the tomb, presumably as an act of devotion or expression of grief. In the Gospel of John, the preparation of Jesus’body for burial occurred on Friday, thanks to Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus.

Mary Magdalene’s first encounter with the reality of the resurrection is the fact that“the stone had been removed,”presumably rolled back from the entrance (v. 1 c). All that she can assume is that some unknown perpetrators have taken Jesus’body.

She herself does not apparently look in the tomb on her own but goes to tell the the disciples–or at least Simon Peter and the“beloved disciple”–of what must have seemed horrific news. They are the ones that are actually the first to witness the empty tomb, but by no means do they fully comprehend what has happened.

After the two disciples return to their homes, Mary remains standing outside the tomb, weeping. Actually, the Greek word used for“weeping”could more accurately be translated“sobbing.”There is no quiet, almost imperceptible grief here. Instead, there are loud, racking sobs.

Summoning a last measure of courage, devotion, or desperation, Mary Magdalene bends over to look into the tomb. She sees“two angels in white,”who ask her,“Woman, why are you weeping?”This is yet more stunning news, and her disbelief increases.

After she responds, Mary turns and sees one whom she supposes to be the gardener, who first asks her the same question as the angels,“Woman, why are you weeping?”This was exactly the same question asked by the angels in the tomb. But this unidentified individual then asks,“Whom are you looking for?”

Mary’s bewilderment and confusion continue to grow, until finally Jesus speaks her name. With that, Mary turns toward him and recognizes him for who he is. What had been confused is clear. What had been grief is now joy. What had been sorrow is now celebration.

For Mary Magdalene, resurrection is a reality!
 
Reflection Questions

 What causes us to weep (or sob) so that we do not see the reality of the resurrection? Pain? Loss? Disappointment? Defeat? Despair? Death? What other experiences in life keep us focused on ourselves, so much so that we do not notice Jesus alongside us? Anger? Emptiness? Fatigue? Frustration? Meaninglessness? What do we put first in our lives? What do we seek? And, more importantly, whom do we seek in life? Do we genuinely look for the living Lord, or do we settle for past evidence of a once vital faith? When and how does Jesus speak our name, making it possible for us to lift our eyes (spiritually speaking) and recognize his presence? 

Prayer
 
Lord, thank you for your presence with us–even in ways that appear to us as absence. Thank you for helping us to see through our tears and recognize the reality of the resurrection. May resurrection be a reality for us! Amen.

Scripture: John 20:19-31 (NRSV) 

Context
 
The setting is the evening of the“first day of the week,”i.e., the day of Jesus’resurrection. Peter and“the disciple whom Jesus loved”have seen the empty tomb, but it seems not to have made a difference. Mary Magdalene has told the disciples that she has“seen the Lord”and reported what he had told her, but again without apparent impact. Her words must have sounded delusional.

The disciples–ten of them, as it turns out–are huddled together behind locked doors. After all, one of them had betrayed Jesus, one had denied him, and virtually all had abandoned him. [In the Gospel of John, the &quot;disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;--presumably John--is noted to be &quot;standing near the cross&quot;(John 19:25) during the crucifixion.] For whatever reason, Thomas is not there.

The usual focus in this passage, at least for me, has been the absence of Thomas, his refusal to believe, and his confession the following week,“My Lord and my God!”(John 20:28).

Prior to these verses, however, comes what amounts to John’s Pentecost. The story of Pentecost, of course, comes from the second chapter of Acts–fifty days after the resurrection, when“they were all together in one place”and they experienced the particular power and presence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4).

For the Gospel of John, the gift of the Holy Spirit comes directly from the resurrected Christ, speaking with ten of  his disciples on the evening of the first day. After blessing them with peace, showing them his hands and side, and blessing them with peace again, Jesus gives the disciples their apostolic commission, i.e., their marching orders.

Jesus breathes on the disciples, reminiscent of the“breath of life”which God breathed into Adam (Genesis 2:7) or the passage in Ezekiel about breath coming into the dry bones (Ezekiel 37:9-10).

This is Jesus’“gift of the Spirit,”and the sign of the spirit is not speaking in tongues as in the book of Acts. The sign of the spirit is the power of forgiveness, whether offered or withheld. It is a different kind of Pentecost, but one that is nonetheless compelling.
 
Reflection Questions

 What is the most persistent and powerful expression of God’s spirit in our lives? When and how have we been commissioned, i.e., sent forth to do the work of God? How is forgiveness a sign of God’s spirit? What happens with those who refuse to forgive? Or with those who never seek forgiveness? 

Prayer
 
Lord, help us hear your blessing of peace, witness the reality of your resurrected presence, and hear your call and claim on our lives. Help us never to take forgiveness lightly. Help us to let go of hurts that have been done to us and to seek forgiveness for when we have hurt others. Amen.
