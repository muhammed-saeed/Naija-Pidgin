This Should End Well: Mega Millions Winner Says Ticket Hidden at McDonald’s
 
 Mirlande Wilson, a McDonald’s employee who claimed she had a winning ticket, now says that she hid the paper somewhere inside the fast food restaurant… 

 Controversy erupted over the weekend when Wilson, 37, claimed that she had one of the three winning tickets in last Friday’s multi-state Mega Millions lottery, a prize that would have earned her an lump-sum payout of $105 million after taxes, the New York Post reported on Monday. 

 But when her McDonald’s coworkers saw Wilson on the local news, they came forward and said that she purchased the ticket as part of a 15-person pool where each member paid $5 dollars and agreed to split the winnings, according to Fox News. 

 I’m going to go out on a limb and say this should end well…has the McDonald’s she works at been torn down to the last brick yet? 

And about the fellow employees who comprise the pool, I’m sure they totally believe her that it’s a private ticket…either way, this is not going to end well…but I’m guessing many lawyers will be employed.

Well, the jig is up. The Maryland winners came forward and she is not one of them.

Very sad that this woman took all these people for a ride. I’m just glad her game is over. Too bad for her coworkers who thought they had won.
Anyway glad it was 3 teachers. Good for them. Wish it could have been me. It’s fair to say their lives just got a whole lot funner for the foreseeable future. I would be in Tahiti real soon if I were them, among a bunch of other beautiful places.

I wonder if she is the same lady from Baltimore, Maryland, that called in on the Mel Dorado Show during Cars 2?

At least we know that one of the 3 winners has claimed the money. The winner that claimed it is from Kansas. The other two winners are from Illinois and supposedly Maryland, where this Wilson girl lives. I read in different articles that she has 7 children right now and works at the McDonalds where she hid the ticket. I smell welfare.

She actually hid it in a random Finn McMissile package while touring Mattel distribution center. Surely someone will find it soon.

By now this is the cleanest fast food restaurant in the USA. If she put the requisite number of tickets in the restaurant’s safe before the drawing, I’m sure all the employees have viewed the losing tickets. Not having read the entire story at other sources, I know the computer can identify where and exactly when the ticket was sold. And, if there is a security video system at the point of sale, I sure they can figure out who was in line at the time of sale.

What is there to say about all this. First, the“winner”of this thing is a read dirtbag. Second, this is a good example why you never join in with those office pools for lotto tickets. Whoever is put in charge of handling it will try to keep everything if they win. Lotto is a waste of money all around. Seriously, you have a 1 in 14 million (or more) chance of winning. You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to win the lottery. Keep that dollar in your pocket. Do the same next week. In 4 weeks, hooray you won a“free”Disney Car!
