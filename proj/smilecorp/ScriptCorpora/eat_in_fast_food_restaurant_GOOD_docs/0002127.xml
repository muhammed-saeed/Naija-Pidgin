Multiplayer Modes - DAH! Big Willy Unleashed features all new multiplayer modes heart Willy Wonka amp the Chocolate Factory 1971 DVD £ 3.99 P&amp;P:£ 0.00 GO TO SHOP at Amazon Marketplace help Having proven itself as a favourite film of children around the world, Willy Wonka&amp;the Chocolate Factory is every bit as entertaining now as it was when originally released in 1971. There&apos;s a timeless appeal to Roald Dahl&apos;s classic children&apos;s novel, which was playfully preserved in this charming musical, from the colourful carnival-like splendour of its production design to the infectious melody of the&quot;Oompah-Loompah&quot;songs that punctuate the story. Who can forget those diminutive Oompah-loompah workers who recite rhyming parental warnings (&quot;Oompah-loompah, doopity do...&quot;) whenever some mischievous child has disobeyed Willy Wonka&apos;s orders to remain orderly? Oh, but we&apos;re getting ahead of ourselves ... it&apos;s really the story of the impoverished Charlie Bucket, who, along with four other kids and their parental guests, wins a coveted golden ticket to enter the fantastic realm of Wonka&apos;s mysterious confectionery. After the other kids have proven themselves to be irresponsible brats, it&apos;s Charlie who impresses Wonka and wins a reward beyond his wildest dreams. But before that, the tour of Wonka&apos;s factory provides a dazzling parade of delights, and with Gene Wilder giving a brilliant performance as the eccentric candyman, Wonka gains an edge of menace and madness that nicely counterbalances the movie&apos;s sentimental sweetness. It&apos;s that willingness to risk a darker tone--to show that even a wonderland like Wonka&apos;s can be a weird and dangerous place if you&apos;re a bad kid--that makes this an enduring family classic. --Jeff Shannon heart Clone A Willy Chocolate Moulding Kit £ 19.99 P&amp;P:£ 0.00 GO TO SHOP at Lovehoney help Make a replica of your own (or someone else&apos;s!) willy out of solid chocolate and then hunker down for a lip-smacking treat!
