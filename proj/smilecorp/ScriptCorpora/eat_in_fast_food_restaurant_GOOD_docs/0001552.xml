Guide Review - Noodles and Company Chapel Hill - Review of Noodles and Company Chapel Hill
 The Chapel Hill Noodles and Company is in the funky-looking stand-alone building on Franklin Street, which had been vacant for almost 10 years. The restaurant has the minimalist chic aesthetic that is common to several &quot;upscale-style&quot; fast food chains, including Chipotle Grill.
During my visit, at 9:30 on a Friday night, the service was courteous and fast, although there was a five-minute wait to place my order because the customer in front of me was confused by the menu and the cashier patiently took the time to explain it to her. However, once I placed my order for Japanese pan noodles with sautéed beef and pad Thai with tofu, the food was ready quickly (in a little over five minutes) and was brought to me at my table.
The food was artfully presented--the pad Thai had colorful sprigs of fresh cilantro on the side, and bright pieces of carrot mixed in with it--and tasted light and freshly-made. The portions were smaller than I expected them to be, and were about 85% noodle and 15% meat or vegetable. I was especially disappointed that the extra $2.00 I spent to add tofu to the pad Thai only bought me about eight teeny cubes of tofu. I had a similar reaction to the very tough and somewhat gristly beef that I bought to complement the Japanese pan noodles. However, the &quot;yumminess&quot; of the caramelized udon noodles in the dish almost made up for the &quot;yuckiness&quot; of the beef.
Still, I might just stick with the mac n&apos; cheese next time!
