New BK Racing owner committed to running successful Cup team

 DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Tomato grower Wayne Press had invested in TRG Motorsports, a team that showed potential but eventually wound up folding its Sprint Cup operation after three seasons.

That experience, though, didn’t sour him nor some of his other partners enough to keep them out of the Cup garage.

Press and his partners had originally planned to start their own team with the equipment from TRG Motorsports, which was managed by Kevin Buckler. But they couldn’t get access to that equipment, so Press, Scott Gunderson and others bought equipment and assumed the owner points from Red Bull Racing, which went out of business after last season.

Their two-car BK Racing organization will make its debut Sunday in the Daytona 500.

“It’s a few disgruntled investors who decided to get together and do it ourselves,” Press said last week at Daytona International Speedway. “We wanted to just make sure we had a way to control what was going on in the team, which is something we never had control with the now-defunct 71 team [of TRG].

“We decided if we were going to put the money up, we might as well control what was going on. … No hard feelings.”

The team has signed Landon Cassill to drive a full season in the No. 83 car while David Reutimann and Travis Kvapil will drive the No. 93. Reutimann is in the car at Daytona and Kvapil will drive at Phoenix. Kvapil likely will run more races, and the team hopes that Reutimann drives in the 10 races when he isn’t in the No. 10 Tommy Baldwin Racing car he will share with Danica Patrick.

Because they have the owner points from Red Bull, the team will start the season with guaranteed starting spots in the first five races. They plan to stay in the top 35 to keep those guaranteed spots, something that TRG Motorsports wasn’t always able to accomplish.

“We actually had a wonderful experience with the 71 [of TRG], it really was good,” Press said. “We were outside the top 35 and we started funding it again and all of a sudden we were in the top 35 again.

“Then all of a sudden we were out of the top 35 and the only reason we can figure is we stopped funding it.”

Why BK Racing? There are Burger King logos on the hood of the cars and the uniforms of the drivers, but the fast-food restaurant’s headquarters hasn’t announced a sponsorship.

Some of the investors are Burger King franchise owners. Press said he hopes some of the company’s vendors will also get involved in sponsoring races. Burger King executives will be at the track for the Daytona 500, and Press said he hopes some of the company’s vendors also will get involved in sponsoring the team.

“We have their absolute 100 percent go on this,” Press said about Burger King. “Whether they are going to compete as a corporate car or if they’re going to offer it out to some of their suppliers or vendors or their charitable foundation [is to be determined].”

Harry McMullen, the former TRG general manager, is the team’s general manager. It has 17 cars from Red Bull but it has been a scramble since the purchase was completed less than a month ago.

The team is based in the former Randy Moss Motorsports shop in Statesville, N.C.

“We’re ready and we have 100 percent confidence not only in the cars but the crew,” McMullen said. “It was a Herculean task to assemble such a crew in such a short time, which is a credit to them to assemble cars.

“This bunch accomplished something that a lot of people told us was impossible a month ago.”

Cassill said he has confidence in his new owners.

“They’ve shown me how serious they are about going racing and they’ve made it clear to me of their intentions and their passion,” Cassill said.

“These guys have dabbled in NASCAR through TRG but have decided they want to do this the right way and be competitive. … They want to make a good impression on the sport and be a positive addition to NASCAR.”

Press is part of a family that owns Lipman Produce, a Florida tomato grower, and said he knows what it will take financially to keep the team going.

“We survived on a shoestring [budget] with the 71,” Press said. “We’re so much better funded it’s unbelievable going into this venture with the 83 and the 93.

“BK Racing is here to race every weekend, every race, every lap. We’re not start-and-parkers. We intend to do this correctly. We want some longevity out of this.”
