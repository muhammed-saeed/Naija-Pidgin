Eveninthebestoftimes, applicationsforSocial Security disability benefitsmoveata glacial pace,butbaby boomers risk being frozen outastheyfloodtheSocial Security Administration,orSSA,withnewrequests.



Older workerswithmedical conditionsmayhavelosttheirjobs,notbeenabletofindnewworkandnowarefilingfordisabilityasa last resortbecauseoftheeconomy,saysMarkHinkle, spokesmanfortheSSA.



In2008,thelast yearforwhichfiguresareavailable,theSSA received morethan2.3 million applicationsforSocial Security disability insurance, upabout117,000fromtheprevious year.Butnowtheagencyisbeing swampedwithabout750,000 more disability insurance applicationsthanexpected, Hinklesays.



Whileinmostcasesthere’snoguaranteed waytospeedtheprocess along, followingsomesimple stepsmayhelpavoid years-long delays.



Thefirst thingtokeepinmindisthatsomedire conditions, suchascertaintypesofcancer, early onset Alzheimer’s diseaseanddozensofothers, receivealmostimmediate approvalforSocial Security disability benefits.Thelistofconditionsthatqualifyfor“Compassionate Allowances”canbefoundontheSSA website.



Butformostcases,it’s much more complicatedtowin approval. Jean Setzfand, directoroffinancial securitywiththeAARPinWashington, D.C.,saysabouttwo-thirdsofSocial Security disability requestsareinitially rejected.Ifyou’re turned down,youcanrequestthatyourcasebereconsidered,butfew decisionsarereversedatthatlevel.Thenext stepisa hearing beforeanadministrative law judge,andnearly two-thirdsofapplicationsarethenapproved.



Intheory, appealsaredecidedwithin a year,but“thatisanaspirational goal,”saysGerald McIntyre, directing attorneywiththenonprofit National Senior Citizens Law CenterinLos Angeles.It’snotunusualforcasestotake twoorthree years.
