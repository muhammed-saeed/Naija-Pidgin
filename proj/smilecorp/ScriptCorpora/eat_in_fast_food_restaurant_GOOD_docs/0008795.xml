Officer stops to check car, finds three teens losing lunch
 By Nick McCrea , BDN Staff Posted Feb. 19, 2012, at 5:42 p.m.                
HOLDEN, Maine — In 21 years of law enforcement, nine of them with the Holden Police Department, Officer Chris Greeley has seen a lot, but nothing quite as amusing or unusual as what he saw at the side of the road Sunday afternoon.

“I’ve been a cop a long time,” Greeley said, “and I’m telling you, this is a first.”

Around 4:40 p.m., Greeley was on patrol in his cruiser when he came across a vehicle parked on the side of the road in an odd way and decided to stop and check on the occupants. As Greeley pulled up, he saw the three teenage occupants of the vehicle sticking their heads outside the car, vomiting simultaneously.

“At first, I figured I maybe had drunk people or something,” Greeley said. But that didn’t end up being the case.

When the teens recovered, they told Greeley they had just left a fast-food restaurant. Apparently, the meal didn’t agree with the front-seat passenger, who lost his lunch in the car. The driver and passenger followed suit, and the driver pulled over until their stomachs had settled again.

“It’s not so unusual to see one person throwing up on the side of the road as a cop,” Greeley said, “but to see three doing it in concert [is].”

Greeley left the scene after making sure the teens were OK so they could clean up.

No one was charged after the incident “and I wasn’t about to search the car,” Greeley said, still laughing when he called the Bangor Daily News minutes after leaving the scene.

“They were in good spirits, considering,” Greeley said. He did not say where they had eaten. (Nick McCrea, BDN)
