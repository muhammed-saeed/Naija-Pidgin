What was once Vietnam Georgetown is now Little Viet Garden and while it looks a LOT nicer after an entire redecoration the food was not as great as I remember it being before, although still very good.

We liked everything we ordered and I got my usual seafood in a bird&apos;s nest (noodles) but there wasn&apos;t enough sauce so maybe that was it...  Before I would do whatever I could to get to Georgetown Vietnamese each year I was in DC for our meetings. Now I can really take it or leave it. However, if you are looking for a nice place to go in Georgetown and get Vietnamese food I would recommend it, I just liked it  a bit better before...

Service was good too.

I am actually impressed. Honestly if only Georgetown wasn&apos;t so crowded and if parking wasn&apos;t so dreadful, I might just be a regular here.

Appetizers: For once, the crispy spring rolls were actually extremely delightful, though the portion was pitiful. With those, I was pleasantly surprised. The garden roll never really gets me (reminds me of rabbit food), so I&apos;ll won&apos;t speak too much on those.

Entres: Curry lovers, or even if you&apos;re not, the Chicken Curry I would definitely DEFINITELY recommend. Loved it! The dish came out and there were small chunks of chicken, small blocks of potatoes, and jalapeno peppers in the dish. This dish alone was redeeming and was the determining factor for my return (if i ever make it to georgetown again).
The Saigon Combo was........ meh. Don&apos;t get it, it&apos;s nothing spectacular. Just meat and vegetables on a stick with rice.

I had walked by Vietnam Georgetown numerous times, the food always looked good and this establishment was on my list of places to try while living in DC.  Too bad I didn&apos;t lose that list!

In a nut shell, this is a great place to go if you don&apos;t know what good Vietnamese food can taste like and don&apos;t care to learn.  Also, its helpful if you don&apos;t mind being implicitly treated like your some idiot tourist who can be served pretty much anything at any price and just say, &quot;meh, ok I&apos;ll eat this...&quot;

What I mean by this is, please don&apos;t serve me appetizers that look like they came from the frozen food isle and heated up in the microwave.  While this is perfectly acceptable drunk food that comes free with a pitcher of Bud at TGI Fridays, please do not try to pass it off as authentic Vietnamese and charge around $10.  Also, lemonade for $4 (with no free refills)... you better have been back in the kitchen squeezing lemons and stirring in the sugar, not dispensing it from a soda fountain which is how it tasted.  All I know is that nobody enjoys finding $12 on their bill for lemonade.

We ordered 3 entrées:
1. The Golden Crepe - avoid at all costs.  This is a huge bean sprout pie with a few shrimp mixed in.  The quantity does not compensate for the lack of quality and absence of flavor.
2. The lemon grass chicken served in a clay pot: This was decent, not what I have come to expect when ordering Vietnamese... the flavors were one dimensional and the lemongrass overpowered any other spices... but it was edible.
3. The seafood curry: Very delicious.  If I ever return to this restaurant (which I doubt I will since there are so many better options in DC) I would probably order this again.  Again, the flavors were not nuanced, it was pretty much just spicy, but at least it was flavorful and not offensive.  This dish alone allowed Vietnam Georgetown to avoid a 1 start rating.

One final tip to management, clean this place up, fruit flies have set up shot in your dining room!

We went on a Sunday afternoon with a group of folks attending a conference. Unlike La Madeline next door, this restaurant was not crowded.
Tips for the restaurant:
a) Do not present the menu with weekday lunch specials if you do not serve them on Sundays.
b) Sunday lunch is a lean time and it felt like there was less supervision in the restaurant leading to a bit of slow service

Food was great and for food this restaurant should get 31/2 stars. I would go back again and live with slow service. It was very friendly and neverthless enjoyed the meal very much.

I liked this place (random find on Yelp), but I know my fellow dining companions just thought it was okay. Guess it depends on what you order!

My friend&amp;I split the Tom Yum soup with tofu (REALLY good)&amp;the vermicelli with pork&amp;egg roll (good, but not spectacular). Based on our food choices, I thought this place was pretty good (albeit a little pricey). Some other people got pho (they only have one option of pho on the menu...weird for a place that calls itself Vietnamese cuisine) and they thought it was okay. A few other friends got the Pad Thai, which they said was NOT good.

Overall, I think this is a decent place to come to if you know what to order (or happen to stumble upon something that&apos;s good).

This is not a pho house.  I know pho.  This is not pho.

We ordered 2 non pho plates.  Ok  I should preface by saying besides pho,  I know vietnamese food from places like Le Cheval in Oakland, CA http://www.yelp.com/biz/… and Le Colonial http://www.yelp.com/biz/… .

So when we order a grilled chicken with vegetables.  We certainly didn&apos;t expect our vegetables to include, cooked english cucumbers, pineapples, celery and stewed-like tomato.  People keep saying &quot;Solid and authentic&quot; in their reviews about this place and it totally throws me for a loop.

Maybe I don&apos;t know vietnamese?  Hence the 2 star and not the 1 I really think it deserves.  But cooked cucumbers?  really?

I agree with most it&apos;s a dive.  Regardless of the picture of Harrison Ford dining here. And yup the service is poor.  Have to ask for things a few times before you get what you asked for.  If you&apos;re wondering why the service is slow then look in the corner of the restaurant, the host/server person is totally engrossed on his laptop.  Yup.  I wish I could I IM that I&apos;m ready for my check!  Check please!!

My boyfriend and I went to this place on a whim late on a Sunday night, and I must say we were VERY pleasantly surprised by everything.

The service: Impeccable, I never had to get anyone&apos;s attention, and the food came out so quickly I felt like I had just sat down.  The staff was polite and friendly, I just felt so welcome there.

The food: Fantastic.  Maybe we just got lucky with the right wait staff and the right cooks this night, but every dish we got was fantastic, and for the price it was a reasonable amount(especially in the downtown area).

Overall my experience was superb, and I will definitely be going back.  And if you go, try the Vietnamese coffee; it&apos;s sweetened with condensed milk and it&apos;s such a different kind of delicious I&apos;ve never had before.

This little dive restaurant located in Georgetown (who would think it) serves up some solid AUTHENTIC Vietnamese food unlike their competitor Miss Saigon. The Pho here was solid, the crispy spring rolls are amazing and the lemongrass chicken is ok.

As with other reviews I will have to agree that their service can be horrendous, especially if you go during peak hours. To alliviate this go when its not busy, duh. Thats what I do and I have no problem with the service.

Why all the bad reviews??

After a weekend of gorging ourselves with alcohol and less than healthy American food, our final food stop was Asian and we decided to go with Viet. nomnommmm.

Even dining with a Vietnamese, she said this shit was up to par!

Service was just as good - definitely no gripes there though the man other than our waiter seemed to be working harder than our actual waiter.

For a Viet joint, the prices were a bit higher vs portion but I&apos;m not complaining.

My boyfriend has been pretty sick and since our favorite Pho place (PHO 75 in Rosslyn) was closed in honor of the Chinese new year,  we decided to try something in our neighborhood.  I have to say, I don&apos;t think Pho is something that is too difficult to get wrong but this pho was just awful. The meat was WAY overcooked, the hot sauce you add to the pho was incredibly crusty around the opening of the bottle and the mint seemed like it was a few days old as it was pretty dried out.

I ordered what I thought was going to be a meat and veggie dish only to find out that it was an $18 way over glorified Beef Lomein with like 3 pieces of meat and very few veggies.

We arrived at about 2:00pm and were given the lunch menu.  We picked out two lunch items (Pho and my beef dish) both listed as being $8.95.  Once we ordered, the waiter very quickly said- &quot;oh the lunch menu is only week days so you are ordering off the dinner menu&quot; and then quickly scurried off.  We didn&apos;t have an option, or even an opportunity to look or change our minds.  The total bill was $38 which included Pho, the glorified beef lomein and 2 glasses of tea.  For a 2:00 &quot;light lunch&quot; with sub par food, I&apos;d say this is completely ridiculous.

We both decided we were glad we tried out the restaurant but that we will most definitely never return!  Now we know we just HAVE to be faithful to our PHO 75 in Arlington- the VERY VERY best!  If we want beef lomein we will order off of the delivery Chinese menu!

This is a lunch review.  Pretty moderate prices, and tasty food.  They recently jazzed up the decor and installed a nice little bar to give an extra option for single diners.  I don&apos;t know authentic pho from faux pho (I love reading that out loud), but I know what I like, and I like their pho. Pretty decent service.

BTW, the place is now known as Little Viet.

Went to this restaurant with some friends last weekend, and I must say, this place was DELICIOUS.  The menu had a lot of delicious choices, but I ended up getting the crepe with beansprouts, mushrooms, shrimp and chicken.  It was so good, I only wish the portion size had been bigger!  The crepe melts in your mouth.  I have actually been thinking about that crepe ever since and am dying to go back.  Friends seemed to really like their dishes too.

The decor of the place seemed a little run down but I don&apos;t really care about that.  The waiter was a little hard to understand but he did a fine job.

I highly recommend this place because it is delicious food, the restaurant is not incredibly crowded and its reasonably priced, as well as smack-dab in the center of Georgetown.  Get the beansproat crepe!

I&apos;ll repeat what a few have said:

-Not really a pho spot.

-I&apos;ll assume it&apos;s not really all that authentic...I&apos;ll take Gina K&apos;s word for it.

-But...It&apos;s very tasty!  Priced pretty typically.  A solid meal and a quiet (too quiet actually, I think they deserve more clientelle) atmosphere.

&quot;See those two resturants across the street?&quot; my friend was telling me, &quot;they&apos;re both Vietnamese places. Go to the one on the right, the corner. It&apos;s always full of people. The one on the left is always empty and doesn&apos;t have good food.&quot; Taking this tip, as you should, too, I walked into Vietnam Georgetown in search of spring rolls.

Vietnam Georgetown is not a large restaurant. The giant mirror on the far wall makes it seem like it&apos;s bigger, which was rather amusingly disorienting to me when I first walked in. Indeed, at 6:30 on a Thursday night it was full of people. The menu is extensive as most vietnamese resturants have it, although this one is somewhat confusingly divided into Appetizers, Chef&apos;s Specials, Beef, Pork, Chicken, and Vegetarian. Confusing because some of these categories overlap (ie Chef&apos;s Specials include things that one would find under beef or chicken, but which weren&apos;t redundantly listed there. Appetizers popped up redundantly or randomly throughout...)

I ordered the chicken saute curry. I had really wanted a vegetarian curry with tofu in it, but they don&apos;t serve a vegetarian curry so I settled. I also ordered spring rolls which, upon arriving - two spring rolls already cut in two for me with a side of peanut sauce - the waiter abruptly and almost rudely told me &quot;do not cut the rolls with a knife! just eat it like it is.&quot; The warning came from the right place, but it was so strange to hear someone tell me how to eat my food, particularly at a restaurant.

The spring rolls were OK - the dish alone is a 3 out of 5 stars. They weren&apos;t the worst spring rolls I&apos;ve eaten, nor were they the best. Filled with typical shrimp, rice noodles, lettuce/basil, and, actually I think beef and not pork - two of them were $4.95. The rolls were somewhat small, and the rolls themselves were warm - I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re really supposed to be served cold, but it wasn&apos;t a warmth of freshly prepared spring rolls - the bottoms were becoming tough from over refrigeration or something. Still, they managed to satisfy my craving.

The chicken saute curry (or was it saute curry chicken?) was a red curry with coconut milk, lemongrass, basil. It wasn&apos;t overly spicy and I wasn&apos;t given an option of choosing a level of spiciness. The portion was moderately sized and came with a side of broccoli. I could have easily finished it even after eating the spring rolls. This dish was $11.95.

Service was prompt - my water glass was never empty and the food arrived quickly - and the food was pretty yum. I would return again, but I&apos;d definitely like to try some of the other vietnamese restaurants in the area and I certainly hope that this isn&apos;t the best DC has to offer.

What would I do to improve / why didn&apos;t I think it was better? Aside from the above complaints, I felt that it was a little expensive for what it was and the portion sizes. I was also missing what I feel are other vietnamese staples - more curry choices, etc. But I could be wrong since my favorite vietnamese place is actually a thai + vietnamese restaurant. Anyway...

I took my aunt out here for dinner last week, and while I&apos;ve eaten here before, I thought it would be a good time to start yelping again.

The food was pretty good (even better than I remember it being). We got the crispy rolls and fried wonton for appetizers, and they were both nice and tasty. The crispy rolls were especially.... crispy.... and had a hint of some nice spices in them - they were delicious!

My entree was the spicy fish (salmon) which was served with steamed white rice. I really liked the flavor of the spices that they used in the spicy curry sauce. They aren&apos;t anything that I normally use to cook with, so they added a nice flavor that you don&apos;t get from other popular asian foods (Japanese, Chinese, Thai, etc.). My aunt got some grilled pork that was served on skewers, and let me tell you, they were absolutely delicious! The meat was so tender and perfectly cooked throughout. Combine that with the spices they were cooked with, and it was so good! I will definitely get that the next time I come back here (and trust me, I WILL be back!).

As far as the portions/price and service are concerned, I have no major complaints. The price is a little bit pricier for the portion size, but the restaurant is in the Georgetown area, so what do you expect? The service was fine - no complaints.

Just a note, if you have to use the restroom, it&apos;s in the basement of the restaurant. When you open the door for the stairs, the stairs are literally RIGHT THERE, so watch your step. The stairway is pretty narrow too (with the door opening towards the stairs), so it&apos;s kind of an awkward process going to the bathroom - this is just a product of the colonial buildings found in Georgetown though.

In short, I really enjoy going to Vietnam Georgetown for a different dining experience. And while some people say that the food isn&apos;t authentic Vietnamese food, I am no expert, so I can&apos;t make that assessment. My aunt, on the other hand, spent 3 years in Vietnam as the US Consul General to the country, and she said that the food is pretty darn authentic, so I&apos;ll take her word on that!

Come to Vietnam Georgetown and enjoy!

What can I say that hasn&apos;t already been said? This is a great place to go on a date, or if you just want some awesome Vietnamese. I wasn&apos;t aware of all the history this place had (thanks Lu D!), I thought it was just good eats. I really enjoy the garden out back, and I usually don&apos;t like eating outside.

I heard they have a buffet here for lunch and I think it&apos;s only about $5 or something. You really can&apos;t beat that. I wish I worked in this neighborhood, because I would hit up the buffet like every day. I do agree there are not enough vegetarian options, but the spring rolls are some of the best I&apos;ve had in D.C.

Well, from the outside this appears to be a quaint Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Georgetown. But passerbys beware; this is not the once highly rated spot it use to be. There was an odor not native to Asian markets the moment you walked in the door. The entire restaurant looks a bit too used and worn by the years to occupy such a corner location in expensive Georgetown.

The Pho was okay; both was lacking in flavour and the beef was mediocre. Only one type of chili sauce **GASP** was enough to make me want to walk out the door.

Keep walking; there are better Vietnamese choices just up the road.

How is this place still in business? The restaurant looks really outdated and very old. I would think that if you have a restaurant on Georgetown and on M street, that you would invest a little more in decorating the restaurant and making it feel welcoming in the hopes of attracting more customers. Now, the food is just plain terrible! I thought this place would be good for dinner because whenever I pass by it, it&apos;s usually crowded for dinner and someone from the Four Season mentioned it to me (perhaps I got the wrong name?). So of course I thought it would be good. Boy, was I in for a surprise!

The waiter wasn&apos;t rude, however, he wasn&apos;t engaging or friendly. He barely spoke English and was very inattentive. I waited FOREVER for him to come and take my order even though the restaurant at this time was empty. You can tell by the way he took my order that this is probably his first time working as waiter or just really didn&apos;t care. He was nice, but it looked like he was taking at order at a fast food restaurant. I asked him for recommendations and he couldn&apos;t even answer that and just gave me an odd look. I ended up ordering the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were just plain oily and not great at all. The panang curry was semi decent, but not enticing enough for me to want to return. I had the fried banana for dessert and it was just average.

I was a bit annoyed because they sat me on a table next to the window facing the street --which had a plant by the window. Guess what? They were bugs flying around the plant and going around me. I guess I should&apos;ve said something, but at this point I just wanted to leave.

I came alone for dinner and watched the waiter with the other tables. I could tell the other patrons were completely unhappy and also regretted having dinner there.

I spent an overall $36 for dinner (tip included) and I really wish I would&apos;ve gone somewhere else.

Overall, save your money and go somewhere else.

I go here for lunch occasionally as I work in the area.  The prices are meh, but considering wraps around here cost upwards of $8, Im glad to pay for something I can take home and reheat.

I usually get soup and a noodle dish, and while the noodles aren&apos;t AS Fresh as I would like in a more upscale restaraunt, for lunch - it&apos;s not bad. I go and sit down sometimes for lunch there, though not often, and the staff is always nice.

I would recommend this for a lunch place more so than a dinner &quot;date&quot;.  It&apos;s really more like a local joint than a fine dining Georgetown experience.

What lured me into this restaurant was the beautiful garden in the back, complete with strung-up little lights at night...and it was in Georgetown.  Yes, it has some history and has survived a long time as an upper-scale Vietnamese restaurant, but unfortunately the quality of the food does not match the atmosphere.

I took family here (two-fifths were Vietnamese) for a nice dinner out 5 years ago and never went back.  Although some of the food was pretty decent, mine was terrible.  I ordered the egg noodle soup with roasted pork and shrimp -- which advertised the noodles as being &quot;fresh&quot;.  They were not.  I know what fresh egg noodles taste like, and these had a bad case of freezer burn flavor.  It totally permeated and ruined the flavor of the entire soup.  How disappointing.

Just across the bridge is Minh&apos;s (Courthouse metro stop); it&apos;s my favorite place for Vietnamese dinner cuisine (not pho).  The white tablecloth atmosphere there is nice and the food is great, complete with lower prices.

Okay, I get that this place is in the middle of a non-Asian area and it&apos;s one of only a few Vietnamese places. But this was the SMALLEST bowl of pho I&apos;d ever had in my life. EVER. Like half the size of a bowl I&apos;d get anywhere else. And it was expensive. Small or expensive would be ok, but not both! Sadness!!! The taste was ok, I&apos;ve had much better.

Excellent!  I&apos;ve been going here since the early 90s and it has never changed.  The food has always been incredible, exactly how upscale viet food should be.  I won&apos;t comment on the authenticity (which it has) of the food, and seriously who cares (go to VA if you want strictly &quot;authentic&quot; food), but if you love GOOD food, this is the place.  Yes, its expensive, but you&apos;re in Georgetown, get over it! (Once again, go to VA if you want cheap).
Its small, but the wait is usually not bad, and its usually not the busiest place in GTown, so the wait staff is pretty good.
The crispy spring rolls are a dream!  They hit the spot everytime.  The rest of the menu is equally delicious, spicy and tasty.  This is NOT a place for pho (see my recommendation on Pho75 if you want pho), so don&apos;t judge based on that, although it too is good.

The water comments below made me laugh--we received two glasses of water each, within 2 minutes.

A foggy, wintry Sunday night at 10:15 pm is no time to be choosy about restaurant options, at least in this town. Thank you, Vietnam G&apos;town, for being open. Food was pretty good--beef vermicelli and spring rolls. Caramel chicken tasted a bit...old, like the chicken had been cooked long before.

Apparently, the patio is a really nice spot.

I met a friend for dinner visiting from Rome who remembered a great Vietnamese place in Georgetown. Unfortunately it was the place next door.

Nevertheless, we went in to find a few tables occupied and were quickly sat by the window. The weather was frigid and I wanted nothing more than a hot steaming bowl of pho to soothe the soul.

Unfortunately, they only had a few pho varieties, beef, chicken and fish, as well as lemongrass soups on the menu. Tsk tsk. I asked if they had anything more hearty like mi kho or anything else with egg noodles to which they replied: oh, that&apos;s authentic Vietnamese food. Our clientele is different.

Ok. &apos;Nuff said.

With that, I walked away from the soups and ordered deep fried soft shell crab with ginger sauce. My dinner mate ordered chicken lemongrass soup and the seafood crepe. We started with Crispy Rolls.

The rolls were decent, but too much of everything - I think they used rice paper as the wrapping but it was too much, maybe layered a few times. Huge chunks of onion that made a messy operation of eating. We didn&apos;t finish them.

The Lemongrass soup came out next to share. Good flavor and tender slices of chicken. Overall a good soup dish although it did need more of a kick.

On to the mains. My fried soft shell crab was above average, although I have a sneaking suspicion that the &quot;ginger sauce&quot; came out of a plastic pouch in the back. Not very good - I mixed my own sauce with fish sauce and sriracha. His crepe looked decent and had no complaints.

Overall, it was a good meal. However, don&apos;t go if you&apos;re expecting authentic Vietnamese cuisine. It felt more like dining at a Chinese dive restaurant - with very friendly service.

Vietnam Georgetown is nothing to write home about!   The service was poor.  My friend and I only ordered soup&amp;the fried summer rolls, but we couldn&apos;t seem to get the waiters attention for more water, even though the place wasn&apos;t full.

The food was fine, but again, nothing special.  I wouldn&apos;t even recommend it to anyone either.

Fried rice is good. Noodle soup is okay. A little pricy though. But it&apos;s Gerogetown, so understandable.

Great Place!  We eat here all of the time.  It is the best Vietnamese food in the district.  You can&apos;t go wrong.

Miss Saigon sucks.  Don&apos;t go there.

This place is only okay in my opinion.  Call me a wimpy American, but I have on at least one occasion found a bug in the soup.  And yes, that pisses me off.

That said, it&apos;s less fancy than Miss Saigon and so I often pop in here during lunch for summer rolls and a small bowl of Pho.  Summer rolls here are nice though!  Pho not so much.  Just not that tasty in my opinion.  But as many have pointed out, there really are not a lot of Pho places in DC, which makes this place all the more important. For those of you who like Pho as much as I, I will put it this way:  when attempting to satisfy a Pho craving here, I leave about half satisfied and thinking about where else I can go next!

But bonus points for accepting credit cards, being in the district, and offering other dishes besides Pho, although I have never tried anything outside of summer rolls.

I had the shrimp toast, goi ga,  pho ga and the hu tieu thit tom.  The shrimp toast was basically a shrimp paste on top of toast and it&apos;s all deep fried.  It was ok, but nothing I would order again.  The shape of the shrimp toast was odd and I&apos;m curious what they do to get their bread to look like that.  The goi ga was great.  They put enough fish sauce in where so you don&apos;t need to put your own in but I would prefer the fish sauce on the side so I can customize to my own taste.  The cabbage and veggies were finely shredded and easy to eat while the white meat chicken was tender and shredded consistently.

The pho ga had a great broth.  They served us the bowls of soup and I waited for a bit for them to come around with some veggies and hoison and hot sauce.  For some reason they forgot and I had to get the servers attention and remind him.  There were 3 tables of customers and that&apos;s it so it wasn&apos;t because they were busy.  The small bowl of Hu Tieu we ordered was too small.  I recommend you to get the large regardless of size of appetite.    The hu tieu also had slices of pork that were delicious with the broth, noodles and shrimp.

I guess I went on a bad day, or ordered the wrong thing...I was really looking forward to some delicious Vietnamese food.  I ordered the Pork with Lemongrass in Caramel sauce.  The pork was almost inedibly dry, and it was served with some under-cooked, unseasoned steamed broccoli for $12.  The sauce was quite flavorful but a little too thin mop up with the meat.  I ended up ordering some peanut sauce to counteract the dryness...The peanut sauce was bland and of an undesirable consistency (not fully emulsified)

The jasmine tea I ordered was oversteeped and very bitter.  However, I loved the high quality classical tea pots they use, and the nice ceramic teacup.

The service was passable.  They were quick but not particularly friendly.

The ambiance could use some work, and the menu could use a little aesthetic tune-up.

Still, after reading everyone else&apos;s reviews, I&apos;d almost be willing to give it another go.  Every place has bad days.

The staff was pleasant towards us when we ate here.

Unfortunately the food was watered down, catering to the below average taste buds that run rampant in this area.

Prices are decent, but go to Falls Church for authentic Vietnamese cuisine.

Very not bad.  I wandered through Georgetown and needed a place to grab a bite.  I wanted a quaint little dive with good food and that&apos;s exactly what I got.

The place is nothing to look at but it was clean and and well it was clean.

The bottom line was that I enjoyed my meal.  I got something with chicken skewers, which were infused with some interesting flavors.  They were tender and juicy and overall ok.

Folks, it&apos;s a dive.  Go in with that attitude and you&apos;ll come out feeling pretty good.   Expect your server to hand you a wine list and give you a black napkin that won&apos;t leave lint on your pants and you&apos;ll be thoroughly disappointed.

Food/Cost: (4/5) I came here for an early dinner around 5pm today (a Sunday). The place was pretty much empty except for one other table. We started with the Fried Wonton appetizer ($4.95). I ordered the Grilled Chicken with Noodles ($12.95), and my dining companions ordered the Chicken Curry (approx. $13), which was served with rice and broccoli, and Grilled Pork (approx. $13), served with veggies and rice. The wontons were average at best. They were freshly fried and hot, but the wontons were pretty small and didn&apos;t leave me any lasting impressions. My friends really loved the red dipping sauce it came with though. As for the entrees, all were enjoyable. I particularly liked the grilled chicken on skewers; the flavored really marinated well into the chicken and the meat was moist and succulent. However, I wish that they slid the meat off the skewers before serving as that would make the dining experience easier. I also wanted more crushed peanuts; it felt like they only gave me a teaspoon. Still, it was fun eating my Grilled Chicken with Noodles as the veggies, meat, sauce, and noodles come in distinct piles for you to cut and mix together. The flavors were well-blanced (sweet and salty), there were a variety of textures (soft noodles, tender chicken, and crunchy veggies and peanut bits), the colors were vibrant, and the meal left me feeling full in a healthy, energized way.  As for the other dishes, my friend raved about the Curry Chicken (I&apos;ll withhold judgement as I&apos;m a Japanese Curry type of girl) and I also like the Grilled Pork (like my chicken, it was also grilled and flavored perfectly) despite not being a pork fan. From my one meal here, I would venture a guess that there grilled meat dishes are all good if not great -- they really seem to know how to tenderize, marinate, and cook the meat.

Ambiance: (1/5) This place needs a facelift , inside and out. The paint on the outside was chipping and looked a bit dilapidated. Inside, there is no semblance of decor or theme. Also, I have to say, the chairs here are super uncomfortable. They don&apos;t move well on the carpeted floors and you can feel the reeds that you sit on. For the price tag of the food, customers really expect more in terms of ambiance -- especially in the beautiful Georgetown area.

Location: (3.5/5) The Georgetown area is lovely -- it&apos;s bustling and trendy -- but Vietnam Georgetown is located at the very edge of it. Further, the Georgetown area is not exactly accessible by Metro, which is my preferred method of public transport here in DC. So while this restaurant is in a nice, relatively safe area of DC (which boosts its location rating), it still only fares slightly better than average.

Service: (4/5) As the restaurant was primarily empty when we ate here, we got pretty good service. We were greeted by a nice Vietnamese (?) lady upon entering, orders were taken quickly and our appetizer came out right away. After we finished our starter, our entrees arrived shortly after and the staff checked on us a couple times throughout the meal.

Overall: (3/5) Despite the great flavors of the dishes here -- particularly of the great sauces and meats -- I would expect a bit more ambiance and class for the price paid. I would consider eating here if I was in the Georgetown area, but I wouldn&apos;t make a special trek out here for Vietnam Georgetown.

Unfortunately, Yelp doesn&apos;t allow me to give this place zero stars.

I came with a party of five, and the restaurant was pretty full. However, when I asked for a table, I was told it would be just five or ten minutes. Over the next 45 minutes, we watched as about 20-25 people who came after us were seated ahead of us, sometimes in places where they could have pulled two tables together. Every time we asked we were told we it would be just a moment.

Just as we were getting ready to leave, we were ushered inside, which turned out to be very unfortunate. We were seated and given empty water glasses and no menus. After waiting another 15 minutes, during which we tried to get the waiter&apos;s attention, we had to get up and tell the manager that we still hadn&apos;t been waited on. We were handed menus to take back to our table. Several minutes later -- more than an hour after arriving to the restaurant -- we were given water.

When the waiter came over, we expressed our displeasure, but he did not apologize. Not at all. He just said it was the bus boy&apos;s fault.

By the time we got our food, everyone who had come after us had already had finished. The food itself was not very good. Out of five, one person liked her dish.

It took us nearly three hours to have dinner here. Despite all of this, no one at the restaurant apologized. When I told the manager that we&apos;d had a really bad experience, he acted like he had no idea why we were unhappy.

Skip it.

&quot;Opened since 1973,&quot; it says.  I find nothing more depressing about a restaurant than one that&apos;s clings onto its former glory.  Any restaurant that prominently advertises its awards from the 1980&apos;s is like a aged prom queen living through worn out yearbooks.  Yes, Vietnam Georgetown may have earned Washingtonian Awards between 1980 and 1987 but what happened afterward?  What happened to the 1990s?  Or the 2000s?  1987 was over 20 years ago!

And the Cheap Eats award of 1994?  Outdated.  Few menu items cost less than $10.  There are enough price revisions that Vietnam Georgetown should simply print a new menu.  Or do they lack the capital to re-market itself?  Better to close up shop, declare bankruptcy like Chrysler, and re-open with a new reputation.

There is a more elaborate menu but I consider a bowl of pho to be the litmus test of Vietnamese cuisine.  If you can&apos;t get that right, I&apos;m not convinced why I should spend any more money.  At, Vietnam Georgetown, the pho (alternatively known as &quot;beef and rice noodle soup&quot;) is treated like an appetizer soup.  At $7.95 for a small bowl and $8.95 for a large bowl, that&apos;s a pricey appetizer.  The broth is very light and clear.  It many respects, it&apos;s not that bad for a summer soup.  But the beef is overcooked and it lacks any garnish (e.g. bean sprouts, jalapeno, basil, lime juice, etc.).  I wasn&apos;t even offered chopsticks.  Imagine that ... an Asian eating a noodle soup with a fork.  Fortunately, it wasn&apos;t the worst bowl of pho I&apos;ve ever had but it was surely lacking in size and taste for the amount you pay.  By comparison, you&apos;d find better Vietnamese food at Pho 14 at Columbia Heights but you&apos;re better served by choosing to bridge to reach Pho 75.

My word of advice for Vietnam Georgetown.  If you want to hang up old Washingtonian Awards, you better keep earning them.  Check out A&amp;J&apos;s in Rockville, MD, or Pho 75 in Arlington, VA, for its continuous chain of Cheap Eats Awards dating back to the 1990&apos;s and late 1980&apos;s, respectively.  Now, that&apos;s impressive.  (Original Visit: May 23, 2009)

Oh I miss this place...I went to school in DC, but now I am down in GA.  Every time my boyfriend was in town visiting, we would hit this place.  I would get the grilled chicken with noodles every time, and he would always get the crepe. Yum yum!!
