Atlanta, GA -- March 27, 1999 -- Longtime Atlanta homicide investigator James Grimes III won&apos;t give up on the murder case of Markisha Brown, who was 16 and pregnant four years ago when she was found strangled and stuffed into a trash bin behind a gas station.
Grimes, a cop for 30 years, is intensifying his efforts to uncover fresh leads in the case.

&quot;In the years I&apos;ve worked as an investigator, this has been the most frustrating case,&quot;Grimes said.&quot;We&apos;ve done all the work we can. But we are again asking that anyone who may have seen anything the day of that girl&apos;s murder, please come forward.&quot;

The Brown case is one of 14 being reviewed by a newly formed&quot;cold cases&quot;detail in Atlanta&apos;s homicide squad.

It&apos;s an especially tough one for Grimes because of Markisha&apos;s youth and because, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner&apos;s Office, she was in her first trimester of pregnancy when she was killed in May 1995.

Police have identified Markisha&apos;s stepfather, Darryl Lucas, as a suspect.

But DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan said there is not enough evidence to arrest Lucas.

Detectives believe Markisha was strangled in her family&apos;s home in DeKalb County, then dumped behind a gas station on Bankhead Highway in northwest Atlanta.

&quot;I didn&apos;t think police had strong evidence for arrest or prosecution in DeKalb or Fulton counties, certainly not strong enough for DeKalb,&quot;Morgan said.

Based on interviews with the family, Grimes said, police believe the motive may have been Markisha&apos;s rejection of sexual advances.

Markisha&apos;s grandmother, Christine Bailey, told Grimes that Markisha confided in her that Lucas made advances toward her.

Bailey, who lives in Decatur, used to call Grimes daily to find out whether police had made an arrest.

&quot;I know it was him,&quot;Bailey said.&quot;Darryl never liked Markisha.

She told me he would go in her bedroom and watch her. She never wanted to take a bath when he was around because she said he would go in the bathroom and watch her there, too.

&quot;Markisha was afraid of Lucas and so is my daughter Diane. But she won&apos;t admit it,&quot;Bailey added.

Diane Lucas, Markisha&apos;s mother, doesn&apos;t believe Lucas killed her daughter.

&quot;We had a good family,&quot;said Diane Lucas, a physical therapist at DeKalb Medical Center.&quot;The only time I&apos;ll want to talk about this murder is when police tell me they&apos;ve arrested someone.&quot;

Diane Lucas said she has not seen Lucas since the couple separated shortly after the girl&apos;s death. Bailey said she last saw Lucas about the same time, at Markisha&apos;s funeral.

Markisha was a 10th-grader at Columbia High School in DeKalb.

Family members say she wouldn&apos;t leave the house unless her makeup and hair were perfect and she was wearing earrings. The teen was close to her mother, but the pair seemed to get along only when Lucas wasn&apos;t around. Police said Diane Lucas was often caught between the two, trying to maintain the peace.

&quot;One of the things her grandmother told me was that Markisha would never leave the house without her purse,&quot;Grimes said.&quot;It was crucial to her because that&apos;s where she kept her makeup.&quot;

The day Markisha&apos;s body was found by a homeless man behind a Texaco station on Bankhead, she had neither her purse nor her earrings. She wasn&apos;t wearing makeup. Her things were found in her bedroom at the Sandusky Drive house she shared with Lucas and her mother.

Tests at the time showed that carpet fibers found in Lucas&apos; car matched fibers found on the clothes Markisha was wearing when she was discovered. The same fibers clung to the lid of the trash bin, Grimes said.

&quot;A neighbor said he saw Lucas park the car way into the carport with the rear of the car backed up close to a side door to the house,&quot;Grimes said.&quot;The neighbor said Lucas had lifted the trunk door so that it would obstruct the view of the side door from the street. The neighbor said he watched Lucas spend most of the morning putting something into the trunk.&quot;

Grimes questioned Lucus twice. The first time was the day after the killing at the family&apos;s house. Lucas recounted his activities the morning of the killing, saying he drove his wife to work and ran errands. He said he got home at 8:30 a.m. and Markisha already had left for school. Lucas told Grimes he had gone to an Auto Zone shop to pick up parts for his car and to a fast food restaurant. Employees of the auto shop told Grimes they didn&apos;t see Lucas, the detective said.

Nearly four years later, Grimes is still looking.

&quot;Someone out there knows something more,&quot;Grimes said.
