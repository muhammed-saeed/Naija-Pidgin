 Daughter Recants Rape Claim; Father Free After Nine Years In Prison 
 April 3, 2012 at 11:06 am by Morbid   
 LONGVIEW, Wash.– Think you got it bad? Imagine spending nine years in prison for raping your own daughter even though you were innocent of the crime.

That’s exactly what happened to one a man in Washington who spent nine years in prison after being convicted of raping his 11-year-old daughter in 2002.

Thomas Edward Kennedy, 43, has always maintained his innocence, before and after a jury convicted him of three counts of first-degree child rape. He still had six more years to go behind bars when all charges against him were dropped and he was released from Stafford Creek Corrections Center last week.

The reason? His daughter lied.

Cassandra Kennedy, now 23, went to police in January and admitted to detectives that she had falsely accused her father of raping her because she was angry over her parents 1991 divorce and was disappointed with her father’s increasing absence.

Cassandra told detectives she got the idea from a friend whose stepfather was sent to prison for a child sex crime.

“I thought that is what I would do to make my dad go away,”she told police.”I wanted him away so he would stop hurting me. I took my own vengeance.”

According to the Cowlitz County prosecutor, there are no plans to charge Cassandra for lying because doing so may discourage girls from reporting sexual assaults. Thomas has declined to comment, saying he’s simply trying to get on with his life.…

 Boy Who Was Starved To Death By Parents Ate Own Feces 
 April 3, 2012 at 9:52 am by Morbid   
 Dallas, TX– This is one of those horrendous child abuse stories that keep me from typing up another child abuse story for a week or so. But if you are looking to hate anyone today, I give you Aaron and Elizabeth Ramsey, a Texas couple who admitted to starving a 10-year-old boy to death .

Police began looking into the disappearance of Jonathan Ramsey after the child’s grandfather contacted them last week, concerned that the boy had not been seen since January 2011 and the boy’s father was giving him different reasons why.

After being questioned by police, 34-year-old Aaron and 31-year-old Elizabeth would finally admit that the boy was dead and that Aaron had disposed of his body in an unknown location. But an affidavit has been released that details exactly how the boy was killed and the details are absolutely sickening.

According to Elizabeth Ramsey, who is the boy’s stepmother, they began starving the boy in March 2011 after the boy punched her in the stomach while pregnant with triplets, supposedly causing her to lose the babies.

Elizabeth said that her husband Aaron locked Johnathan in a bedroom and only fed him bread, water, and occasionally milk. The boy went from 90-pounds to 60-pounds and according to the affidavit, the boy was so hungry that he ate his own feces .…

 Man Dies At Wrestlemania Party After Cousin Puts Him In Chokehold 
 April 3, 2012 at 9:01 am by Morbid   
 Destrehan, LA —A man died at his own Wrestlemania party Sunday night after his teen cousin placed him in a choke hold.

According to reports, 24-year-old Stephen Arceneaux III had invited friends to his home Sunday night to watch a gay wrestling soap opera called Wrestlemania 28.  At some point during the festivities, Arceneaux and his 14-year-old cousin began wrestling on an inflated mattress.

During the bout, the teenager, who weighed 110 pounds, got 220-pound Arceneaux in a rear-naked choke hold .

For those of you unaware, this popular move is when you get behind an opponent and wrap yourself around them like an addiction. You then place a forearm around their neck while pushing on the back of their head with your other arm, subsequently cutting off their air supply.

Witnesses told investigators that Stephen Arceneaux had informed everyone he was no pussy and would not“tap out”or signal the teen to release the hold. He kept his word.

After 30 to 40 seconds of not being able to breathe, witnesses say that Arceneaux turned blue from lack of oxygen. They told the teen to let go, which he did, but it didn’t matter much as Arceneaux had stopped breathing altogether.…

 Man Arrested After Propositioning Child Torture Victim 
 April 3, 2012 at 7:54 am by kniption   
 

 Portsmouth, NH - According to police, a 52-year-old woman reported that a man who had tortured, raped, sodomized, drugged, and threatened her over an 8-year period as a child approached her in a supermarket and asked her if “she wanted to pick up their ‘affair’ where they had left off.”

This inquiry by Souran Manougian, 81,led to his arrest on 25 felonies.

A police affidavit described a pattern of behavior and manipulation that Manougian–who is known locally as “Buddha Babe” (?!)–is alleged to have used on the victim, who is a relative.

The court documents describe the abuse beginning in 1966, when the woman was 7 or 8 years old and–according to police–include her being forcibly raped and sodomized by Manougian who told the girl it was his responsibility to teach her “how to be a woman.”

Manougian is alleged to have told the victim that he would kill her, her mother, her grandparents, her dog, or “anything she loved if she told the police.” The woman reportedly described Manougian once showing her a badge and saying he was “a special officer” with the city police department and that she “would never be believed” if she told anyone what he’d done to her.…

 Woman Accused Of Throwing Puppies At Boyfriend During Fight 
 April 3, 2012 at 7:40 am by Rebekah Herzberg   
 Fridley, Minn - A woman in Minnesota has been arrested and charged with three counts of animal cruelty after allegedly throwing three pit bull puppies at her 25-year-old boyfriend.

David Remme and 20-year-old Gabrielle Allen had been arguing inside an SUV outside an apartment complex last Friday morning when Remme allegedly struck Allen in the face, breaking her nose.

That’s when Allen reportedly picked up three week-old pit bull puppies that had been in the front seat and threw them at Remme. No reports on if she hit her mark, but the puppies landed in the parking lot.

As Allen left the Anoka County Jail with a black eye, she denied any wrong doing.

“I didn’t throw any puppies.”She claimed.“I was wrongfully incarcerated. I have a broken nose. I have some bruises and scars all over my back. That’s all I’m going to say.”

Police say that although the puppies landed on concrete, they appear to be fine. They were taken to a breeder for evaluation and neither of them were believed to have sustained any injuries. Because of this, Allen will only be facing misdemeanor charges.

Charges that Allen says police should have been filed against Remme in the first place.…

 Four Girls Charged After Beating Of 12-Year-Old Girl Caught On Video 
 April 2, 2012 at 12:34 pm by Morbid   
 WOONSOCKET, R.I.– We can’t seem to go more than a week without juveniles making the news after getting caught on camera beating the crap out of one of their peers.

This time it’s out of Rhode Island where four girls, two 12-year-olds and two 13-year-olds, have been charged after a tape of them beating a 12-year-old girl was posted online.

The victim’s mother, Holly Gingerella, downloaded the video before it was removed from Youtube and took it to police. After their investigation, officers charged all four girls ; two with assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy, two with simple assault and conspiracy.

The video shows a 12-year-old girl spending most of her time on the grounding fending off the kicks, hits, bites, and scratches of her attackers. Gingerella says her daughter was friends with the girls and the fight was the result of her daughter saying a boy was cute.

She says they lured her there in order to ambush her and then wouldn’t let her leave. She says they threatened to beat her again if she went home and told anyone and pretended to be her daughter when they texted Gingerella asking if she could spend the night with the girls.…

 Mom Charged After Killing Daughter In Botched Suicide Pact 
 April 2, 2012 at 11:11 am by Morbid   
 SALT LAKE CITY, UT– Here’s a depressing one out of Utah where a woman has been charged with murdering her 18-year-old daughter while allegedly botching a suicide pact .

On March 21, 52-year-old Mary Ethyl Hansen drove to a neighbor’s home to tell them she had shot her daughter and asked if they could call 911.

When police arrived at Hansen’s home, they found her suffering from a non-fatal, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. In one of the bedrooms they found the dead body of Hansen’s daughter, Virginia Ray Hansen. She had been shot twice in the head.

Hansen told officials that she and her daughter suffered from mental illness and wanted to die . She had just failed to honor her end of the agreement they supposedly made.

A friend of the family said that Hansen was living on Social Security benefits, had fibromyalgia and was having financial difficulties. her daughter had few friends and took online courses instead of going to school. According to the friend, the Hansen and her daughter spent most of their time together inside the house and rarely went out.

Hansen has been charged with first-degree felony murder and was booked into the Salt Lake County jail immediately after being released from the hospital.…

 Man Accused Of Extorting BYU Student He Met On Craigslist 
 April 2, 2012 at 10:05 am by kniption   
 Salt Lake City, UT - A Utah man has been charged after being accused by police of extorting sexual favors and money from an engaged, male Brigham Young University student whom he met on Craigslist.

Provo police say Brad Ray Adams, 36, met the unnamed 21-year-old BYU student Feb. 22 on Craigslist and the student subsequently sent him sexually explicit pictures. According to the police report, the two men also had consensual sex, which Adams videotaped without the student’s knowledge.

According to Provo police, when the student told Adams he didn’t want to continue the relationship, Adams reportedly demanded $260 to destroy the video and pictures. If the student refused, Adams said he would release the pictures and video to BYU officials , the student’s family members, fiance, and LDS religious leaders.

The threat of disclosure to BYU officials may have been seen as particularly troublesome as BYU students are bound by a strict honor code that prohibits students from having pre-marital sex. Although the honor code doesn’t specifically address their male students taking the sausage from men who look like pug dogs, it is presumed that this particular activity would also be met by BYU officials with disdain.

After the student paid the money, Adams reportedly demanded an additional $800 or $600 plus more sex.…

 Man Charged After Spitting On Elderly Woman In Traffic 
 April 2, 2012 at 9:57 am by Morbid   
 Cape Coral, FL– A 33-year-old man has been charged with battery after he allegedly spit on a 75-year-old woman in traffic in a fit of road rage.

Police say the woman, Lois Artino, was a passenger in a vehicle being driven by her son when Kurt Ronis pulled alongside them.

He was not happy with the way they where operating their vehicle and showed his displeasure with a barrage of profanity and a salvo of spit fired into their passenger window.

After the elder Artino was spat on several times, they pulled over and called police. Ronis was later identified after a surveillance photo of him at a toll booth was made public.

Officers interviewed Ronis at his home where he admitted to spitting at the Altinos after they cut him off in traffic. Ronis, who expressed remorse for what he did, was arrested for battery on a person 65 years of age or older.

I don’t condone what Ronis did, but my God do I understand it. But if it were legal for me to spit on all the horrible drivers I encounter on a daily basis, I’d be dead of severe dehydration. I’d leave for work at 7 a.m., and at 7:15 a.m.…

 Homophobic Old Woman Attacks Gay Neighbor 
 March 30, 2012 at 11:04 am by PetePuma   
 Richland Hills, TX –Wanda Derby, 71, is charged with a hate crime after allegedly attacking her openly-gay next-door neighbor , Lloyd Guerrero, 25, with a cane on Wednesday night.  It must be“Crazy Texas Old Person Day”here on Dreamin’Demon, at least from where I sit.

It seems that Derby was perturbed by the fact that her son had recently moved in with Guerrero and his family .  Over the past week, she had reportedly begun posting messages on Guerrero’s Facebook wall, saying that he had AIDS and would die of it soon.

Hours before the attack Wednesday night, Derby wrote on her Facebook page:“My son Steven is no longer my son. He has sided with the idiots next door and I guess he [thinks] they will take care of him. He will never get another thing from me or his dad. We have washed our hands of him.”

As the police report goes, Derby ambled over to Guerrero’s house on Wednesday night, armed with a cane and a whole cadre of slurs directed at his sexual orientation.  She struck and attempted to choke him, leaving marks on his throat and torso, slapped Guerrero’s mother, and assaulted other members of the household.  When they attempted to seek refuge inside the house, the old bat just kept coming, like a fat, homophobic, deranged, geriatric Energizer bunny, I’m guessing.…

 Elderly Man Kills Wife After Dog Defecates In Home 
 March 30, 2012 at 10:34 am by PetePuma   
 Lewisville, TX –A 76-year-old man, Michael Stolz, has admitted to shooting and killing his wife, Bernice, 49, and their two dogs over an argument regarding floor-borne fecal matter .  And here’s the kicker:  it didn’t happen in Florida.

Mr. Stolz, who was reportedly scheduled for a mental evaluation already, claims he was frustrated with his dog’s habit of laying down deuces in the house.  Now, anyone with a brain knows that you’re not supposed to complain to a guy who has just come to realization that he’s got a carpet bomb to clean up, especially he’s been unhinging right in front of you for some time.  Bernice did it anyway, however.  I only wish I’d been there to counsel her.

Michael then allegedly did what any mentally unstable person with a loaded gun might do.  He went into the bedroom and got it.  He then proceeded to unload the gun through the barrel and into the offending dog’s skull, killing it.  Not satisfied, he fired at least a couple of bullets into the other, soon-to-be dead, dog.   That’s when Bernice apparently ran, screaming, into the kitchen.

Stolz then turned the gun on her, lethally shooting her in the abdomen.  He admitted to not planning the murders out very well because, if he had, he claims he would have left a bullet for himself.  I guess he just wasn’t thinking straight at the time.…

 Teen Charged After Sexual Images Of Herself Found On School Laptop 
 March 29, 2012 at 2:08 pm by kniption   
 New Holland, PA - Police in Pennsylvania have charged a 16-year-old girl after she was reportedly discovered to have more than 350 images of herself engaging in or simulating sexual acts on her school issued computer .

The girl also reportedly had additional videos of herself and 13 videos of other underage children engaged in similar behavior.

“[I am] shocked that that could happen in a public school,” stated Carrie Hantranft, a mother of another Garden Spot High School student. “As parents we need to make sure that the teachers are doing everything they can to make sure that the kids are monitored,” added Hantranft.

“I guess I never really gave it that much thought that somebody would have something like that on there,” another mother, Valerie Muttik, commented.

The 16-year-old has been charged with two counts of possessing obscene and other sexual materials. Additional charges against Garden Spot High School parents for felony cluelessness are, presumably, still pending.…

 Fetus Eater Accused of Dumping Abortion Records Into Recycling Bin 
 March 29, 2012 at 11:01 am by PetePuma   
 Overland Park, KS –More than 1,000 abortion records including names, birth dates, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, and the patients’health history have been found in the recycling bin of a Kansas City elementary school, causing outrage in the community and a police investigation to boot.

Krishna Rajanna, 74, a former doctor whose license was revoked in 2005 after receiving numerous fines and disciplinary actions for uncleanliness by the Kansas Board of Healing Arts, is under investigation in the case .  The story goes far, far beyond that, however, as the police records from 2005 detail a truly appalling history behind the former abortion doctor. 

On March 15, 2005, Kansas City Detective William Howard testified before the House Committee on Health and Human Services regarding a visit he’d paid to Affordable Medical and Surgical Services while investigating a claim by Rajanna that an employee was stealing from him.  The accusations proved baseless, it seems, but what the detective saw at the clinic, and heard from employees, probably scarred him for life.

According to the detective, the doctor was unkempt; with dirty hands, messy hair, and stained clothing.  The clinic was“dark and dingy”and smelled“musty.”There were reportedly dirty dishes in the sink and tabletop, trash everywhere, and roaches crawling across the counters.  There were no visible medical waste containers, as employees from the clinic report that he would bring all medical waste home to be dumped in his personal trash.  On the way out of the facility, Howard’s partner reports seeing dried blood on the floor of a“nasty”-looking procedure room.…

 Teen Caught On Video Beating Girl During Girl’s Soccer Match 
 March 29, 2012 at 10:27 am by Morbid   
 CHESTER COUNTY, SC– Police have charged a teen girl after she was caught on video assaulting another player during a girl’s high school soccer match .

The attack happened Monday afternoon during a soccer game between Chester High School and Lewisville High School. It was also captured on video by a CN2 News crew.

In the video, 18-year-old Annette McCullough, a player for Lewisville, is passed the ball and ends up tripping and falling to the ground. When she stands up, she immediately begins beating the snot out of an opposing player.

The video shows McCullough dragging the victim to the ground by her hair, then punching her in the head and face at least 11 times. The attack lasts around ten seconds and didn’t stop until a woman comes over and separates the two girls. A referee can then be seen escorting McCullough off the field.

The victim didn’t suffer any apparent major injuries, just some knots to her head. Her mother told reporters that she still has to undergo some medical tests to insure none of her daughter’s brains got scrambled in the melee.

After reviewing the video, police charged McCullough with simple assault. Referees are also reviewing the video with the South Carolina High School League to see if they will dole out further punishments.…

 Man Apprehended With BAC Seven Times The Legal Limit 
 March 29, 2012 at 8:39 am by kniption   
 Valparaiso, IN - In an obvious bid to secure a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for drunkenness, a northwest Indiana man was apprehended by police with a blood-alcohol level of 0.552 percent – or roughly seven times the legal limit.

Police say that on Saturday afternoon, a woman reported seeing a man–later identified as James Henderson, 28–laying on the side of a road. EMS noted that Henderson had several bruises and responding officers reported that Henderson made a“barely-coherent”statement about getting hit by a truck. Police have not yet confirmed whether Henderson was in fact struck by a vehicle.

Henderson faces public intoxication charges as soon as he is released from the hospital. If his release is pending sobriety, he may have some time yet…

It has been reported that Henderson has a‘ history of alcohol-related charges .’Sadly, it appears that the positive side of his drunkenness has been underreported. Let’s hope that this achievement will change all of that.

 Man Wearing Sombrero Jumps On Police Cruiser 
 March 29, 2012 at 8:07 am by PetePuma   
 Sacramento, CA –Jesse James Thomas, 55, was arrested at about 12:30 AM yesterday morning on suspicion of being drunk in public .  I am suspicious, myself, with regard to the probable cause here.

Thomas, stealthy drunk that he appears to be, reportedly approached a manned police cruiser wearing a single boxing glove, sombrero, and a puffy, dark jacket.  He then jumped onto the hood of the vehicle, shouted his name, hopped down, and fled the scene.

He was found nearby in short order, lying down in the street.  He was booked into the Sacramento County Jail on $1,000 bail.  It’s just too bad that he had obviously regained full sobriety prior to his mugshot being taken.…
