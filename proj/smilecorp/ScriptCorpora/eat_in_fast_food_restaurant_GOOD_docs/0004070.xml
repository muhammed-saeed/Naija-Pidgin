Ingredients

One batch of Both: Batter&amp;Frosting (Hershey Cocoa)

1 Bar of Semi-Sweet Chocolate (I used Ghiradelli), shredded/grated

1 large package of Gummy Worms

Cupcake Liners


Instructions

Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Line two, 6-cupcake tins. Fill the liners half way. In three batches, bake 12 cupcakes at a time, for 17 minutes. Allow to cool entirely.


After the cupcakes are cooled, take a large-holed straw (like a fast food restaurant&apos;s)&amp;insert into the middle of each cupcake. Twist out a &quot;hole&quot; Place the tail end of 1 gummy worm in the hole. Holding the gummy worm&apos;s head, frost around the worm on the cupcake. Still holding the gummy worm&apos;s head, sprinkle shredded chocolate &quot;dirt&quot; onto the frosting. Finally, place the gummy worm head into the frosting so the candy bug stays in place!
