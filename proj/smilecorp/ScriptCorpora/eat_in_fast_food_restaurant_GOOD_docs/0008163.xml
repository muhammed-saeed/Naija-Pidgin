  Quoting: Guns n&apos;God (redux) 

America outspends all the next twenty-five most prodigal armaments -purchasing countries on the planet and the whole shebang has been run under Emergency war Powers since 1933*, and in whose interests it has been administered thus becomes daily more apparent, and you can&apos;t envisage a formal declaration of martial law EVER taking place? Haven&apos;t you noticed how your&apos;civilian&apos;law-enforcement has morphed into kevlared&apos;Delta force cyborgs?
Weren&apos;t you watching after Katrina?



*It is an established fact that the United States Federal Government has
been dissolved by the Emergency Banking Act, March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1,
Public Law 89-719; declared by President Roosevelt, being bankrupt and
insolvent. H.J.R. 192, 73rd Congress m session June 5, 1933 - Joint
Resolution To Suspend The Gold Standard and Abrogate The Gold Clause
dissolved the Sovereign Authority of the United States and the official
capacities of all United States Governmental Offices, Officers, and
Departments and is further evidence that the United States Federal
Government exists today in name only.


The receivers of the United States Bankruptcy are the International
Bankers, via the United Nations, the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. All United States Offices, Officials, and Departments are now
operating within a de facto status in name only under Emergency War Powers.

Really? What do you expect the Feds to do when the nation is going up in flames, the cities are burning, the economy is in complete shambles, and no one is able to exert any authority over the people? Just sit by and watch to see how it turns out, and if the people will permit them to remain in charge after they storm Washington?

I think not! Despots NEVER relinquish power willingly, and the Federal Government is indeed a DESPOT... THey will FIGHT to retain their authority, and they will try anything and everything to subjugate the people of the USA to accomplish that.

Martial law included!

IF they get away with it... The States stand in their way, under the 10th amendment and other laws, the individual States could band together regionally using the National Guard to oppose the Feds.

We&apos;ll see, maybe...

No, we won&apos;t. What type of fantasy world are you living in where cities are about to burn and the American people are about to riot?

Nobody that I know seems all that angry.


You and your friends don&apos;t seem to be mad because you all have you OBAMA liberal heads buried in the sand. One of these days your gonna wake up to a full revolt against our government. Do you know how many Americans are involved in militia groups and various other anti-government organizations? The number is growing everyday, and the number are already staggering. I&apos;m personally not involved with any such group but I know many fellow Americans that are. These are just your everyday normal people, not your everyday nut. Can you imagine what the everyday nut is thinking about our government right now. Look at the man that shot up the federal courthouse in Nevada. He was just mad about social security. Whats gonna happen when these people join together instead of acting alone. Its a scary thought to me. There are to many things for the people of Earth to be scared of today. If its not earthquakes its solar flares or near earth objects in space. Its late, im tired and im rambling on.

LOL, the&quot;miltia movement&quot;was just a bunch of fat middle aged men running around in the woods during the weekends in the mid-90&apos;s. The Clinton administration and now Obama&apos;s crew are trying to hype it up like the militia is an actual threat and that they&apos;re organized but that couldn&apos;t be further from the truth.
  Quoting: Guns n&apos;God (redux) 

Keep telling yourself that the militia is just a trend of the 90&apos;s bud. Its people like you that are signing our rights over every day because you refuse to even take a glimpse at the truth.

  Quoting: Anonymous Coward 534125 

Which Constitution? President Obama is not talking about the Constitution of Corp US.

The president withdrew from the BAR before becoming the President. He is not swearing his fealty to the British.

He is the President of the United States of America....and that&apos;s WE the people.

So, I&apos;m asking which constitution you are talking about. Study the original Constitution. I haven&apos;t, but it would be interesting to know what the vested authority for the President is under the original Constitution.

No, it&apos;s not.
  Quoting: Guns n&apos;God (redux) 

I never said they were organized, I just said there numbers have grown extensively in the last few years. I don&apos;t think there a thing of the past. I believe when pushed to a certain point they will all unite to form one massive group. Weather or not they win is a different story. Because as most of us here know that if we rise against our country that the UN (or the NWO) will come to Mr. Obama&apos;s rescue. But I just feel that Americans will get tired of living like a third world nation. Unemployment will be the tipping point of all this, that or if we start a new war front. Me and my family are having to move because there is no work where I live, I have been out of a job since September. Mr.Obama promised that he would turn the economy around, but in his hands it has went in the opposite direction. I cant even get a job at a fast food restaurant. And because my wife has enough Indian in her to have a cdib card the DHS wont help us with bills, and because she has so little Indian in her the tribe wont help us either. At least they let us have food stamps. If it wasn&apos;t for caring family we wouldn&apos;t have money for bills. Thank god we have a total electric home. And thank god its mine and no money is owed against it. The closest job I can find is 100 miles away. Because I hurt my back several years ago there just is not a lot of jobs for someone without a HS diploma, in which I blame no one but myself for not graduating. All in all I just thought as Americans that we deserve a little more, I thought the Constitution guaranteed it. Ive paid into our social security and everything else for half my life, and to be tossed out with the garbage is just a shame, and I bet I&apos;m not the only person to feel this way. Where is my country when I need them the most. mercury2

 The formation of the Council of Governors was required by the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defence Authorization Act which stated, The President shall establish a bipartisan Council of Governors to advise the Secretary of Defence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Council on matters related to the National Guard and civil support missions.

 I do not see how either this EO, or the enabling law, can in any way be construed to support your assertion that this is a first step toward martial law.

1) The requirement for this Council originated with the National Governor&apos;s Association (NGA), after several senior DOD officials tried to tell state governors (in 2006 and 2007) how and when the federal government could use (call up for Title 10 Federal active duty) the National Guard units, which are controlled by the respective governors. For background on this issue, please see the NGA letter at [ link to ow.ly ] The 4th point of the letter addresses the council.

2)This council is a FACA advisory committee; for more information on how they work, please see [ link to ow.ly ]

The President today signed an Executive Order establishing a Council of Governors to strengthen further the partnership between the Federal Government and State Governments to protect our Nation against all types of hazards. When appointed, the Council will be reviewing such matters as involving the National Guard of the various States; homeland defence; civil support; synchronization and integration of State and Federal military activities in the United States; and other matters of mutual interest pertaining to National Guard, homeland defence, and civil support activities.

In selecting the Governors to the Council, the White House will solicit input from Governors and Governors associations.

 Report Copyright Violation Re: Breaking News - Obama Signs Martial Law Executive Order the numbers are giving me the creeps, I wondered if something&apos;bad&apos;was going to happen on 1-11-2010, and it seems kinda bad to me. Why did he pick this day to sign it?

10 regions? That number gives me the creeps due to what the bible says about the king coming out of the 10, kinda weird, why didn&apos;t he pick 12? or 9? or even 11?

hmmmm,

I&apos;m sure he is dotting his i&apos;s and crossing his t&apos;s due to the fact that the shtf is coming when the bottom drops out this year. We can&apos;t keep printing money, something has to give, Geitner will be thrown under the bus, but people are going to demand fed res audit. People are going to vote against the dem&apos;s and they are going to HAVE to TAKE control, not let the pub&apos;s win, and thats when shtf in the streets, and OBAMA will take over for good.

Course I believe there could be two bama&apos;s, a look alike clone and the original.

I do believe he is controlled by the illumanti, and if you read this...you&apos;ll just be freaked out like me

15Then the angel said to me,&quot;The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. 16 The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire . 17For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God&apos;s words are fulfilled. 


&quot;The bipartisan Council will be composed of Ten State Governors who will be selected by the President to serve two year terms.&quot;
