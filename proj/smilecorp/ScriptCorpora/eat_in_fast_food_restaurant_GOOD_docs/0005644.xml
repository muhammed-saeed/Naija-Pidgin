 Calling every boy, every girl... 
 A new year. So filled with opportunity, isn’t it? Just thinking of bits of deliciousness to unearth and healthful-affordable recipes for sharing thrills me right down to my core. 
 So do these! Redolent, dark, rich and creamy; I couldn’t resist C.H.O.C.O.L.A.T.E. It would be remiss if I were to skip-out on these bites.  Yup.  To put it succinctly, these dinner-spoilers are both my butter and my daily bread. 
  One mouthful for me; all eyes for you. As I nibble, I think, &quot;Why? Why do chocolates taste so gosh-darn perfect?&quot; Chocolate is well, chocolate, and there is no other that holds more allure than multant gooey-goodness that lingers only to leave me ready for the next light-and-fluffy bite. 
 
 
 It&apos;s truth, my friends: this coming-back-for-more-seduction is but a foolproof tactic to food marketers. The marketers&apos; goal? For us (the eater, buyer or the buyer’s accomplice) to pick their product as a remedy to any craving. Their sales pitch might as well plead, &quot;Pick US as your poison!” 
 
 
 Don’t believe me? Then here is Coke’s food scientist gloating the essence of soda,“... In our fruit flavors we’re talking about, we want a burst in the beginning. And maybe a finish that doesn’t linger too much so that you want more of it.” To hear more, listen to this video . And, in case you wonder what food scientists do, they adulterate far-out flavors like these , colors like those , and or precarious  ingredients  to mix into the most pleasing entree.  
 
 
 Maybe processed foods and beverages are the major culprits. You know – the half-baked, partially hydrogenated (also known as &quot;illegal&quot; trans fats  found in these foods ) mis-pronouceable, boxed ingredients we call our beloved All-American cuisine – are engineered to satisfy our taste-buds’  fix. 
 
 
 But, are these foods addictive? I couldn’t justify an answer nor am I out to vilify the food industry. I like too many of these goodies (but not to my detriment) to do that. 
 Here’s a local cupcakery with cannoli cream filled cakes, buttercream frosted white chocolate cake with mascarpone filling, vanilla cake imbued with Samoas or Snickers or Reeses, a tuxedoed cream cheese frosting on top a cocoa bottom and so much more! How about this one...a homemade local plum and peach tart iced with homemade blueberry-lime jam You can’t go wrong with this one – my first long-neck pumpkin pie. Its flavor comes to life with a splash of bourbon. 
 The Food Industry: A Change of Pace? Food makers seem to vacillate between signs of better-for-you discoveries and the omens of profitable fat, sugar, corn and processing.  
 A couple months ago, change-makers in the public and private sectors (like food industry, government, foodies, movers-shakers, you name it) met to brainstorm transformative action in the  Partnership for a Healthier America . They challenged the current projections about American health by altering children’s programs to grow healthier peeps while devising new partnerships and funding avenues to support them.  
 Amidst the speculation, they took this  study  into account. It addresses the bottom-line advice that industry can profitably make the healthier foods or behaviors the easier choice for Americans. Let&apos;s wait to see results.  
 Take  Fruity Faces  for starters. Though full of sugar and additives, I believe this product enlivens wholesome possibilities. Whats more, the “Got Milk”ads will now feature your favorite breakfast Cereal characters . Most of the chosen cartoons represent relatively healthful cereals; except Tony the Tiger from Frosted Flakes (This cereal misses the federal and industry mark by a looong shot because of the ample amount of added sugar)....Oh well, maybe I’m nit-picking.  
 The Food Industry: Hesitant to Change their Direction  For now, companies who make sodas,  sugary cereal ,  fries  and other ambrosial delights cry out for your lapping tongue! The marketers take any means to obtain their hankering....at any cost. Just look at the amount of  lobbying money  (skip down to the $$ projections at the base of the lobbying link) they spent to continue advertisements, for children no less. According to Marion Nestle’s account, the food industry fought this kind of nutrition regulation with $37 million. Why? 
 
 
 So they could nutritionally classify  pizza as a“vegetable”  for school meals.  
 Side Note: the calories in 1 slice of pizza  = 5 cups of carrots  but with 9 times the fat and 14 times less fiber. The registered dietitian in me wishes people eat a pizza for protein and grains and a side dish of carrots for their vegetable fill.) 
  In this picture I even pack the vegetables on top. Don’t let the purple color fool you, it is a whole wheat pizza-pie loaded with my signature blend of chicken sausage, purple cabbage, onions and roasted sweet peppers strewn across melty cheese and red sauce. 
  Even more interesting would be the addition of purple or dragon red carrots as a side! 
 
 
 Back to my question: why does food industry flaunt what’s unhealthy?  So that the potato agribusiness representatives can use their clout (and $$) to keep fried potatoes as a school cafeteria staple? Maybe... 
 
 
 Or, I know! Lobbying food companies get reimbursed. It’s about increasing product sales and monetary pay-backs (Please listen to this NPR segment  for more details!). Though predominant in this area,  lobbying happens in every sector , not just the food system. 
 
 
 The Food Industry: Repercussions of Their Greed  Why can’t these lobbiests forget about the money and remember whom they are targeting? The kids. Can’t we  come up with common sensical reasons not to inoculate the young, growing youth with unhealthy behaviors. Because of the obesity epidemic future generations  are predicted to die younger  than their parents. Unhealthy kids will be hospitalized more often. Maybe they won’t be as productive as their peers with so many secondary issues to obesity (70% of obese kids have one risk factor for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, the list goes on... ).  

 This Youtube campaign states my case loud and absolute: currently, much of the food industry seduces kids with delicious treats. Yale and the Robert Wood Johnson foundation also printed a  report on the influence of internet gaming (Case in point,  Fruity Pebble’s Flinstone online games ) on kid’s food purchases. 
 
 
 It’s Your Turn. Take Action.   The People campaign   aims to topple the Supreme Court’s  Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission  decision, which held that“corporations are people.”If this ruling were to change it would alter two things: (1) corporations would have to disclose their political spending, and (2) it would ardently dismiss big money from politics (lobbying in part). If you wish to confront corporate influence on politics, put your word in by signing this petition  to call the president into action. 
 
 
 You can always support one of these organizations too!  
 
 
 If you’re not into this whole political thing; you can always buy you, your family or your future family healthy, well-balanced meals. Vote with your food dollar.  Sammy urges us to go for the cause! And, who could say no to that puppy face... 
 
 
 That’s all for now.  
 
 Eat well, and k eep frosty!

 I&apos;m baaaaack. 
 Chicitos--long-lost friends--groupies of the blogosphere, have you been awaitng more delectable recipes? 
 
 I’m speaking to you, readers out there.  
 It’s been a skip-hop-and-a-sprint type of trip since last we spoke. But, what better a time to revisit this blogging hobby than a couple days past the Food Day ? As the first holiday of its kind, this day called partakers to encourage an affordable, healthy, fresh new makeover of our food system. The question is,“Did you take some moments to recognize this special holiday?&quot; Moving forward. Please, might you want to pull up a chair, smell the flowers and hear of my adventure last year? Here it comes; hang-on tight. 
 
 D.C. was just the beginning. A spring board, of sorts. There, I ate from a full plate of opportunities (all voluntary, of course). I started by meeting with many &quot;number ones”or head-honchos of the professional world, Christine Jahnke being one of them. She&apos;s a speaking coach from“ Positive Communications ”who was featured as one of the most influential female professionals in the NY Times. J ust wrapped-up, polished and printed is her first book (Find it on the cheap  here ). 
 &quot;Freetime,&quot; I devoted toward two places that snuggled dear to my heart: (1) Livehealthier and (2) DC Central kitchen . The people who exert some elbow grease to run these places are fabuloso. EHEM...dietetic interns, both of these organizations house dietitians on staff. Check‘em out for the pick-your-own-career rotation! REALLY! 
 
 At GW, I attended the big (gigantic in my world...) unveiling of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines , heralding a year of political nutrition support and a world that recognizes the food movement. Also, I took part in the National Food Policy Conference .  More to come on all the developments in my future posts! (Dismiss the bald-head blocking my view at 12 o’clock....)  
 Oh my, and how might I forget the kids from the &quot;Rooting DC”Conference and the Washington Youth Garden ! While conferencing, I succored urbanites in mastering their mud-playing skills. Quite a quotidian matter for us country folk turned into the challenge of their kiddie-lifetime. 
 But it was nothin’that some good-ol’-fashioned education couldn’t handle. This city-slickers learned to roll a dirt ball perfectly. Amen little brother (pronounced“Aaaaammmeennn lil brotha!”And, for effect, a fling of the hip, lean, and elbow up resting on my side). (My photography is also posted on the Washington Youth Garden Blog site) To honor my birthday, I caroused in NYC with ferly surprises from two of my best buds (pictured below). Unquestionably one of my 2011 highlights. Together, we ventured through Chelsea, an uppity section of NYC. We fit in? Sure....well, at first we pretended. Instinct and a drive to jump begged to differ. My friend and I posed on the garden furniture as onlookers’eyes rounded with incredulousness. They tried to decipher the situation. However, their stares never unnerved this party of three (Actually, it was quite adrenalin-pinching.).  It was my birthday, and we celebrated how I wanted to: goofing and leapfrogging from benches. Mmmkay? 
 
 We stole away to the novel restaurant  Bell. Book.&amp;. Candle . What a sight! Skyward, the roof kept a small hydroponic garden . Forward, we scored our fixes of this heavenly produce. And, sideward, my friends and I stuffed our faces while sharing full smiles of half-eaten delights. To follow was a market-run for fresh dinner ingredients and a Central Park-run to breath in the flawlessness of the spring evening. By sunset, we finished both our ambrosia and jogging. That night, the lights of Broadway beckoned us into the city. Mary Poppins welcomed us with open umbrella. What next?? 
 Gardening! Beehaven Acre’s   (AKA my family’s farm) counters were in constant overflow--mounding with blueberries, blackberries, grapes, green beans, onions, tomatoes, peppers (enough to make Peter Piper red-in-the-face), beets (enough to dye Peter red-in-the-fingers), cucumbers; and during this time of year, a friend and I took on ample amounts of sweet potatoes. One of the last croppings brought horseradish root, parsnips, red beans (for soup and chili), pumpkins (for roasting and a Halloween showing), winter squash, celery, celriac and candy-bites of golden tomato. Too, carrots of the red dragon variety.... I cherish the influx of produce. Each fruit marking up a different part of the growing season. For early spring: strawberries, sugar snap peas, asparagus and spring onions. summer squash, beets and cucumbers come the heat of mid-summer.... Tomatoes, hot peppers, peppers, tomatillos, onions, okra....to follow He’s a year-round crop.     The beginnings of a late summer-early fall harvests includes chestnuts, winter squash, apples, more pumpkins and sunflowers. I plucked and salted these good-eats-sunflower-seeds for baking. They received the“baseball player”approval from my dad. With his life-long baseball obsession, his expert opinion means the seeds must have tasted smashing!  
 My next foraging crop up for experiment? Black walnuts. 
 I also entertained some turkeys. Who knew these birds were such people lovers?! However, expect these guys to teach you not to outfit yourself in shiney garb.  Do. Not. Get. In. This. Lady-Bird&apos;s. Way. Of. Things. That. Glisten. Hide your watches, bracelets, cameras, earrings and the like. 
 I taught the beginning of a college course to some  amazing gals. Charming, aren’t they?? 
 I met with some amazing people too. Some of them new and delightful. I proudly admit that Marion Nestle (pictured beneath) is my nutrition idol. Some old but cherished... An Arabic-speaking eskimo too (She would agree to me addressing her like so.)! I’ve kept my feet under me but moving fast. Two races down, the More and Hershey Half Marathons. Come 2012--BOOM--the NYC Marathon. I cannot wait to watch the flutter of colors characteristic to each city borough. But, for now, I weave down, around, and in-between my back-country-roads. Sometimes, I run so early in the morning that the stars ponder down on me. They’re my watchdogs, protecting me from the darkness until day-break. I feel safe. And, just recently, the northern lights  gave us a peep show. 
 
 I’ve paid zero attention to you, dear blog. Dismissing you altogether, I sadly left little time for leisure writing. It’s my new job, you see. As a registered dietitian at the Pennsylvania Nutrition Education Network , I jot a fair share of my thoughts for Pennsylvania health and wellness professionals. My organization hosted a nutrition workshop with Lynn Fredericks of  Family Cook Productions . She spoke to nutrition educators through cooking demonstrations and puppet-play. Lynn researches teaching styles. She shared; the audience listened. Families around the globe could benefit from her nutrition tactics. After the workshop, I breaked for dinner with my Mama in Bethlehem, PA.  1741 on the Terrace  was quite the find! 
 Along the side, curious friends and family investigate nutrition truths and myths. Questions anyone? 
 
 One of my girl friends, Shannon, moved back into town! She attained her dream job, and we’ve been celebratin’with slumber parties. Wahoo! Just call me her rah-rah supporter. Earlier this summer, I played at the beach, baby! My step-sis came along. Attached to her was her cutie-boy Tyler (&quot;T-bone&quot; for short). She just moved on from one of the hardest jobs in the world, being a stay-at-home mama, that is, to another career mentoring boys at a youth development center. She’ll keep busy; I’m sure. Her last week of freedom was spent tanning beneath UV rays of the North Carolina shore. She basked to a coffee-complexion while celebrating T-bone’s first steps on the beach...first cry as a wave nicked his feet....first screech in salty water. Lollygagging in the ocean is just not his forte, until his new girlfriend shimmied into the picture (photographed below on the bottom left frame). My friend Carolyn brought her monster-of-a-hubby from “Where the Wild Things Are” to my farm. After such a scare, I ran non-stop up to Canada...Wolf Lake. The traveling-crew started early... My passenger slept... And snoozed.... 
 awoke for some bakery goods! Mmmm.... He napped here... ..there too. 
 My bucket lists is deemed complete (until tomorrow). Check, check and check! This summer closed full as a pig after a day of hogging all the grass on pasture. Speaking of piglets, today, we picked-up some lovely Kune-Kunes  to round-out our farm family! 
 WHAT A TRIP, I tell you.&lt;Breath&gt;, I think you’re all caught up in the dazzling, madcap affair I call life. But, my goodness, how could I leave out the essentials: FOOD!? 
 Ground Cherry Jam Post Food Day just seems like the time to get back down to business, doesn’t it? So lets get to it as I&apos;ve busied myself in the kitchen. 
 Ground Cherries. They’ve been on my“to-grow”list for a while. Have you heard of these buggers? They cavalcade a mix of tomato and kiwi into your mouth. Their silhouettes imitate  tomatillos , except they shine with their orangie hue and miniature stature. P eal away the husk; and you’ve discovered, plump, tender, ripe-full of juice, interior fruit. These babies simmer down sweet and jell perfectly into a jam. We also popped them for seeds in next years garden! You can too!  The nutty-sweet flavor was begging to be paired with citrus and sugar, so I obliged . While eating this heaven-like jelly, I found myself heavily dependent on bread...but let’s look outside the bread box to pair it with savory meats, with oatmeal, to top thumb print cookies, combine with mashed butternut squash or sweet potato, blend into a fruit-n-yogurt smoothies, coat your ice cream sundaes or spruce-up your green bean saute. Oh yum...can you add onto my list? 
 Check out the recipe! 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ground Cherry Jam Servings: Two, 6 oz jars of jam 
 Recommended Serving Size: 1-2 tablespoons 
 Ingredients 3 cups ground cherries, (de-papered) 1/4 cup water, maybe a little more 1 orange, segmented orange and juice 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon ½cup sugar ¾of 1.75 oz packet pectin

 Directions: Remove husks from the ground cherries, then measure the first time. Put cherries in large stew pot and crush so that they are all at least broken. (Remember to save some cherries to de-seed and grow in your garden the following year.) Heat to a boil along with enough water to get them to cook without burning, about 1/4 cup. Boil 2 minutes. Return ground cherries to the pot. Add the chopped orange with any juice that is oozing away. Add ground cinnamon, sugar, if using, and the pectin. Bring mixture to full boil, boil 1 minute. Bring to full boil for 5 minutes. Posted by Amanda at 3:31 PM 1 comment: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
