Top 10 Unhealthiest Fast-Food Meals

That value meal could be your last supper.

The Top 10 fast-food restaurants in the nation boast entrees loaded with stomach-stuffing, artery-clogging saturated fat, sodium, and calories, according to a study by Men&apos;s Health magazine.

&quot;Fast food requires fast decisions, and we wanted to create a guide to help people lose weight while still eating fast food,&quot; said David Zinczenko, author of the book series &quot;Eat This! Not That!&quot; and the mag&apos;s editor-in-chief, who conducted the study.

Topping the list as the worst of the worst was the Tuna Melt sandwich combo from Quiznos.

The value meal, which comes with a bag of Cheetos, tops out at an astonishing 1,900 calories—the equivalent of eating an entire bag of Chips Ahoy! cookies and near the average person&apos;s daily caloric intake, the study noted.

No. 2 on the list was the Triple Baconator Value Meal from Wendy&apos;s. The sandwich, which has three hamburger patties, three slices of cheese and nine strips of bacon, packs an 1,850-calorie punch when paired with a small Coke and fries.

Other offenders include the large Triple Whopper with Cheese Value Meal, which weighs in at nearly 1,800 calories, and the Big Breakfast Platter from McDonald&apos;s, which contains 1,370 calories and nearly 65 grams of fat.
