 Melbourne Updates 
 Tuesday, December 13, 2011 
 Had this sudden urge to blog about my recent life.
 
Yeah, I&apos;m still good, the same old me, except for some changes in my life. Well, not gonna mention the details about the changes, and yeah....

For people who don&apos;t know, I just came back from Melbourne, like a month ago...?

Frankly speaking, it wasn&apos;t a pleasant trip as I came back with a broken heart.

The trip went well at the beginning (at least I was hopeful at the first place), and things just turned upside down all the way...

Didn&apos;t manage to travel a lot in Melbourne, not the Yarra Valley, not the city of Ballarat, not even the famous Crown Casino.

And the foods? Nah, I don&apos;t even get a small bite of sandwich there.

Ohh wait... I did had some fish n&apos; chips in one of the fast food restaurant at the Great Ocean Road.

The Salty Dog Fish&amp;Chippery it is :)

And another plus of the trip was....

I get to meet up with Rubhen. He was my ex-tuition-mate for blardy 5 years, but we never talk during the days. Perhaps we did, but definitely not more 10 times, I guess. Hahahaha!

Well, get to meet up with some of his machas too, where I find that indian guys are actually quite cool though. Maybe not all, but the 4 indian guys that I&apos;ve met in Melbourne, are all cool to max.

But me, ain&apos;t no cool at all. I was way too quiet whenever I hang out with them, until the extent where Ghavin asked me &quot;Why are you so quiet? Don&apos;t be so quiet, if not, I&apos;ll think that my guest doesn&apos;t like my house&quot;.

Ah-hah, honestly, I miss all four of them. The Deepavali meal, the great companion, and the farking wasted alcoholic night....

Anyway, I&apos;m really thankful for all of you, the many ones who accommodated me in Melbourne, the many ones who listened to my rants when I&apos;m in Melbourne, the many ones who comforted me alot, the many ones who made me stayed behind in Melbourne instead of flying back straight to KL on the 6th day of my trip, and many many more.

I H ♥ E ♥ A ♥ R ♥ T you guys a lot, a lot more than you could expect.

And you know who you guys are ♥ ♥ 
 
 And one thingy, I will definitely return to Melbourne again, to pick up my broken pieces :) 

 ♥ Samir Khullar ♥ 

 ♥ Indians are cool. Maybe not all, but this Canadian born Indian here, definitely is my type of guy ♥

 Sincere Apology 
 Wednesday, December 7, 2011 
 I&apos;m crying inside.

I didn&apos;t realise that I&apos;ve lost a a friendship with a good friend of mine during my trip to Melbourne.

If you ever happen to read this, I&apos;m truly sorry, right bottom from my heart. I didn&apos;t expect things to turned out in such way, causing so much trouble to you. I really owe you a sorry.

 ACCA is a BITCH! 
 Monday, December 5, 2011 
 Whenever my exam approaches, I will never failed to ask myself one blardy question.

 &quot;Why do I take ACCA in the first place?&quot; 

Anyway no point ranting, and good luck to all the ACCA-ians who are taking this December sitting.

As well as to me.

 Whispers of the Night 
 Saturday, November 26, 2011 
 Why didn&apos;t you come online?

Hurmm...

Even if you do, I&apos;ll be staring at the tiny lit&apos; chatbox, hoping that you would ask me &apos;Dei... It has been a week. How&apos;s your neck?&apos;

But....

By end of the day, I&apos;ll be ONLY staring at the tiny lit&apos; chatbox, seeing the green light turn into white.

Makes me wonder, again...

Will I ever see you, again?
