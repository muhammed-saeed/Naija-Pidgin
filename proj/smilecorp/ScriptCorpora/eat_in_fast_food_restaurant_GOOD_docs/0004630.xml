 Little Caesars 

 
 Since all Little Caesar&apos;s pizzas come with cheese, special ordering is a must if you want a dairy-free pizza. So we have included the crusts and sauces that will work in the lists below.

Just an additional note, Little Caesar&apos;s pizza crust and sauce are also vegan (egg-free). We are in the process of inquiring about their meat toppings, since this information was not readily available.

 

 No Dairy (Milk) Ingredients (use caution due to cross-contamination potential) : 

 Crusts - Regular Crust Sauces - Pizza Sauce, Crazy Dipping Sauce (other sauces not yet verified) Toppings - All Vegetables (awaiting feedback on other toppings) 

 Special Order (use caution due to cross-contamination potential) : 

 Sides - Crazy Bread (order without Parmesan)
