 THE MODERATE RESORTS

The Disney World Restaurants at the Moderate Resorts are a mixture of food courts and Table Service restaurants. There are some interesting offerings at the Moderate Resorts.

Caribbean Beach Resort

 
 
Old Port Royal - Old Port Royal was Disney&apos;s first food court. The original is sometimes the best (and sometimes you learn from your mistakes). This is a little of both.

Coronado Springs Resort

 
 
 Pepper Market - a new fangled food court that is part quick service, part table service. (A 10% service charge is added to each meal.) Southwest favorites are on display.

In the morning it&apos;s pasteries and the rest of the day sandwiches. 

Port Orleans Resort

 
 
Boatwright&apos;s - Louisiana favorites served in an old boat factory. Now that&apos;s something different. Located in the Riverside section this table service restaurant features favorites from Prime Rib to Jambalaya. Riverside Mill Foodcourt - The Riverside Mill is the foodcourt in the Riverside section of the Port Orleans (imagine that). Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory - the food court in the French Quarter section. 

Fort Wilderness Campground

 
 
 The Hoop Dee Doo Review - Dinner and a show. What could be better. While not technically a Disney World restaurant, this patriotic show is fun and has some really good food. Mickey&apos;s Backyard BBQ - dance and sing with Mickey and friends and get some really great food. Trails Inn - buffet restaurant and general store all rolled into one. 

 THE VALUE RESORTS

While there aren&apos;t any fancy Disney World restaurants at the Value Resorts. The only choise is the food courts. Each has the same food stations, and basically the same menus. (Everything Pop has some Pop Century specific offerings.)

 


 
The food is pretty good, and breakfast is really good. Here are the food courts for each resort -

 World Premier - All Star Movies Intermission Court - All Star Music. End Zone Food Court - All Star Sports Everything Pop - Pop Century 

 IN THE PARKS

There are some really wonderful Walt Disney World Restaurants in the Parks. There are some very average restaurants in the parks. So, Dad, which is which? Check it out ...

Magic Kingdom Restaurants

The Magic Kingdom has some great, and some not so great Disney World restaurants, but every one has a great theme. Cinderella&apos;s Royal Table is not to be missed. Enjoy.

 
 
 Tony&apos;s Town Square Restaurant - Italian Restaurant with a Lady and the Tramp theme. Casey&apos;s Corner - Hot dog stand. Main Street Bakery - Great place to grab a quick snack. Cinderella&apos;s Royal Table - The Magic Kingdom&apos;s signature restaurant located in Cinderella Castle. The Crystal Palace - Character buffet starring Winnie the Pooh and friends.

The Magic Kingdom isn&apos;t the best place for great food, but you can get good food in some interesting locations.

EPCOT RESTAURANTS

Epcot has some of the best restaurants in Disney World. The Disney World Restaurant menus for the World Showcase restaurants are as varied as the pavilions. Future World isn&apos;t a great place for great food. But, the Disney restaurants in the World Showcase makes up for the lack of eating places in Future World.

 
 
 Coral Reef Restaurant - Seafood in a great location.
 Sunshine Season Food Fair - Food court in the lower area of the Land pavilion. The Electric Umbrella - Fast food, plain and simple. The San Angel Inn - The restaurant inside the pyramid at the Mexico Pavilion La Hacienda y La Cantina - The quick service and table service restaurants in Mexico on the World Showcase Lagoon Akershus Royal Banquet Hall - Home of DIsney&apos;s Princess Storybook Meals (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) Kringla Bakeri og Kafe - Norwegian pastries and sandwiches.

You can find just about anything you&apos;d like to eat in Epcot.

IN DISNEY HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS

Disney&apos;s Hollywood Studios is home to some of the most uniquely themed Disney World Restaurants. Here you&apos;ll find a drive in movie restaurant and a pizza restaurant complete with a large arcade. Ch eck them out. 

 
 
 Hollywood Brown Derby - take a trip back in time to a more elegant age when movie stars roamed Hollywood Boulevard and the Cobb Salad was a thing of legend. Mama Melrose&apos;s Ristorante Italiano - get some interesting Italian food with a Hollywood flair. Toy Story Pizza Planet - this restaurant comes right out of the movie Toy Story. The menu is pretty limited, pizza and salad, but it&apos;s a pretty good deal (for Disney World). 50&apos;s Prime Time Cafe - take a trip back to a slower time where families dined together right in the kitchen. Sci Fi Dine In - jump in a 6 seater and watch old time Sci Fi movies under the stars. Starring Rolls Cafe - a quick and tasty bite to eat when you&apos;re in a hurry. Studio Catering Company - quick service restaurant in the back part of the Studios. 

IN ANIMAL KINGDOM

There is not a lot of variety, or selection in the Animal Kingdom restaurants. The park closes at 5:00 on most days, so dinner isn&apos;t really an option. Check out what&apos;s available.

 
 
 Tusker House -&quot;Awaken the Day&quot;at Donald&apos;s Safari Breakfast buffet. You can also get a unique lunch and dinner buffet here Flame Tree BBQ - really interesting BBQ flavors in a colorful setting Yak and Yeti - Chinese food in the shadow of Expedition Everest Rainforest Cafe - Dine in a tropical rain forest Pizzafari - Grab some pizza and re st in the air conditioning 

The Theme Parks are where most guests eat most meals. The Disney World Restaurants in the parks specialize in feeding hoards of people really fast.

Disney World Dining Plans

The Disney Dining Plans will allow you to prepay your meals at one of the Disney World Restaurants. Check out Dad&apos;s Dining Plan pages for more information.

 Disney Dining Plans - Dad&apos;s Guide to the dining plans. Check out all the dining plans that Disney offers for Disney World Restaurants. Disney Dining Plan Calculator - Disney say&apos;s you&apos;ll save 20-40%. Dad&apos;s not so sure, that&apos;s why he developed a calculator to help you compare what you will spend with the price of the dining plan. 

Disney World Character Dining

Some of the most popular meals at Disney World include Character Dining. Want to eat a meal with Donald Duck? Go to the Tusker House at Animal Kingdom for breakfast and enjoy a Safari Breakfast with Donald and friends. It&apos;s just one of the great character meals Disney offers.

 

 Dad&apos;s Disney World Character Dining page 

Signature Restaurants

 

A few years ago, Disney started what they call Signature Dining. These Walt Disney World restaurants are some of the top of the line restaurants anywhere. There are Signature Dining restaurants located in the hotels, some are in the parks. For example, Victoria and Albert&apos;s in the Grand Floridian and Le Cellier in Epcot are Signature Dining Restaurants.

 

A Signature Restaurant will have a menu that is usually tailored to fresh ingredients. It also has a dress code (usually) and outstanding service. Outstanding service means that meals tend to be slower paced and not rushed. Signature Dining Restaurants also smaller restaurants that have limited seating so Advanced Dining Reservations are a must.

 

These restaurants typically&quot;cost&quot;2 table service credits on the Disney Dining Plan.

Advanced Dining Reservations

If you want to eat at one of the wonderful Disney World Table Service Restaurants, you&apos;ll probably need an Advanced Dining Reservation. Want some more information? Here you go ...

Disney World Menus

Recently, Disney World restaurants have had their menus appeared on the internet. Not all of them, but some. These are full copies of the menus. Dad has gathered all of the available menus into one place so you can have easy access to much needed information. Grab a bib and check it out.

 

 Dad&apos;s Disney World Menus page 

Disney World Restaurant Reviews

Want to know the whole story about the restaurants at Walt Disney World? Good idea. One place you can get reviews of the eating places is to go to TripAdvisor. They have hundreds of listings. See reviews of Disney World Restaurants at TripAdvisor . No, Dad doesn&apos;t have a review page yet. You can expect one soon.

Dad&apos;s Bottom Line

Each of the Walt Disney World Restaurants has a unique theme. Some just have to be experienced. Character meals have become really big and must be reserved early. Make sure to get together as a family and decide which of the Disney restaurants you want to try out.
