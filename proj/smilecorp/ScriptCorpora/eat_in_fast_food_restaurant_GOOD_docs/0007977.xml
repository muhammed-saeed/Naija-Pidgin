 The way to wrap up your speech is to summarize your main points then restate your thesis, which is that fast food is bad for you.

So if you points were that it is high in fat, high in sodium, and generally is not a balanced diet, you might say:

&quot;In conclusion, I would like to remind you that fast food is high in fat and high in sodium, both major contributing factors to cardiovascular disease. It is also very difficult to eat a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables if your primary source of nutrition is a fast food restaurant. With these factors, it is easy to see that fast food is not a healthy option for your diet.&quot;

 Fast food is bad for u because it is associated with overweight and heart problems. I especially do not recommend Mc Donald&apos;s due to the problems it causes today&apos;s children. Why is fast food bad for u I will tell u it is very unhealthy. We need to live a healthy lifestyle in order to live better.

I hope u can use this in your paper.
