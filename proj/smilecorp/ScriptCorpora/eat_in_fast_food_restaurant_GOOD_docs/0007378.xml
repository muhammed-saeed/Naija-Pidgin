I don’t know where anyone gets the idea that bagels are
considered healthy or part of a healthy diet. Bagels are very high in calories, even without the high fat slop of cream cheese that most bagels come slathered with, just
one accourtrement of a vast array of basically high fat, high calorie, high-glycemic junk food time-bombs.

Futhermore, most bagels, except for whole wheat, are made from highly processed flour, sugar, the fiber / nutrients stripped away in the process, making them a very high-glycemic food. World health authorities are predicted disaster for the next generation that they say,
will dwarf today’s AIDS epidemic, because of the
exponential rise of a whole host of diabetes-related diseases caused by Diabetes II, self-induced diabetes,
brought on by eating the highly processed foods that
are already creating plague-like numbers of teens afflicted wit hself-induced diabetes, weaned on a diet of snacks, fast food and sugary drinks and of course, bagels.

The scourge of fast food that accompanies globalization as it makes inroads in the world is predicted to increase
pressure on the already over-burdened health related economic costs of these newly developing countries.

Highly processed foods, like fast food in general are by its very nature, highly glycemic and is pure junk food, highly processed foods like bagels/fast food, sugar, that are already wreaking havoc but has only just begun.

Great article! Thanks for all the links :)

Michael,
Hi, I thought you might be interested to know that the bagels mentioned in the first recipie are indeed whole wheat bagels, and that they don’t recommend cream cheese.
 Michael R. Havard 
Wow. Great List. I think with healthy foods there are two things that people have to get over. First is the idea that you miss out on flavor. Done right it’s easy to make healthy and flavorful food. Second is the idea that cooking (or food preperation) equals toil. Too many people spend as much time waiting in line at their local fast food restaurant or sit in a booth at some chain waiting on food than if they had just prepared the meal themselves. Plus just think about the cost versus home prepared food.

My wife has gotten in the habbit lately of fixing two or three meals at a time. While you’re heating the kitchen up or dirtying up the dishes you might as well make it worth while. Fix some fish and green beans or asparagus and freeze it for later. Make extra portions for lunch the next day, etc.

Michael–breathe man, breathe. Everything in moderation, INCLUDING MODERATION.

Toasted whole wheat tortilla with hummus
Indian Naan Flatbread with hummus
Hummus wrap:
Whole wheat tortilla
Hummus
Avocado slices
Onion sprouts
Luncheon meat
Green Onion
cucumber
red bell pepper

I have to agree that healthy food is so good and full of flavor. I’m only 19, so you can just imagine the amount of junk food and soda I’ve been on for practically all my life. Recently I got this back pain, nothing serious was the response of my doctor. However, though it wasn’t serious, come to think of it, it scared me to think that I was starting to feel pains that old people get. Could be my kidneys I thought. I quickly changed the junk food for healthy foods, and I’ve never felt so free and healthy. I eat fruits,yummy chicken thats healthy,and I drink water water water. Though I’m skinney,my face feels smooth,my back pain went away, and my stomach does not growl like it use to. I really made a life changing choice.“You are what you eat, what you eat today is the outcome of your future results.”

This rocks. As a person who thrives on efficiency, I love concept of a quick healthy meal. Also, when you have NO time with kids, work etc.it’s a great solution when you want to feed your family nutritious food and not settle for take-out which is usually expensive and disappointing.

Although he may not have said things in a way which everyone can appreciate (lol) Mr. Mike Savoy hit the nail on the head. I will be placing into my holisticmedicina.com newsletter info about the recent decision by the FDA to allow unmarked cloned animals into the American food supply (Cows, Pigs). This on top of recently allowing virus sprayed foods, super radiated foods (10,000 times the radiation of a chest X-RAY–and radiation can lead to cancer) and all the other tricks brilliant Americans have used to fool Mother nature. As a Native American I will assure you, you have only fooled yourself.

If you follow health trends in the USA at all, you are well aware that this nation is indeed on a collision course with disaster. This is not just something that suddenly happened. This has been a long time coming. Bad farming practices, greed, and laziness are a bad combination.

Diabetes is growing into an epidemic in this country. The thigns that we have processed and stripped out of the food (to increase shelf life/ profits) were placed there by God to slow digestion–slowing the rate at which sugar is dumped into the bloodstream). Add to this growing epidemic the way our families are also breaking down and you have the recipe for run-away diabetes, neurological disorders, obesity, cancers (especially breast for women and prostate for men) and a real social problem. Natural medicines can help some, for sure, but we must begin with greater awareness of the problem.

Worrying about AIDS, Hurricanes and stuff won’t help when you are doing nothing but stuffing your pie-hole full of twinkies (smile).

And whomever said“moderation”, hey, sounds good, but that’s just the problem–as Savoy pointed it we’re NOT moderating as a country, we’re letting the Hellivision (television) define what we should buy, and buying it hook line and sinker. And being sunk.
Wake Up People.

Great recipe list, and very well organized. I will be trying the Ginger-yogurt over fruit breakfast this week!

Are you kidding me? The top of this page says, and I quote”Over 100 Quick AND Healthy Foods”

What happened to the“AND HEALTHY???”

Sure, these recipes may be yummy, but when you have ONE POUND of Cream Cheese, of course it is going to taste great, but HEALTHY????? COME ON!!!

Thanks for wasting mine and others’time, and I feel sorry for those who are trying to eat healthy and don’t realize that they are NOT in fact getting healthy recipes from the false advertisement at the top of your page!

Keep up the GREAT work!

Okay…it just so happened that the first recipe I looked at was Poor Man’s Biscuits and Gravy. Now, I hate to say this, but bacon is not a healthy food, and a pound of bacon plus all its drippings in your gravy is a heart attack waiting the happen.

Dear Editor: Following are the latest links from our news website ISRAEL21c– http://www.israel21c.org . Feel free to link to these items and quote up to 2 paragraphs. if you’d like a photo, please let me know.

An Israeli energy bar just like Grandma used to make

Unlike most aspiring Israeli thespians, Yoav Almazag thanks his lucky stars every day that his acting career didn’t pan out. After all, if it had, he wouldn’t be poised to turn his grandmother’s recipe into an energy bar that promises to sweep the US and Europe and hopefully turn into a staple at health food stores, health clubs and supermarkets around the globe.

With final negotiations close to completion, Almazag’s got a date with success: a US food chain is about to sign on to carry his Hatifei Energia (Energy Treats), and European importers are also showing interest. Soon sportspeople and others looking for natural energy while exercising will be stocking up on Almazog’s date-based treats.

What I feel is most important, and blatantly overlooked (aside from the fact that I’m a terrible speller, so bare with me)is mental health and how it coexists with physical health.

Depression, insomnia, anxiety disorders, anger management problems, stress…all these things can cause weight gain. Your body is in touch with your brain, and an uplifting psychological view on life definitely helps in weight loss.

I notice when I’m sad I feel insecure and fat…and of course I eat terribly at a higher rate when I’m depressed. When I’m happy I’m content with eating healthy. I run around more and stay active as well.

Another huge, yet common mistake is the idea that there’s a middle ground in your“diet”that most people refer to as“trying.”Kind of like when a smoker is“trying”to quit. There really is no middle ground. You either do or you don’t. The idea of a diet, even the word, becomes an obsession rather than a lifestyle. If you’re blatantly aware that you’re dieting then you’re setting yourself up for failure. You will cheat and feel as if it’s the end of the world. I assure you, though…cheating is human nature. Everyone has cheat days. Even Jessica Simpson’s sexy ass…(moment of silence for the ditsy blonde) Where was I? OH yeah. It’s logic. Nobody can live in todays world and not eat fast food at some point or another. It’s hard to go out with your friends and not have a drink or two, or maybe eat something you normally wouldn’t.

Bottom line: Don’t worry! Be Happy!

Hello,

I see that the Lifehack website gives really useful information. We have created a public interest website at http://www.kidsandnutrition.co.uk focused on maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet in children, which I thought may be of interest to your visitors.

We don’t make any profit from the site but we’d like to spread the word and get the information out to as many people as possible. Links from sites like http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/over-100-quick-and-easy-healthy-foods.html are really valuable to us and I was wondering if you could place a link to KidsandNutrition?

Please let me know if you’d like any more information about our site, or if there is someone else I need to speak to about this.

Thanks in advance

Samantha Higham

 fuckface 
I feel that these recipes are at a very low standard; But i would also apreciate if sad little people didnt go around critising this site. Yes i said my opinion but other people have just been plain rude.
Thankyou.
 none ya 
um yeah….this food is not healthy and this site is tupid and the people that are coming here and saying good job these are great…yeaaah they are stupid too.

The one where it suffer in the CONSTIPATION, trying one time my KOMBUCHA, how is? Kombucha is the healthy beverage
which has been popular with New York. My kombucha is 100%kombucha. Part is different from kombucha of wikipedia.
When drinking, incerting in cola or juice, please drink. Drinking kombucha, it seems that you can defecate after 4-5 time. How to make is detailed e-mail to me. address: barasusi-oyaji@paw.hi-ho.ne.jp

It’s true that cooking seems to take time but believe me it’s worth the hassle and the time. I think we see cooking as a burden because we don’t fully appreciate how much more healthy is the food that we cook compared to fast food chain food. I recommend http://blog.fruitfultime.com/2007/10/14/5-reasons-why-you-should-eat-a-healthy-diet/ as a reading to appreciate the life of a healthy diet.

I dont see how some of these can be catagorized as healthy, but of course all things in moderation.

Bacon? Butter?

Shrimp is pretty high in cholesterol as well.

Good meals, but dont expect to eat these every day and be“healthy”.

I was looking at your site and thought you might give me some feedback on a project I just finished at http://www.star-telegram.com/Thanksgiving .

It’s a package for people who have to work until Wednesday night and only have Thanksgiving day to cook.

I’d like to hear what you think about it!

This is a great site together with http://www.whfoods.com ! I think we as a society get it wrong, and think that taking the time and effort to feed our bodies (which are in effect our vehicles for life) is not a big deal, when in actual fact it is the biggest deal ever. The word DIET stems from the Greek language and means‘healthy living’. Not starving ourselves or taking care of ourselves some of the time only. It’s a continous mission. We should readjust our thinking and get more involved in taking time and care to feed ourselves properly. There is no quick fix, but there ARE good quick recipies that give us the nutrition we are meant to get and which our bodies DESERVE.

Hi guys,

I found a site that uses all whole grain flours and almost all natural sweeteners. They have also managed to sneak in nutritious ingredients into baked goods (such as zucchini in cake) to add nutritional value. My son is a picky eater but he didn’t even notice!

Enjoy!

Here is another page that actually has photos of quick and easy healthy meals. Most of them encompass 2-5 unprocessed ingredients and require only 2-10 minutes to whip up. Yummy too. :)

I LOVE HEALTH FOOD–ESPECIALLY THIS RECIPE–Thank you Lifehack–I’m going to eat this every day for breakfast!!!

6 boiled eggs, peeled and diced
1 pound bacon
About 1/2 gallon milk
Flour
Salt and pepper

Fry bacon until crispy and save drippings. Crumble and set aside.

Place drippings in a 6-quart pan over medium-high heat. Stir in and brown flour, adding enough to absorb drippings. Add about 1/2 gallon of milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and, while gravy is thickening, add diced eggs and crumbled bacon. Season to taste (we like lots of pepper). Serve over split biscuits.

to chet: that is a joke right? 6 eggs alone is 3 days worth of cholesterol. add in the bacon and drippings and you’re on the fast track to a heart attack. that has nothing to do with health whatsoever.

Great article! Having this kind of information truly helps people be prepared and that’s one of the biggest contributors to eating healthy…being prepared. One of the biggest problems I have found is with dining out, Americans are eating out over 250 times a year…So many people don’t realize what kind of calories they are consuming when they dine out…how much they add to their waist line when they eat bread and butter that calls their name while waiting for the appetizer or main course…a small piece of bread and butter can add 150 to 400 calories before the server gets back with your meal. There are some great websites that allow the user to select their favorite restaurant meals and then they suggest the quantity of each meal so the user stays within their suggested calorie range. Thanks for educating readers with simple meal options. I would like to introduce everyone to a simple and free website designed to provide meal options to over 10,500 national, regional and local restaurant meals called MenuCoach.com.
 http://www.EatLowSodium.com Umit 
For those who want to eat healthy I also suggest eating very low sodium. I am putting together a list of low sodium foods at http://www.eatlowsodium.com 
I am open to your suggestions to improve the list.
Thanks,

I really like some of these recipies. Keep up the good work!

I would just like to point out 2 those people who left rude comments that even though some of these recipes may not be %100 healthy that it works for some people who want to lose wait. Some people could be eating junk food and then come to this website and make healthier choises then they have been making previously. So just because not all of these foods are healthy doesnt mean they dont help some people.

A lot of people think that if you’re not eating all vegetables and tofu that it’s not healthy. Too bad for them. There is a whole world of delicious food. You may not like this style of food. I have a more Americanized collection of recipes. If you learn the basics and look around a little, you can make your own list of favorite recipes. And you don’t have to be a saint. Just get the packaged crap out of your diet and eat more fruits and vegetables.

And if you eat your vegetables, you can have dessert ;-)

Seriously, don’t make it so hard. That’s just an excuse to hide behind.

So wow–I was very impressed with the amount of recipes on here! I was very excited also; I mean, people just don’t REALIZE how hard it is to find truly HEALTHY recipes! Only thing is though–alot of these don’t seem very healthy to me…In the very first section alone, there are recipes like“Poor Man’s Biscuits&amp;Gravy”, which, if you read it, sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen. I just want to know who came up with this list, and what their credentials are for determining what is and what is not healthy. I mean–is this a place where ANYONE can submit a recipe? I’m sure that most of these recipes are great, healthy ones–but someone needs to go through these and make sure the ones like“Poor Man’s B&amp;G”get deleted.

That is just the point, McDonald’s is one of the top fast food restaurants that sell you unhealthy food you don’t even get full of. If people weren’t so egoistic to eat so unhealthy in a fast food restaurant, people at other parts of the world would actually have enough food and wouldn’t starve to death!!!
