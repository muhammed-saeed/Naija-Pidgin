Ideas for Communities

 

 Work with schools and service clubs to raise &quot;Pennies for a Kindness Park&quot; (or other community beautification project).  Pennies don&apos;t seem to have much value, but when combined, they do make a difference.  In the same way, one kind act may seem insignificant, but many kind acts practiced daily have great impact. Collect goods for a food bank or shelter. Develop interactive programs between retirement homes/senior centers and schools.  Older children can read to the elderly and younger children can simply visit.  Seniors can also tutor children in their schoolwork. Plant a Kindness Tree or Garden with the help of youth groups, service clubs, or other volunteers.  Plant a tree or flowers in a public area like a park or walking trail, and ask the mayor to make a brief presentation at the dedication. Set up free coffee or hot chocolate for morning commuters.  Offer lemonade or water during warm months. Organize a blood drive dedicated to Random Acts of Kindness. Ask a fast food restaurant to hold a “Customer Appreciation Day.” They can decorate the dining area and post signs. Schoolchildren enjoy “hosting” at these events after school, carrying trays for people, getting beverage refills, or just greeting them at the door with a smile and suggestions for acts of kindness. Ask groups, such as a garden club, to create floral arrangements for a senior center, nursing home, police station, hospital, or the homebound. Prepare a special meal or dessert for seniors or nursing home residents. Hold a kindness concert with a band and give out ideas for kind acts. Invite role models and community leaders to public events to speak about the importance kindness has played in their lives. Instead of distributing invitations to a public Random Acts of Kindness event, create and distribute RAK “punch cards.” The recipients punch a hole around the edge of their cards whenever they perform a kind act. Print the event information on the back, along with instructions to bring their completed punch cards to the event. Put all the cards on a wall to show how many acts of kindness the activity generated. Ask your library or bookstore to host storytelling parties, a children’s kindness hour, etc. Create a special newsletter featuring kindness stories. Ask permission to put story collection boxes in stores. Create a Random Acts of Kindness mascot to circulate in high foot-traffic areas, distributing gifts and suggestions for acts of kindness. Then send the mascot to visit schools and talk about kindness. Hold a children’s kindness drawing or coloring campaign. Hold a teddy bear drive and donate the bears to police or fire departments for traumatized children. Suggest that city hall host an open house for employees and residents. Organize interracial/interfaith programs and performances. Organize public presentations by community/religious/civil rights leaders about bringing kindness into the community. Get the police involved! Ask them to hand out “Kindness Citations” as they witness kind acts. (Seattle’s Chief of Police spent the day on bicycle patrol giving out kindness citations.) Police can also give out “Good Driving” tickets, visit classrooms with stories of kindness they encounter on duty, put a banner over their entryway, or display kids’ kindness drawings. After collecting safety tips from firefighters and police, organize a program to discuss safety with seniors living alone. Ask the mayor’s office or city hall employees to host a coffee and cake party for merchants or community groups. Ask the librarian to forgive late fines during RAK Week. Place a “Practice Random Acts of Kindness” or “Kindness Zone” banner across a downtown street. Ask residents to drive with car headlights on to convey participation in Random Acts of Kindness Week. Start a ribbon campaign. Give out kindness ribbons to be worn and passed on to another person. The giver of the kind act can sign the back of the ribbon before passing it along. At the end of the campaign, display the signed ribbons at the mayor’s office or city hall. Make cookies and bring them to downtown merchants. Organize spring and fall clean-up projects. Choose an area that needs attention and collect debris, abandoned items, and other materials that have collected in the area. Invite faith organizations and/or schools to come together as a “harmony choir” and perform. Ask the chamber of commerce to help you recruit merchants for a kindness planter box project. Suggest that the merchants buy the boxes and that schoolchildren have a penny drive to purchase the flowers. Paint the boxes with kindness slogans and pictures (e.g., hearts, stick figures holding hands). People can write stories about kind acts they have performed and received and post them on a community bulletin board. Help schoolchildren design and make Random Acts of Kindness bookmarks, stickers, or buttons. Ask teachers, libraries, and merchants to distribute them. Create Random Acts of Kindness signs (stickers or clear static)for windows of official city vehicles, buses, factory worker safety helmets, or residential windows. Conduct an annual poster contest for all ages. Display the posters at city hall or the mayor’s office, and ask a newspaper, radio or TV station to announce the winners.
