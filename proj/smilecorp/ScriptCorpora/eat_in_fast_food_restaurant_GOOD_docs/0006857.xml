 ★★★☆☆ Chili Cheese Fries! 
 Kelly J. | Insider Guru
| Rank: 318 3 Hamburger Express 
 
This fast food restaurant has DEE-licious hamburgers and my favorite thing to order is their famous chili cheese fries! They make a few different types of foods here. They go to schools and cater events such as back to school night. It helps bring more kids and parents to the night events!

 ★★★★☆ Homey restaurant! 
 Craig W. | Insider

This restaurant has a nice family restaurant atmosphere and offers a variety of American and Mexican breakfast and lunch foods.

They provide decent-sized food portions.

Orders are placed at the counter and you receive your food on a plastic plate and metal utensils to take back to your booth. They have a plush animal crane game machine.
