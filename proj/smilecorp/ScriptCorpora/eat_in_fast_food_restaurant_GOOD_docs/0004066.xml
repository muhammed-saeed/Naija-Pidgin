 Posted: 2/3/2012 12:35:02 PM First, when did McD&apos;s itty bitty size the fries in the Happy Meals and add in apple slices?

 

Second, my almost 3 year old, when I handed her the happy meal said&quot;What is this?&quot;

and then I realized she&apos;d never had a Happy Meal before.

 Posted: 2/3/2012 12:56:31 PM I heard from someone the other day that they were planning on doing it but didn&apos;t realize they had rolled it out already. My girls like their chicken snack wraps. We&apos;re not anti-McDonald&apos;s or fast food in moderation but we never order the value/Happy meal things.

We&apos;re all about&quot;serving size&quot;and appropriate portion sizes. I think the smaller sized fries is a great thing!

 Posted: 2/3/2012 1:30:29 PM I saw on the news that they&apos;re not going to use the &apos;pink slime&apos; or bleach in their meat anymore. Go McD&apos;s 

We haven&apos;t been to a fast food restaurant in over 3 years, and we don&apos;t miss them.

Darn it! The pink slime made their burgers so juicy.

 Posted: 2/3/2012 1:47:56 PM They did this a few months ago. I like the little fries but my kids were disappointed. We don&apos;t eat at McDonalds very often but when we do the kids always ordered the apple slices with caramel sauce. Now they get fewer apples and no caramel sauce. They don&apos;t eat the fries. I know they can put another thing of apples in there instead of fries but they still don&apos;t get the caramel sauce. That was the special treat for the kids.

 Posted: 2/3/2012 1:50:27 PM I know why they&apos;re doing it, but honestly, whatever.

My kids can eat apple slices any time at home, and much better ones than in a Happy Meal. We go there to get fries, dammit! I&apos;m not eating there for my health.

 Posted: 2/3/2012 2:08:33 PM bleach? silicone? butane? Egads, ignorance really IS bliss!

 dammit! I&apos;m not eating there for my health. 
Agreed--even before I knew the above

 Posted: 2/3/2012 2:38:33 PM I feel ya. It&apos;s too expensive to take 6 kids to a fast food restaurant. Of course you feed them at home, with couponing. What a nice treat for your daughter though.

Same here, my 12 yr old loves their chicken snack wraps 

We have recently started getting an ice cream cone more often than we get a meal. There is McD&apos;s on our way home from agility and it&apos;s a nice treat for all of us

 Posted: 2/3/2012 3:21:51 PM Two of my kids won&apos;t eat apples, so I always specify&quot;fries only&quot;and they will put the kid&apos;s size fry that used to be in there. My apple eater does eat the apples, but it&apos;s disappointing that they don&apos;t have the caramel sauce. I like that McDonalds got rid of the pink slime, but I wish they wouldn&apos;t mess with other things. I agree with a PP- we don&apos;t go to McDonalds to eat healthy(although, I do usually order a grilled chicken salad). Next thing you know, they&apos;ll get rid of all the soda and only offer water and milk to drink.

 Posted: 2/3/2012 3:48:18 PM My 3 year old LOVES the apples, she was so excited when she pulled them out. I thought they got thrown in there by accident. We also got the itty bitty fries but she only eats like 2 fries so no big deal. We went there again yesterday and she got the apples and the regular kids fries.. whatever...she eats her apples and nuggets and is happy.
