 Your Questions About Ways To Make Money Illegally 
 Posted on July 9, 2012 by Nagesh 
 

Chris asks…
 
Do you think this is the right call Undocumented residents denied relocation money?

PICO RIVERA–Hundreds of people being forced to move because of a Public Works project will get no relocation money because they are in the country illegally , according to Pico Rivera city officials.

The demolition of the 90-unit Rivera Villas Apartments south of Slauson Avenue on Passons Boulevard, along with five single-family homes, will make way for a traffic underpass beneath nearby train tracks, which is part of the Alameda Corridor-East project.

The work is being overseen by the city of Pico Rivera.

Normally, when a government project displaces residents, families are given money to move.

But rules attached to federal funding for the project prohibit Pico Rivera from giving money to illegal immigrants, city spokesman Bob Spencer said.

“The federal assistance is not available for undocumented residents,”Spencer said.“There are severe penalties if we misuse funds that have been given to this project, including the loss of those funds and the loss of any future federal funds.”

According to Spencer, four people have died in the past 10 years while crossing the tracks.For“Maria,”who did not give her full name out of fear her husband would lose his job, scraping up enough money to move will be impossible.

Maria lives with her husband illegally . He works at a local restaurant. She also has a 7-year-old daughter born in Mexico, and a 3-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son, who were born here and are U.S. citizens.

“Having to pay the rent here, and also trying to save enough money for a new place–that’s a really tough thing to do,”Maria said through a translator.

Maria said she wants her daughter to stay at her local school, where she has made friends. And she hopes her husband can keep his job at the restaurant.http://www.whittierdailynews.com/news/ci_10562138

Should They tell them all to meet at a certain time in a certain place for their relocation money and have the immigration buses ready to roll in the back?
 
Nagesh answers:

If Maria wants all of those things then she should have come into this country the legal way. Like my grandparents did. Learn our language so you don’t have to use an translator.
We had to relocate this year to another state that was more affordable, I had to take my 2 children out of their local schools and my husband went to work for a different company, it was difficult for everyone, but we deal with it.

It just isn’t fair to all of the people who come to this country for the exact same reason as Maria, but do it the legal way.
 
 

Laura asks…
 
Claimed Dependant Illegally on Taxes (CA)?

Every year I do my girlfriends taxes. Last year she lived with her mother for about 5mths, and her mother claimed her as a dependant. I was pretty angry about that, but her mother was going through some hard times so I didnt do much about it.

This year though, We (girlfriend and I), are wary that she might have already done the same (She already got her income tax return via loan check). When she asked her mother if she had been claimed, her mother replied“Uh.. I don’t think so”, which obviously wasn’t very reaassuring.

My girlfriend (20)made about 10,000 this year, and has lived with me for about eight months (I’m 20) in a studio. Her mother didn’t support financially in any way through out the year; since I make more money I basically pay the bills and her money is used for food and household upkeep expenses.

What recourse should we take if she has already been claimed as a dependent? Happened last year the same, she went to do her taxes and (continued below)
(continued from above)

and got rejected, saying her mother had already claimed her. That was a nasty surprise, but we let it go.

I’m thinking of going to a tax place and having her ssn looked up to see if it has already been claimed. I tried to have her taxes done before her mother this year, but due to school tax questions I guess I didn’t beat her to the punch.

So if it turns out that her mother already claimed her, what recourse should I (and her) take while I do her taxes? She is barely getting anything back as it is, and the dependant claim I’m afraid might push her down lower into having to actually pay back the IRS instead of getting a small refund.

Suggestions?
Added Information:

Yeah, forgot to add that, me and my girlfriend both signed the lease together on our apartment, so she is indeed on there.
 
Nagesh answers:

It gets really touchy when you start dealing with parents and money. I have always lived by the motto“Family will do you in faster than anyone else.”That being said here is a possible solutions. First tell her that she needs to file an amended tax return to correct everything. If she refuses then you can still file anyway. The IRS will look into it. If your girlfriend is on your lease then it won’t be a problem showing that she was not under her mother’s care (or have your landord sign a notarized letter saying that she has been living there). I think that you will have to mail in your taxes, otherwise it will kick it out.

Nagesh answers:

Find a job at a tattoo place, start from there. Theres really no excuse for you to be doing tatoo’s illegaly, there is so much other stuff yiou can do out there legally.
 
 

Sharon asks…
 
Do you think we would be justified machine gunning those illegally cutting down the rainforests?

This is obviously an emotive subject but given the way these individuals run these areas and kill anyone suspicious, there being so much money in illegal timber production.

I suggest helicopter gunships patrolling the treeline–giving fair warning to stop the illegal logging, then simply take out these evil cartels with rapid fire from a distance.

Individuals like this have no value to society.

No doubt someone will bleat on about these people have to make a living, yet at the expense of us and future generations (if there are any).
 
Nagesh answers:

The real problem is corporations who want to develop the land.
If there’s anybody to machine gun, its business executives, not the low paid workers with machetes cutting brush.
 
 

Sandra asks…
 
Do you believe the people who illegally immigrate from Mexico are responsible for this problem?

I say no.

It is not their fault, the illegal immigrants, and I can’t stand to see people dehumanize them.

It is not their fault because they’re just trying to make a living, and provide for their family. Think of the conditions in Mexico. No where to work for lots of people, no way to get food, no way to provide for their family.

Say they tried to get citizen ship legally, but couldn’t because they didn’t have enough money , or some other reason. (there are a lot of them)

So what do they do? Sit around in Mexico and starve to death, or cross a border and have a job?

WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

Sure, there are some bad people who bring drugs across. But that is not most people.
SO whose fault is it? The companies that hire these people. IF AMERICAN companies didn’t hire them, they would have no motive for coming over.

It is the companies who should be blamed.

Solution to this problem?
HELP THINGS IN MEXICO. Create jobs there. Then why would I.I. come here? They could work in Mexico.
Your thoughts?
And by the way, illegals help economy because they work under the minimum wage, and overtime. That is why businesses hire them.
Chuck: I skimmed through that website, I.I. is bad. I’m not saying it isn’t. However, the actual people immigrating are not on the same scale as criminals, murders, robbers…etc.

Micky: If they can get big money over there, why do you think 10 million people decided to live here? And do cheap labor under the minimum wage? Please.

cj sez: How can they work for change over in Mexico when they have to run over here for a living? The government isn’t strong enough, we have to help them.
Angela: Thanks for an answer like that. Glad someone can see past the color of another’s skin.

mikea_va: Let’s see you take the citizenship test. Tell me your score. And then explain to me how someone born and raised in Mexico is supposed to know this. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13442226/
CRK: I get accused of“depending on the government”because I believe that the government should highly tax the rich, and give to the poor, incase you were wondering…
cj sez: They could stay here and“advocate for change,”while starving to death, And do you really think that by protesting or whatever you think they could do, they could get food+ money ? No. Also, like someone else said, you can’t just overthrow a government in a couple of weeks.
 
Nagesh answers:

These people crying about illegals, don’t realize the reason this govt. Turns a blind eye is because they keep us globally competitive with countries like China and India.

Your right, they do demonize these people, its based on hatred, because they are not the same culture and color. If these people were from Europe, they wouldn’t complain as such…A star for you!

 Your Questions About Make Money Illegally 
 Posted on July 8, 2012 by Nagesh 
 

Mandy asks…
 
Which approach would you choose regarding small theft?

I registered myself and another classmate for a trade class and offered to pre-pay for her, then she to was to reimburse me as soon as she was able. The class came&amp;went, and all she did was promise verbally&amp;with emails. She gave me a personal check for an outing, only to have her tell me to“not cash it; I’ll replace it”and the bank said there were no funds to cover. I was finally able to go directly to her bank, and the bank officer was able to determine that this classmate had an open account w/ money and one she kept very low that she ran checks on. The officer was kind enough to transfer funds so that I would be paid. But as far as the class, this former buddy of mine still owes me. I noticed on her website that she doesn’t list her license #, and our State doesn’t have her listed either, which makes her illegally setting up shop.

My question: Since she won’t work w/me, do you suggest I contact the state and have them handle it?
Any other suggestions? Thx! 1001 5p
Post note: This trade is highly regulated, and if in violation, can strongly fine to land a violater in jail [only if prostitution is proven] and her ad does say“Right now if you book an appt with me this week you will get a wonderful surprise”. That is a very suggestive comment, and those who legitimately practise, wording is very important and nothing is left to conjecture. If she did wrong to me, and doesn’t maintain her license, and has misleading ads….well?
I’m putting this to the Yahoo Community for vote. Wanting some“fresh”eyes to decide what seems most feasible. Thanks!
 
Nagesh answers:

Wipe the debt out of your mind and get on with your life.
Never lend again to anyone for any reason.
You have experienced first hand what can happen so treat it as a learning experience.
 
 

Sandra asks…
 
If 15 million American citizens illegally evaded federal income taxes, will the government forgive them?

Will the government give them amnesty? After all you can’t put 15 million Americans in jail for tax evasion.
Perhaps Congress could pass much needed“Taxpayer Reform”.legislation. Obviously the current tax laws aren’t working. This bill would require tax evaders to pay a“meaningful fine”of say $1000 or $5000 to get back in good standing with the IRS (without having to pay the original taxes that they evaded, of course). This will bring these good people, that are just trying togive their families a better life, out of the shadows.
But we can’t make them pay the taxes they evaded. That’s just not realistic. Most of them have used that money already to buy homes. They are just trying to live the American dream like anybody else. If they had to sell their homes, the housing market would collapse.
Other tax evaders have used the money to start businesses. They are actually helping the economy.
Call your senator and tell them to vote YES on AMNESTY FOR TAX EVADERS
 
Nagesh answers:

An absolutely BRILLIANT argument

So foreign nationals can break american laws an be forgiven, but catch me with a nickel bag, skimping on my taxes and im going to jail.

There is not right or wrong in the states anymore. Only those who have help in high places and those who dont.
 
 

Daniel asks…
 
Would you stay or would you go??

To those of you that are against illegal immigrants…No one has a choice to be born to the country of their choice. What if you were born in a country that had a very low economy. Where everyone struggles to make money because there are hardly any jobs. Where your parents cannot even work because after they turn 40…they are considered to“old”to be able to work and no one will hire them. Where you could not even have a chance to get an education because you have to work instead of your parents. Where it is almost impossible to have a nice car…much less have money to buy nice clothes. And here is America that has everything, a chance to make life better for you and your family. A second chance to come to America and work to make money to support your family in Mexico. You would have to come illegally because they will not give you any kind of Visa or you have no chance of anything……Would you come to America??Or would you stay in the other country to live a low life?Truthfully
 
Nagesh answers:

Yes they would all come legally. Yea right. Too bad that the legal was is not possible unless you have family here or you are very skilled(masters and up).
 
 

William asks…
 
virus scanner?

is it necessarly to have a virus scanner if I

1. never use P2P or Torrent programs
2. never download random toolbars and crap from unwanted sites.
3. never go to spammy websites
4. only download updates from adobe, aol, cakewalk, microsoft, ect.
5. has a good firewall and strick security settings
6. never open attachments, unless i know what it is
7. never open email from unknown users

i personally think virus scanners are out there just to make money . is it really necessarly? i mean, a firewall suppose to block open gateways in windows vista, and i am sure it does. think about this: 1. virus scanners only pick up a virus that already has been found, so new viruses still can attack. 2. a virus must be acted upon, downloaded, clicked on and such. 3. viruses can be minimized by safe browsing, and not download shit illegally .
 
Nagesh answers:

Yes, it is still advisable to have an antivirus. For example, if a contact unknowingly gets infected and sends you a file or a link to a malicious webpage, you might open it and become infected yourself. Also you don’t need to buy an AV product, the following are free and Vista compatible.

AVG 7.5 AntiVirus (Vista Compatible)

http://free.grisoft.com/doc/1

Avast Home Antivirus (Vista Compatible)

http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html

AntiVir PE (Vista Compatible)

http://www.free-av.com/

( Note: Only use one anti-virus product. Running more than one can cause conflicts thus rendering each ineffective.

Sharon asks…
 
Why is everyone against stopping Illegals from crossing our borders?

It is a simple problem, arrest EVERYONE in this country illegally , and deport them. Fine every company HIRING them, and make it hurt (and use the money from this to support sending them back), and then find a better solution for work visa’s.
 
Nagesh answers:

I agree with what you are saying. Unfortunately, it is a lot easier said than done!! Our government does not want to go after those companies because they are in bed with most of those companies. Nor do we have the resources (police department, immigration) to go after every illegal in the US. You also have to remember that once illegals get deported, they just turn right around and re-enter the US illegally again!

But something has to be done and done NOW!!

 Your Questions About Safe Illegal Ways To Make Money 
 Posted on July 7, 2012 by Nagesh 
 

Lisa asks…
 
What is your view on prostitution?

Don’t give me the religious stuff, its not a real explanation because there are too many religions out there to be unique.
Lets say that both parties are using safe practices and that the girl do it because it is her choice. I think that human trafficking and forced prositution is morally wrong.
I’m talking about prostitution as a choice of free will.
I think that its the oldest profession in human existence. Its exist in society as a mean for men to get their thing on and then be on their way back to their daily life. Girls who need the cash simply do it and be on her way as well. As for people who are in relationships: If they are dumb enough to make the dirty choice then its strictly their choice to ruin their relationship. As far as the law is concerned, I think it is illegal in most area of the world because people are just uncomfortable about the idea of people selling sex for money .
 
Nagesh answers:

I have no problem with sex. I have no problem talking about it or doing it. I have no problem with people having sex outside of a committed relationship…. But….Prostitution isn’t good. Only certain people prostitue themselves. It’s usually people who have issues. They have issues with self-esteem, relationships and etc. Some are desperate for money and/or don’t have an education and see prostitution as a way of surviving or getting out of a situation. Whether they’re on the street alone or at a place of business, they put themselves in danger by doing it. It is their choice. They may choose how far to go with something, but they still have issues and they are putting themselves at risk. I feel sorry for them.
 
 

Chris asks…
 
Are these good reasons for prostitution to be illegal?

Please just be honest and dont say nothing in a joking matter, judge it based on how strong my points are…and if your against my points then give atleast a good rebuttal to my point.

1) Promotes Sex Trafficking–Legalizing it would give the ass asumption to citizens that all sex workers are here legally and are not sex slaves basically. They would assume the government regulates the sex. Legalizing prostitution creates a safe haven for sex traffickers and allows them to blend in into a so called“regulated sex sector”. Therefor, legalizing it presents less risks and with less risks brings more opportunities to succeed.

2) Would not decrease HIV/STD spread significantly–Imagine Susy, works 4 days a week and has an average of 4 Johns (person to pays prostitute for sex) a night, that means she had sexual encounters with 16 men. All it takes is one of the 15 men to give her a STD/HIV and then she transfers that to the 16th man and then he prob will give that to another prostitute or his wife or significant other. Plus if they assume that making condoms mandatory will work, then they are ridiculous because women will come in contact with men who rather not wear condoms and with the prices these men are paying, they most likely will give into the needs of the males, cause thats less money in their pockets if they don’t. Condoms cannot protect from HPV and Herpes.

3) It harms women, mentally, physically and psychologically–U.S. Department of State website said 89% of women look to escape prostitution. Most prostitutes have no choice but to do it. As a nation that values education, it gives the message to future generations and present generations that it’s okay to do this and settle for this rather than going onto bigger and better things. We should set up programs to educate these women and teach them valuable trade skills, etc. Women in prostitution are usually victims of child abuse, and so there used to a life of being abused. When women come out of prostitution they feel worthless and devalued.

I go into way more detail in my paper but so far so good?

Feel free to rebut my arguements, i’d love to hear your oppinion.
 
Nagesh answers:

(1) is flawed because it sets an invalid precedent for other realms of commerce. Should all pornography be banned in order to make the subset that involves children *more* risky? Should alcohol/cigarette sales to *everyone* be banned to prevent minors from attaining them?

(2) is all over the map. What exactly are you trying to say here?

(3) reverts to the ol’“Bad things should be illegal!”chestnut. Freedom means that people have the right to do the wrong thing.
 
 

Thomas asks…
 
Why can’t I return my GPS?

I purchased a GPS on March 25th. It was not reliable, would often tell me to make illegal u-turns when safe to do so, told me on numerous occassions to go south instead of north (which would have been fine if i was coming from the north), and I’d pass streets before they showed up on the screen. When I tried to return it on April 10th, the man I bought it from told me not to be petty, and basically told me to get out of his store. I feel like he should honor my request to return it (maybe I got a bad one??) but he wouldn’t hear me out and told me it wasn’t a Rent-a-Center and to leave. I bought it from a well-known store, but come to find out they’re not reputable and have many strikes against them with the Better Business Bureau (I even filed a claim with them).
WHat I want to know is…short of selling it on eBay, is there a way I can get my money back?? What should I do? I feel its the man’s responsability to take care of his customers.
ANY help is appreciated!
The man I bought it from also told me that he couldn’t return it because it was“used electronics”. I seriously used it for 6 days, if that cuz it was a piece of junk. Anyways, come to find out last week that a co-worker of mine returned a GPS to him 2 years ago w/ no problems. Maybe its cuz he is a guy and I’m a girl?? I dont know. All I know is that I’m out ALOT of money and have a product that I do not want.
 
Nagesh answers:

You filed with the BBB. That’s a good start. Now, contact the manufacture of the product. Explain what is happening with the equipment and then tell them the merchant will not let you return it. The store may be violating their policy of doing business with the manufacture. Definitely call the manufacture and see what they will do. You will get no where with the store!
 
 

William asks…
 
Told to pay short bank our of pocket?

I deliver pizza in California. The way we handle tips is at the beginning of the day I am given $20 for change and at the end of the night I simply owe what was charged for the orders. All of the extra cash, credit card tips and check money goes home with me in cash at the end of the night. The checks and credit card receipts are subtracted from what I owe then I just owe whatever cash is left. So even if there is a $3 tip on a credit card or check, I still end up with it at the end.

I keep track of all of my tips and I know what to expect within a dollar. Tonight I was told I owe $26 more than I calculated. This happens a lot and 99% of the time it’s a safe drop error or miscalculation. Tonight it turned out that I was sent on a delivery, but in the computer they entered I had been sent on a different one, someone else got entered for mine. The order entered into the computer for me was for $26 more than the order I had actually taken. My manager entered in the orders himself, and he swapped the two by mistake. Therefore the computer expected me to owe $26 than I had actually collected. The other driver already went home with this extra $26, but none of the other drivers keep track of tips so nothing was mentioned. I even had the credit card receipt for the order that the computer was told he took. So I had all the evidence to clearly show without any doubt that this was the issue. There was no dispute over the mistake.

My supervisor told me I needed to leave the $26 until they got it from the other driver tomorrow or else the safe wouldn’t balance at the end of the night. I told him I cannot do that since it was completely evident that it was my money , and I need it to buy books for class in the morning. He called the manager(the one who made the mistake but had since left) and I was told I needed to leave it. I told him that I needed to keep it. He told me that there would be repercussions if I did not surrender the money and I told him that was fine, it is my money .

So basically they wanted to keep my own personal money that I had earned that night to balance out the safe until they got the money back from the other driver. I see this as if I was tending a cash register, someone else’s register did not get counted correctly, and I was told to give my own money to balance out the safe just because someone else’s error effected my register. In no other circumstance would an employee be asked to give money to their employer to fix errors. Let alone OTHER people’s errors.

I’m completely prepared to face the consequences, but it seems to me to be wrong that I could be punished for not giving my money to my employer. I thought it was illegal to tell an employee to pay out of pocket for any kind of mistake, even IF it was their own. The worst part is that my manager is extremely unintelligent and I fear he will not even respond to this reasoning. I tried to explain this over the phone and he just kept telling me that the other driver had my money . But I had no transactions with the other driver! My manager made a mistake and sent him home with $26 more than he should have! How does that make it my money !? Any kind of legal viewpoint would help me a heck of a lot because this guy is going to give me a lot of trouble over his mistake and my education expenses.

Thank you!
Just to be clear, there was no shortage. My manager made a mistake and sent another employee home with extra money and I was told to pay that shortage out of pocket until it was retrieved from that other employee. Even though I had made no mistake at all.
 
Nagesh answers:

Pizza Delivery is a tough biz. Owners expect too much from their drivers and in some places even ask them to keep their delivery money and their personal money in separate pockets so they can give up“their”money not the company money in the event they are mugged.

Its insane. The manager was probably trying to talk tough to put the problem on your shoulders. Stand your ground.

Why does President Bush want to Destroy the United States?

I thought this was conspiracy theory but it seems to becoming a reality…this is a Conservative website by the way…

http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=14965

What is happening to this administration?…I know they’re all money hungry SOB’s that really don’t care about the civil rights of Americans but to sell out our country and its sovereignty? I am shocked that at a time where the GOP speaks of national terrorism threats and how UNSAFE we all are…they would have our borders open for anybody to roll into America with any kind of terrorist objectives….What happened to making OUR borders safer and stronger? If you think illegal immigration is bad now, MY God, I can’t imagine what it would be like then…We’ll lose our national identity within years, not decades…I can’t see how you radical cons can still support this President…and you guys call us traitors&amp;communists???
 
Nagesh answers:

It makes sense…

His grandfather (Prescott Bush) was convicted of doing business with the Nazis–while at war with America–and had his assets confiscated. His former closest adviser, Karl Rove, was the grandson of Karl Heinz Roverer, who designed concentration camps for Hitler. Californian Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s father was a member of the SS during WW2.

Seems like there’s a pattern developing! Seems like certain elements within the American moneyed elite really wanted the Nazis to win WW2, and they’re doing their best to see that Hitler scores a belated victory.

IMPEACH BUSH AND HIS CRIMINAL CRONIES NOW!!!

Ruth asks…
 
HELPPPPPP! MY PARENTS…?

My parents are soo controlling, like I hate them. Ok I got a job and I’m now making my own money and it seems like now that I’m making my own money I can spend it on things I want. Ha so wrong my parents are even more controlling like they won’t even let me spend my own spend money , like I got a job and I’m now making money so it’s safe to assume that I would want to spend it. And it’s not like I’m blowing my checks, I set up a checkings account at Washington Mutual and I’m actually saving all my money . I’ve only spent it on food for work breaks and a purse (which they got mad at me for buying, they said it was too much, it was only $50).
So today, I told my mom if she was working on Saturday so she could take me school shopping so I could buy school clothes. She asked me where I want to go and I said Forever 21, I’ve never been there but I visited their website and the prices are reasonable and the stuff is cute. And we always go to this place called DD’s Discounts for school shopping and the stuff isn’t ugly it’s just I want to expand places where I go shopping and the stuff there isn’t really my style and fashionable.
Anyway, I told me mom I want to go to this store called Forever 21 and she’s like no. I don’t want you to spend more than $90. It makes me mad, like first off it’s my money I’m spending and I was just going to spend between $200 and $300 dollars for a NEW school wardrobe, I don’t think that’s too much or unreasonable.
AAARRGGGHH!! It just makes me angry I feel like I’m in a bubble and I can’t get out, i’m not happy here, like they control everything in my life even my own money now, I can’t even spend it how I would like to . I just want them to back off and leave me alone. I’ve never even been to like the movies (which is funny cause I work at a movie theater) or shopping with my friends at the mall.
How do I get my parents to just let me spend my money the way I want to ? I’m not wasting my money , blowing my paycheck or buying anything illegal . I just want cute clothes for school, is that a crime?

Nagesh answers:

Okk when i was 16 id been working for 2 years and my parents had come to terms with the fact that i was making my own money and i was going to spend it the way i wanted to
Although to begin with i had a similar problem, your parents are however trying to protect you from regretting what you do with your hard earned cash, after talking to my parents calmly we came to a compromise in that i would spend the money i earned but i would also save so much of it each time i got paid. You may already be doing this but you may have to let your parents know and make them feel like you are actually attempting to meet them half way. Tbh i basically made my parents feel like they were still putting restrictions on me but they were letting me go a litttttle bit. Ask your friends if they want to go out shopping and take your card with you [if you have one] draw out the money you want to spend and put it away for the day, that way you spend what you want on what you want cause your parents won’t be with you but you’ll still save the money they want you to save.
I really hope this works, i know how frustrating it is to have so many rules over you

HELLPPPPPPP!!!! IS FOREVER 21 BAD??

My parents are soo controlling, like I hate them. Ok I got a job and I’m now making my own money and it seems like now that I’m making my own money I can spend it on things I want. Ha so wrong my parents are even more controlling like they won’t even let me spend my own spend money , like I got a job and I’m now making money so it’s safe to assume that I would want to spend it. And it’s not like I’m blowing my checks, I set up a checkings account at Washington Mutual and I’m actually saving all my money .

Nagesh answers:

Well none of us get to pick our parents. Yeah, theyre wrong not to let you spend your OWN money, but really theres nothing you can do about. Try this. Since its your bank account, withdraw $300, and then tell your mom youre going to hang out at your friend’s house. Instead go to the mall and buy whatever you want, and then just take the hit for it.

Nagesh answers:

It’s your money, spend it however you want. I was in Forever 21 yesterday and got 2 shirts for 9 dollars. It’s not overpriced, and your parents should let you buy clothes if you want them, so long as they’re not slutty clothes. I bought new clothes for the end of summer and fall, and I am an adult, but I spent around 200 dollars and got lots of nice things, 2 new pairs of jeans, 2 tank tops, 5 shirts, a new bag, some perfumes, new underwear, etc.. If you can afford it, go for it, you don’t need a million dollars to get cute things if you bargain shop. Look for sales in the paper or clearance racks in expensive stores can be awesome too.

A question on marriage laws!?

I’ve heard Marriage is only supposed to be done bi a man and a women!
Does that mean a Man could marry his sister legally?
Does that mean a mother could marry her son after he was of age?
Does that mean a Father could marry his Daughter after she came of age?
I know this is wrong in the eye’s of God, and no i would not do any of the above questions myself!
But legally some one could if they really wanted to , right!
But same sex marriages are against the law! I’m Bi but I would not marry a guy! I’ve been married once and i would prefer never to do it again!
I just wanted to ask this question!
The laws in this country are slanted towards whats ethical, not towards whats good for its citizens!
Seatbelt laws are just a way to make money ! Otherwise motorcycles should be outlawed as un safe !
Cannibas doesn’t impair your ability to drive, but its illegal while Alcohol kills 1000′s every year!
I’m sorry for all who have taken offense to some of my ramblings! Bless You!

 Your Questions About Safe Illegal Ways To Make Money 
 Posted on July 5, 2012 by Nagesh 
 

James asks…
 
Concerning the illegal immigrant debate…Does anyone out there care about their fellow citizens?

Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen. I want to explain SB 1070

I’m Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen. I want to explain SB 1070 which I voted for and was just signed by Governor Jan Brewer. Rancher Rob Krantz was murdered by the drug cartel on his ranch a month ago. I participated in a senate hearing two weeks ago on the border violence, here is just some of the highlights from those who testified.

The people who live within 60 to 80 miles of the Arizona/Mexico Border have for years been terrorized and have pleaded for help to stop the daily invasion of humans who cross their property . One Rancher testified that 300 to 1200 people a DAY come across his ranch vandalizing his property, stealing his vehicles and property, cutting down his fences, and leaving trash. In the last two years he has found 17 dead bodies and two Koran bibles.

Another rancher testified that daily drugs are brought across his ranch in a military operation. A point man with a machine gun goes in front, 1/2 mile behind are the guards fully armed, 1/2 mile behind them are the drugs, behind the drugs 1/2 mile are more guards. These people are violent and they will kill anyone who gets in the way. This was not the only rancher we heard that day that talked about the drug trains.

One man told of two illegals who came upon his property one shot in the back and the other in the arm by the drug runners who had forced them to carry the drugs and then shot them. Daily they listen to gun fire during the night it is not safe to leave his family alone on the ranch and they can’t leave the ranch for fear of nothing being left when they come back.

The border patrol is not on the border. They have set up 60 miles away with check points that do nothing to stop the invasion. They are not allowed to use force in stopping anyone who is entering. They run around chasing them, if they get their hands on them then they can take them back across the border.

Federal prisons have over 35% illegals and 20% of Arizona prisons are filled with illegals. In the last few years 80% of our law enforcement that have been killed or wounded have been by an illegal .

The majority of people coming now are people we need to be worried about. The ranchers told us that they have seen a change in the people coming they are not just those who are looking for work and a better life.

The Federal Government has refused for years to do anything to help the border states . We have been over run and once they are here we have the burden of funding state services that they use. Education cost have been over a billion dollars. The health care cost billions of dollars. Our State is broke, $3.5 billion deficit and we have many serious decisions to make . One is that we do not have the money to care for any who are not here legally. It has to stop. The border can be secured. We have the technology we have the ability to stop this invasion. We must know who is coming and they must come in an organized manner legally so that we can assimilate them into our population and protect the sovereignty of our country. We are a nation of laws. We have a responsibility to protect our citizens and to protect the integrity of our country and the government which we live under.

I would give amnesty today to many, but here is the problem, we dare not do this until the Border is secure. It will do no good to forgive them because thousands will come behind them and we will be over run to the point that there will no longer be the United States of America but a North American Union of open borders. I ask you what form of government will we live under? How long will it be before we will be just like Mexico , Canada or any of the other Central American or South American countries? We have already lost our language, everything must be printed in Spanish also. We have already lost our history it is no longer taught in our schools. And we have lost our borders.

The leftist media has distorted what SB 1070 will do. It is not going to set up a Nazi Germany. Are you kidding. The ACLU and the leftist courts will do everything to protect those who are here illegally, but it was an effort to try and stop illegal ‘s from setting up businesses, and employment, and receiving state services and give the ability to local law enforcement when there is probable cause like a traffic stop to determine if they are here legally. Federal law is very clear if you are here on a visa you must have your papers on you at all times. That is the law. In Arizona all you need to show you are a legal citizen
Well the first two posts show the utter ignorance of some Americans who would rather form their opinions on GARBAGE they are fed by the lame stream media than the facts on the ground from a man who is a politician from AZ who voted for the bill and why..

Liberals don’t want to have to think about a position, they just take the position they are told to have…how sad.
White..typical liberal response, all rhetoric with no facts to back up the rant.
Appreciate the thoughtful responses…I am fed up with people boycotting, protesting, bullying AZ for trying to defend herself…I hope the miscreants in CA who are attempting to hurt us financially know that AZ can boycott them back..which will probably hurt them alot more than they can hurt us. I have already cancelled my travel plans to the beach this summer…
 
Nagesh answers:

Will the law work, I don’t know. I do wonder what will have to happen for liberals (like white) and the democratic party to realize there is a real problem on the boarder! Have the Democrats created a counter proposal that would actually help protect US CITIZENS from ILLEGALS along the boarder. Until they do, the government is failing an essential task for any government, protect it’s people and boarders from any and all intruders. That is the number one priority of a government, not providing medical care for all, or food stamps, or social security, or even roads, but the protection of its boarders and citizens. Without those there isn’t a nation.
 
 

Maria asks…
 
What is my neihgbor up to? (suspected illegal activity)?

I got a new neighbor recently. I live in a house and the neighbor has their own house next to mine. The neighborhood is the most ghetto in the city. They moved in about 2 months ago. She is a black female 25-35 years old. I have seen four young kids (5-10) that I presume are hers. She drives a Cadillac SUV in pearl white (easily a $60,000 car). She says she works in the city of _______. I left it blank because you don’t need to know. All I can say is, there are no jobs in _______ where you can make enough money to drive a $60,000 SUV and raise four kids. She said she moved out of the last place because“There were to many people coming and going and I didn’t feel safe with my kids”. None of the property is being maintained. The two previous owners had maintained 2 raised gardens but now they are just growing weeds and grass. The grass seldom gets cut. The bushes in front of the house get way overgrown until someone trims them. She immediately put up blinds on the porch upon moving in. I have seen numerous black males sitting on the porch. There have been up to four different cars in the driveway at one given time. These aren’t the husband’s friends because there is no husband. I suspect something illegal is going on. I usually don’t care about other people’s business but I am not going to sit by and watch my neighborhood get more and more ghetto. Notice how vague she is in her explanation for moving and what she does for a living. What do you think is going on?
Also, her coming and going is not typical of a job. Her caddy is at the house and gone at random times, rather than a certain hour to certain hour job.
LOL BANKROLLING A CADILLAC?!!?!?! Don’t tell me to mind my own business. Don’t try and stick up for her. Normal law abiding citizens do not act or live this way. I am not going to stand by and watch my neighborhood turn into the slums.

Anthony Sowell murdered 11 women and I’m sure his behavior was much less suspicious than this. I don’t think there are any murders going on, but I’m sure there is something else happening.

Mark asks…
 
I’m going to need rides here and there ALOT this summer. How can I make my taxi riding experiences safer?

 Money doesn’t matter too much. I just need some reassuring ideas. If youre going to say that nothing is 100% safe …don’t bother–that’s not what I need to hear. Nothing illegal , either. I wouldnt want for my bag to be searched by coincident and be in legal trouble. 

I’m 16 by the way, my parents are willing to give me $500 a week for rides. (Don’t call me spoiled or tell me I should have my own license by now…I know that I should. I just haven’t gotten around to it and even then I have to wait 6 months after getting my permit.)
I live in Dallas TX
 
Nagesh answers:

Will your parents adopt me??? I would drive you for $500 a week!

Seriously though. Are you always going to be coming and going from the same places at the same time every day? If you are, you can see if you can arrange for the same driver each time, that will mean it’s always the same person and you will feel more comfortable getting in the car with them. Or maybe there is a neighbor or college student that would be willing to hire on on a as needed basis. $500/ week is really good pay for being a driver.

Always wear your seat belt. Always make sure you have your cell phone with you and charged. Always make sure you have everything when you get in and out of the cab. If you have to wait for the car, make sure you do it inside in a lit area where you can be seen.

I’m not sure what you would think you could carry in your bag, or why you think it would be searched, but you’re right you don’t want an unforeseen coincidence to happen and have them find anything illegal.

(BTW–where I live, a 16 y/o can’t drive by themselves anyway.)
 
 

Jenny asks…
 
Why doesnt the govornment make marijuana legal?

Ok heres what i know. When the un was made they passed a law saying all countrys will ban illegAl drugs including marijuana. But tuat was made in the fourties when they thought tobacxo was gOod for children. Ik marijuana has been a proven pain killer antidepressant and a good way to ease pain in cancer patientd and get them to eat. I also know that around the Age of 21 or so when the neurological connections in the brain are fully developed it can be a heaalthy way to stimulate them and make stronger connections. There safer than tobacco and no doubt safer than alcohol seeing that it wont destroy your liver. So why do they continue to make it illegal . Ive heard thearoies that its so the fpv. Can make money but the DEA spends around a couple million if not billion dollars a year prOtecting the borders from drug traffickers. So why is it still illegal ?

Mandy asks…
 
Insurance help–Automobile?

I know that lying to my automobile insurance provider is both pointless and illegal , but i still want to save money . Here is my situation…

I have 2 cars…one for whatever, and one for fun =). However, my fun car was recently purchased and I have been shopping around for auto insurance for it. I am 18 years old, and since the car’s title is in my name, the policy will list me as the primary driver (from what i understand, this is required). I have gotten quotes from 3 providers at the moment…Geico’s quote was astronomical, Farmer’s was quite high, and my family’s current policy holder American Family was still high. But this is to be expected since the car is quite nice…a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. At the moment, since i just got a new job and have started to generate some income, I opted for simply the comprehensive coverage…basically anything that happens to it in my garage, like theft or natural disasters, is covered. Plus for some reason if i hit an animal too (i have no idea why). This is costing me around $75 a month. Since i have a lean on the car from my bank, they said they would need comp and collision for the car when i start driving it…but my state also requires liability. This coverage would all cost a grand total of $290 a month. This is in addition to my $170 a month car payments.

I cannot afford $290 a month!! I have talked to a friend of mine…her father owns an S2000 and a 2006 Evo, and he was saying that somewhere around $200 to $250 a month tops would be ok for me. What should i dooooooo? I really wanna drive it in the summer (or when the weather permits in general), but i cannot afford to give my entire paycheck for my insurance&amp;car payments…if i can get insurance for my fun car for around $200, that will leave me some room for food, gas, etc.

AFI has discounts for policies, like good student (which i am), and if the car has 1 (driver) airbag…but the car is safe in other ways too–4 wheel drive, anti lock brakes, 4 doors….and I have a totally clean driving record, no tickets or anything. Unfortunately the guy said that the car isn’t in the“preferred vehicle”catagory, and that they could make an exception if i had another 1-3 years of driving experience…that by itself would save me 50 bucks, but alas, nope.

Ideas?
*sigh* i do not own my“whatever”car, nor do i pay the insurance for it. The only reason i even got a job is because i wanted my own car for fun
 
Nagesh answers:

Clearly, you cannot afford two cars, you can A get rid of one or B get another job? Whats it going to be. I looked up funcar and it is not in the dictionary, sorry. May not be what you want to hear, but I suggest after your three years experience you can afford it. And when do you guys learn to not compare rates from adults who have 20 years experience?

Can my manager take money out of my paycheck just because I make a mistake?

I work for Safe Touch Security Systems and last week we were informed that every time we schedule a service call and we make a mistake on the scheduling they will take $75 out of our paycheck which by the way we don’t already get paid much to begin with. Can he do this? Isn’t this illegal ?

I do not know what state you are employed in, but in California this would be clearly illegal. I suspect laws are quite similar in other states, especially if the penalty withdrawal drops you below the minimum wage. Here is a link:

Do you think that Bank of America will be forced to buy back mortgages?

When Bank of America purchased Countrywide along with my mortgage from them I was hoping something like this would come along and now it’s in the news. Do you think this might actually happen or will the crooks (Dem and Rem) find a way to make money off of keeping the illegal mortgages safe for the bank to keep while those of use who got ripped off keep trying to pay for homes that are not worth what we bought them for?

http://www.google.com/search?q=bank+of+america+buy+back&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;lr=&amp;ft=i&amp;tbs=qdr:w&amp;cr=&amp; safe =images#q=bank+of+america+buy+back&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tbs=qdr:w,nws:1&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=univ&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=1wPPTMnFBpS8nge62NDtDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQqAIwAA&amp;fp=dcbdd1be8eb8f40b

.
BTW, saying“bought houses they KNEW they could not afford”across the board isn’t what’s going on with everyone. This was my first home purchase and I was told that I could afford it so I believed Countrywide since I didn’t know that I shouldn’t believe them and they made it sound like I could afford the home and then some. NO need to be rude.

Is it illegal to download music from youtube to itunes?

I download music off youtube on this website called video2mp3.com or easymovieconverter.com to my itunes.. But I don’t sell it or share it though. Is that still illegal ? Could you get arrested or sued for that? Because I don’t see anything wrong with it, it’s only going to be on my itunes. If it was illegal I don’t think they would make all these website for music off youtube. But is it illegal ? Should I stop? Is there any other place I can get music for my itunes that doesn’t cause virus or cost money ? Please let me know.. And if there’s a safer way please let me know where and how to do it. Please and thank you.

Donna asks…
 
My friend is lying to social services to get benefits. She does illegal drugs around her kids. Should I report?

Urgent. Please help! I’m sorry this is long. The YMCA took her and her kids moved her into a home free. She gets social service food stamps benefits for $500.00 per month. She also gets $600.00 cash assistance per month. Plus free family health care. She gets to basically live for free.They pay her rent free with the exception her husband does not come on or around premises, her, and her kids. She lies to them weekly he does not come around when he does. He sneaks out the door before they arrive to do their weekly supervised visits and check the scene. He’s violent and dangerous that is why. She smokes weed in front of her kids daily. She scolds them if they come near her and she yells at them to go away (so she can have her weed). The kids cry because they don’t understand why she yells at them to go away for her reason to smoke weed. The kids are 3 and 8. The mother also sells her prescription drugs to make money . Isn’t that illegal ? She does that because she spends all of her $600.00 incorrectly, buying weed and things for herself. Her drug dealer comes to her house often to give her weed and pay him. She said she smokes weed because she does not want to take her happy pills. Well, isn’t everything she is doing unlawful and constitutes a felony if caught? In addition lying to the YMCA to get her benefits and rent paid too? The husband is dangerous and has a 25 year criminal record. This is why the YMCA doesn’t want him around if they are going to pay her rent. If she gets caught she will lose her home and her children. It was supposed to be a help to her to keep her kids and her safe , but yet she does nothing to help herself. She doesn’t even bother to get a job. She takes care of her kids,but mentally no. Rile the 3 year old is torn mentally and demonstrates his father’s violent behavior by hitting the mom, her friends that are over, and his sister. The 8 year old is her daughter from a different father who is afraid for her mother’s life. Her other family doesn’t agree with her being at her Mom’s house with her violent partner. She fears Nathan will hurt him, but accepts him when he is there because she doesn’t want to get in trouble. I’ve heard the mother yell at her daughter she causes her and her husband fights. It’s her daughter’s fault for why they are the way they are because she has to be nosy about everything. She also tells her daughter that if she tells her other father her husband is around she will no longer see her mom. She will be in trouble and if she tells on Mommy, she is the reason she will lose her mother, she must lie about it. Her daughter said she doesn’t want to lie and lying is bad. How can she lie to her other families face about this when she is asked? The mother said: you just do or you will be punished.

I am not this Mom’s friend anymore because she continues to self-destruct with this behavior of hers over the last 6 years and I was afraid if she was caught doing the unlawful acts I could be charged as an accessory for not reporting it. I have not spoken to her in over a month, but I am half tempted to report to YMCA and social services what’s going on as it’s truly unlawful, but I’m afraid if she finds out it was me, she would send her husband after me to kill me or hurt me. Or her herself for revenge. What do I do? I wish I never knew this person and I thought she was my friend, but I cannot stand to let this happen to herself and her children. Mainly it’s her children that are my concern. And it says by law if you know of a person in a situation like this or doing unlawful things to report, but I’m afraid to . Should I or not? What if she’s caught one day and they find I was a friend of hers. I could be in trouble for not reporting it then too right?
 To the one person who said I am glad I don’t have any friends like you: Wake up to reality hunny. You’re obviously not connected to reality. And no I am not wanting revenge. You are clearly not thinking about the child’s safety etc. Screw you for condoning people to act unlawfully. Weed not that bad? You’re not worth wasting anymore of my time for a retort.
The mother needs help here. And I was her friend for a long time where I tried to help her, but she ignored me and everyone else who tried to help her. I lost a job over helping her. I just couldn’t sit back to watch this self-destructing unlawful life lived anymore for the sake of her children.
So how does this make me a bad person? Would you let someone get away with this after five years? Would you act this way to yourself? I don’t think so.
 
Nagesh answers:

YES!!! DO NOT DELAY: Go to Google.com and search“Public Assistance Fraud reporting”for your area (city, state) and call that number IMMEDIATELY. Call the police and have this woman ARRESTED. In her current state, she is no mother, she is a MONSTER.
The fact that you are struggling with this shows that you do have some kind of conscience, and that’s a good thing. Those children have already suffered what may be irrepairable emotional and psychological damage, and God Himself only knows about any other abuses (physical, probably some sexual abuse with the druggie‘boyfriends’).
Those children deserve better. I pray that you are no longer blessed with any kind of internal peace or ability to have decent sleep until you have acted on the knowledge of abuse and done the right thing by reporting it. Imagine if you were one of those children yourself. They don’t have their own voice and are wholly reliant on adult intervention. And yes, knowing of abuse and failure to report makes you legally culpable. So report it. Get those babies to safety and for goodness’sake, let’s get that woman the help she so desperately needs.
 
 

David asks…
 
Is a flat tax of a dime per product sold the answer to any State’s money woe’s?

For all those who don’t contribute to income Tax collection’s, ie: Illegal immigrants, Independent Contractor’s, So many small store and gas station owners. It is my thought that if the State you live in placed a Ten Cent per item Flat Tax on every item sold any where including non nutricous food item’s. That State would be able to collect Hundred’s of Millions of dollars in revenue that it would not normally receive. Money strictly to be spent on furnishing JOB’S, State Police and Fire Troopers. EMS Tech’s, Road repair and clean up crew’s. And at a dime per item, it would only cost the average person about $40.00 to $60.00 per month. Money that so many people should contribute any way. Now if a person or family member could not afford it they could go get a job with the State. If a person is impoverished and unable to work, the State could supply a certain discount card if the right criteria is met. Let’s put America back to work and make our road’s clean and safe again. ( At the cost of a dime. )
 
Nagesh answers:

First off, every independent contractor I’ve ever worked with (myself included) has made darn sure their taxes are accurate–the IRS loves to audit people who work for themselves. If you don’t believe me, I can show you the almost 100 page tax return I filed one year.

The main problem with your idea is that if you’re just going to pull $500-$750 a year from each person, that money comes from somewhere. It comes from the stuff that they might buy, but can’t because the state tax is so high. That means they don’t buy as much stuff. If enough people do that, stores need fewer people to work, and they buy less inventory, which means their suppliers need fewer people. That does not equate to putting“America back to work”.

BTW, at $60/month per person a family of four gets dinged for just under $3000 a year. If you know a family like that, ask them if they’ve got a spare three grand a year just laying around.

When you say that a person who couldn’t afford it should“just go get a job with the state”, you do realize that that person has to be paid, get benefits, etc. When you figure it all in, it probably averages out to about $60,000 a year for each person the state employs. So for every person who can’t afford the tax and gets a job with the state, it takes about 80 people at your $60/month just to pay for that person. And there’s going to be a lot more than 1 or 2 percent of the population that can’t afford your tax. That means it’s going to end up costing money, and making the budget situation worse. You’re losing money on each person the state hires, but trying to make up for it by hiring a lot of them.

Also, when you say it’s money“that so many people should contribute any way”, I think it says a lot about how you view the relationship between the government and the people.“Because they can afford it”is _never_ the right reason to impose a tax.

Donald asks…
 
Natwest have charged me too much in charges and have there for illegally taken money from my account?

I have just checked my bank statement and was shocked to see that natwest have taken £180 in charges. I did go over my over draft limit as have had some financial problems which I am slowly getting sorted and expected some charges but not this much. I have looked at the break down of what the charges are for and how much they have charged. and the have charged me a Maintenance fee of £28. According to there website under current account rates and charges

http://www.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/g6/rates-charges.ashx (see bottom of page)

it clearly states there maintenance fee is £20 so they have charged me £8 too much. Secondly they have charged me a unpaid item fee of £38 again according to there website it states there unpaid item fee is £5 per item. So they have charged me £33 too much and lastly they have charged me £105 in guaranteed payment fees. For 3 transactions. It again clearly states on there website £15 per transaction up to a maximum of £90 in a billing period. 3 transactions at £15 is £45 not £105 so they have charged me £60 too much. All together they have charged me £101 too much. What should I do I can’t afford too loose this much money . If I phone up first thing in the morning and complain will they refund my money , or as im complaining about charges will they tell me they can’t help me and that my complaint will be put on hold. It would seem really unfair if they did as at the end of the day they have charged me too much and have illegally taken money from my account. Is it best to phone or should I write.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

thanks in advance

OMG Natwest R Pigs !

About 3 months ago i had a request from paypal for £7.27 that got sent to my account in which i got no warning for atal. I didnt have the money in my account so it got reversed back ti paypal in which i paid the folowing day.

2 months later i put £40.00 in my account&amp;ordered this amount of items on the internet. I checked my account the next morning and it said–£38.00 overdrawn so i got a statement and i was charged £38.00 unpaid Item fee even though i paid it ages ago. I phoned up explaining i cant afford it and the women said i also have to pay another £20.00 charge tomoroow and every wendsay of week i dont pay the charges by. Including nect month another £55.00 for the items i originally put the money in for and bought. So basically atm iv got to pay £113.00 including £20.00 each week i dont pay

they can fuck themselves and what gets me angry is i shouldnt of had to pay the charge anyway as it was cancelded and i still paid anyway a while back. Also threir extremely rude in the branch and over the phone and wont help u out atal, i am going to leave them no matter how high that charge gets im ignorin it.

Last of all when they tried to take out the £7.27 i actually had £36.00 in my account but withdrew £30.00 which is mean because why couldnt they take it out as soon as they say the £36.00 instead of waiting for me to withdraw it so they can fuck me over with charges. I was only £1.27 short anyway and should of had to repay a cancelled transaction.
 
 

Helen asks…
 
How can I persuade my dad to get him lend me his debit card so that I can buy things/apps over the internet…?

via PayPal? Okay first of all i am under the age of 18, and i aint got no credit card/debit card yet. but my father has one–a debit card. I am so crazy of the apps i wanted to buy online so i made a paypal account (put fake D.O.B.) :p but they asked for the card number. How do I stand before my dad asking for the debit card for the number? If I say something about the internet, when he ask me why do I need his card, he’ll surely not lend me becos he is afraid I’m sending his money to a person illegally -_- or if i tell him PayPal. he will say What?? he doesnt know much about the internet!! helpp I so freaking want that app for my ipad!!
 
Nagesh answers:

What you can try is to give him the money in advance. For instance, if you want a $5 app you can give him the money and use his card to make the online transaction then give the card back to him, If he has concerns you can invite him to watch as you process the purchase. Once you establish his trust he may allow you to use the card more often. I hope that works for you.
 
 

Mark asks…
 
Should I turn her in for tax fraud?

My co-worker keeps bragging about how much money she is getting illegally from the government. I think she is despicable and her husband is doing the same thing. It really pisses me off that she would brag about it. They are on welfare have 2 kids and on top of that they are illegal. I really want to turn them in but I don’t know if I should. Advice? please…
It upsets me because I work really hard for my money and I follow the rules, just like many American citizens. This is not the first year she does it. Last year between her and and her husband they got $18,000 and this year it looks like the same. It is just a really tough decision.
Well on the IRS website it says it’s confidential. I don’t know maybe the IRS is building a case against them as we speak. She just really got under my skin today, bragging so much. Then she has the nerve to lecture me on being a good Christian. What a pathetic excuse for a human being. Thanks for all the responses guys. I will ponder upon this conundrum.
 
Nagesh answers:

That’s quite a dilemma you have there.

By turning them in, and acting as any upstanding citizen should when they see defrauding of the government, the well-being of the children has to be taken under consideration. You know the two adults would be prosecuted and the kids put in foster homes so, there lies the rub…will what you intend to do be worth seeing that family being torn asunder?

It’s your choice to make.

I was suspended for drinking during working hours pending investigation. I then asked to do a compromise deal.?

The deal is verbally agreed subject to some clarifications. Today I read in the paper that the company had a management re-structure and I was leaving. Even with the disciplinary case looming, surely this is me being dismissed illegally ? I have a lot of money riding on this but the company are struggling for money a bit. Is this a clear cut unfair dismissal and if successful how much money could I get ?

Sandy asks…
 
how do you get reimbursed for something that was illegally charged and nobody can help (mp3 music)?

have gone every avenue i can think of with no results. this was taken off my credit card without my permission or knowledge. $65.00 isn’t alot of money to some but it is to me. Characters like this give the internet a bad name.
 
Nagesh answers:

If it was charged on your credit card without your consent, call the credit card company and file a chargeback. They will contact the company that the charge came from and unless they can show proof that you made the charge, they essentially accepted a stolen credit card and it will be credited back to you.

College Writing Help?

My professor wants us students to write a weekly“Journal”which is something I dont thing I have ever done but the topic is“Anything college related or a college experience”. It is not an essay just a Journal. I’ve already done 2. Let me know what you think. Also, if you did Journals in college. You have any tips in making this alittle easier?

Journal #1

Since starting college, I have noticed how different it is from high school.
In High school, students are labeled and stereotyped. Students are not treated as individuals. Rather, they form and exist in groups or cliques. While adolescence is a time when teenagers are supposed to be developing, they are affected by the unwritten rules of high school. There are certain things that are considered acceptable and unacceptable. These ideas can limit someone’s freedom to be who they are.
By law, it is necessary and to a certain extent, teenagers are forced to attend high school. There are rules and regulations which one cannot break, because there will be punishments for their actions. Most students do not take high school seriously enough; they go because they have to . They do not see it as a lifetime opportunity.
In college, students are there because they are serious about furthering an education and achieving long life goals. A person has to pay for college. So, if a student does not live up to the expectations of college they know they wasted their hard earned money , or their parents. Since students pay to get into college they work harder than they did in high school.
Also, students are not discriminated because they are outcasts, straight, gay, black, or white. They are the same as everyone else, an individual. Students are not here to gossip or judge others. We are adults. We have taken the first step to have a better earning potential, a fulfilling career, and a good life for our families.

Journal #2
Enrolling into college was harder than I ever imagined. You have to do everything on your own. First you have to go to the enrollment office, wait in line, and enroll. Take a placement test to find out which classes you need to be put in. Go to student orientation or do it online for those of us who signed up late into the semester. See a counselor to find out what schedule fits you best for classes. Go to the business office and pay for your classes before they get dropped. Then, somewhere in the middle of all the chaos you have to find time to make it into the financial aid office so you can have some help in paying for the whole college experience.
Not forgetting the fact that you have to buy your own textbooks, a calculator, computer, printer and all the other necessities you might need in college. Then, you have the agonizing worry if your going to do well or even fit in. It is something every student has to go through at one point at their college.
Sometimes I think preparatory school never properly prepares you for the real world. Having to do everything on your own is a whole new experience and very overwhelming especially for freshmen. It is different because your no longer a dependent under your parents. Your on your own with your own life and problems. Mommy and Daddy are not there every step of the way to save you anymore. I suppose it all soaks in after a few weeks of school.
Needless to say, the whole adventure will give you and insight of the real world and becoming an adult. Going through the enrollment process on your own will give you a boost of confidence to face other situations in your life.
 
Nagesh answers:

I think your writing is quite good, you have definitely captured the experience well and your comparison to school is spot on. Also to note is that teenagers have grown up a little by the time they hit college, either that or because they are thrown into a different environment with“adults”rather than younger teens they can pick on they have to grow up and face the real world. Yes I agree that most people are prepared to work harder in college, for one they are doing something they“want”to do rather than taking a bunch of subjects that most of the time they only like 1 or 2 of! I can imagine how daunting and stressful the enrollment experience must be on someone young and who is doing things for themselves for the first time, I as a mature student with life experience found it stressful and confusing! And then of course if and when you go to university it is even worse! Well worse in the sense of having to be very independent and capable of doing pretty much everything for yourself, don’t let me put you off, I myself am doing a university degree but am doing it at a college instead of a university because I prefer the college environment and smaller classes, more time with your tutor etc. Another thing I found different from school was that you are on the same level as your tutors, they are not seen as“above you”and as authoritarian as teachers are, you can swear in front of them, have a fag with them at breaks and even go to the pub with them in some cases! It’s a very nice experience after being around snotty teachers who think they“own”you! (of course when I say swear in front of them I do not recommend this, you must have respect for your tutors at all times, I just mean in in the sense that as you are on a level with them as an adult you can speak to them in their own language, of course it may be different for younger students) Another point to mention is that student life is very distracting and often results in wild parties, drugs etc and when living away from home there is no one to tell you otherwise so new students need to be careful of that, there is nothing wrong with having fun however you don’t want it to interfere with your studies as you can quickly fall behind.
Also in my experience I find that older students and those who are paying for their course or getting a loan to pay for it work harder and are more dedicated, whereas those who are getting the course free via government funding tend to be the ones who do not work as hard and take the most time off, I am not being stero-typical just making a statement about what I have seen first hand.

Hmmm tips on making writing a journal easier? Well I’d say your doing a pretty good job, have you tried an online blog such as blogger? If you enjoy writing as I clearly do then it’s not a problem to write a journal each day, but if it’s more of a challenge for you how about setting aside some dedicated time each evening, even if it is only 10 minutes to write about that day? Or carrying a notepad around and jotting down little things that have happened during the day or that you might fancy writing about later to give you inspiration if you get stuck?
Hope this helps and keep at it cause you seem to be doing to right thing, best of luck! Xx

How to make money from writing online?

I’m still at school but I’d like to earn a bit of money for writing things online . I’ve heard about Triond and Blogspot and things like that but i wasnt keen? I tried Blogspot but getting the google adsense apprioved is just too hard and on triond it seems that the earnings are really bad. So are there any ways to earn some money (more than penuts) for writing online ? which are the best sites/ ways. any ideas?
 
Nagesh answers:

The best way is probably to enter writing competitions online. Be careful of scams though.

Literary magazines are also a good idea, there are some online ones that are always on the lookout for interesting articles, poems, stories; anything thought-provoking. I’ve submitted some poetry to Wet Ink (it’s an Australian magazine). The only problem with this method is how long you have to wait to find out if your work gets accepted.

If I think of anything else, I’ll let you know

Ken asks…
 
Fiance is being difficult about wedding finance/planning?

We recently got engaged and have been trying to start the beginning phases of planning our wedding. The thing is, he’s the one who wants the wedding, not me. I would much rather elope, but this is something that’s important to him so we are compromising. He said that he just wants to have a big party for our friends and family. I’m starting to become more ok with his plan, but its still not my first choice.

From the beginning of our engagement, he’s been pretty ignorant about how much things cost in the real world. He asked me to show him engagement rings that I would like to give him ideas. I’m not really big on flashy rings so I told him I would rather just have a nice wedding band and skip the diamond engagement ring. He insisted on the engagement ring, so I picked out some cheaper ones (in the $300 range) and he was put off by the prices and said that was in the way upper range of what he wanted to spend. So, I shopped around online for a few weeks and found a used ring that was $110 which he was OK with.

When we started talking about wedding stuff, I was telling him that I just wanted something simple and that I was appalled at the fact that the average wedding costs around $20,000 these days. He was shocked at the price and said that we wouldn’t spend that much. He has about $5000-$6000 saved up and I don’t have much at all since I’m saving up for grad school. I asked him how much he wants to spend and he said around $2000 for the reception. (We already agreed on a courthouse ceremony) He has done nothing as far as planning/looking into locations and has left it all to me. After looking around at prices for a long time I told him I didn’t know what we were going to do because there was nowhere that charged less than $2500 for the night and didn’t require a minimum catering order of around $4000. He didn’t really have anything to say about it, he basically ignored me. He also keeps saying that he thinks we’ll break even with the costs, he thinks his relatives are going to give him lot of money for wedding gifts. He has a pretty small family and knowing them, I really wouldn’t count on much. (I think he got the idea from a Vietnamese friend of ours who recently got married and got a lot of money from relatives but thats only because in his culture family member give A LOT of money , like $1000+ from each family member…) I try telling him that’s not realistic but he won’t listen to me. He also just got a new (and slightly better paying job) so he says that he’ll have more money by next year. Even though that’s true, I don’t think it will be that much more AND I think it would be irresponsible for him to blow his entire savings on one day.

Finally, yesterday I found what seemed like the best deal so far. $1500 for an awesome (but smaller) venue in a great area that allows outside catering. I told him about it and he seemed into the idea and excited about it. I did a write up of the bare minimum of what we will have to pay to show him and start getting into the actual planning. Needless to say, the costs still ended up being well over $2000 at the absolute bare minimum. He didn’t really want to look at my list at all and wouldn’t even talk about the price. He just said“I’ll pay for it, don’t worry”. I still don’t think he understands what this will add up to and I still think he’s counting on breaking even. (HA!)

How can I get him to take this more seriously and actually start planning for how much this WILL cost us? I’m getting anxious about the whole thing because I’m doing all the planning even though HE’S the one who wants the wedding. I told him this and he said he could do the planning just as easily and yet he hasn’t done anything. I’m stressing about the amount of money this is going to cost us, and I feel like its totally on my shoulders to find a way to make this happen without blowing our entire savings…(also, trying to plan something that our families will be pleased with and our friends will have fun at…we’ve been to a lot of awesome weddings lately and although its not a competition they’ve put the bar up pretty high)

Sorry for the loooong post, I just needed to vent a little because its been stressing me out a lot for the past few days.

Thanks in advance for any advice or sympathy at all 

(Please, no comments like“If you can’t even handle planning a wedding, you can’t handle marriage”. We have a wonderful relationship and I wouldn’t even be putting myself through this and bending over backwards to plan a wedding for him if he wasn’t a great partner 99% of the time.)
We’re in our mid-late 20′s. He’s normally VERY good with money , extremely responsible, so its weird how he’s been so clueless with this. Also, communication is usually very good between us, again, its weird that he’s being like this. We are hoping for a Spring 2013 wedding, so a little over a year away. To him that feels like forever, to me it feels like its right around the corner. We want to try for kids within the next couple years.
I KNOW he’s being immature/passive aggressive about this issue, which is why I’m asking for advice. Luckily, this is very out of character for him and nowhere near enough to call off a wedding about.

I’m trying to be as accommodating as possible because I know this is something that’s important to him, but obviously there is a limit and I’m slowly reaching that point.
p.s. We’ve also been together for over 5 years.
We are in the US, I have no idea how this ended up in the UK section. We’ve looked into park/backyard ceremonies but nothings fit what we are looking for. Our guest list so far is between 70-100, may have to be edited down further.
 
Nagesh answers:

You can have a beautiful wedding on any budget so that is not where the problem lies. The day is as much his as yours so I’m happy to hear there is compromising going on. To get him to think realistically, you both need to sit down together with your parents and come up with a realistic budget. If you don’t have a budget it mind from the beginning, you will definitely end up with a few surprises after the wedding.

You don’t say what type or style of wedding so its hard to judge why you are not finding a backyard or park that fits into your plan. Remember, 40% of your budget goes to catering so even though a backyard or park is either free or very inexpensive, you still need enough food to go around.

If he wants to throw a big party as the reception then have a smaller, more intimate ceremony with 25-40 guests and then have the reception and invite all 70-100 people. Of course the problem is you still have to feed your guests.

If I was your planner, I would sit down with both of you and explain how it all works. In your case, I would have you set a budget of $3,000-$3,500 for both ceremony and reception. That is plenty enough to feed everyone, limit your alcohol and have minimal flowers. You should try to find an inexpensive gown or rent a gown to keep costs down. IPODs for music is easy to do and friends can help you with that. Find a location that you both can compromise on and put the extras in the details.

I’m not exactly looking for an answer; just let me know you read it and maybe offer a tip or two. It looks long, but it’ll only take five minutes. Ten if you’re an extremely slow reader.

A day in my shoes

First, let me tell you a couple things about myself.
1.I’m terrified to sleep when I’m home alone
2.I think my sister is a mooch in the simplest of ways : no thank-yous whatsoever toward her family that does so much for her and lets her have a roof over her head, even though she’s almost twenty and shouldn’t even be living here anymore. My mom on the other hand believes that she’s not a mooch because she’s paying for college so she can get a career. (Yeah, cosmetology school. As if a hairdresser makes enough to get by these days.)

I wake up, it being an average day. I go and talk to my mom while she is getting ready for work. We have a decent conversation. I go downstairs and do my own thing. Later, she comes down and asks why a clean load of laundry is sitting on the floor and not the counter. I tell her that I took it out of the dryer to put our (mine and my mom’s) laundry in, and threw it on the floor because I thought it was my sister’s. (After all, that’s what my sister would have done if it was mine, and I’ve even seen my mom do such a thing before.) So she offers a rebuttal: “You think your sister’s dirt!? Everybody should be treated fairly!”

She tells me that I’m grounded, and takes the laptop with her (the only computer in the house with Internet connection). I tell her that I have homework to do with it (damn online textbook). After going back and forth, she finally leaves through the garage door, and takes the laptop with her. Later, she calls to tell me that she’ll tell me where she hid the laptop if I finish my chores, which include a few simple tasks around the house. This tells me that the laptop is obviously in the garage, because where else could she have hidden it? Well, I decide not to go get it, but instead to just clean the entire house, because there’s nothing my mom would like more and it would possibly put us back on good terms (we had recently started fighting more often).

Well, first, my sister comes to ask me if I could walk to the store and buy her some cake mix (apparently for a party that night). She tells me that I could spend a buck or two of her money on myself. “Ok,” I thought. After all, I was getting exercise from walking, and here she was offering me a settlement for my time. So, I go to the store and buy her a box of cake mix. I get back, and start cleaning the house. She makes her cake, leaving behind her a giant mess, then goes to lie on the couch and watch TV. Here I am, working my ass off cleaning the house. I get to the living room. I ask my sister if she could help me lift the little bitty coffee table onto the couch so that I can vacuum underneath it. She refuses. “But I’d rather not use my knees,” she says. So I manage to get it myself, nearly spilling the contents of the table’s drawers all over the floor. She says, “See, you could have gotten it yourself.” Yeah. Thanks for the help. I guess it’s fine, because you’re so busy and all.

So it’s about two hours later. The house is almost finished and my sister hasn’t budged from the couch except to make a minor mess of the living room that I had previously cleaned. I ask her if she’d mind helping just a tad by cleaning up her small messes around the house. I don’t exactly remember how she responded, but the mess never got picked up.

The house is now nearly spotless; probably the cleanest it’s been in a couple of months (no joking). My sister is still watching the TV, even though it’s been another hour or so, and she’s been watching it for over four hours now. I ask if I can use the TV. She replies saying that there are others in the house. But I’d rather just lay on the couch, eat some food, and relax after cleaning the entire house, rather than sitting on a bed, craning my neck to stare at a 7” TV. I simply tell her, “Yeah, but there aren’t any other couches.” She doesn’t budge. Yeah, didn’t expect anything there. But really, does she truly think she deserves to watch that TV more than me?

I decide just to sit on the desk chair and watch the TV in the den. But not after long, she finally goes upstairs. I had previously folded her clothes up neatly and placed then on her bed, and then placed a few more items of her junk on top of that, just to get it all out of the hallway (where we do laundry) to get it clean. I hear her throwing things upstairs, and then I hear her door slam. I go up there to check it out. It appears that she’s thrown all her junk right back out into the previously clean hallway. I wait for her to go to the shower, and then put all her crap right back in her room, but this time make them blend better into her room, of which you can’t even see the floor. That wasn’t hard.

An opportunity arises to go over to one of my friends’ house. I do so, and upon coming home , I s

Joseph asks…
 
What would happen if charging interest became illegal .?

The working class no longer charged itself for borrowing money like it does now .
Only people who have money benefit from interest .
The only way they got money was to collect it from working people as a fee for showing them how to perform a routine task over and over that they continue to profit from .

Everyone who is rich has profited from the workers because alone the Ford family could only make a dozen cars a year .
But by showing a few people how to make a car they where able to become billionaires and in the process share the wealth with other people who had lots of money to invest .

SO its simple ELIMINATE INTEREST and save the poor working man from 6% on home loans which amounts to $8000. a year to 12% -25% on consumer goods like clothing and and other Items purchased on credit .

That credit is the work of others being produced and the profits from which all go to the so called investors who take huge profits out of the work and credit they willingly provide .

Why would anyone lend money? For a fee?
 
 

Sharon asks…
 
Was I wrong to Gamble my Grandmother’s Money?

Before judging me, please read my entire question.

I went to a Casino with my good friend Ruth Hubbard- you might have heard of her, she’s an improv actress in Chicago that just graduated from IO University (Improv Olympic) and has done a ton of basement theater, including“Stick it in your Eye”- about people who like to poke themselves. It’s funny, you should see it if you’re in town, it runs till October 2nd.

Anyways, Ruth told me about a place called a Casino- I had never heard of it before, only saw a place like it in movies or on the radio. When we went in, I saw people putting dollar bills into machines that had lights on them and would make noise. Some people jumped up and began screaming for joy. I found out this is because they won money out of the machines. Most people looked unhappy and were smoking a lot. I am 30 and Ruth is 28 by the way.

Anyways we each had $30 with us and sat down at the penny slots. I looked for the place where you put the penny in, but Ruth said I had to put a dollar in. Why on earth would it be called a penny machine then if I have to put a buck in? LOL funny, right? As I began playing the machine, I pressed buttons that said LINES and CREDITS. Whatever that means. I pressed them randomly, and before I knew it my machine lit up and began making loud noises. I remembered these sounds from before when I saw the people happy, so I jumped up and made happy noises too. Ruth informed me I had hit a cherry and had only won 2 cents. It didn’t matter- I was still a winner. I kept playing the machine, but suddenly it stopped working. Ruth told me this was because I was out of money . I had maxed out a whole dollar. Frustrated, I put more dollars in but the machine didn’t light up a lot anymore and before I knew it I had spent all my cash.

I had fun with Ruth that night, but upon my return home I couldn’t stop thinking about the casino. I was scratching myself and knew that if I could go back, I would win more. I decided since I don’t have a job I needed emergency money . I asked my Grandmother for some loan money to get me to go to school. She loved the idea that I was trying to further my education. I ended up getting a good $2,000 out of her for a few“classes”I was going to take. Once I got the money , I hit the casino alone. I quickly ditched the penny slots and headed towards the dollar ones. For some reason, my luck from the previous night was not happening this time. I lost $200 in a good hour on dollar slots. Some times the machine would“hit”and give me a few bucks back. But mostly they sucked it back.

Then I saw what they call The Tables. I approached a table called Roulette. This seemed fairly simple . Put it all on Black or put it all on Red. I hear the odds to this are better then Blackjack- since here its a 50/50 chance. I put all the rest of the cash I had on Red, my lucky color. I figured you gotta play big to win big. I ended up losing BIG. I couldn’t believe it. One spin of that wheel, and I lost. I even asked if I could purchase some easy dollar chips and spread them on all 37 numbers so I could win no matter what. The dealer laughed at this. Stupid, since technically all you have to do to win Roulette is place a single chip on every number. That way you’ll always win.

My Grandmother found out I was at the casino and now refuses to speak to me. Was I wrong to do this, and why is gambling so hard? I see so many people coming out of casinos screaming for joy and saying they won big.
Explain how Roulette has worse odds then Blackjack. In Roulette, there are more variations of winning. Especially in the Red or Black scenario. It’s a 50/50 chance. Not in blackjack- the cards are always going to be different.
 
Nagesh answers:

What you described and how you described is exactly the BEHAVIOR OF AN ADDICTED GAMBLER at the beginning stage. And it is no matter if you agree with me or think that I’m unfair with you. What you did is cheating with yourself. A deceptive attitude, a train of lies to yourself and to your grandmother, a vision of illusory future and in fact you don’t know to gamble. You don’t know that this place exists to make a lot of money from people that think exactly like you. I’m sorry to read such story and zero condolence for you. You was no wrong but VERY WRONG. I’m sure that you also now think where to find money to go back being sure that you will win. Forget from that. You will lose again. All addicted think the same. But because I told you that you are at the beginning, there is what to do and all is depending on you. You can repair the situation if you want. It will take some time and some effort from your side but it is possible.

Nagesh answers:

I think it was wrong because you lied and wasted her money…but people make mistakes and you should make it a point to pay her back ALL of the money. Casinos aren’t a way to get rich quick and you can’t go in expecting to win. If you don’t have the money, you shouldn’t go and if you do you should only take a twenty and put it in your pocket for the night AND THAT”S IT! It’s very easy to get“sucked in”just like alcohol and drugs. The chances of winning are slim…and yes sometimes people do win money but how much did they spend in order to get it…Some people also get hit by buses but that doesn’t mean they did anything for it to happen. I’ve seen a lot of people do VERY stupid things with their money at casinos don’t be one of them.

Nagesh answers:

Few pointers you need in life:
1) never try to gain anything without putting in genuine effort, and that include gambling–refrain from gambling;
2) if you are aware that you had made a mistake (in gambling), then learn not to repeat it. The lesson is worth it;
3) you had disappointed your grandma, and in order to make up for it, work hard and study hard and I am sure that she would be pleased to know that you have learnt from your bad experience;

 Your Questions About Ways To Make Money At Home For Kids 
 Posted on June 30, 2012 by Nagesh 
 

Donna asks…
 
I want to be a stay at home mom, but I need money. What is a good way of doing that?

I’ve been job hunting for the past 8 months and its not working for me!! I cant find a job, because I dont meet their needs. These places want you to have open availability and they dont care about your home situations as long as their business is going right. I cant work for them because I’m a single mom of 2 kids . And I dont have people to keep my kids for me. Yes they are in school and day care but thats Monday thru Friday between 7-6pm but most hours offered for a job dont work with my availability. So now I’m stuck!! My kids come first point blank, but I need to make money ! I’ve tried some of those make money quick things, but all they’ve done was take my money . So what do I do? If there is any one out here that has any suggestions, please let me know.

Thanx in advance;-)
 
Nagesh answers:

1. Their father needs to be paying child support and alimony if appropiate.

2. Start a business, doing from home, what you know how to do best. Something you are good at, that people will pay for.

3. If #2 does not apply, go find something at the library, learn something.

4. If you are not sure, ask people what they need and want and would pay for, then do, produce and deliver it.

5. Stay away from all the work at home and MLM scams. Always deliver what you promise, and don’t do anything you think is unethical, immoral, illegal, or even questionable.

6. Involve the children, have them help you out, after their school assignments are up-to-date.

PS: That healthandwealthalways outfit and the Premier Designs company looks pretty questionable to me. Never pay a company to work for them. Why? Because it is very stupid.

PSS: I just found out that Premier Designs Jewelry charges $395 to become a distributor. They want you to pay them $395 to sell costume jewelry for them.

Ways to make money for kids?

I 11 years old and I want to make money for the new Ipod 4 gen. Ways to make money in the summer for Kids ? Mostly Home and Outside. I am good at sports. Especially with basketball.
 
Nagesh answers:

You may be a tiny bit young but are there any ways you could help coach younger children with their basketball?

Other options are
- jobs for neighbours such as painting fences, washing cars, walking dogs. Make a leaflet and post it around your road saying you want to earn the money yourself and it may persuade them to help you out.
- check out maybe doing a paper round–not sure what the age limit is.
- ask if your parents/relatives will pay you to do jobs etc.

That’s all I’ve got, you sound very mature though, so good luck!

If you don’t have suggestion please do not response .i don’t need any judgment from anyone
 
Nagesh answers:

I understand. It’s hard to be home all the time with our kids and no adult interaction. The way things used to be in small towns and communities, women with kids would talk to their neighbors or friends. Now we sit at home and go on internet sites like this one so we can feel like we have an adult mind as well. I think we do need interaction with other adults, but it doesn’t have to be at work. I have a couple of suggestions. Join a mom’s group. My town has one and we get together at eachother’s houses or the community park for play time. It’s a good way to meet other moms and while you’re chatting and having a cup of coffee, the kids are playing. It’s a whole lot better than hours a day on the internet. I end up feeling more anxious and isolated doing that. Joining a group like that could help you meet other moms. I met a few moms that way and we’d occasionally babysit for one another. That might allow you to get out and do a little volunteer work or something that would help you feel productive. Maybe walk dogs at a shelter once a week, or work at a food bank a couple of hours. Don’t let the moms who practice“competitive parenting”, you know the ones who are sooo happy (they aren’t) and want you to feel bad because you want to live your life a little differently make you feel bad. We all need adult friendships!
