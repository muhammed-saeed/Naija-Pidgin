I Don&apos;t Care If We&apos;Re There Yet: The Backseat Boredom Buster

Synopsis

Children love being on holiday or visiting friends and family - it&apos;s just the boring hours travelling on the plane, train, bus, or car that they hate. But even long journeys will fly by with this jam-packed collection of activities. In fact, it will keep kids so busy they won&apos;t even care when they get there! All kinds of puzzles, personality quizzes, brainteasers, writing and drawing prompts, and word and board games entertain a single kid or a large group. The fun goes way beyond the usual: do scavenger hunts for speeding cars, funny signs and roadside animals, and fold fast-food restaurant napkins into origami creatures. All that&apos;s required is a pencil, pen, or a few markers. With so many great things to do, getting there just might be the best part of the trip!
