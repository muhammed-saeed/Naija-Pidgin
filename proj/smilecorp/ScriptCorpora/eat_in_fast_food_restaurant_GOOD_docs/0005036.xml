 VIDEO: Communication after an earthquake 
 
 
SALT LAKE CITY—In preparing for a natural disaster we talk a lot about the need for food storage, but sometimes we forget to talk about the other end of that. In a disaster, your toilet and sewer system just may not work.
Your backup plan? A self-contained portable toilet.
To make one, start by purchasing a 5 gallon bucket at your local grocery store and a special lid from an emergency supply store. The lid has a seat that attaches to it, and you can line the inside with a plastic garbage bag.
You also want to make sure your kit has some rolls of toilet paper in a plastic zipper bag as well as a container of kitty litter, which you can sprinkle in after you have done your business.
Last, but not least, make sure you include hand sanitizer in your kit.
When you&apos;re done, simply tie up the bag and throw it in the garbage.

Shakeout website .
