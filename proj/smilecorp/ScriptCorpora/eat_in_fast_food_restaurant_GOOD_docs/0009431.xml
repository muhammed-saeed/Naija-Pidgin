Cashier
 Jobs
 Being a great cashier Cashier - (City withheld for privacy), North Carolina, United States I have been a cashier for various fast food restaurants and department stores. Salary usually starts at minimum, but is usually dependent on experience. I was a manager for a restaurant and we based salary on experience. Those who learned quickly and did their job well were given raises quickly. Posted in Dream Job on 5 Dec 2008 Pay Rate Cashier - (City withheld for privacy), Hawaii, United States I think that i am under pay because i have all this experience background. All new associates that recently got hired before the holidays were getting $10.40 an hour, and it&apos;s just so unfair that i was started out at a rate of $8.40 in 2004. So now for 2 years of working for this company, i am only making $9.60 an hour. Posted in Fair Pay on 21 Jan 2007 Success in the job-market Cashier - (City withheld for privacy), Illinois, United States First of all, you need to have the knowledge and the patience it takes to be a good cashier. When you work with the public, you must know how to carry on a polite,but yet professional conversation with every customer you deal with. If you cannot deal with people in general, then you should not be working as a cashier. Posted in Job Search on 7 Jan 2007
