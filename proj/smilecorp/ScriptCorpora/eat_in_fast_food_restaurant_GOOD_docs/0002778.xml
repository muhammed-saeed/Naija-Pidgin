 APRIL 27-MAY 6, 1863.--The Chancellorsville Campaign. 
 No. 241.--Report of Lieut. Col. William G. Le Due, Chief Quartermaster,
Eleventh Army Corps. 
 &lt;ar39_632&gt; 
                                                            OFFICE OF CHIEF QUARTERMASTER, 11TH ARMY CORPS, 
                                                            In Camp, near Brooke&apos;s Station, May 8, 1863. 
 GENERAL: By your order of April 28, conveyed through Capt. F. A.
Dessauer, I parked the trains of the Eleventh Corps at the junction of
the Berea and Hartwood roads. Supplies for troops and trains were drawn
from Stoneman&apos;s Switch, and kept constantly on hand and forwarded according
to your orders. At no time was there less than five days&apos; forage on hand
to send forward for issue. 
        On the 29th of April,
1 caused to be arrested one Bensinger, a sutler (of the Eighty-second Ohio,
I believe), for selling whisky in camp, and found him guilty, and fined
him $100, and to be driven from the camp. Also, a teamster was found guilty
of making a row by bringing into camp (from Stoneman&apos;s Switch) and selling
one canteen of whisky. He was fined $30. 
        The provost-guard of
convalescents, under the very efficient supervision of Lieutenant [Dominicus]
Klutsch, were extremely useful to me in maintaining order, guarding the
ammunition trains, performing picket duty, arresting stragglers, and aiding
and assisting the wounded who were able to travel or were brought to the
camp in wagons. Four hundred and seventy-nine wounded and sick from the
front were fed and forwarded to the hospital--216 on foot and 263 by ambulances
and spring wagons. Eighty-four stragglers were arrested, 34 of whom were
sent to the provost-marshal-general, at Falmouth; 30 were sent back to
their regiments; 20 were kept in custody. Fifty-eight musicians were sent
to the hospital to nurse the sick and wounded. 
        On the 6th, at 3 a.m.,
having received your order, I broke camp, and marched by way of Stoneman&apos;s
Switch to the old headquarters near Brooke&apos;s Station, about dark of the
6th. The transportation of the corps is ready for service. A few mules
have been lost and some horses, but not enough to materially interfere
with active and efficient operations. 
    Respectfully submitted. 
                                                            WM. G. LE DUC, 
                                                                    Lieu tenant- Colonel and Chief Quartermaster, 11th Army Corps. 
                                                            Major-General HOWARD. 
 
 O.R.--SERIES I--VOLUME XXVII/1 [S# 43] -- Gettysburg Campaign 
 No. 261. -- Report of Lieut. Col. David Thomson, 
 Eighty-second Ohio Infantry. 
 [ar43_744 con&apos;t] 
                                                            NEAR WARRENTON JUNCTION, VA., 
                                                            August 21, 1863. 
 SIR: In compliance with your order, I have the honor to submit the
following report of the operations of this regiment at the battle of Gettysburg,
and from that time to July 25, the date of our encampment near Warrenton
Junction, Va.: 
        On July 1 last, this
regiment, numbering 312 men present for duty, under the command of Col.
James S. Robinson, and forming part of the Second Brigade, was assigned
a position on the left of that brigade during the battle of that day, in
the north of the town. By command of Colonel Robinson, the regiment fell
back through Gettysburg with the remainder of the forces of the Third Division.
Upon entering the town, Colonel Robinson was severely wounded, when I took
command of the regiment. On arriving on the ground in front of the cemetery
building, I was ordered to take a position near. I placed the regiment
west of and near that building, where I remained during that day and until
the evening of July 5, when we left Gettysburg, and marched with the Second
Brigade until we arrived near Hagerstown, Md., on July 11, the regiment
then numbering 220 present for duty. 
        During the battle, the
regiment lost 4 officers killed, 2 mortally wounded (since died), 12 wounded,
and 2 taken prisoners. Total loss of officers, 20. The loss in enlisted
men was 13 killed, 10 mortally wounded, 61 wounded, and 77 missing. Total
loss of enlisted men, 161. 
        The regiment remained
near Hagerstown, Md., until July 14, when it was transferred to the First
Brigade, under your command. Since then we have marched with the First
Brigade from Hagerstown, Md., to Warrenton Junction, Va., where we arrived
July 25, near 5 p.m. The strength of the regiment upon its arrival at the
latter place was 224 present for duty. 
        I am, general, very respectfully,
your obedient servant, 
                                                            D. THOMSON, 
                                                                    Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Regiment. 
                                                            Brigadier-General TYNDALE, 
                                                                    Comdg. First Brigade, Third Division, Eleventh Corps.

 MARCH 28, 1864.--Scouts to Caperton&apos;s Ferry, Ala. 
 Report of Col. James S. Robinson, Eighty-second Ohio Infantry, commanding
brigade. 
 &lt;ar57_644&gt; 
                                                            HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., THIRD DIV., ELEVENTH CORPS, 
                                                            March 28, 1864. 
 CAPTAIN: A patrol from the First Alabama Cavalry, which returned
at 5 p.m. on yesterday, reported themselves to have been driven back from
Caperton&apos;s Ferry to Island Creek by a detachment of about 50 rebel cavalry.
They declared that they exchanged shots with scattering bushwhackers near
the house of one Caperton, adjoining the ferry, and that the enemy suddenly
afterward appeared in such numbers as to compel the retreat of the cavalry. 
        Upon receipt of this
news I immediately dispatched a detachment of 10 men and a lieutenant of
the Second Kentucky Cavalry, with orders to patrol the road as far as Island
Creek and farther, &apos;if found to be safe, and to return about daylight.
This patrol returned at 7 a.m. this morning. The lieutenant commanding
reported that he went as far as within 4 miles of Caperton&apos;s Ferry without
seeing the enemy, and that he could not learn that they had been in the
vicinity during the previous day, thus partly contradicting the story of
the Alabama cavalry patrol. 
        At 9 a.m. this morning
I sent out a second detachment from the Second Kentucky Cavalry, with orders
to go as far as Caperton&apos;s Ferry (if found to be safe) and ascertain the
truth as to the presence of the enemy in that vicinity. I had also previous
to that hour sent a mounted patrol from the First Alabama Cavalry to scour
the country and co-operate with an infantry patrol from the One hundred
and first Illinois. 
        At 12.30 p.m. cannonading
was heard down the river, which I finally ascertained to be one of Brigadier-General
Geary&apos;s batteries shelling a small party of 4 or 5 of the seen from that
side of enemy the river below the point of the island. The cannonading
continued at intervals for half an hour. 
        I have sent out a reconnoitering
party of six companies, 125 men, under Lieut. Col. D. Thomson, of the Eighty-second
Ohio, with orders to ascertain the truth with reference to the various
and contradicting rumors which have been received. 
        I respectfully request
authority to send a strong detachment of infantry to Caperton&apos;s Ferry to-morrow,
having had information from various sources that the enemy has a picket
at that point. 
        Very respectfully, your
obedient servant, 
                                                            J. S. ROBINSON, 
                                                                    Colonel, Commanding Brigade. 
                                                            Capt. EUGENE WIEGEL,

 MAY 1-SEPTEMBER 8, 1864.--The Atlanta (Georgia) Campaign. 
 No. 195.--Report of Col. James S. Robinson, Eighty-second Ohio Infantry,
commanding Third Brigade, of operations May 1-July 24. 
 [ar73_84 con&apos;t] 
                                                            HDQRS. THIRD BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, 20TH CORPS, 
                                                            Near Atlanta, Ga., July 24, 1864. 
 CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report of the field
movements and operations of my command since the 1st of May, 1864: 
        On the 2d day of the
month just named the command of this brigade devolved upon me from the
hands of Brigadier-General Tyndale, &lt;ar73_85&gt; who had received
a leave of absence on account of illness. On the same date the brigade
marched from Bridgeport, Ala., where it was then stationed, to join the
remainder of the division at White-side&apos;s, Tenn. The latter point was reached
during the ensuing evening, and the brigade for the first time met its
associate brigades of the new organization, known as the First Division,
Twentieth Army Corps. The brigade, as at that time organized, consisted
of the following regiments: Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers, commanded
by Col. Stephen J. McGroarty; Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteers, Lieut.
Col. David Thomson; One hundred and forty-third New York Volunteers, Col.
Horace Boughton; Forty-fifth New York Veteran Volunteers, Col. Adolphus
Dobke; One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers, Lieut. Col. John B. Le
Sage; Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers, Lieut. Col. Edward S. Salomon.
The march was continued from Whiteside&apos;s on the 3d, and was pursued without
being marked by any event especially important until the arrival of my
command with the remainder of the division at Trickum Post-Office, on the
East Chickamauga, May 7. Here the brigade was rejoined by the Sixty-first
Ohio Veteran Volunteers, which regiment had been absent on veteran furlough
since the 13th of March, 1864. The command marched again from the Trickum
Post-Office at midnight of the 10th, and arrived at Sugar Valley, at the
mouth of Snake Creek Gap, on the 12th. On the 13th the command was pushed
forward toward Resaca, and during the afternoon formed line of battle and
assisted in building a line of intrenchments near Camp Creek. On the 14th
the position was shifted one mile farther to the left, where the entire
division was held in reserve of the division of General Butterfield until
4.30 p.m. At that hour I was directed by the brigadier-general commanding
division to move my brigade by the left flank and lead the division in
marching toward the Dalton road, near which at that time the Fourth Corps
was engaging the enemy. By 6.30 p.m. the head of my column reached a high
wooded ridge, overlooking a narrow open valley, along which extended the
main road leading to Dalton. On the farther side of the valley was another
thickly wooded hill, and upon a slight knoll in the open field at our feet
stood the Fifth Indiana Battery, supported by a portion of Stanley&apos;s division,
of the Fourth Corps. The division itself was at that time engaging the
enemy some distance beyond the farther end of the valley, and from the
character of the firing it was evident that General Stanley&apos;s lines were
falling back; in fact that they were giving way in some disorder. By direction
of General Williams I immediately formed my brigade in line of battle along
the crest of the ridge parallel to and overlooking the valley. I had four
regiments in front and two in rear, thus forming two lines, one in support
of the other. In my first line were the One hundred and first Illinois,
Eighty-second Illinois, and the One hundred and forty-third and Forty-fifth
New York Volunteers, and in the second the Sixty-first and Eighty-second
Ohio Volunteers. I had hardly gotten my command into position until the
enemy swarmed out of the woods in pursuit of Stanley&apos;s men, and with defiant
yells made for the battery, the infantry support of which immediately fled.
The enemy came confidently on, apparently unaware of our presence. He was
rapidly nearing the battery, when I was directed by the brigadier-general
commanding division to precipitate my entire command into the valley, and,
wheeling it upon the right flank, bring it up to the support&lt;ar73_86&gt;
of the battery. This order was at once communicated to the regiments of
my brigade, and in a moment the whole was in motion. The evolution was
executed with enthusiasm and with no less precision and regularity of movement
than might have been expected upon drill. Arriving at the front of the
battery the Eighty-second Illinois, Sixty-first Ohio, and One hundred and
forty-third New York Volunteers poured a tremendous fire upon the overconfident
foe. The One hundred and first Illinois was directed to move at once upon
the hill on the left, now in possession of the enemy. That gallant regiment
at once advanced in perfect order to the crest and drove from it the enemy&apos;s
skirmishers. Meeting with such severe and unexpected resistance, the enemy
at once gave way and confusedly sought his intrenchments back in the woods.
The troops now bivouacked in line of battle, and remained in the position
thus taken up until 12 m. of the following day. At that time I was directed
by General Williams to march my brigade, following that of Brigadier-General
Ruger, down the Dalton road. After proceeding about half a mile, and having
entered the dense forest covering the enemy&apos;s position, I was ordered by
the brigadier-general commanding division to form my brigade on the left
of the road in line of battle, the regiments being in column. Butterfield&apos;s
and Geary&apos;s divisions had already actively engaged the enemy, and the firing
upon my right had grown severe. Upon further consultation with General
Williams, I moved my brigade to the crest of the hill in front of the line
then occupied, and directly afterward moved my command forward half a mile
and placed it in position on the left of General Ruger&apos;s brigade, and upon
the left flank of the division, and in fact the left flank of the army.
My brigade was formed in two lines, the One hundred and first Illinois
and the One hundred and forty-third New York Volunteers, deployed, composing
the first, and the Sixty-first Ohio, Eighty-second Ohio, Forty-fifth New
York, and Eighty-second Illinois the second line, supporting the two regiments
of General Ruger&apos;s brigade, and the two regiments of my own brigade deployed
in the front line. My first line rested along the base of a slight declivity.
Shortly after my brigade was thus formed, I was directed by General Williams
to send a regiment to support the battery of Captain Woodbury, which had
been placed in position upon a wooded hill some distance to the rear. I
immediately dispatched the Forty-fifth New York Veteran Volunteers, which
regiment remained with the battery until the morning of the 16th. At about
5 p.m. the enemy was discovered to be massing his troops in the forest
that skirted the farther side of the open field in my front. I immediately
moved the Eighty-second Ohio to the crest of the slope, and stationed it
behind the breast-works immediately in rear and support of the One hundred
and fiftieth New York Volunteers, of Ruger&apos;s brigade. The One hundred and
first Illinois Volunteers was then deployed and formed in continuation
of the line on the left of the One hundred and fiftieth New York Volunteers.
The One hundred and forty-third New York Volunteers was next deployed and
formed on the left of the One hundred and first Illinois. The two latter
regiments were unsheltered by any species of breast-works or other obstacle
to the fire of the enemy. The dispositions just described had been hardly
made until the enemy boldly emerged from the woods and began the attack.
He at once opened a heavy fire of musketry, which was repaid with interest.
He had not advanced far into the open field&lt;ar73_87&gt; until his progress
was checked by the sweeping fire which was poured upon him. In about twenty
minutes his lines, broken and confused, withdrew to the woods, and the
firing ceased. The Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers was now deployed and
placed in the position previously occupied by the One hundred and fiftieth
New York Volunteers, which regiment was relieved. The Sixty-first Ohio
Veteran Volunteers was also deployed and kept in hand ready to strengthen
whatever might prove to be the weakest point. These dispositions were no
sooner made than the enemy again advanced to the attack. He came forward
with a reckless desperation, which indicated a determination to break our
line at every hazard. But his rash purposes were doomed to the same signal
failure as before. He approached in heavy and well sustained force within
seventy-five yards of my line, when the fire of musketry became so destructive
that he again hastily withdrew, leaving dead and wounded, hundreds of small-arms,
and about 20 prisoners in our hands. It was now 6.30 p.m. No further attack
was made upon my lines during the evening or night. On the ensuing morning,
it being discovered that the enemy had withdrawn, I sent out my pioneer
corps to bury the dead of the enemy in front of my line. The officer in
charge of the corps afterward reported that he buried 85 dead rebels, including
5 commissioned officers, in front of the brigade. The march in pursuit
of the retreating enemy was begun at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 16th.
My command crossed the Connesauga River above Resaca at 1 p.m., and encamped
on the right bank of the Coosawattee at 6 p.m. The march was pursued on
the 17th as far as to a point four miles east of Calhoun. On the 18th the
brigade resumed its march, and arrived at 9.30 p.m. at a point near Spring
Mills, and six miles east of Adairsville. At 1 p.m. on the 19th the march
was continued as far as Two-Run Creek. Here the enemy&apos;s cavalry and flankers
were encountered at 4 p.m., and the brigade was immediately formed in battle
order. By direction of General Williams, and under the personal superintendence
of Lieutenant-Colonel Asmussen, of General Hooker&apos;s staff, I advanced my
brigade in two lines, one in support of the other, at 5 p.m. The troops
moved steadily forward over steep hills and through tangled forests and
marshes, compelling the enemy to remove his light artillery and cavalry
and fall back upon his infantry supports. The latter were encountered in
strong force near the village of Cassville just at dusk. My command closed
up well upon the enemy and threw up a breastwork under cover of the darkness.
The rebel forces withdrew during the night, and on the following day I
encamped my brigade in the suburbs of Cassville. 
        On the 23d of May active
operations were resumed, the brief repose permitted to the army having
expired. My command marched from Cassville at 5 a.m., and at 2 p.m. crossed
the Etowah River near Euharlee Mills. On the 24th the brigade marched by
mountain paths and by-ways to Burnt Hickory, where it encamped at 4 p.m.
On the morning of the 25th the Forty-fifth New York Volunteers, was, by
order of General Williams, detached from the brigade to guard the division
ammunition train. (This regiment remained thus detached until June 28,
and, therefore, participated in none of the subsequent operations and engagements
of the brigade up to the latter date.) At 6 a.m. my command marched from
Burnt Hickory and crossed the Pumpkin Vine Creek about noon. Shortly after
passing this stream, and while the column was marching on the&lt;ar73_88&gt;
main road to Dallas, and was about three miles distant from that place,
I was suddenly ordered by General Williams to face my command about and
march it to the relief of General Geary&apos;s division, which, I was informed,
had encountered the enemy. I quickly reversed the direction of the march,
and my brigade, having been the rear of the division, now led the advance.
Recrossing Pumpkin Vine Creek, the column moved up that stream about two
miles, then crossing it ascended a high wooded ridge, and continued the
march along its crest. At 5 p.m. my brigade came up with Geary&apos;s division,
and immediately formed in line of battle preparatory to an advance against
the enemy. The Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers was deployed as skirmishers,
covering the brigade front. The other four regiments, viz, the One hundred
and forty-third New York Volunteers, Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteers,
One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers, and Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers,
formed
the main line from right to left, in the order named. My brigade was supported
by Brigadier-General Ruger&apos;s command. Everything being ready the signal
to advance was given, the troops moved forward, and the action opened immediately.
My troops, I am happy to say, moved with great steadiness, and there was
not the least sign of hesitation or wavering. The enemy&apos;s skirmishers were
compelled to withdraw precipitately, and some of them were taken prisoners.
The brigade moved steadily forward for a distance of about one mile, when
it was, by order of General Williams, relieved by the brigade of General
Ruger. My regiments retired by the left of companies, permitting General
Ruger&apos;s to pass through, then reformed in line of battle. The fight continued
about one-half hour longer, when General Ruger&apos;s ammunition getting low,
the general commanding the division directed that my brigade go again to
the front. The troops of my command instantly advanced to the front line
and reopened their fire. The enemy swept the line with shell and canister
in addition to the musketry, thus occasioning many fearful gaps in the
ranks, but not the loss to us of one inch of ground. The already depleted
cartridge-boxes of my men were soon emptied of their remaining contents,
and the boxes of the wounded and dead were resorted to. The ammunition
thus obtained enabled the troops to maintain their fire until, under cover
of the darkness, they were relieved. Some of my regiments went to the rear
with scarcely a single cartridge remaining. During the night the troops
rested upon their arms a few hundred yards in rear of the front line. They
remained in this position during the 26th and 27th. On the 28th, having
been directed by General Williams to report with my command to the officer
having charge of the ordnance train of the army headquarters, to escort
the same to Kingston and return, my brigade marched at daylight and reached
Pumpkin Vine Creek, where the train was to be collected at 6 a.m. Much
time was consumed in unloading and preparing the wagons, and the march
could not be resumed until about 1 p.m. Stilesborough was reached on the
28th and Kingston at 3.30 p.m. of the 29th. The train was immediately loaded
with ordnance, subsistence, and sanitary stores, and at 7 a.m. of the 30th
was on its march back to the front. The entire command reached Burnt Hickory
early on the morning of the 31st. Here the ammunition was shifted to another
train and my brigade, having completed its duty as escort, rejoined the
division at the point where it had left it, at 6.30 p.m. &lt;ar73_89&gt; 
        On the 1st of June, the
army having commenced its movements to the left, my brigade marched four
miles in that direction. On the 2d the movement was continued one mile
farther, and my command formed a line of battle on the left of Carlin&apos;s
brigade, Fourteenth Army Corps, and threw up a line of breast-works. The
brigade remained in this position on the 3d and 4th, keeping a strong line
of skirmishers in front, which engaged the enemy both day and night. On
the 5th, being relieved by Mitchell&apos;s brigade, of Davis&apos; division, Fourteenth
Army Corps, the movement to the left was resumed. At 3 p.m. my command
encamped near the junction of the Acworth and Marietta roads five miles
from Acworth. On the 6th the brigade marched again, and after proceeding
about three miles, formed in line of battle, and threw up a line of breast-works.
This position was changed during the afternoon, and a new line of breast-works
built at a point on the Sandtown road two and a half miles north of Lost
Mountain. The position of the brigade remained substantially the same until
the 15th. On that date, a general advance being made, the line was thrown
forward two miles on the Sandtown road. General Geary&apos;s division, having
encountered the enemy, and become engaged with him in his trenches, General
Williams directed me to support him with my brigade. I moved my command
in line of battle up to within a few yards of Geary&apos;s line, and, as ordered
by General Williams, constructed a breast-work under cover of the darkness
of the evening. On the 16th, being relieved by Geary s troops, I was ordered
to withdraw my command a few hundred yards, which was accordingly done. 
        Early on the morning
of the 17th my brigade joined in the pursuit of the enemy, who had abandoned
his works during the previous night. The advance continued about one and
a half miles, when the enemy was again discovered in a strongly fortified
position. The picket became immediately engaged with him, and the brigade
formed a new line of battle, which was at once strengthened by breast-works.
The position thus taken remained unchanged during the 18th. During the
night, however, the enemy abandoned works of immense strength, and which,
if not impregnable, seemed to have at least exhausted the last resources
of military science and human ingenuity to make them so. My brigade marched
in the pursuit on the morning of the 19th and went into position in front
of the enemy near Kenesaw Mountain at I p.m. Active skirmishing immediately
began, which resulted in the killing and wounding of several men of my
command. At 7 a.m. on the 20th the brigade marched to the right, and at
7 p.m. encamped in line of battle on Atkinson&apos;s plantation. On the 21st
my line was strengthened by breast-works, the position remaining otherwise
unchanged. At 10.30 a.m. on the 22d my brigade advanced about one mile
directly to the front and went into position on the left of General Knipe&apos;s
brigade on the crest of a high wooded hill. The troops were concealed by
the timber. My line overlooked an open field and hollow about 1,000 yards
in width, on the farther side of which the rebel skirmish line was plainly
visible. There was no serious demonstration in my immediate front, and
no movement of my command until 5.30 p.m. About that time the enemy, having
massed his forces under the concealment of the woods, suddenly debouched
from the timber and advanced to assault the hill occupied by my brigade.
General Knipe, on my right, had already become heavily engaged, and the
enemy&apos;s masses, preceded by a strong skirmish line, came boldly forward, &lt;ar73_90&gt; apparently bent upon carrying my position at every hazard. As directed
by General Williams, I marched my brigade out of the woods, formed it in
line of battle along the brow of the hill, and made all possible preparations
to receive the enemy&apos;s expected onslaught. Lieutenant Winegar&apos;s battery
(I), of the First New York Artillery, which was supported by my line, opened
a vigorous fire as soon as the enemy began to advance and plunged so well
directed and rapid a fire of shell against his masses that they soon became
checked and confused, and were finally compelled to withdraw. In the mean
time, General Knipe&apos;s line being dangerously pressed, I was directed by
General Williams to send one of my regiments to form on the left flank
of that brigade, to prevent the enemy from turning it. I immediately dispatched
the Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers with directions to report to General
Knipe and remain with his command subject to his orders. During the battle
this regiment suffered considerably. Excepting this, my brigade, not being
much engaged, suffered but little, and that chiefly from the enemy&apos;s shells.
The fight substantially ceased at sundown, and as soon as safe to do so,
I strengthened my line with breast-works. The enemy, repulsed at all points,
retired, and the battle subsided into the irregular firing of the pickets.
The position of my brigade remained unchanged until the 3d of July. On
the 27th of June it was held in readiness to participate in the assault
then made upon the enemy&apos;s works, but was not moved from its intrenchments.
During the night of July 2 the enemy again retreated, leaving his fortifications
in our front vacant; at 7 a.m. on the ensuing morning my command marched
inside of them. The pursuit was continued about five miles, when the brigade
was put in position in front of the enemy, who was again discovered strongly
intrenched. On the 4th the position was slightly changed, preparatory to
an anticipated advance, which, however, was not made. At 5 p.m. the command
moved one and a half miles to the right and encamped. On the morning of
the 5th it was discovered that the enemy had again retreated, and the troops
at once began the pursuing march. Passing through a broken and wooded country
by unfrequented roads and by-ways, the column came up with the enemy in
his fortifications on the right bank of the Chattahoochee River at 6 p.m.
The brigade was put in position along the summit of one of the series of
heights skirting the river and overlooking the city of Atlanta. On the
6th of July I received an order of Major-General Thomas transferring the
Forty-fifth New York Veteran Volunteers from the Third Brigade, First Division,
to the Fourth Division, Twentieth Corps, and directing that the Thirty-first
Wisconsin Volunteers, then at Nashville, Tenn., immediately report for
duty with my brigade. At noon of the same day my command marched from its
position on the height crowning the right bank of Nickajack Creek, and
crossing that stream, went into position again on the right of the Fourteenth
Corps. Here the troops threw up breast-works and otherwise strengthened
their line. No further event occurred to mark the history of the brigade,
until the night of the 9th, when the enemy disappeared from its front,
having retreated over the river. The position of my command remained the
same up to the 17th of July. On that day it marched in conjunction with
the other brigades of the division to Pace&apos;s Ferry and crossed the Chattahoochee
River at that point. On the 18th, in obedience to an order from General
Williams, I detailed the Eighty-second Ohio Veteran &lt;ar73_91&gt; Volunteers to accompany a reconnaissance, under Colonel Carman, of the
Thirteenth New Jersey Volunteers, to Island Creek. The reconnoitering party
encountered and engaged the enemy&apos;s cavalry early in the forenoon, but
no serious loss occurred to the regiment from my command·The brigade
marched at 2.30 p.m., and crossing Nancy&apos;s Creek, encamped near Buck Head.
Here it remained until the evening of the 19th, when it marched on the
road leading to Atlanta, and encamped at 8.30 p.m. on the north bank of
Peach Tree Creek·Early on the morning of the 20th my command crossed
Peach Tree Creek, and ascended the chain of hills skirting the left bank.
It being understood that the line was to be pushed forward and the enemy
pressed during the day, care was not taken to put the troops regularly
into position or to intrench the line. The picket was pushed forward far
enough to feel the enemy and discover his whereabouts. No special precaution
was taken against an attack, for none was anticipated·At 2 p.m.,
however, a heavy discharge of musketry was heard in the direction of General
Geary&apos;s division. The storm quickly rolled along toward the right, and
it became suddenly apparent that the enemy was advancing in heavy force.
Preparation was immediately made to meet him. At the instance of General
Williams, I marched my brigade by the right flank at double-quick time
along the crest of the hill, then formed in line of battle and moved a
short distance down the eastern face of the hill into the timber. This
movement was not fully executed when the enemy opened a heavy fire of musketry
upon my line, and received a similar compliment in return. The battle at
once grew fierce and bloody, a portion of my troops becoming mingled with
those of the enemy in an almost hand-to-hand conflict. The One hundred
and forty-third New York, Eighty-second Ohio, Sixty-first Ohio, and One
hundred and first Illinois Volunteers, being in my front line, bore the
brunt of the attack. The Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers was formed a
short distance in rear, and in support of the other regiments. The first
onslaught of the enemy was finally repulsed, and he sullenly withdrew a
short distance, still, however, maintaining a considerable fire. In the
mean time the battle grew very warm along General Knipe&apos;s line on my right.
I was directed by General Williams to send two regiments to re-enforce
General Knipe&apos;s brigade, and in compliance with the order at once dispatched
the One hundred and first and Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers. These
two regiments reported to General Knipe, and remained with his command
during the remainder of the battle. The fight continued to rage with irregular
fury until sundown, when the enemy, being repulsed at all points, withdrew
his forces. I regret to say that this sanguinary engagement cost my brigade
many valuable officers and men. It would be invidious to mention names
where all alike performed their part so nobly Never was the hardihood and
temper of my entire command more completely and thoroughly tested. The
battle was sprung upon it at an unexpected moment, and with a fury not
hitherto exceeded in the annals of the campaign. Yet officers and men sprang
with alacrity to the post of duty and danger, and met the shock of battle
with a courage, promptitude, and determination that ought to command the
most lasting and exalted admiration. On the 21st my brigade was joined
by the Thirty-first Wisconsin Volunteers, over 700 strong, from Nashville.
The position of the troops remained the same as on the evening of the previous
day, except that it was covered by a line of defensive works. On the 22d, &lt;ar73_92&gt; the enemy having fallen back during the night previous,
my command advanced one and a quarter miles directly toward Atlanta and
formed a new line, the right of which rested upon the road by which the
advance was made. A strong breast-work, covering the line, was immediately
constructed under fire of the enemy&apos;s artillery and sharpshooters. The
position thus assumed remained unchanged until the 24th instant, at which
date, owing to severe illness, I was compelled to request the brigadier-general
commanding division to relieve me temporarily from command. The request
was promptly granted, and Col. Horace Boughton, of the One hundred and
forty-third New York Volunteers, assumed command of the brigade. 
        I cannot close this report
without expressing my high appreciation of and sincere thanks for the gallantry,
ability, and hearty spirit of co-operation displayed by the commanders
of the regiments of my brigade throughout the period of my command. Their
names and regiments, to mention which affords me mingled pride and pleasure,
are as follows: Col. S. J. McGroarty, Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers;
Col. H. Boughton, One hundred and forty-third New York Volunteers; Col.
F. H. West, Thirty-first Wisconsin Volunteers; Lieut. Col. D. Thomson,
Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteers; Lieut. Col. E. S. Salomon, Eighty-second
Illinois Volunteers; Lieut. Col. J. B. Le Sage, One hundred and first Illinois
Volunteers, and Lieut. Col. A. Dobke, Forty-fifth New York Veteran Volunteers.
To the different members of my staff my hearty thanks are also due for
their willing and able performance of their arduous duties. To them all
I am deeply indebted, and shall hold in lasting remembrance their names,
which are as follows: Capt. F. S. Wallace, topographical engineer: Capt.

Infantry.

                                                            HDQRS. EIGTY-SECOND REGT. OHIO VET. VOL. INFTY., 
                                                            Atlanta, Ga., September 10, 1864. 
 SIR: In accordance with your order, I have the honor to submit the
following report of the part taken by the Eighty-second Regiment of Ohio
Veteran Volunteer Infantry during the campaign which has just ended with
the capture of Atlanta: 
        On the 2d day of May,
1864, the regiment, then encamped near Bridgeport, Ala., broke camp and
marched to Lookout Valley, Tenn., where it joined the Twentieth Corps,
or that portion encamped at that place. The regiment afterward marched
to Resaca and took part in the engagement near that place. Here Capt. William
J. Dickson, of Company B, who was at the time acting as major, was killed;
my command met with no other loss. On the 25th day of May the regiment
participated in the battle of Dallas, and met with a very severe loss;
11 enlisted men were killed and 53 wounded. On the 28th the Third Brigade,
of which the Eighty-second forms a part, was sent as an escort to the ordnance
train of the Twentieth Corps to Kingston, Ga. The train, after being loaded
with ammunition, returned to the front escorted by the Third Brigade, where
it arrived on the 1st day of June. From this date until the 22d day of
June the regiment was constantly skirmishing with the enemy; I enlisted
man was killed by a shell near Pine Mountain on the 16th day of June. On
the 22d day of June the Twentieth Corps advanced to near Kenesaw Mountain.
Here the First Division was attacked by the enemy before it had taken up
a
position. The enemy were, however, handsomely repulsed. My command lost
1 man killed and 3 wounded. The enemy having retreated from Kenesaw Mountain,
the Twentieth Corps again advanced on the 3d day of July. Constant skirmishing
was kept up with the enemy, who was still retreating slowly. On the 19th
of July &lt;ar73_111&gt; my command, together with the Thirteenth New
Jersey, was sent to find and make connection with the right of the Fourth
Corps. Both regiments were under the command of Colonel Carman, of the
Thirteenth New Jersey. We found the right of the Fourth Corps and rendered
material assistance to the skirmishers of General Wood&apos;s division of said
corps in driving back a strong force of the enemy. The next day, the 20th,
my command was again in the front and hotly engaged with the enemy, who
had attacked the Twentieth Corps in large force. My loss was heavy; 1 officer,
Lieut. Asa H. Gary, was killed; 11 enlisted men were killed and 45 wounded;
5 enlisted [men] were missing and it is thought were taken prisoners. On
21st my command moved to in front of Atlanta, where it built strong earth-works
under the constant fire of the enemy&apos;s guns. On the 28th day of August,
the Twentieth Corps having remained before Atlanta until that date, the
corps fell back to the Chattahoochee River, while the remainder of the
army moved to the right and engaged the enemy near Jonesborough. The regiment
remained at this point until the 2d day of September. The enemy having
evacuated the city, the Eighty-second was sent, together with the One hundred
and first Illinois Volunteers and General Knipe&apos;s brigade, to occupy and
hold the place. A portion of the Third Division, Twentieth Corps, occupied
the city the same day. 
        During the campaign the
regiment lost 2 officers killed, and also 30 enlisted men killed; 98 enlisted
men were wounded, of whom 9 have since died of their wounds. The officers
and men of my regiment deserve my thanks for the ready obedience they have
at all times yielded me. With a very few exceptions they have at all times
discharged their duty bravely and manfully. They have borne the long marches
and many fatigues and privations of the campaign without a murmur. 
        I am, captain, very respectfully, 
                                                            D. THOMSON, 
                                                                    Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Regiment. 
                                                            Capt. A. E. LEE, 
                                                                    Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

 No. 31.--Report of Col. James S. Robinson, Eighty-second Ohio Infantry,
commanding Third Brigade. 
 [ar77_659 con&apos;t] 
                                                            HDQRS. THIRD BRIG.. FIRST DIV., TWENTIETH CORPS, 
                                                            Near Savannah, Ga., December 28, 1864. 
 LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to submit the following report of the
services and operations of this brigade from the occupation of the city
of Atlanta down to the capture and occupation of Savannah: 
        On the 5th of September
the entire brigade was encamped near Atlanta, Ga., having marched to that
place from Montgomery&apos;s Ferry, on the Chattahoochee River, on the day previous.
At this time and up to the 27th, at which date I rejoined the brigade from
sick leave, it was commanded by Col. Horace Boughton, of the One hundred
and forty-third New York Volunteers. From this officer I have received
no report, and shall, therefore, limit myself to the time of actual command.
On the 28th, by order of Brig. Gen. A. S. Williams, commanding division,
I formally resumed command of the brigade. I found the troops at this time
in good health, with tidy, well-policed camps, and well supplied with clothing,
arms, and food. Daily drills in company and battalion tactics had been
established, under which exercise the troops seemed to be rapidly improving
in discipline and efficiency. 
        On the 4th of October
the Twentieth Corps having been charged with the sole occupation and defense
of Atlanta, a new chain of defenses around the city was commenced. A detail
of 7 officers and 350 men to work upon these fortifications was now required
from and daily furnished by my brigade. This work was continued, with but
little interruption, on the part of my command down to the 15th. On that
date the brigade was designated to accompany a foraging expedition consisting
of three brigades of infantry, a division of cavalry, a battery of &lt;ar77_660&gt; artillery, and 733 wagons sent out on the following day and to the command
of which I had the honor to be appointed. The infantry, the Third Brigade,
First Division, the Second Brigade, Second Division, and the Second Brigade,
Third Division; the artillery, Captain Sloan&apos;s battery, and the train under
charge of Capt. E. P. Graves, assistant quartermaster, rendezvoused on
the Decatur road at 6 a.m. The expedition marched at 6.30 a.m. and was
joined at l p.m. by Colonel Garrard&apos;s division of cavalry at Avery&apos;s Cross-Roads.
The head of the column encamped at Flat Shoals at 7 p.m., and by 10 p.m.
was joined by all the troops and trains. On the 17th, leaving the Third
Brigade of the First Division and two sections of artillery in Charge of
about 400 wagons at Flat Shoals, I took the remainder of the troops and
wagons and marched down the left bank of the South River in quest of forage.
Though the country was poor and unproductive, I succeeded in loading most
of the train by night-fall. On the following day, the 18th, leaving the
Second Brigade, Third Division, and two sections of artillery at Flat Shoals
in charge of the loaded wagons, with the remainder of the troops and wagons
I crossed South River. Here I found a country more fertile than that foraged
the day previous, and succeeded without difficulty in obtaining enough
corn to load the entire train. A slight resistance offered by the enemy&apos;s
cavalry was easily overcome without loss. The expedition at night-fall
rejoined in safety the detachment left at Flat Shoals, and on the next
day, the 19th, returned to Atlanta. The quantity of corn brought in amounted
to about 11,000 bushels. The troops obtained besides this a considerable
quantity of fresh beef, fresh pork, poultry, sweet potatoes, and other
species of provisions. The immediate command of my brigade during this
expedition was intrusted to Lieut. Col. E. S. Salomon, of the Eighty-second
Illinois Volunteers, who was the senior officer present. I take pleasure
in acknowledging the efficiency and zeal with which Lieutenant-Colonel
Salomon discharged the duty thus devolving upon him. On the 21st the work
on the fortifications was resumed by my brigade, which furnished a detail
of 200 men for that purpose. On the 24th this detail was reduced to 100
men. On the 25th I received an order to join with my brigade a foraging
expedition to be sent out on the following day under the command of Brigadier-General
Geary. According to directions, my command reported to General Geary on
the Decatur road at 6 a.m. on the 26th, and was assigned, in connection
with a battery of artillery, to the duty of covering the rear of the column.
Passing through Decatur at 11 a.m., my command reached Stone Mountain at
9.30 p.m. Early on the 27th, by General Geary&apos;s direction, I sent out two
regiments, the One hundred and first Illinois and Eighty-second Ohio Veteran
Volunteers, to assist in loading wagons with corn. They returned to camp
at 6.30 p.m., having succeeded, in spite of the very inclement weather
and prowling detachments of hostile cavalry, in loading 196 wagons. On
the 28th, by direction of General Geary, I proceeded with my brigade, a
section of artillery, a battalion of cavalry, and about 300 wagons, across
Yellow River in the direction of Lawrenceville. I found here a productive
country and had no difficulty in loading the entire train. My command returned
toward Berkshire at 3 p.m., crossing Yellow River upon a bridge which,
though partly burned by the enemy the day previous, was nevertheless easily
rendered passable for the train. The column reached Berkshire at sundown
and pushed forward, following the remainder of the expedition, which had
already preceded us on its return march. Reached Stone Mountain at 10.30
p.m., and encamped three miles beyond Stone Mountain Station&lt;ar77_661&gt;
at about midnight. On the following day my brigade formed the vanguard
of the expedition and returned without accident to its encampment at Atlanta.
During this expedition my brigade secured about 6,000 bushels of corn,
besides the usual amount of provisions and other promiscuous articles.
On the 30th orders were issued to send all surplus baggage to the rear,
and such preparations began to be made as clearly indicated the approach
of a great movement. No further work was done on the fortifications, and
all attention was given to putting the command in the best possible condition
to march. 
        On the 5th of November,
at 1 p.m., I received an unexpected order to move my brigade immediately.
In a very short space of time the column was moving out the McDonough road,
every one supposing this to be the initial step of the campaign, but the
sequel proved otherwise. Proceeding about three miles the troops bivouacked
for the night, and on the following day marched back to their camps near
the city. The payment of my command, which had been but partially completed,
was now continued. On the 8th the Presidential election was held in those
regiments entitled by law to vote. On the 9th, at daybreak, a violent cannonade
suddenly broke out on the southeastern side of the city. The cause of this
was hardly comprehended, but it soon became apparent that a hostile force,
either great or small, had appeared in front of our works. The firing soon
shifted to our right, in front of General Geary&apos;s division, and began to
be mingled with musketry; my brigade was soon afterward ordered to move
to the support of General Geary, whose lines were reported as being dangerously
threatened. In a few minutes my column was in motion down White Hall street,
the troops keeping step to the martial bands, and the colors floating in
the breeze. I had hardly reached the suburbs of the town, however, when
I was informed by Major-General Slocum, that the enemy, about ---- in number,
under the rebel General Iverson, had been driven off, and that my brigade
would not be needed, and might return to its camp. I thereupon countermarched
my column and moved it back to its old position. Excepting the changes
incident to the reorganization of the army, no further event of importance
transpired until the 14th, when the final marching orders were received.(*) 
        Respectfully, your obedient
servant,

 CAPTAIN: In compliance with circular from headquarters First Division,
Twentieth Corps, I have the honor to submit the following report of the
part taken by my command in the various foraging expeditions sent out from
Atlanta, and also in the recent campaign: 
        The Eighty-second Regiment
formed a part of the advance force which occupied Atlanta on the 2d day
of September, and at that time was temporarily attached to the command
of Brigadier-General Knipe. The First Division, of which the Eighty-Second
Regiment formed a part, remained encamped in Atlanta from the time of its
occupation by our forces until the 15th of November. The enemy having interrupted
our line of communication with the rear, various foraging expeditions were
sent out south of Atlanta for the purpose of procuring forage and provisions.
The brigade to which the regiment is attached was sent out on two of these
expeditions, the first expedition under command of Colonel Robinson, commanding
Third Brigade, First Division, and the second under command of Brigadier-General
Geary. On these expeditions the regiment loaded 540 wagons of corn and
provender; in addition the following supplies: 50 bushels potatoes, 25
head of hogs, 15 head of sheep, 6 head of cattle, and 20 gallons of molasses. 
        Early on the morning
of the 9th of November the enemy, in small force, made an attack on our
picket-line south of Atlanta. The Third Brigade was sent to the attacked
point, but before getting into position the enemy were repulsed, and the
brigade returned to its encampment.(*) 
        I am, captain, very respectfully, 
                                                            D. THOMSON,

                                                            Near Savannah, Ga., December 28, 1864. 
 LIEUTENANT :(*) 
        On the 15th [November],
at 7 a.m., my brigade filed out of its encampments and made its final exit
from the city of Atlanta. Behind us all means of communication and supply
had been utterly destroyed, and the town itself was a blazing ruin, abandoned
alike by citizens and &lt;ar92_253&gt; soldiers to the harsh fortunes
of war. Before us lay a vast stretch of country, containing no organized
army, yet thoroughly infested with enemies clear to its natural boundary,
the ocean. There was nothing left for us to rely upon but ourselves, our
leader, and the God of battles. Moving out on the Decatur road, my brigade
passed the village of Decatur at 2 p.m. Our first day&apos;s march terminated
near Stone Mountain, about fifteen miles from Atlanta. Early on the morning
of the 16th I was directed by General Jackson, commanding division, to
take my brigade and commence destroying the Georgia railroad at a point
about half a mile beyond my encampment. Extending my brigade along the
track, I succeeded in thoroughly destroying about two miles of it by the
a.m. After this was accomplished, having been assigned as rear guard of
the corps, my command awaited the passage of the troops and trains. This
was not completed until 5 p.m.,at which hour my brigade marched from Stone
Mountain. My column crossed Stone Mountain Creek at 10 and Yellow River
at 11.30 p.m. It encamped on the left bank of Yellow River, near Rock Bridge
Post-Office, about midnight, having marched about seven miles. My brigade,
still the rear guard of the corps, marched from its camp near Rock Bridge
at noon on the 17th. It crossed No Business Creek at 1, Big Haynes Creek
at 5, and Little Haynes Creek, at Summers&apos; Mills, at 7 p.m. My column was
greatly detained by the trains, which moved very slowly, owing to the heavy
loads carried in the wagons and the difficult places in the road. My command
did not get into camp until one hour after midnight, when it reached a
point near Flat Creek. The distance marched on this day was about thirteen
miles. My brigade marched, following the Second Brigade of the First Division,
and charged with the protection of about 100 wagons, at 8 a.m. on the 18th;
it passed Alcovy Mountain at 11, and crossed Alcovy or Ulcofauhachee River
at 11.30 a.m. At 1.30 p.m. it reached Social Circle, on the Georgia railroad.
Here it emerged into a fine, level, open country with a good road which
enabled us to move along briskly. At 8 p.m. my command passed through Rutledge
Station, and at 10 p.m. encamped five miles west of Madison. 
        My brigade marched at
7.45 a.m. on the ensuing morning, November 19, leading the division and
corps, and unencumbered with wagons. At 10 a.m. it passed through the village
of Madison and marched in a southward course on the Eatonton road. At 12
m. it encamped three miles south of Madison. The aggregate distance marched
on this and the preeeding day was about twenty-five miles. On the 20th
my command resumed its march at 7.15 a.m. It moved in rear of the division
and was charged with the protection of about 300 wagons, including the
pontoon and a large portion of the Second Division train. Considerable
rain had fallen, which rendered the road heavy and retarded the movement
of the column. It crossed Sugar Creek at 11.30 a.m., and Clark&apos;s Fork at
1 p.m. The country now being traversed was quite fertile, and afforded
an abundance of all kinds of supplies. A considerable number of fine horses
and mules were also brought in. By this means the transportation of my
brigade was greatly improved. At 7 p.m. my command reached a point about
four miles and a half from Eatonton and encamped. The distance marched
this day was about twelve miles. On the 21st the morning dawned dark and
lowering, with occasional gusts of rain. My brigade was again assigned
to duty as rear guard of the corps. A battery of artillery accompanied
my command, which was unencumbered with wagons. Our march commenced at
11 a.m. At 1 p.m., the column being temporarily delayed by the breaking
of a tongue in an artillery carriage, the rebel cavalry appeared in our
rear and made &lt;ar92_254&gt; a slight demonstration. It was driven
off precipitately by the Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers, which constituted
my rear guard. At 4 p.m. my command marched through the village of Eatonton.
At 9 p.m., the column having been tediously delayed, I discovered, upon
investigation, that about sixty wagons had become almost hopelessly stalled
in a sort of quagmire. My troops were at once put to work lightening out
these wagons and were thus employed for about two hours, when the march
was resumed. My brigade encamped six miles from Eatonton at midnight, having
marched ten miles and a half. At 7.15 a.m. on the 22d my march was continued.
My command moved in the rear of the division and was charged with the protection
of about 400 wagons. The weather had now cleared up, but the column still
moved slowly. My brigade did not cross Little River until 12.30 p.m. From
that point the march was resumed again at 3 p.m. on the direct road to
Milledgeville. My brigade marched into Milledgeville at 7.30 p.m. Passing
through the town, and crossing the Oconee River on a wooden bridge, it
encamped on the left bank at 9 p.m., having marched seventeen miles. On
the 23d my brigade remained in camp near the Oconee bridge. This day&apos;s
rest enabled the foraging parties to collect a considerable quantity of
provisions and a number of horses and mules. 
        At 6 a.m. on the 24th
my brigade resumed its march, leading the division and corps. Being charged
with the duty of advance guard it was unencumbered by the trains. Our line
of march pursued the Oconee through a sparsely settled, broken, piney country.
My column crossed Beaver Dam at 11 a.m., and at 12.15 p.m. crossed Town
Creek. At 3 p.m. my brigade crossed Gum Creek and at 4.30 p.m. encamped
on the ridge beyond. The distance marched on this day was about fifteen
miles. On the 25th, at 6 a.m., my brigade continued its march, again being
the vanguard of the division and corps. Bluff Creek was passed at 7, and
the column reached Hebron Post-Office at 8 and Buffalo Creek at 9 a.m.
Over Buffalo Creek, a wide, swampy stream, was a series of bridges, nine
in number, all of which had been destroyed by the enemy. According to directions,
I detailed a regiment, the One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers, to
assist in their reconstruction. While this work was going on, the rebel
cavalry made a demonstration on the pickets on the left bank of the stream.
At the instance of the general commanding division, I at once dispatched
five companies of the One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers to re-enforce
the picket-line. The enemy at once withdrew, and the bridges were completed
without further annoyance. The remainder of my brigade crossed Buffalo
Creek at 3.30 p.m., and the entire command, excepting the five companies
of the One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers left to cover a side road,
pursued its march toward Sandersville. Having ascended a plateau three
miles from the creek lively skirmishing was overheard toward the front,
which proved to be the cavalry advance engaging the rebel forces under
Wheeler. As the enemy appeared to be charging down the road I was directed
by the general commanding division to throw my command immediately forward
into line, extending across and covering the road. My troops came up promptly
on the double-quick, and were in a very short space of time advancing in
a steady line of battle. Contemporaneously with this movement a line of
skirmishers, consisting of two companies from the Thirty-first Wisconsin
Volunteers and two from the Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteers, had
been thrown forward, covering the front of the brigade. My line of battle
had not advanced but a short distance when, it not being deemed necessary
to push it any farther, it was, by direction of the &lt;ar92_255&gt; general commanding division, halted and the troops put in camp. My skirmish
line, however, under direction of two officers of my staff, Capt. A. E.
Lee, acting assistant adjutant-general, and Capt. Cyrus Hearrick, acting
aide-de-camp, steadily advanced, and without hesitation and without loss
drove the enemy from a commanding position from which he had charged our
cavalry half an hour previously. Not content with this my skirmish line
pursued the enemy and drove him through woods and open fields one mile
farther, when it was, by my order, halted and withdrawn. 
        On the ensuing day, the
26th, my brigade resumed the march at 6.15 a.m., following the Second Brigade,
which was in advance of the division and corps. This brigade at 7 a.m.
commenced skirmishing with the enemy&apos;s cavalry at the point where it had
been left by my skirmishers on the evening previous. Soon afterward a detachment
of rebels having been discovered observing our movements on a side road
leading to our right, I was directed to send a regiment to drive them off.
I immediately dispatched the One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers,
Lieutenant-Colonel Le Sage. This regiment charged the enemy and drove him
precipitately to the woods, capturing one prisoner, and discovering about
100
bales of cotton, which were burned, including the cotton gin. The regiment
then rejoined the brigade, which had by this time resumed its march toward
Sandersville. My column reached that village without any further opposition
at 11 a.m. Here the trains being left in charge of the Third Division,
the troops of the First Division, including my brigade, marched unencumbered
toward the Georgia Central Railroad, three miles distant. My command struck
the road at Tennille Station at 3.30 p.m. and immediately began the destruction
of the track. About one mile was thoroughly destroyed by my brigade by
sundown. My troops were then encamped near the station. The entire distance
marched on this day was nine miles. On the 27th my brigade marched in the
center of the division at 7 a.m. The route from Tennille pursued a secluded,
untraveled road on the south side of the railroad. The troops being unencumbered,
marched rapidly and made Jackson&apos;s Church by 11 a.m. At 4.30 p.m. my command
crossed Williamson&apos;s Swamp Creek and arrived at Davisborough. Here the
troops were encamped for the night, having marched about seventeen miles.
At daylight the next morning, November 28, my brigade marched down the
railroad track three miles and commenced its destruction. Inasmuch as the
track bed for the most part ran through a difficult swamp much of it was
composed of trestle-work and bridges, all of which were effectually destroyed.
When the track was laid upon a road bed the rail upon one side, with the
stringer attached, was unfastened by means of levers and lifted over against
the rail on the other side. Rails and dry wood were then piled on top and
the whole set on fire. The heat would soon spring the rails, still attached
to the wooden stringers, into a variety of contortions, and the work of
destruction was completed. Thus my brigade, in connection with the other
brigades of the division and alternating with them, proceeded down the
track, destroying mile after mile. At night-fall my command reached Spiers
Turnout, and there encamped, having marched eleven miles and destroyed
four miles of track during the day. 
        At 7 a.m. on the 29th
my brigade returned about two miles up the track and completed its destruction
down as far as Spiers. The station house and other railroad fixtures were
then burned or otherwise effectually destroyed. At 11 a.m. my command marched
singly on the wagon road from Spiers. The corps and division headquarters
trains &lt;ar92_256&gt; were placed in its charge, but it was otherwise
unencumbered. My column crossed Great Coat Creek at 12.30, and arrived
at Bethany at 1.30 p.m. At 3.30 p.m. it crossed Boggy Girt Creek, and at
nightfall encamped two miles and a half from the Ogeechee River. By direction
of the general commanding division, I sent forward a regiment (the Eighty-second
Ohio Veteran Volunteers) with orders to proceed as far as the Ogeechee,
and there encamp for the night, picketing well the bank of the river. On
the morning of the 30th the regiment sent forward to the river was withdrawn
and rejoined the brigade, which marched up the right bank at 8.30 a.m.
At 1 p.m. the column crossed Mill Creek and halted for dinner on Blake&apos;s
plantation. At 4.30 p.m. my command crossed the Ogeechee River, at a point
two miles below Louisville. The bridge here had been ineffectually destroyed
by the enemy, and was repaired by my pioneer corps. My brigade pushed forward
and encamped two miles beyond the river at nightfall. It marched on this
day about fifteen miles. 
        On the morning of December
1 the march was resumed in the direction of Birdville. My brigade moved
in the center of the division and in charge of the division train. However,
it did not leave its encampment near Louisville until noon. During the
afternoon it crossed Big, Dry, Spring, and Bark Camp Creeks, all small,
swampy streams of clear water. The march was very much retarded by the
boggy places in the road. My command did not get into camp until half an
hour after midnight, when it reached a point about four miles from Birdville,
having marched thirteen miles. On the 2d my brigade resumed its march at
9.45 a.m. leading its division and following the Second Division, which
was in advance. At noon it reached Birdville, and at 8 p.m. crossed Buck
Head Creek at Buck Head Church, and there encamped. The distance marched
on this day was about fifteen miles. Shortly after passing Birdville, having
received reliable information that a planter named Bullard, living in that
neighborhood, had made himself conspicuous for his zeal in recapturing
and securing prisoners from our army escaped from the rebel authorities,
I dispatched an officer with authority to destroy his outbuildings and
cotton. He accordingly set fire to the corn cribs, cotton gin, cotton presses,
and a warehouse containing $50,000 worth of cotton. These were all consumed,
and the owner admonished that a repetition of his offense would bring a
similar fate upon his dwelling at the next visitation of our army. On the
3d my brigade marched at 7 a.m. on the Sylvania road; my command occupied
the center of the division, and was unencumbered with wagons. My brigade
crossed the Augusta branch of the Central railroad at noon. The Michigan
Engineers having been charged with the destruction of this road, my command
pressed forward and encamped near Horse Creek at 4.45 p.m. The distance
marched on this day was about fifteen miles. On the 4th my brigade, having
in charge the entire division train, the pontoon trains, the corps supply
train, and the artillery ammunition train, marched at 9 a.m. The column
crossed a number of small, swampy streams, and passed through a sterile,
sandy country, bountifully timbered with groves of pine. At 12.30 p.m.
it crossed Little Horse Creek, and at 5 p.m. Little Ogeechee Creek. At
6 p.m. my troops encamped one mile beyond the Little Ogeechee, having marched
thirteen miles. On the 5th the First Division, which had previously been
in advance, dropped to the rear, allowing the other two divisions to go
ahead; this consumed most of the day. My brigade marched at 5 p.m.; the
road was very sloughy, greatly detaining the trains. The column advanced
only about three miles and a half, when it encamped at 10.30 p.m. &lt;ar92_257&gt; 
        On the 6th my brigade,
with a battery of artillery, was detailed as a rear guard for the corps.
It marched at 9.30 a.m. unencumbered with wagons. The line of march pursued
the Springfield road through a moderately fertile country. My foraging
parties, which were now kept out dally, were enabled to obtain a considerable
quantity of sweet potatoes and fresh meat. Ample supplies of forage were
also obtained along the road. My command marched on this day about twelve
miles, and encamped at a point about six miles from the Ogeechee River,
six from the Savannah, and sixteen from Springfield. On the 7th our march
was resumed at 8 a.m. My brigade had charge of about 300 wagons, consisting
of the division and the cavalry trains. The road soon entered the Cowpens
Branch Swamp, a low, flat, boggy surface, about three miles in width. The
wagons easily cut through the surface and many of them became completely
mired. In the meantime a drizzling rain set in, which had no tendency to
improve the roads. In many instances the animals had to be entirely removed
from the wagons and the vehicles drawn out of the slough by the troops.
By 1.30 p.m. the trains were all gotten safely through the swamp and the
column moved slowly on. At 8 p.m. it reached Turkey Creek and Swamp, and
at 10 p.m. encamped one mile above Springfield. The distance marched on
this day was fifteen miles. At 8 a.m. on the morning of the 8th my brigade
crossed Jack&apos;s Creek and arrived at Springfield. My command was now unencumbered
and marched in advance of the division, following the Second Division.
Our course followed the Monteith road about nine miles, then turned to
the right and pursued a southwesterly direction for a distance of six miles,
which brought us to our encampment, having marched in the aggregate fifteen
miles. 
        The march was resumed
at 8.30 a.m. on the 9th. My brigade followed the Second, the First being
in the advance. At 10 a.m. the column struck the main road leading to Savannah.
Cannonading and musketry were now occasionally heard in the advance. It
began to be evident that a considerable force of the enemy had gathered
in our front and meant to oppose our onward march to Savannah. At 3 p.m.
my brigade reached Monteith Swamp, where the First and Second Brigades
had already encountered a considerable force of the enemy. The rebel forces
were so disposed as to completely command the only practicable passage
of the swamp, which was by the main road. Their artillery, which they were
disposed to use freely, was so posted as to completely sweep the road,
and was covered by earth-works. The advance of the First Brigade against
the enemy&apos;s front, together with that of the Second Brigade against his
left flank, having failed to dislodge him, I was instructed by the general
commanding division to send two regiments around the left, with directions
to push through the swamp if possible and turn the enemy&apos;s right. I immediately
dispatched the Thirty-first Wisconsin and Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers,
the whole commanded by Colonel West, of the Thirty-first Wisconsin Volunteers,
to whom I gave the instructions above repeated. Making a detour of about
one mile to the left Colonel West formed his command in line of battle
and plunged into the almost impenetrable swamp. It was found impossible
to get a horse over the miry surface, and officers and men were alike compelled
to go on foot. The swamp, which was about 400 yards in width, was finally
passed and the troops emerged into an open field skirted on the farther
side by timber, in which the enemy lay concealed. The point at which he
was struck was far in the rear of his main position, which was completely
turned, yet he was not wholly «17 R IV--VOL XLIV»&lt;ar92_258&gt; unprepared to meet Colonel West&apos;s forces, upon whom he opened fire at their
first appearance. The fire was returned with a good will, but only three
volleys were needed to complete the overthrow and effect the precipitate
retreat of the enemy. Colonel West now cautiously advanced his line, fearing
an ambush. He soon discovered that the rebel forces were all gone, and
quietly occupied two fine redoubts, containing eighty abandoned knapsacks,
well packed with clothing,&amp;c. The remainder of my brigade except the
Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry, which had been sent to the
support of Colonel West, now crossed the swamp by the main road, and the
whole encamped near the rebel redoubts. This little affair, in my judgment,
reflects great credit upon those concerned in it, and I take this occasion
to express my appreciation of the skill and promptitude with which Colonel
West handled his troops. I regret to say, however, that this affair cost
us one man killed and four wounded. 
        My brigade marched again
at 7 a.m. on the 10th, in the center of the division, the Second Brigade
leading. The road was excellent, and devoid of all obstructions. My brigade
struck the Charleston and Savannah Railroad at Monteith Station at 10 a.m.,
and soon afterward commenced destroying the track. By 11.30 a.m. half a
mile of the track was thoroughly destroyed by the brigade, and the column
resumed its march, now on the direct road to the city of Savannah. By 2.30
p.m. my command reached the fifth mile-post from the city. About one mile
in advance of this the enemy had already been encountered, strongly intrenched,
with artillery in position. It was evident that this was the main line
of the defenses of the city. My brigade immediately went into position
on the left of the Second Brigade, which had already formed in the dense
forest on the left of the road. My left flank joined the right of the First
Brigade. Pickets covering the line were at once thrown forward, but no
demonstration was made upon the enemy. My troops encamped in the position
thus taken. On the 11th my command was thrown forward and to the left about
400 yards, and the troops again encamped in their position. At 11 p.m.,by
direction of the general commanding division, I detached the One hundred
and first and Eighty-second Illinois and Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers,
the whole under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Le Sage, of the One hundred
and first Illinois Volunteers, and sent them to the rear, to be used in
guarding the trains of the corps. On the 13th I was directed to move the
remainder of my brigade to the rear, to cover the approaches to the trains.
At 3 p.m. my entire command was posted, covering the different roads coming
from the rear. My line was about three miles in extent, joining the pickets
of the Twenty-second Wisconsin Volunteers on the right, near the Savannah
River, and those of the Fourteenth Army Corps on the left. The One hundred
and forty-third New York Volunteers was placed near the junction of the
Tweedside, the Potter&apos;s plantation, and the Savannah roads. The Eighty-second
Ohio Veteran Volunteers was placed about three-quarters of a mile farther
to the right, on the Potter&apos;s plantation road. The One hundred and first
Illinois Volunteers and Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers covered the
Savannah road, near Cherokee Hill. The Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers
covered the line of the Charleston and Savannah. Railroad. The Thirty-first
Wisconsin Volunteers was placed three-quarters of a mile south of Cherokee
Hill, on a road leading in that direction. The positions thus chosen, excepting
those of the two regiments first named, were covered by substantial breast-works.
A section of artillery, which reported to me on the 14th, was posted on &lt;ar92_259&gt; the Savannah road and was covered by a redoubt. My brigade remained in
the position just described without incident worthy of note until the 19th.
On that date, by permission of the general commanding division, I sent
out a foraging expedition, consisting of twelve companies of infantry,
two from each regiment, and eight wagons. My instructions to Lieutenant-Colonel
Le Sage, commanding the detachment, were to proceed about four miles north
of Monteith Station, to obtain all the forage and supplies he could, and
to develop the strength and position of a hostile force reported to be
in that neighborhood. The party returned at 3 p.m. without having obtained
either provisions or forage. It had encountered the enemy&apos;s outposts and
driven them back to within one mile and a half of his main camp, capturing
one prisoner. During the night of the 20th, according to direction, I detailed
a regiment, the One hundred and forty-third New York Volunteers, to cross
to Argyle Island and there go into position, covering the flank of the
Second Brigade, which had crossed to the South Carolina shore. On the morning
of the 21st it was discovered that the enemy had evacuated the city and
defenses of Savannah. The One hundred and forty-third New York Volunteers
therefore rejoined the brigade on the morning of the 22d. On the 23d my
command moved back toward the city and encamped on McAlpin&apos;s plantation,
on the right bank of the Savannah River. The position assigned me was on
the right of the Second Brigade and one mile above the city of Savannah.
Here my troops erected comfortable quarters, in which they still remain. 
        During the extraordinary
campaign which has terminated, my command marched over 350 miles, completely
destroyed 9 miles of railroad track, burned a station-house, several water-tanks,
and a large quantity of wood and railroad lumber; burned 12 cotton-gins
and presses, and 250 bales of cotton; captured 5 serviceable horses, 42
serviceable mules, 460 head of cattle, 200 sheep, 500 hogs, 12 barrels
of molasses, 1 barrel of whisky, 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes, 10,800
pounds of rice, besides a vast quantity of flour, meal, bacon, poultry,
and other promiscuous kinds of provisions. The quantity of forage captured
it is difficult to estimate, but it is safe to say that it amounted to
not less than 130,000 pounds. Excepting the articles of bread, coffee,
and sugar, my troops subsisted almost entirely from the country. The animals
also were fed almost exclusively upon what was obtained from the same source. 
        I take pleasure in expressing
my hearty commendation of the soldierly behavior of the officers and men
of my command during this long and arduous campaign. The fatigues and privations
of the march were borne with cheerfulness. The heavy labor of assisting
trains, destroying railroads, building bridges, repairing roads,&amp;c.,
was performed with alacrity, and when the voice of danger summoned, every
soldier sprang to his post with enthusiasm. The commanders of my regiments
and the officers of my staff deserve and are tendered my sincere thanks
for their ready co-operation in every laudable undertaking, and their earnest
zeal in carrying out my orders. But the soldiers and officers of my command
need no praise from me. Their own achievements are their highest encomium,
and the united admiration of their countrymen their best reward. These
are already theirs, and neither my pen nor voice can add anything to them. 
        n conclusion I have the
honor to add the following list of the regiments composing my brigade and
the officers commanding them during the campaign: Thirty-first Wisconsin
Volunteers, Col Francis H. West; &lt;ar92_260&gt; Eighty-second Ohio
Veteran Volunteers, Lieut. Col. David Thomson; One hundred and forty-third
New York Volunteers, Lieut. Col. Hezekiah Watkins; One hundred and first
Illinois Volunteers, Lieut. Col. John B. Le Sage; Eighty-second Illinois
Volunteers, Maj. F. H. Rolsbausch; Sixty-first Ohio Veteran Volunteers,
Capt. John Garrett. 
        The officers of my staff
were as follows: Capt. A. E. Lee, acting assistant adjutant-general; Capt.
Benjamin Reynolds, acting assistant inspector general; Capt. F. S. Wallace,
topographical engineer; Capt. Charles Saalmann, acting commissary of subsistence;
Capt. W. T. George, acting assistant quartermaster; Surg. H. K. Spooner,
surgeon-in-chief; Capt. Cyrus Hearrick, acting aide-de-camp; Capt. Myron
H. Lamb, acting aide-de-camp; Lieut. Charles M. Lockwood, acting assistant

 CAPTAIN :(*) 
        On the 15th day of November
the regiment left its camp in Atlanta and entered upon the campaign which
ended with the capture and occupation of Savannah by our forces. During
the campaign the troops were principally subsisted off the country through
which we passed. On the l6th we reached and commenced destroying the railroad
near Stone Mountain. My regiment here destroyed about two miles &lt;ar92_266&gt; of the road. But small forces of the enemy were met, and until our arrival
before Savannah it was necessary for the regiment to take a position in
line of battle but twice. The first time was near Sanders-ville, on November
25. We met the enemy late in the afternoon. The fighting (which was nothing
more than skirmishing) was principally done by our advance cavalry. The
Third Brigade was in advance and formed in line of battle. We encamped
in line, and the next morning the Second Brigade took the advance, the
Third Brigade following. The enemy made but very little opposition, and
we had no difficulty in occupying Sandersville. From this place we moved
to Tennille Station, No. 13, and destroyed about half a mile of the railroad.
On the 27th we reached Davisborough Station, on the Georgia Central Railroad,
and early on the morning of the 28th commenced destroying the railroad.
We destroyed about three miles of the road and at night went into camp
at Station No. 11. The Third Brigade at this point was detached from the
corps for the purpose of guarding the corps train. On the 30th we crossed
the Little Ogeechee several miles above the railroad, in consequence of
the destruction of the bridge, and encamped near the east bank of the river. 
        We marched and crossed
the Augusta branch railroad on the 3d day of December, leaving Milien to
our right. On the 5th our regiment was sent two miles from camp, with orders
to destroy two mills. I destroyed the mills and returned to camp. From
this time until the 9th nothing worthy of note occurred. On the 9th we
found the enemy in considerable force in our front. They were in a strong
position, had fortifications with two pieces of artillery, and their front
and right was protected by a swamp. The Thirty-first Wisconsin and Sixty-first
Ohio were thrown forward, and succeeded in passing through this swamp and
attacked the enemy from the rear and right. The Eighty-second Ohio was
thrown forward as a support, but before my regiment succeeded in passing
through this swamp the Thirty-first Wisconsin and Sixty-first Ohio had
attacked and routed the enemy. On the 10th, having reached Monteith, a
station on the Savannah and Charleston Railroad, the Third Brigade was
ordered to commence and effectually destroy as much of this road as possible.
The Eighty-second Ohio Regiment destroyed about 300 yards of the road and
also the station-house. The same day, having reached the enemy&apos;s lines
in front of Savannah, the brigade took up a position, with three regiments
in line of battle, with the Second Brigade on the right. My regiment was
on the front line, connecting with the Thirty-first Wisconsin on the right
and the One hundred and forty-third New York on the left. On the 11th the
brigade was moved a short distance to the left, the regiments occupying
the same positions in line. On the 13th the brigade was moved about three
miles to the rear, where a second or rear line was formed for the purpose
of protecting the rear. The Eighty-second occupied the right of this line,
my pickets connecting with those of the One hundred and forty-third New
York on my left. My command occupied this position until the surrender
of Savannah and its occupation by our forces. The regiment entered its
present encampment on the 23d of December, connecting on the right with
the One hundred and forty-third New York and on the left with the Thirty-first
Wisconsin. 
        During the campaign my
command has captured 13 head of horses, 25 head of mules, 30 head of cattle,
150 head of hogs, 35 head f sheep, 200 pounds sugar, 4 tons fodder, 200
bushels of corn, 200 bushels of potatoes, 125 bushels of corn meal, 1,000
pounds of flour, 160 gallons of molasses, and chickens and turkeys innumerable. &lt;ar92_267&gt; 
        My command also captured
30 negroes and destroyed in all six miles of railroad and 150 bales of
cotton and burned two cotton gins.
