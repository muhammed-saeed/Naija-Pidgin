All about Bob
 
Bob bounced into my life as a two year old pup in 1992; an adventurous, rambunctious little dog. In desperate need of rescue from the Phoenix Animal Protection Agency, he was bailed out by Janis, my friend and sympathetic animal lover. Despite all the tender loving care he received, or maybe because of it, Bob developed a most reckless independent spirit.

Somehow he lost a chunk of his ear that he never could quite explain. One exhilarating day Bob even lost his tail when he decided to jump over a razor wire fence in hot pursuit of a four legged enemy of the feline persuasion. Needless to say, my admiration grew in direct proportion to his exploits.

On another wonderful day full of adventure and excitement Bob was on the third floor of a building under construction when he spotted a pigeon. With no time to waste he dashed after the bird, failing to realize that as he leapt through an open window, ground level was three stories below. Sailing through the air, the windshield of a car finally broke his fall. The bird got away, and poor little Bob broke his front legs which required an emergency vet visit and permanently implanted steel rods in both legs.
 
Janis again was his savior and nursed him back to complete health, carrying him in a sling when his legs were just too tender to be used. I think he took advantage of that as he enjoyed being carried around long after his legs had healed. Bob acquired a military gait in remembrance of his greatest escapade and once again we were off to explore the many thrilling alleys and pathways on our long walks.

Although he never received an Oscar for his doggie stunts (however well deserved an Oscar may be), he was made a star by famed photographer Christopher Makos when he was photographed for the ARCOS art fair in Madrid.

Our relationship continued to grow stronger as I spoiled him day after day with juicy steak bones and a comfortable bed. Bob passed this year at the ripe old age of 20. A day does not go by that I don’t think of Bob. His loyalty to Janis and me was unsurpassed and absolute. And yes, Bob did like frozen custard.
 Do you have a Bob in your life? Treasure your time with them. They are God’s creatures to be loved and enjoyed. Karl
