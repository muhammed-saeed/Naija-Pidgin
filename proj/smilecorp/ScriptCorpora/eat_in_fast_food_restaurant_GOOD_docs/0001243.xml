 Working At A Fast Food Restaurant (Part 1)… 

{ April 1, 2011 @ 11:34 am }·{ Stories Of My Life , work }
 
From age 16-18, I worked at a fast food restraunt in one of the shadier neighborhoods in town. We call this part of town the dirtiest part of Felony Flat(t)s. It is dirty, grungy, and full of tweakers. The fast food restraunt was cheap, and the perfect hang out for those with little money, no shelter, and those who just“scored”drugs.

While I have many stories from this particular time in my life, the one story that sticks in my mind was the man that used to use our bathroom as a shower.

Now, in the bathrooms at this particular restraunt, there is a toilet, a sink, and a mirror above the sink. Then, of course, you have toilet paper dispensers, paper towel dispensers, and the soap dispenser. Pretty simple.

So how in the fuck does one manage to use these things to make himself a shower?!?!!?

I was working front counter on a particular sunny afternoon not long after I started working there. A customer walked up and asked if he could have the bathroom key. I smiled sweetly and let him know that if it was locked it was because someone was in there. He thanked me and went back to his seat.

About ten minutes later, a different man walked up, asking for the key. I repeated what I had told the previous customer, figuring it was a coincidence. I mean, someone was either taking a massive shit, or someone else was occupying the bathroom.

Well, imagine my surprise when a customer walked up, telling me that there was water coming out from under the bathroom door! Jaw on the floor, I thought for sure this customer was lying to me. Slowly walking around to the bathroom area, my worst fears were confirmed. Some jack ass was flooding our bathroom!!

Luckily, at that point in my“career”I was nothing more than a“team member.”Meaning, I didn’t have to deal with the disruptive or unruly customers that were often the norm. So, I grabbed the assistant manager on duty, a funny man who we will call J, and told him about the flood. He immediately went banging on the door of the bathroom, demanding the man inside come out.

I went back about my business taking orders for customers and helping put finished orders in bags and handing them out to customers. A few minutes passed before I saw J again, who was having no luck in removing our flood-maker.

He gave the man 5 minutes, which was apparently enough, because when J walked back to the bathrooms, the door was unlocked, but the water remained. He cleaned it up, but without anyone seeing the man, no one knew what he was doing, why he did it, or anything else for that matter.

It was a few months later that this whole scenario was replayed. This time, however, we were ready. Now I’m not sure how our friend always showed up when I was working, or when I was working the front counter, but it never fucking failed.

This time, the manager, who we shall call B, was on duty, and he is a force you don’t want to mess with. It was later in the day, much less crowded then before, and I asked B to watch the front counter while I peed. Employees used the same bathrooms as the customers did, so when I walked back to the ladies room, I noticed something. Something very familiar and gut-wrenching.

Water pouring from under the door of the men’s bathroom.

Fuck. My. Life.

Really, I was happy that the big man was there, considering he doesn’t mess around. He waltzed right over there, pounded on the door, and demanded our unwelcome guest come out. There, of course, was no response, other than the sound of water hitting the tile floors. My manager didn’t find that too appealing, so he said he was calling the cops and getting the keyes to the restroom.

We walked away, but I had no idea what my manager had planned. He did indeed grab the phone and placed a phone call to the police, but he also grabbed the polaroid camera, with every intention of snapping a picture of the culprit when he decided to leave the bathrrom.

However, that plan blew up in our face when we walked back to the restroom, only to find the door unlocked, the sink off, and some miraculously clean-shaven man walking away from our building, who didn’t just eat.

B called after him, and he turned just in time for B to snap a picture of him.

The scene in the bathroom shed light on the man’s whole operation. He had been using paper towels and toilet paper to plug up the sink in the bathroom, so that it would overflow, causing a“shower”of sorts. Or something.

He was a creative man. I will give him that much.

(This man showered two more times in our bathrooms before the police finally caught him, which was after I stopped working there)…..
