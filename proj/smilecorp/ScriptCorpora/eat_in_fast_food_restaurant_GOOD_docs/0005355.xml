 09/12/11--14:16: Desmond Patton gets 10 to 12 year sentence for manslaughter in fatal shooting of Jerry Hughes III (chan 1424840 ) 

The now-15-year-old boy shot in stray gunfire still has bullet in leg.

SPRINGFIELD–A prosecutor said Monday a 15-year-old boy still has a bullet in his left leg, almost two years after he was shot by stray gunfire during a daytime fatal shooting outside a Mason Square fast food restaurant.

Assistant District Attorney Eduardo Velazquez made the comment Monday as 21-year-old Desmond D. Patton of Springfield pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of Jerry A. Hughes III , in what was called a gang dispute by the prosecution.

Following the Aug. 22, 2009, shooting in a crowded parking lot at Mid Town Plaza, Police Commissioner William J. Fitchet assigned extra patrols “to quell the violence and to assure the public that peace will be restored.”

Patton pleaded guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon for the shot that hit the then-13-year-old’s leg.“Certainly he was caught up in the cross-fire,”Velazquez said about the boy, who was coming out of McDonalds restaurant. At least 17 shots were fired, he said.

Hampden Superior Court Judge Cornelius J. Moriarty II accepted the agreed upon recommendation and sentenced Patton to a 10-12-year state prison term followed by three years probation.

The last-minute plea came as Patton’s murder trial was about to start. Justin Garcia, 20, who was charged with Patton for Hughes’killing, is awaiting a separate trial.

Defense lawyer Jean A. Liddy said Patton was taking responsibility for his actions and wanted to be part of his young daughter’s life when he gets free.

Liddy said Patton, at a very young age, became involved with a crowd he should have avoided.

Velazquez said Hughes was found on the ground near the McDonald’s drive up window, shot multiple times.

Another man was nearby trying to take Hughes from the area after the shooting, according to a security guard. Velazquez said the guard said he saw a man take a large gun from Hughes’pocket as he lay on the ground.




 
 09/12/11--15:00: David Narkewicz gets a feel for his duties as acting mayor of Northampton (chan 1424840 ) 

Narkewicz’first official appearance as acting mayor came on Sunday when he officiated at a Sept. 11, 2001, tenth anniversary commemoration at the Fire Station.

 NORTHAMPTON –He isn’t bringing his dog to work, so the transition from Mary Clare Higgins to David J. Narkewicz in the mayor’s office is not quite complete, but the acting mayor is bringing his work ethic.

By virtue of being city council president, Narkewicz officially took over from Higgins last Friday, when she left office before the end of her term to take over the reins of CommunityAction! of Franklin County, a non-profit human services agency left just a few months shy of completing her sixth term, a record she shares with David B. Musante, Jr., whose tenure ran from the 1980s into the 1990s. Narkewicz and Michael R. Bardsley, another former council president who occasionally stood in for Higgins , are vying for the post in November.

 Narkewicz has said he would play it by ear in terms of using the City Hall office in Higgins ’absence. As acting mayor, he is charged with running City Council meetings, representing the city at official functions and signing various orders. His first such act Monday was signing an order authorizing the Department of Public Works to fill a position that was recently made vacant due to a death. Narkewicz said he also met with the staff in the mayor’s office to discuss scheduling, computer use and other basic functions of the office.

 Narkewicz ’first official appearance as acting mayor came on Sunday when he officiated at a Sept. 11, 2001, tenth anniversary commemoration at the Fire Station. On Monday, he took part in the dedication of three new barns at the Three County Fairgrounds , a ceremony that Higgins also attended.

The fact that there were four former mayors at the ceremony was not lost on U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, a Democrat who held the mayoral office in Springfield before he was elected to Congress. Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray was mayor of Worcester, and state Environmental and Energy Secretary Richard Sullivan is a former Westfield mayor.

“You will never be more popular,”Neal told Narkewicz . To Higgins, he said,“You’re about to become popular again.”

 Higgins , whom Narkewicz credited with helping to advance the fairgrounds project, acknowledged her civilian status by saying,“It feels kind of funny to be a former mayor, but I’ve got to tell you, I think it’s good.”

Unlike Higgins , who brought her dog to work every day, Narkewicz kept the family pet at home.



 
 09/12/11--15:59: Angelica Guerrero of West Springfield, killed protecting daughter during tornado, awarded Sweeney Award for Civilian Bravery (chan 1424840 ) 

A West Springfield business has started a fund to help with educating the daughters of the late Angelica Guerrero.


 Juan Guerrero 

WEST SPRINGFIELD–For the family of Angelica Guerrero, who died June 1 shielding her 15-year-old daughter from the tornado that swept the area, the wounds are still fresh in the wake of a recent accolade from the state Legislature.

Angelica’s husband, Juan Guerrero, said Monday that he still has nightmares about the collapse of the Union Street three-decker in which they lived on the first floor.

Lt. Gov. Timothy P. Murray bestowed the ninth annual Madeline Amy Sweeney Award for Civilian Bravery on the late mother during a ceremony at the State House Sunday. Murray presented the award to Guerrero’s husband, Juan, her two daughters and other family members.

The award is named after a flight attendant from Acton who was aboard the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 that was flown into the World Trade Center in New York City Sept. 11, 2001. Sweeney gave information about the plane’s hijackers to ground services.

State Rep. Michael J. Finn, D-West Springfield, and state Sen. James R. Welch, D-West Springfield, nominated Angelica for the honor.

“The whole (Statehouse) chamber was filled. It was very inspiring,”Finn said of the ceremony, which featured speaking by Sweeney’s family.“She was there for her family. It was an incredible act of heroism.”

Angelica Guerrero covered her daughter Ibone with her body as they sought safety in a bathtub in their home in the Merrick section of West Springfield.

“I feel my wife is a hero. She was my hero, is my hero and is always going to be my hero,”Guerrero said Monday.

Recalling his wife still causes Guerrero to become emotional.

“We never fought. We never yelled. Some people find it hard to believe,”Guerrero said.“That is the reason it is so painful.”

Guerrero and his wife were in the living room of their home when the tornado struck. Guerrero said he was on the verge of crossing into the bathroom to throw himself on top of his wife when the building came crashing down on them.

The local man, who, like his wife, is originally from Mexico, has been disabled since an accident on one of his construction jobs several years ago. He has been set back again by the two bulging discs and a broken bone in his pelvis. He now has to use a cane.

The family has been resettled in a two-bedroom apartment on Park Street. Ibone is back in the classroom at West Springfield High School and her sister, 19-year-old Fabiola, has returned to Holyoke Community College where she is a second-year student studying photography.

Guerrero said the girls continue to have needs he cannot meet. Ibone would like to return to her karate lessons, but still has some problems with her legs. Fabiola needs art supplies and a camera.

Guerrero said he is grateful that West Springfield businessman Victor E. Thomas Jr. has started a scholarship drive to help fund his daughters’educations and he extends thanks to people who have worked in that effort. Donations to the Angelica Guerrero Memorial Scholarship Fund may be sent to the Holyoke Community College Foundation at 303 Homestead Ave., Holyoke, MA 01040.

 AMHERST –Town Manager John P. Musante was released from Baystate Medical Center Sunday and is now recuperating at home following injuries from a fall on Sept. 6 .

“All members of the Town staff are sending him good thoughts and best wishes, and we look forward to when he is well enough to be back here with us. In the meantime, we have the Town’s business well in hand, so that he can focus all his energy on feeling better.”

Select Board Chair Stephanie O’Keeffe stated that“there is an incredible team here, and the community is very fortunate to have the service of such a tremendous staff. And, we are also all fortunate to serve in such a caring community. The outpouring of concern and thoughtfulness for John has been amazing.”

Musante fell while walking the family dog.
