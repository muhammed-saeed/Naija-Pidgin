In the XXI century more and more people are aware of the importance of healthy eating . The healthy conscientious people groups are growing every year and the result is a very significant increase in the consumption of organic products and directly related to healthy eating.

Every year each family spends extra money on buying “organic products” in order to reduce the chances of cancerous diseases and improve their health.

Grill Food is the most used cooking method in US. 70% of the US population eat grill food more than twice a week.

Prevention is very important (buying organic food ) but if they don’t cook properly doesn’t make sense spend extra money buying special products to cook. The “organic products” are free of synthetic pesticides, bio-engineered genes ( GMOs ), petroleum-based fertilizers and sewage sludge-based fertilizers but if the way people cook them (in special grilling )is not the proper one they will get other substances probably worse than the residual ones used in conventional production.

Grilling is often presented as a healthy alternative to cooking with oil, because foods can be lower in saturated fat, if fat is allowed to drip out after it liquefies, although other problems can occur that are forgotten or ignored.

Unfortunately, as fond of your grills as many of you may be, understanding the health risks created from grilling meat may be enough to change your mind. In fact, since the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR), after analyzing over 7,000 studies concluded that grilling any meat, including chicken and fish produces cancer-causing carcinogens ; we are urging everyone to rethink the pastime of the traditional backyard grill or barbecue.

By now, every single Grill Restaurant produces carcinogenic grill food, what is directly related to 60% of cancer diseases in US.

This project will bring the solution to avoid one of the most silent causes of cancer.

Healthy Grill USA will be on the food service market as the solution in order to provide true Healthy and juiciest Grill meal.

 HEALTHY GRILL USA is the commercial solution in order to reduce the consummation of carcinogenic Grill Food!

 

 We just need to find the right Investor to provide America with the best and healthier Grill Food.

 How to avoid grilling issues when you’re grilling fish and know when it is ready 
 Posted by Healthy Grill USA on May 26, 2012 Posted in: Recipes , Healthy Foods , Grilling healthy , Tools , Healthy Tips .

Adding grilled fish –including salmon –to your diet is a heart-healthy choice. The American Heart Association recommends two servings of fish per week, and salmon as sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and high in protein. Although grilled fish  is simple to prepare, it can be difficult to decide how to keep it healthier avoiding some grill issues caused by the traditional cooking methods or when it’s ready to eat. Never–I said never–overcook your fish. Learn how to avoid some issues even when using traditional methods and how to check for done-ness and banish dry grilled fish forever.

 

 HOW TO DO 

 Light the grill to a medium to low flame. If you get it too hot, you’ll burn the outside of your fish, while the inside will still be raw. If you’re using charcoal or wood, wait until the fire will be without flames. never cook any food over flames. Leave the skin on the fish . This protects the fish to get all the PAH’s – Grill dangers - while is grilling and also holds the fish together and makes it easier to remove from the grill when done. Determine the approximate thickness of your fish. You will need to grill 7 to 9 minutes for a 1-inch fillet. A whole 2 lb. salmon will take about 15 to 17 minutes–All depends of the used grilling method - Grill Methods / Systems . Place the fish on the grill at an angle, skin-side down (always). This will help in taking it off the grill, and also avoids great part of the PAH’s to get into the fish. If you have a marinade, you can baste it while it’s grilling. Don’t flip it. When you see some“white foam’(the fat) appear on the top of the fish–with Salmon it is easy to check–it is practically done. It will also look opaque and feel slightly firm. Don’t use fork to don’t break the fish and remove the fish from the grill with a thin, flat metal spatula.

 Grilling–The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat 
 Posted by Healthy Grill USA on May 26, 2012 Posted in: Grilling healthy , Healthy Foods , Healthy Tips , Recipes , Restaurants , Tools . 
 Tagged: Barbecue grill , Conditions and Diseases , cook , cooking , environment , Fast food , fish , food , grill , grill dangers , grill issues , grilled food , health , healthy grill , healthy grilling , meat , Meat thermometer , Temperature . 2 comments 
 
There are two basic methods to test for how done your meat is while you are cooking it–use a meat thermometer , or press on the meat with your finger tips.

The problem with the meat thermometer approach is that when you poke a hole into the meat with a thermometer , it can let juices escape, juices that you would rather have stay in the meat. For this reason, most experienced cooks rely on a“finger test”method, especially on steaks (whole roasts are better tested with a thermometer).

During my research about the“Finger  Test”I found several articles about it and I decided to share one that I consider the best one due to its illustrations and because was in English (not my best language). This method has been used for years and when I have lived in Brazil and started to develop my Healthy Grill project, I learned from one of the best Grill master I ever knew. Of course he didn’t grill by the healthier method but even using the traditional methods he already showed some concerns about some issues trying to avoid them the best he could.
 
This is one of those things that gets easier with practice. The next time you cook a steak, even if you are still planning to rely on a meat thermometer, press on the meat here and there while it cooks, and compare the feeling of the meat with the following finger test. With practice, you will become more confident.

 METHOD 

Open the palm of your hand. Relax the hand. Take the index finger of your other hand and push on the fleshy area between the thumb and the base of the palm. Make sure your hand is relaxed. This is what raw meat feels like. (Check this out the next time you have a raw steak to cook.)

 

Now gently press the tip of your pinky and your thumb together. Again feel the fleshy area below the thumb. It should feel quite firm. This is what well done meat feels like when you press on it. (Check this out the next time you overcook a piece of meat.)

 

Press the tip of your ring finger and your thumb together. The flesh beneath the thumb should give a little more. This is what meat cooked to a medium doneness feels like.

 

Gently press the tip of your middle finger to the tip of your thumb. This is medium rare .

 

Press the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb. The fleshy area below the thumb should give quite a bit. This is what meat cooked to rare feels like. Open up your palm again and compare raw to rare.

 Diabetes? Liver and kidney problems? Makes them part of your past!

 Birdseed / Canary milk 

If you think that the birdseed is a food for birds, you are right, but is also a food for humans, especially those who want to lose weight, improve health and prevent illness.

Initial results are excellent in what relates to an improved organ function, mood, etc…

 The birdseed has gone through extensive research at the National University of Mexico due to the high protein and its amino acid which can run stable secure and indestructible by the body. The grass is native of the Mediterranean , and marketed worldwide only as food for pet birds.

The result of the studies revealed that the birdseed has the ability to recharge and cure the human body.

The birdseed milk (one cup) has more protein than two or three pounds of meat. According to the researches of the University of Mexico , the enzymes birdseed milk eliminate the inflammation of the organs of our body, especially the liver, kidneys and pancreas. They end up with diabetes in weeks, and contribute to liver cirrhosis cure because they can increase the number of hepatocytes.

When refilled with the birdseed milk enzymes, the kidneys are undergo a healthy diuresis that removes excess fluid from the body. It also reduces high blood pressure due to  have the lipase enzyme that rapidly dissolves fat deposits in veins and arteries. Is a great remedy against obesity and restoring muscle tone.

This milk enzymes reduces high rates of cholesterol and prevents funneling of the arteries. As diuretic it works in case of cystitis, abundance of nitrogenous substances in the blood, uric acid, gout, hypertension, edema, obesity accompanied by fluid retention, gastritis and ulcer of stomach.

The birdseed milk enzymes also reduces problems related to urine, kidney stones and bladder. Because emollient softens and relaxes inflamed parts, as well as refreshing if used externally in eczema.

Consuming milk birdseed, is an injection of a strong health and diabetes vaccine or any other disease that occurs by high levels of blood acidity. Therefore, it is important to consume at least two or three glasses of milk birdseed to ensure a healthy and slender figure, of course accompanied by a great sensation of well-being.

 Preparation of the Birdseed / Canary milk 

Searching among the different communities that exist on the subject, it was noticed that some people are sensitive to the film that covers the shell of birdseed, so it is recommended to put seven tablespoons of birdseed in one liter of water, let the birdseed in water, in the refrigerator (not freezer) for 12 to 16 hours.

After, remove it from the refrigerator, drain the water and replace it with one liter of clean water in a blender and beat well for about four minutes, remove the waste that are dark on milk (on top), beat for another four minutes and after, strain several times until it loses all dark residue. Mix again only to homogenize.

Once you slowly and carefully strain the liquid after blend the seeds and remove the waste that are dark on top - there will be seed at the bottom of your blender–let it fall into your strainer and then take a spoon and eat it.  It is delicious and such a waste to throw it out.  It has a nutty taste and I is loaded with protein and fiber.  Remember, blend, let it sit a few minutes, what falls to the bottom is live, eatable seed–the top is what gets thrown out.

The ideal is to drink at least two to three cups a day. Never add sugar to fruit or milk. Refined sugar is a poison that destroys the enzymes and the benefits of any food. Nothing survives to refined sugar . The acidity kill enzymes.

Among the many properties of the homemade birdseed milk recipe, is the decrease in blood glucose levels , fighting hypertension and diuretic. Has a high protein source, it is a rich source of amino acids and can be used by athletes as dietary supplementation. It has also been used as a very effective homemade recipe for diet when taken about 20 minutes before meals.

 Among other indications birdseed milk can be used as the strong anti-inflammatory for human organs, assists the proper operation of the urinary tract and reduces the cholesterol level by having the lipase enzyme that breaks down fat molecules.

While these benefits are very good, not any millet seed is suitable for developing such a drink. The good birdseed are those of a variety known as CDC Mary , which has no silica fibers.

Use this recipe for homemade milk birdseed to always be healthy.

 Summarizing the advantages of birdseed milk: 

1. They have a powerful enzyme recharge.
2. Excellent source of antioxidants, which prevent aging and premature wear of the skin.
3. High content of plant proteins.
4. Enzymes of this wonderful little seed are ideal natural remedy for swollen internal organs like the liver, kidneys and pancreas: the canary in a very powerful pancreatic regenerator.
5. Help to eradicate diabetes significantly in a very short time.
6. Eliminates cirrhosis by increasing the count of hepatocytes in the liver.
7. Refill the kidneys of enzymes, helps eliminate excess fluids.
8. Prevents arteriosclerosis.
9. Helps in cases of gout, edema, gastritis and stomach ulcers.
10. Ideal for hypertension.
11. Contains lipase, an enzyme that helps to purify harmful fats in the veins, arteries, or simply fat deposits, thus serving as an extraordinary remedy for obesity, cellulite, swollen abdomen, and so on.
12. Provides muscle tone.
13. It is a very good appetizer.
14. Helps to burn fat, lowers cholesterol. Very good food for weight control diets or cholesterol-lowering.
15. A great remedy for disorders of kidney and bladder (cystitis), because it kills bacteria in the urinary tract.

 HEALTHY GRILL USA–The first grill restaurant concept that will bring to the food service market grill food exempt from carcinogens.

We are bringing“the solution”
 Although the restaurant industry is very competitive, the lifestyle changes created by modern living continue to fuel its steady growth. Today, people are having some difficulties in managing their time, resources, and ability to cook for themselves. Trends are very important and our project will be well positioned for the current interest in lighter healthier foods . HEALTHY GRILL USA will be offering healthy grilled food for the American consumers to contribute towards future healthy generations. What we propose will become a new grill food lifestyle concept and the future of the grilled food industry ! The mentioned issues (see Grill Dangers and Benefits ) will not exist at our restaurants.  We are bringing a real solution concerning grills and grilled food. It is possible to significantly reduce some carcinogens and even eliminate the creation of other ones including mitigating their effect by the use of:

 The right grill method - The grill concept that we developed (the only grill method with these special characteristics), helps to maintain the minerals and vitamins of the food, keeping them rich and succulent with its excellent, natural flavors eliminating the production of any carcinogens. 

 

 Grilling like we do, also eliminate up to sixty-five percent of the fat without losing the minerals. Food retains its natural juices and even when well done, the meat remains tender and moist. As a result of mai

ntaining most of its minerals, the use of salt as seasoning is thereby reduced.

The results only can be possible to obtain due to a specifically developed concept for this exact purpose. This method has several years of study and improvement in order to achieve these results.

Another aspect to our concept is th

at we use clean energy sources that are environmentally friendly. The developed technique that uses those sources releases its heat indirectly, resulting in extremely low-cost food production contributing to maintain very affordable and competitive prices.

Other uses methods in order to targe

t our goals are:

 Proper marinating to reduce the formation of some compounds
 

 The use of high-quality products (Selected suppliers)
 

 Using side dishes and drinks rich in antioxidants–can neutralize some of the toxins by mixing in one’s stomach. 

 

 There are no restaurants or any food chains in the United States that use our know-how– Grilling method–or can deliver the results we achieve. 

 We didn’t develop our project to compete. We just want to give people a chance to have the healthiest and juicy grilled food! 

 

 SHARING ALL THE INFORMATION WE PROVIDE AND OUR WEBSITE ADDRESS, YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROJECT SOON BECOME REALITY. ONE OF OUR GOALS WE CAN BE IMPLANTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITHIN A FEW YEARS. FOR THOSE GOALS BECOME QUICKLY IN REALITY, WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF FRANCHISES.

 Foods with high glycemic index can harm the body 
 Posted by Healthy Grill USA on May 14, 2012 Posted in: Health Danger , Healthy Foods , Healthy Tips , Recipes . 
 Tagged: Carbohydrate , Conditions and Diseases , Diabetes mellitus , Diabetes mellitus type 2 , Glycemic index , Harvard School of Public Health , health , healthy food , Low-carbohydrate diet , Mediterranean diet , Saturated fat . 5 comments 

 

Since 1970, here in the United States began to reduce the percentage of calories from saturated fat, but obesity rates during this period more than doubled. The rates of diabetes and heart disease tripled are still the leading cause of death in the population.

Recent research suggests that the processed carbohydrates , which many people eat today in place of saturated fats , may increase the risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease more than saturated fat intake

Meir Stampfer is a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health and an author of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that followed 322 obese for two years, when they adopted one of three diets: low dietary intake of fat , Mediterranean diet –caloric restriction diet rich in vegetables and low in red meat, diet with low carbohydrate intake without caloric restriction.

Although they made a diet low in carbohydrates have eaten more saturated fats, they finished the study with healthier levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol and lost twice as much weight than those who ate low in saturated fat.

Another study examined 65 000 women and found that those who ate more rapidly absorbed carbohydrates–which have a high glycemic index –had a 47% greater likelihood of acquiring type 2 diabetes than those who ate foods of low glycemic index (the amount of fat intake did not affect the risk of diabetes).

I’m not saying that people should start eating saturated fats in any quantity. What is being shown that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates with high glycemic index as well as provide no benefit, may, however, cause damage to the body.
