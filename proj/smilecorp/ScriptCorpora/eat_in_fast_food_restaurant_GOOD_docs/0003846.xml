 Selling a Used Car 
 Posted on July 10, 2012 by Jane 
I recently sold my car, a 1999 Corolla with 140K miles on it. I bought it 3 years ago for $3,000. And I sold it for…$3,000. I am about as far as you can get from being an expert on cars, but here’s what little advice I have to offer.

 Change the oil frequently. Some people will tell you that this isn’t necessary, but older cars can burn off quite a bit of oil. We found it frugal to use Valvoline for our oil changes. With a $10-off coupon, they cost about $50, but come with free top-offs in between changes, which it itself would have been $30-$35 worth of oil. By keeping the oil clean and full, we preserved the value of our car, as well as our own safety while driving it. Perform regular maintenance. This car did need some maintenance over the three years we owned it, and almost all of that maintenance could have been put off. However, putting it off would have made the car unsafe and raised the chance of more expensive maintenance in the future. Replacing a $90 serpentine belt can save thousands in repairs, so preventative maintenance is key. Advertise online, but don’t underestimate the sign in the windshield. Craigslist is a great place to advertise car sales for free, but what ended up working for me was parking the car in a visible spot with a bright orange posterboard in the windshield displaying the mileage, price, year, and my phone number. Write large and clear, and don’t bother with“for sale”…that’s obvious. Price fairly. Know the Blue Book value of your car, be realistic about the condition, and then choose a price that’s a bit over what you’d like so that you have room to bargain. Be honest. This one might not help you sell your car, but I just feel like it’s really important. If there’s anything about the car that makes it unsafe or requires costly repair or maintenance, be sure you disclose that information and price accordingly. You should expect that potential buyers will want to drive the car and may also want to have their mechanic check it out. Give yourself time to get the price you want. If you are in a rush to sell, you’ll find there are many people happy to pay you much less than you’re asking. By giving yourself time to sell, if possible, you can wait for the best possible offer. Put some elbow grease into it. It’s hard for potential buyers to see themselves in your car if there’s trash in the backseat and your junk in the glove compartment. Wash the car, vacuum the inside carefully, and clean any stain or spots on the interior. Empty the car of any personal items or garbage, and put any service records you have in the glove compartment (black out any personal information first). I ordered new hubcabs for my car on Amazon for about $25, and it made a huge difference in the way the car looked. 

I was really glad to be able to sell my car and put that $3,000 toward my student loans. I’ll need another car in November, but I don’t need one until then, and it’s nice to be free of the insurance cost and the worry of having a car for a little while.

 Nutrisystem Update 
 Posted on July 3, 2012 by Jane 
Another week on Nutrisystem , and this week was mixed with my birthday, which meant it was also mixed with a good amount of cake. And like an entire thing of Samosa ice cream.

But still, I’ve collectively lost 2 pounds in the last 2 weeks! Somehow! I have no idea how that’s even possible considering I honestly spent this whole 2 weeks sitting in front of a computer and eating cake, but I’ll take it.

This makes me sort of want to stay on Nutrisystem forever, to be honest, since it allows for me to eat tortellini and candy bars and somehow get skinnier. I’ve got nothing on my super-skinny brother who’s out on a crazy hiking expedition and somehow has lost 20 pounds in the last month despite eating over 7000 calories a day, but I’ll take it!

And now I have to stop eating birthday cake. For real.

 30 years, 30 things 
 Posted on June 24, 2012 by Jane 
I turned 30 yesterday! I’ll admit that I was dreading it a little, but it turned out to be pretty nice. People had been asking what I wanted to do for my birthday, though, and I really couldn’t come up with anything. And I couldn’t really even think of much I wanted as a present.

But that’s pretty lucky, right? To want for basically nothing? So I decided instead that I would do 30 things for someone else. It turned out to be mostly successful, thought it was hard to come up with things that I could do right now that we’re just giving money. What did I end up doing?

 Made the final donation for a set of microscopes for a classroom through Donors Choose . Bought Somaly Mam’s book on child slavery to read and pass on to this summer’s students. Wrote letters to my senators about various health issues on which they’ve voted/have upcoming votes. Created reviews for the products on Somaly Mam’s website and placed links to them in a number of gift-giving sites, blogs and posts. Sent a mosquito net to a family in Africa via Nothing but Nets , who is working to eradicate malaria deaths by 2015. Donated a huge stack of puzzles to the retirement home down the street. Filled 3 garbage bags with donations (towels, stockpiled toiletries, clothes, food) for Rosie’s Place in Boston. Made a Kiva loan to help a woman named Immazar buy a cow. Started a fundraiser to raise money for our hill tribe school in Thailand. Contributed to a scholarship fund for SMARTS , the arts camp that basically saved my life in high school. Signed and shared a petition to help a deserving young woman get US citizenship, and wrote to a few relevant politicians about the issue. Donated 2 bags of clothes to a shelter. Filled a suitcase with donations for the people we visit in Thailand, including free toiletries and office supplies collected through the year and gloves from a small glove drive to be used for farm work. Bought a bunch of protein bars to send to my brother and his wife while they’re hiking the Appalachian Trail. Helped a high school kid who was trying to raise $300 for wrestling camp to design a campaign/plan so he could raise the money, and started him out with a small donation. Brought a set of study guides to the security guard where I work, who has been trying to study for an entrance exam while working 2 jobs. Helped my grandmother clean out 2 big bags of wrapping supplies and small gifts to donate to Birthday Wishes, which throws birthday parties for kids in homeless shelters. Helped my mom clean out one box of supplies for Birthday Wishes, and cleaned up her storage room. Donated all my wrapping supplies and my stockpile of presents to Birthday Wishes. Donated a stack of puzzles and games to the library. Encouraged my family and friends to collect over 100 bottles and packages of small toiletries to bring with us to Thailand and give to people in need. These donations filled almost half a suitcase. Mailed a box of board games to a family in Texas in need of free ways to keep their family entertained over the summer. Sent a letter to one of my grandmother’s friends who needed some cheering up. Helped a former student with her college applications. Spent a day fixing things at my parents’house: now they have a non-leaking showerhead, a working car radio, all their files backed up on a harddrive, and my mom has a way to accept credit cards for her business. Donated $20 in grocery money to a kid from Kansas who is living at a university doing physics research for the summer, but didn’t have any food. Donated to Charity:Water via this girl , who’s using her 29th birthday to try to raise $5,000 for people to have cleaner water. Cleaned up some trash at a field near my house. Made a donation of children’s books to a family shelter nearby. Helped my grandmother wrap, pack and ship birthday presents for my cousin and 90-year-old aunt. 

Will any of those things save the world? Nope. And in all honesty I probably won’t remember them any more than I’d remember a different birthday present. But it did make me feel just a little bit more grateful for what I do have, and that counts for a lot. And hopefully a couple people will have a day that’s a little bit better.

 Nutrisystem Protein Shakes 
 Posted on June 14, 2012 by Jane 
These Nutrisystem Protein Shakes have really been a life-changer for me these past few weeks.

I’ve decided that if nothing else, I’m keeping a protein shake as part of my day. That can be done pretty affordably, and it seems to make a difference in my energy level for the day. Plus, it stops me from feeling hungry at work, which is a big help.

I have to say that the Nutrisystem shakes are particularly good, and I can imagine that I would keep buying them. If nothing else, I’ll always be adding instant coffee to my protein shakes in an effort to make them taste more like the Nutrisystem coffee shake.

I’m also finding what a difference it makes to eat breakfast. Yes, I know, breakfast, everyone’s all about it. And like once a month I try to start eating something for breakfast, but I last about a day until it just grosses me out.

The protein shake in the morning is, it seems, something I can stick with. It’s not as offensive to me as normal breakfast, and it actually seems to change the course of my day. So if you’re not a breakfast person, that’s something you might want to try!

 Tips for selling a car? 
 Posted on June 14, 2012 by Jane 
I’m really sad that I need to sell my car. I love my little Corolla, and I’ve kept it in great condition. I would happily drive it for the next three years, with no shame.

But, I’m going to be away for about 4 months, and the mechanic says it’s a mistake to let it sit for that long without being driven. So the wiser plan is to sell it, and buy another car when I return.

I honestly thought it would be a breeze. I’ve cleaned it, it’s in great shape, I live in a city so there’s a large available market, and I priced it under blue book value. I put it on Craigslist and thought,“Sweet, that’s done.”

But now it’s 2 weeks later and I still have this car. I only have 2 weeks to get it sold!

Anyone have any ideas?

 Just Don’t Buy Anything 
 Posted on June 14, 2012 by Jane 
In the last couple weeks, I’ve ramped up my efforts at curbing my spending in an effort to make one final push toward my loans before my birthday.

 I’ve found that the most effective method is simple, though boring: Don’t. Buy. Anything. 

If I choose a period of time and decide that I simply won’t buy anything, that becomes a fairly easy task. It’s easier for me than budgeting or trying to watch my spending. So for the last two days, for example, I haven’t bought anything.

The only exception to this rule, when you’re doing it to save, is you should buy something if avoiding it has future costs down the road. I wouldn’t avoid paying for parking if it meant getting a ticket that would be paid in the future, for example.

So in two days, I’ve spend about $4 on parking, and that’s it. It’s a surprisingly freeing exercise. 

My loans are now down to $15,000. Yes, that’s still a lot of money. But tomorrow, when I get paid and am able to take a stab at them again, it will be below $13,800, which means they will be only 10% of what they once were.

 Get off me, Sallie Mae.

 Rebates: ballet flats and packing tape 
 Posted on June 6, 2012 by Jane 
The last few weeks, I’ve gotten back into playing the drugstore game a little bit. My schedule has opened enough a little and my budget has tightened up, and both those things mean getting back to coupons, which I love.

In the past two weeks, I’ve had a lot of success at Walgreen’s, which I generally avoid because they’re so bad at honoring their advertised sales. However, this week my $8 has gotten me: 

 2 bottles of Omega-3 fish oil tablets ( free after RR) 2 bottle of antacids ( free after RR) 2 box of gummy DHA vitamins (which are really gross) ( free after RR) 2 huge bags of Twizzlers for this summer’s trip (on sale) a roll of packing tape ( free after mail-in rebate) a nail file (the only regular price item here) a pair of Dr. Scholl’s foldable ballet flats ( free after mail-in rebate) a canister of Morton Salt (on clearance) 8 protein bars for my brother’s Appalachian Trail hike (on clearance) a travel adapter for phones and plugs worldwide (on clearance) a travel neck pillow (on clearance) a box of peppermint patties (on clearance) 

For me, that’s totally worth it! I did somehow end up with more RR than I thought I would, so maybe I just lucked out a bit here. The best part is that I was using RR from last week to pay for the whole thing, so I think I spent maybe 80 cents out of pocket .

 Look out for the USPS brand packing tape (on a blue plastic roll), which has a“Try Me Free”rebate offer. Also, the Dr. Scholl’s foldable ballet flats (which cost around $12) have a satisfaction guarantee rebate offer. 

 Are there any other good“Try me free”rebates out now?

 My First Week on Nutrisystem 
 Posted on June 6, 2012 by Jane 
 Nutrisystem is letting me try out their program for a few months, and it’s been a really interesting first week. It doesn’t hurt that I keep getting Janet Jackson songs stuck in my head all day, which for me is a huge plus.

While Nutrisystem has a number of plans, the plan that I’m on provides a breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day, as well as a protein shake and a dessert. You supplement the meals with lean proteins, dairy, fruits and vegetables from the grocery store.

I’m technically considered a“healthy”weight, but I could lose 20 pounds and feel really good about it. But more than just losing weight, I know my nutrition could really use some help. I do eat a lot of fruits and vegetables usually, but I also eat a bunch of junk (hello, diet soda) and not much else. Like I’ll absolutely pick a cupcake over a piece of chicken, and just call that dinner. Not exactly the best.

So my favorite thing so far is that I do actually feel like I’m getting better nutrition that sustains me throughout the day. I’m not eating as much, or eating nearly as much junk. And, let’s be fair, I haven’t been a great student here. I’ve still had an occasional Diet Coke, and I’ve gone out to dinner a few times. And you’re supposed to exercise a total of 30 minutes per day, where some days all I do is walk from my car to work, then back to the car after work.

But I still somehow lost 2 pounds! So that’s a really nice bonus that, honestly, I wasn’t expecting considering how laxly I’ve followed the rules.

I’ve been surprised at how good some of the food is. The coffee protein shakes are amazing. In fact, I think I’m going to add a little instant coffee to every protein shake I have from now on, because the authentic flavor makes it really refreshing. Some of the meals I haven’t loved (I’m looking at you, mushroom risotto), but some of them have been totally great. It’s certainly more variety than I would normally prepare for myself, considering that when I’m home alone I seem to eat in ingredients instead of meals.

I think I’m starting to see that part of efficiency may be paying more for things that help you stay healthy, which improves your life overall. I can imagine that having some sort of guidance in what to eat could really be worth it–not because you don’t know what you’re supposed to eat, but just because it’s easier to actually do it when you don’t have to think about it. 

I wonder what other things I can automate so that they do the thinking for me? That’s a serious question–any ideas?

 Short-term pay vs. Long-term investment 
 Posted on June 1, 2012 by Jane 
My job has finally gone out of crazy mode, freeing up a good amount of time in my schedule over the next month. So I have a choice. Do I take on some small projects that pay out now, though at below my usual rate? Or do I work on some things I’m hoping will pay off in a bigger way in the future, forgoing more income now? 

I think there are a few things to consider when making this decision.

 (1) How much do you need the money right now? Simply put, I don’t need it. I want to pay off my loans, very much. And because I have loans, that means I’m losing money every day. Which I hate.

But I don’t really need to have any more income right now. I have enough work set up for June and July that I can travel August-October (as usual) and be in an okay position when I come back to work in November.

I’ve been in situations before where I really needed to increase my income right then, and in those cases I find that pretty much any rate of pay is acceptable. I mean, if you work for $5/hour, you still have $5 at the end of it instead of nothing. Sometimes you don’t have other options, and in those cases, I take the work and try not to think about the cost.

But now isn’t one of those times, so maybe it’s not worth the effort.

 (2) How easy is it to find more work? In other words, do you have another option on the table right now? Or do you have to scavenge around to find odd projects?

This has a huge impact on whether I’m willing to do more work. If I’ve already have the opportunity available, I usually go for it. But finding opportunities for work, starting them, and ensuring that they go as planned usually takes a lot more effort than you want. For a short-term investment, it sometimes isn’t worth it.

 (3) What else could you be doing during that time? Basically, try to think about what value your time has other than for work purposes.

For me, this is really dependent on the weather. In the winter, I’ll take whatever work comes along, because there’s really nothing else to do and otherwise I’m just grumbling around the house.

But in the summer, I can spend those hours outside, reading in the park or walking around the city. Maybe I’d rather have those free hours in the summer and pile on the work in the winter. Time doesn’t come free; whatever you’re doing is something else you’re not doing. And on that note…

 (4) How strongly do you believe in your other projects? I have a book that I’ve been working on for a couple years, and I really think it’s great. It needs some TLC before I put it out into the world though, because there are some changes that I know will improve it.

If I believe in that project, it would be silly not to invest the time necessary to make it as good as it can be.

 For me, looking for more work doesn’t make sense now. I have to tell myself this because otherwise I’ll spend a whole day on Craigslist looking for $20 and $40 jobs. But it’s a beautiful day, so I’m going to spend a few hours outside instead, and then get to work on this book for a couple hours. And then go to the two jobs I already have.

 Are you facing this trade-off? Are there factors I forgot to consider?
