 Not Ranked      How to end up duct taped in a dumpster...... Johnstown, PA (GlossyNews) - Local and state police scoured the hills outside rural Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after reports of three animal rights activists going missing after attempting to protest the wearing of leather at a large motorcycle gang rally this weekend. Two others, previously reported missing, were discovered by fast food workers&quot;duct taped inside fast food restaurant dumpsters,&quot;according to police officials.

&quot;Something just went wrong,&quot;said a still visibly shaken organizer of the protest.&quot;Something just went horribly, horribly, wrong.&quot;The organizer said a group of concerned animal rights activist groups,&quot;growing tired of throwing fake blood and shouting profanities at older women wearing leather or fur coats,&quot;decided to protest the annual motorcycle club event&quot;in a hope to show them our outrage at their wanton use of leather in their clothing and motor bike seats.&quot;&quot;In fact,&quot;said the organizer,&quot;motorcycle gangs are one of the biggest abusers of wearing leather, and we decided it was high time that we let them know that we disagree with them using it. ergo, they should stop.&quot;

According to witnesses, protesters arrived at the event in a vintage 1960&apos;s era Volkswagen van and began to pelt the gang members with balloons filled with red colored water, simulating blood, and shouting&quot;you&apos;re murderers&quot;to passers by. This, evidently, is when the brouhaha began.

&quot;They peed on me!!!&quot;charged one activist.&quot;They grabbed me, said I looked like I was French, started calling me &apos;La Trene&apos;, and duct taped me to a tree so they could pee on me all day!&quot;

Still others claimed they were forced to eat hamburgers and hot dogs under duress. Those who resisted were allegedly held down while several bikers&quot;farted on their heads.&quot;

Police officials declined comments on any leads or arrests due to the ongoing nature of the investigation; however, organizers for the motorcycle club rally expressed&quot;surprise&quot;at the allegations.

&quot;That&apos;s preposterous,&quot;said one high-ranking member of the biker organizing committee.&quot;We were having a party, and these people showed up and were very rude to us. They threw things at us, called us names, and tried to ruin the entire event. So, what did we do? We invited them to the party! What could be more friendly than that? You know, just because we are all members of motorcycle clubs does not mean we do not care about inclusiveness. Personally, I think it shows a lack of character for them to be saying such nasty things about us after we bent over backwards to make them feel welcome.&quot;

When confronted with the allegations of force-feeding the activists meat, using them as ad hoc latrines, leaving them incapacitated in fast food restaurant dumpsters, and &apos;farting on their heads,&apos; the organizer declined to comment in detail.&quot;That&apos;s just our secret handshake,&quot;assured the organizer.

 Not Ranked      If you are stupid enough to go to a biker club event and do dumb shit like throw simulated blood filled ballons at them, then you deserve what ever they do to you. What did they think would happen? The bikers would curl and walk away like those old ladies did earlier?

Protesting the wearing of leather from cows? What else do you do with a cow except eat it and make stuff with its hide.

I had a bunch of animal activists bitch at me while they were protesting the eating of beef at a McDonald&apos;s in Hollywood once. I told them there was no beef in a McDonald&apos;s hamburger so what were they crying about? What a bunch of fucking morons.
