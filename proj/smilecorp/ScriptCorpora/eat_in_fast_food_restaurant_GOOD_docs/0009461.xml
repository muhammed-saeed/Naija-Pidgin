Chipotle wants Susanna Foo&apos;s Center City location
 Extremely primitive photo illustration / The Insider 
For nearly a quarter-century until it closed last June, Susanna Foo Chinese Cuisine was one of the landmarks of Philadelphia&apos;s Restaurant Row, occupying the brownstone at Walnut and Sydenham Streets.

Foo sold 1512 Walnut to a partnership that intends to redevelop the property.

The building&apos;s upper floors are being fashioned into apartments, but I can report exclusively that the prospective new tenant for the ground floor is Chipotle Mexican Grill, a growing quick-serve concept.

Talk is that this location -- Chipotle&apos;s first Center City spot -- will respect the building with a green design and will be a flagship of sorts.

The developer, 1512 Walnut Partners LP, has filed papers with the city Zoning Board of Adjustment to fast-track a use variance to allow accessory takeout. Its hearing date is scheduled for Feb. 3.

If it&apos;s granted, perhaps we&apos;ll see an all-out burrito war with the Qdoba down the block. (Both eateries should experience a degree of synergy with the Apple store coming to 1607 Walnut .)

I&apos;ve left messages with Chipotle reps to seek further details, such as a timeline.

We already have a McDonald&apos;s and Qdoba. What&apos;s next, the Wendy&apos;s on Chestnut Street will move into one of the vacant store fronts. What a shame. I love Philadelphia, but it is dying.  rs505 Sign in to report abuse Post your response

More like crappy Mexican fast food ala Mc Donalds, its one time owner. Sad to see the decline of Chestnut Street.  bjps1353 Sign in to report abuse Post your response

Talk about your bandwagon hoppers. We have had 3 Iron Chefs pass through here, one the current talk of the nation. Steven Starr also showcases well and the small restaurants tend to be hits too. On top of that, Philadelphia has been branded a brunch capital of the city. One small Chipotle takes over in a prior chapel to the asian cuisine resurrection and let&apos;s all go crazy about it!  Douggernaut Sign in to report abuse Post your response

They even had their special Tour de France burrito that was available in July.  catnameddomino Sign in to report abuse Post your response

 Sign in to report abuse Select a username to report abuse Confirm your registration to report abuse 0 like this / 0 don&apos;t   Posted 9:42 PM, 01/21/2010 Philadelphia isn&apos;t dying, it&apos;s booming. Susanna Foo was priced out of Walnut by high rents last year, just like Brasserie Perrier. This isn&apos;t a sign of death, on the contrary it&apos;s another sign that Walnut Street near Rittenhouse is so in demand that only large national chains can afford to rent space there. 

In the 90&apos;s, Walnut St. restaurants like Susanna Foo ignited a restaurant renaissance that has turned Philly into one of the nation&apos;s culinary capitals. It also set off a chain reaction that made Walnut more attractive to upscale national chains, and eventually far too expensive for a local start-up restaurant. It&apos;s all out in the neighborhoods now - Queens Village, South Philly, Fairmount, Northern Liberties, West Philly all have top-flight restaurants on par with any city in the nation. For all of those who think this is a bad thing, take a trip around and see what your &quot;dying&quot; city has become.  phils08 Sign in to report abuse Post your response

It is why they need a variance because this type of restaurant is not suppose to be on Walnut Street. Just because they have money is not an excuse.  Phillies168 Sign in to report abuse Post your response

I&apos;m sure the landlord is happy. I&apos;m not happy. The big surprise would be if Philadelphians rejected this business by never patronizing it. It won&apos;t happen, I&apos;m sure.  El Metiche Sign in to report abuse Post your response

Or something equally disgusting. Long time economic depression was good for us. We had a nice collection of local stores and restaurants - all with character. Now we get fancy, price the small people out of city center and become like any other economically prosperous Main Street in America - sad corporate chain-shops wall to wall. Unless we stop this trend here.  Uncle Bob Sign in to report abuse Post your response

Chipotle is more like a Cosi (already on Rittenhouse Row, which nobody seems to mind) than McDonald&apos;s/Wendy&apos;s. It serves only no antibiotic and free range meat, which is a lot more responsible than 99% of the &quot;gourmet&quot; restaurants in this town. In this economy, just be glad it&apos;s not a Taco Bell!  mattesq Sign in to report abuse Post your response
