Baja Wrap is Wendy’s Latest Taste Test
 
[ Update : See reader comments below for nutrition info on new wraps. ] 

 Wendy’s is ready to roll out the Bacon Deluxe cheeseburger, but it also is checking out additional potential extensions of its Boneless Wings . In selected markets, Wendy’s is testing a Baja Wrap in conjunction with the previously reported Smokehouse BBQ Wrap .

Appropriately, the Baja gets a more Mexican-influenced flavor profile through pico de gallo and cilantro-lime sauce . Also included are usual wrap suspects shredded lettuce and shredded Cheddar, along with Wendy’s Boneless Wings chicken pieces and the Monterey-Jack-cheese infused tortilla the chain also uses with the Smokehouse BBQ. Both wraps are priced at $4.29 in test markets.

Considering that diners have been able to purchase all four items on Wendy’s 99-cent menu (chili, Frosty, Double Stack burger and baked potato) for a total of $3.96, the $4.29 price for a wrap is indeed premium. The snack-size chicken Go Wraps on Wendy’s menu are priced at about $1.49.

Wendy’s sister chain, Arby’s , featured a line of Market Fresh Wraps for several years before refocusing its menu on Market Fresh Sandwiches and Toasted Subs as primary flankers for its core roast-beef sandwiches.

30 comments to Baja Wrap is Wendy’s Latest Taste Test

 MARY October 14th, 2009 at 12:50 pm 
I would like to know the nutritional value of the new Baja Chicken Wrap. Note: grilled chicken NOT fried.
 Vianey Talamantes October 14th, 2009 at 3:11 pm 
I tried the Baja Wrap for the first time on monday night and I have fallen in love! My only disappointment is that they aren’t sold where I live, I bought my first one at a location in Austin, Texas. Please bring them to Boerne Texas!!!!!!!!
Hungry for more!
 admin October 14th, 2009 at 3:43 pm 
I hope a reader can supply the info since test products are not included on Wendy’s otherwise complete nutrition-information section on its Web site.
 Tara October 15th, 2009 at 3:05 pm 
Baja chicken wraps are sooooooo good! By far the best thing I have ever had at any fast food restaurant!
 Diana October 19th, 2009 at 5:16 pm 
These Baja wraps are fabulous. I’m so dissapointed they don’t make them with grilled chicken. Nutrtional value would be great, but I bet they are high in calories and fat. Darn!
 Eric October 22nd, 2009 at 1:30 pm 
I cannot find any nutrition facts for the Baja Chicken Wrap…Can someone put something together even if it’s a guess?
 Debbie October 23rd, 2009 at 12:36 pm 
I would also be interested in the nutritional information on the Smokehouse BBQ wrap…also very good.
 Brandi October 23rd, 2009 at 2:53 pm 
Smokehouse BBQ wrap has 57 grams fat, 1070 calories&amp;4 grams of fiber. The Baja Wrap has 48 grams of fat, 860 calories, 4 grams of fiber. I called Wendy’s Customer Relations dept to get this information. Unfortunately, I did not ask for the values if they used grilled chicken instead of fried.
 Just ate one October 28th, 2009 at 12:40 pm 
Gawww Damn that’s a lot of calories and fat no wonder they don’t put the information on the website. I was halfway through the smokehouse bbq wrap when I read the amount of fat and calories and threw the rest of it away.
 Robin October 29th, 2009 at 1:47 pm 
I had the Baja Chicken Wrap today and also thought it was fantastic. Too bad the nutritional info is so disappointing…I’ll have to forget I ever had one and will never order it again. You would think there is something they could do to lower the fat and calories…they are way too high for one meal.
 Lynda October 29th, 2009 at 8:51 pm 
Wow–My husband&amp;I also love the Baja wrap. I wish they could make it with grilled chicken too and maybe even a little smaller so the calories won’t be almost a full days supply.
 Jenn October 30th, 2009 at 12:58 pm 
Wow! That’s a shame that it’s so high in (unnecessary)fat and calories. I wish I knew this ahead of time’cause I just scarfed one down. Kudos to Wendy’s cause it really did taste great (just the right amount of zing!) but wow, I’m gonna have to sweat to work that one off.
 craftytammie November 16th, 2009 at 9:35 pm 
Thanks for the info–they are sooo good but I will never eat another one! I had one for lunch today and it tasted so healthy, I am in shock over how much fat there is! Off to the elliptical I go!
 Susan November 30th, 2009 at 12:32 pm 
They are good but too fattening.
 mary manson December 6th, 2009 at 1:42 pm 
well that’s disappointing. a whopper is better than that.
 Tina Smith December 8th, 2009 at 1:04 pm 
I can’t believe these wraps are that many calories and fat. That stinks. I’ve been scarfing them down since they came out. Dang it!!!! Alright, I have to hit the treadmill tonight for at least 24 hours to work this one off that I’m eating right now. ;–(
 paula December 17th, 2009 at 9:08 pm 
My local Wendy’s charges $2.75 extra for grilled chicken.
 Deborah December 19th, 2009 at 2:27 pm 
I live in Austin and absolutely love the Baja Wrap. I just started Weight Watchers and I am on a learning curve. I order grilled chicken and it is no extra charge. I think the problem is the extra large totilla. It is almost twice as large as a regular tortilla. Plus it has some kind of infused cheese in it. The sauce is great and I figured with the lime vinagerette type dressing, that it would not be so much. I guess we could order it with grilled chicken, cut the cheese with the sauce on the side- but it really is not the same product.
 Laura December 19th, 2009 at 3:44 pm 
On the Baja and the smokehouse wraps at the Wendy’s I went to requested grilled chicken and they happily obliged, so do not feel intimated asked for grilled and it is delicious!!
 Dawn December 23rd, 2009 at 10:31 am 
Why not just eat half of one? I’m sure it’s the ranch sauce that also helps to pack on the calories. They are mighty tasty!
 James Hanly December 30th, 2009 at 5:34 pm 
The wrap tastes great–what is the fat and cholesteral content? What kind of oil are you using to fry the chicken? I won’t eat another until I find out this information.
 Dee January 5th, 2010 at 1:15 pm 
I also like the grilled chicken Baja wrap. I cut mine in 1/2 and only eat that 1/2 with a side salad (be careful with your choice of dressing) or I just have a bag of baked lays. Save the other 1/2 for lunch the next day or dinner that nite. It preserves well wrapped tightly overnite.
 hippiepirate January 14th, 2010 at 2:36 pm 
I LOVE the baja wrap with grilled chicken! With fried chicken it’s like 860 calories…with grilled it’s about 420! Not to shabby! Not to mention they make them HUGE!
 mandersure January 20th, 2010 at 3:22 pm 
If you are on the Alli pills do not eat the wraps. There is way too much fat in them. I love the Baja but I have to split it up into three meals about 2 hours apart!
 Mandy Cuter January 28th, 2010 at 6:55 pm 
They are absolutely the best thing that I’ve had at any fast food restaurant. They should definatly offer it with grilled chicken though, they’d do way better in sales! AND! I’d love to know when they are going to hit other Wendy’s. I had one in Florida, and was sooo upset when they didn’t have them here in South Carolina. I hope they stick around they’re amazing!!
 Kena January 30th, 2010 at 5:24 pm 
These wraps are fantastic! A friend and I grabbed a wrap each in Alabama at a gas station wendys. They both looked so good on the menu that we couldnt choose so she got the baha and I got the smokehouse, we shared and were quite pleased! They really pack on the flavor with these two. Hands down best thing ive ever had from a fast food chain…and they were massive! Very disappointed to find they arent at my local wendys here in MS so in fact that I left without ordering…these items should be here to stay! The calorie count is pretty hefty so take a run afterwards…its worth it!!!
 Laura January 30th, 2010 at 7:08 pm 
I just Had one today and after paying asked for the nutritional info and the kids said he didnt know….now I find this…I ruined my calorie intake for the whole day on that one :-(
 Valerie March 11th, 2010 at 9:03 pm 
I just had the baja wrap tonight with grilled chicken, it was fantastic. I just asked if I would have it with grilled chicken and they did it. I live in CT.
 Leslie April 9th, 2010 at 2:45 pm 
Indeed the Baja wrap is yummy! I also live in CT like the previous poster. If I order it again, I will see if they can do it with a grilled piece of chicken. Gotta go work it off now.
 Vannesa Curry December 10th, 2010 at 4:23 am 
Beats McD’s and BurgerKing anytime ! Great taste, no additional flavor agents. Like a backyard barbecue.
