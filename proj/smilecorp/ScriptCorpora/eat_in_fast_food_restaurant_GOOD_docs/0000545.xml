 The food industry&apos;s focus upon HMR has made it a whole &quot;new&quot; marketing category with a worth of $89 billion in 1998. This 

Packaged Facts report helps both restaurant and grocery execs to cash in on HMR&apos;s potential sale of $106 billion by 2003. This report provides the essential knowledge needed to fully exploit the HMR market, including discussions of market influences, corporate strategies, new products, and demographics. The battle plans of McDonald&apos;s, Tricon, Tyson, Sara Lee, Kroger, and others are profiled. Individual sections are available. 



 Additional Information 

 Scope and Methodology
Market Definition 
This Packaged Facts report examines the U.S. marketplace for home meal replacements (HMRs) as retailed through restaurant and grocery outlets. Packaged Facts defines HMR as any meal that is pre-cooked, partially cooked, or fully ready-to-eat (R-T-E), and that is sold for consumption in the home. Examples include a takeout/take-home meal from a restaurant, a takeout/take-home meal from a grocery deli counter, or a packaged meal that may or may not re-quire heating up.
Frozen meal products are excluded as are prepared meats/poultry items sold in refrigerated form, unless they are sold as components of refrigerated dinners. Packaged snack and dessert products are also excluded.
 Our Methodology for Estimating Sales Fig-ures 
Packaged Facts arrives at its HMR sales figures by taking into account hard numerical data, marketplace conditions, and national economic and societal trends. The HMR market is huge, very diffi-cult to estimate with any accuracy, and driven by powerful forces, mostly positive.
Available estimates of HMR sales differ by tens of billions of dollars. The most qualified sources, however, give estimates that are within reasonable range of Packaged Facts’ own views of both his-torical and future sales.
Packaged Facts has considered hard data from a range of sources, both governmental and private in arriving at the size of the HMR market. These sources include trade publications, both public and proprietary databases, company literature, and interviews with HMR executives.
