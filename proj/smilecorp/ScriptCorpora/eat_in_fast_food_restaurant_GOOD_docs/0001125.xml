Amusement Park Survival Guide
 
Spring is in the air and it gets you thinking about traveling.  Some of the hottest destinations a family vacations are amusement parks.  Being from a small town I was always overcome with excitement as a child at the prospect of going to an actual amusement park.  Kings Island was usually our summertime destination.  I remember it fondly.  But what I do not remember so fondly was the trip there.  Crowded in the Rambler (yes Rambler) our family would truck down the road to our destination.  Already problems arise.  The obvious was that we were in a Rambler.  The second obvious was that my Dad was driving.  My Dad wasn&apos;t a bad driver, but he was a bad planner.  Most families would hop on the interstate.  Nope not my dad.  We took 300 miles of  a two lane road.  This meant one slower travel time and two me my mom and my sister were going to be sick at some point on the trip.   Then when our stomachs were feeling good and upset  my dad would stop at a fast food restaurant named .. Stuckeys.  Those of you from Ohio may remember this fast food chain, but I would as soon forget it  The ol Stuckeys burger stuck to your gut for the rest of the trip.  My Dad, he didn&apos;t seem to mind it so much.
 
Arriving at our grandmas house whe would stay there until we were taken to the amusement park and the zoo.  There seemed to be a lot of tension in the air when we stayed.  Here are some tips to make your trip to the amusement park a little more bearable

Planning
 
A successful vacation is all in the planning.  After making a decision about where you are going no doubt you popped on the Internet and hit up Priceline.com or another travel website. If you are going on a long trip with family it might be wise to find an interesting midway point to stop at.  A GPS system can help you get to those midway points or even tell you about an event  or attraction you did not know was happening.  It is wise to do additional research when traveling about the states  you will be driving through. If yo look up the Chamber of Commerce website for specific towns they will have a list of festivals or fairs in that area.  Sometimes the Chamberof Commerce might be able to direct you to a travel agency affiliated with them.  I was able to get Fright Night Tickets for Kings Island Amusement Park and tickets for the Renaissance Festival last year this way.  I didn&apos;t even know about the Renaissance festival!

Traveling with children. Any parent knows that they have to have a bag full of tricks when traveling with children. If the trip is long and you are traveling by car you need to have a back up plan to keep the children entertained. A lot of times children are able to keep themselves busy with their MP 3 players or their Nintendo DS. That is all well and good but here are a few more ideas to keep your child occupied during your travel.

An older child might be well entertained with a travel book. The Everything Kids Activity Travel book  does have a little of everything.  There are games, songs, activities and quizzes. Some of he activities include playing detective and building and automobile  There is even a place for a weather diary. Parent reviews give this book high marks stating it even kept her 3 year old and 5 year old entertained

Gear for the Amusement park
 
You might want to stop at your local walmart or take a look at the fanny packs on their right. A fanny pack is a really helpful thing to have at an amusement park. It is hands free and help you keep all of those hard to put in your pockets items such as sunglasses, credit cards and even money. Fanny packs for kids are also a good idea. They can keep the object they ask you to hold throughout the amusement park trip. Fanny packs are really great thing to have when you go on a roller coaster ride too. Do you know how many cell phones are lost on the loopty loop!  The first fanny pack is definitely made with the parent in mind.   A little bigger and an extra carrying compartment for the cell phone.  The second  set of fanny packs are a simpler one compartment packet with a small packet in front.  These would be good for kids and look how many different colors there are!  Kids would not get their backpacks confused!

One of the first things you should do when you come into the amusement park is make a plan with your family. The plan should include a place to meet if you become separated. Maybe it is the big Ferris Wheel or maybe it is a huge fountain. It should be someplace visible that would make it easier for kids to get to and see. Also acquaint yourselves and you children with the security department and the first aid station. If your child is very small a child locator may not be a bad idea. Hook the bear to the child on a shoe lace or a clothing strap. You will have a keychain remote. A beeping sound will come from the bear when the button is pushed. See the parent reviews for more information. Overall parents like ti but there were some stipulations on the kinds of clothing you can wear while wearing the bear.

Prepare for the worst
 
There should be a list of some things you should keep with you on a trip. If you are taking a credit card with you then you need to keep their credit card number ( with the code on back) and the phone number to the credit card company somewhere accessible. Maybe you can keep it it a calendar or maybe you can keep it on a laptop. Keep it somewhere you can access it in case you lose your card. Also keep pictures of your child on you. Don&apos;t rely on cell phone pictures. At least have a couple of photographs on paper.

Dress comfortable. Wear your most comfortable sneakers and clothing appropriate for the time of the year. If you are planning a day at the water park wear your croc or sandals. It is important you wear the right footwear for the activity you are doing.

Take a time out. No doubt you will stand in lines. Take a time out in the middle of the day to regroup or just take a break. Have a picnic at a shelter or by the fountain.

Don&apos;t wear yourself out. If you wear yourself out you will be miserable. Plan accordingly,. If you have small kids take a wagon with you. Your back will thank you for it. If you have hotel room and you need to go back to the hotel then go and take a nap!

Plan for uptime and down time. Try to intermingle the amusement park activities. One activity could be the roller coaster, the next activity could be a show. Don&apos;t go straight form roller coaster to roller coaster unless you think your body can take it.

Don&apos;t go on rides you don&apos;t think you can handle. If you don&apos;t do well at the dizzy rides then don&apos;t go on them ( I don&apos;t) If you are terrified of roller coasters or heights stay off those rides. I know this is common sense but I have seem many adults do activities for the sake of their kids and it ended badly. If ou are questionable then take your Dramamine!

Excellent advice Ms Chievous, I love going on family vacations/trips but never go without extensive planning. I always plan extra time in the traveling route to allow for construction or whatever. Unfortunately fanny packs went out of style in 1987 so I always either wear pants or pocketed shorts or I take a small backpack, or use my wife&apos;s purse to put my stuff. Thanks for the advice.
