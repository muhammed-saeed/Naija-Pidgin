Swimmer Nutrition

 
 
 
 FATS : Fat are also an energy source for swimmers, but it takes 20 - 30 minutes from the time an athlete starts to exercise until enough fat is available to be of much help during exercise. Cakes, pies, French fries, chips and pastries are foods high in fat. Swimmers have no problem in consuming fatty foods. In fact, they usually consume too much fat and as a result don’t eat enough carbohydrates. 

 PROTEIN : Protein, found throughout the body, is necessary to build all body cells. It is possible to use protein for energy; however, it’s one of its least important functions in the body. Only during starvation or extreme malnutrition does the body use protein as a source of fuel. 

 HOW MUCH CARBOHYDRATE, FAT AND PROTEIN DO SWIMMERS NEED? 

 It has been clearly shown that swimmers in training need more calories and these extra calories should be coming from food high in carbohydrates. A swimmer’s diet should contain an energy nutrients balance that includes: 

 12-15% PROTEIN 25-30% FAT 55-70% CARBOHYDRATE 

 VITAMINS : Vitamins help control growth of all body tissue. They are also essential for the release of energy in the body. The body cannot make most vitamins, therefore you must supply these vitamins to your body in what you eat and drink. Vitamins are widely distributed in the foods that make up the typical diet. Most swimmers can obtain all essential vitamins they need by eating a wide variety of foods from the four food groups that include meat, dairy products, vegetables and grain products. 

 MINERALS : Like vitamins, minerals are involved in an endless number of jobs in the body. The major functions of minerals are building cells and controlling body processes. Swimmers who constantly eat inadequate diets may require minerals. Important minerals include calcium, iodine, iron an phosphorous. 

 DO SWIMMERS NEED TO TAKE EXTRA VITAMINS AND MINERALS? 

 Although deficiencies of vitamins and minerals can result in poor performance, there is no evidence that vitamins and minerals taken in excess of the normal daily requirements will enhance performance. Swimmers can automatically increase their vitamin and mineral intake if they make wise food choice from the five food groups. 

 Competition Cuisine 

 Swimming fast is a result of hard training, dedication and making wise food choices. The type of food a swimmer eats may influence how they compete in the water. They key to nutrition and swimming is to make sure that you have eaten enough carbohydrates before the competition starts, not the day before the meet. It may take 24-27 hours to fully reload the muscles with energy (glycogen). It is important for swimmers to consume meals high in carbohydrates at least 2-3 DAYS before the start of a meets, or performance will deteriorate and even an easy workout or race may cause fatigue. 

 It is often difficult for swimmers who are traveling to find nutritious meals that are high in carbohydrates. Fast-food restaurants are often chosen because they are convenient and affordable. To ensure that swimmers make wise food choices while on the road, a coach or swimmer can decide where to eat before mealtime, making sure the restaurant offers choices from all four food groups, while concentrating on high carbohydrate meals. Use the following guidelines in choosing meals while traveling: 

 BREAKFAST 

 Order pancakes, waffles, French toast, bagels, cereal, English muffins, fruit or juice. These foods are all high in carbohydrates. Avoid high-fat choices such as bacon, sausage, or biscuits and gravy. Pack containers of dry cereal, crackers, juice or dried fruit such as raisins, apricots or pack fresh fruits such as apples or oranges in case the restaurant does not provide these items. If you eat breakfast at a fast food restaurant, choose foods like cereal, fruit juice and muffins, or pancakes. Avoid breakfast sandwiches, sausage and bacon.

LUNCH AND DINNER 

 Try restaurants that offer pasta dishes, and salads. Order thick crust rather than thin crust pizza for more carbohydrates. Order vegetables such as mushrooms and green peppers on the pizza. Avoid high fat toppings such as pepperoni and sausage. Order vegetable soups accompanied by crackers, bread or muffins. Emphasize the bread in sandwiches, not the filling, mayonnaise or potato chips. Avoid fat fried foods such as French fries, fried fish and fried chicken. Choose low-fat milk or fruit juices rather than soda pop.

If the swimmer cannot afford all three meals at a restaurants, they should choose breakfast for the team meal. With selections such as cereal (hot or cold), bagels, English muffins, pancakes, toast, fruit and fruit juice, breakfast can be inexpensive and the easiest way to consume carbohydrate-rich foods. If your budget does not allow restaurants meals or if you only have day trips, a nearby grocery store will offer an alternative for great variety of foods. Such stores may have delicatessen or a soup and salad bar, and swimmers can pick up fresh fruits and vegetables, low fat milk and dairy products. Grocery stores are not only fast and easy to find they can also be cheaper source of meals than restaurant. 

 For swimmers who compete at all-day swimming meets choosing nutritious food throughout the day may be a problem. The swimmer should consider the amount of time between eating and racing when choosing foods to eat. The hot dogs, nachos, potato chips or candy bars found at most concession stands are extremely high in fat and usually will not be digested quickly. When these goods are eaten as a pre-event meal they may impair performance. Suggested pre-racing menus include the following: 

 ONE HOUR OR LESS BEFORE COMPETITION 

 Fruit and vegetable juice such as orange, tomato or V-8 AND/OR Fresh fruit such as apples, watermelon, peaches, grapes or oranges AND/OR 1-1/2 cups of a sport drink like Gatorade or Power-Aid 

 TWO OR THREE HOURS BEFORE COMPETITION 

 Fresh Fruit and fruit and vegetable juices AND Bread, bagels, English muffins with limited amounts of butter, margarine or crackers with cheese or peanut butter AND/OR 4 cups of a sport drink like Gatorade 

 THREE TO FOUR HOURS BEFORE COMPETITION 

 Fresh fruit and fruit and vegetable juices AND Breads, bagels, baked potatoes, cereal with low-fat or skim milk, low-fat yogurt sandwiches with a small amount of peanut butter or lean meats and cheese AND/OR 7-1/2 cups of a sports drink like Gatorade or Power-Aid 

 When eating a meal at a fast food restaurant, try not to make it a dietary disaster. A typical fast food meal is high in fat and low in calcium, Vitamin A, and Vitamin C. It is difficult to choose a high carbohydrate meal at a fast food restaurant. Beware, or you can eat half the calories a swimmer needs in one meal. Satisfy your hunger and nutrition needs by using the menus listed below as guidelines.

 FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID 

   

  
 
FLUID REPLACEMENT 

 It is important for the swimmer to realize drinking water is important. In fact, one-half cup of water every 10-15 minutes helps to replace body fluids lost as the swimmers sweat. Many swimmers are unaware that they are sweating as they swim. Sport drinks can be beneficial especially if swimmers are training longer than 60 minutes. The rule of thumb is 6-8% carbohydrates fluids; this means 1/2 strength fruit juice and full sports drink.
