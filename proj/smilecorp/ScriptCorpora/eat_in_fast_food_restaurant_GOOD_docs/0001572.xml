Tim Hortons to raise price of coffee; revenue up nearly 11 per cent


 Published on October 30th, 2009 Published on June 15th, 2010 The Canadian Press   Topics : Tim Hortons Inc. , TSX , Wendy&apos;s , United States , TORONTO , Quebec 

TORONTO - Tim Hortons Inc. (TSX:THI) is boosting the price of a cup of coffee in Quebec, Manitoba and the Maritimes early next month as it contends with higher costs for running its franchised stores.

Executives for the iconic coffee, doughnut and sandwich chain told analysts in a conference call that the price increase would be rolled out during in the first two weeks of November, and that it would range from five to seven cents for a cup on coffee.

The decision comes as it grapples with higher operational costs that range from the price of coffee beans to a minimum wage increase in some parts of the country.

In September, the company increased the price of some of its products at Ontario stores, mostly by five cents each.

&quot;This year our store owners probably faced more of a combination of pressures, not only on the raw material side of things, but also from a labour perspective,&quot; said chief financial officer Cynthia Devine in an interview.

&quot;They held the line on pricing for a very long time.&quot;

On Friday, Tim Hortons served investors with another quarter of revenue growth, even as profits shrank compared with the same time last year, as it ate $23.1 million in costs associated with converting back into a Canadian corporation.

Revenue increased to $563.6 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, up 10.7 per cent from just under $509 million in the comparable quarter of 2008.

The biggest increase was at Tim&apos;s Canadian stores, which brought in $492 million, up $50 million from the third quarter of 2008.

But U.S. stores also increased total sales, which grew by $7.8 million or nearly 25 per cent to $38.9 million.

Same-store sales, which measure performance of locations open for at least a year, increased 3.1 per cent in Canada and 4.3 per cent in the United States.

Despite the sales growth, net income fell to $61.2 million or 34 cents per share in the quarter, down 22.3 per cent from a year ago.

&quot;Performance was delivered in a tough operating environment that continued to be framed by persistently high unemployment levels as well as other pressures in the North American economy,&quot; president and CEO Don Schroeder said in a conference call with analysts.

&quot;I think its fairly obvious to most observers that economic recovery has been a challenge and meaningful recovery has not been seen to this point.&quot;

Tim Hortons said the lower profit was due to $23.1 million in costs associated with reorganizing the company into a Canadian legal entity. It had formerly been a subsidiary of the Wendy&apos;s hamburger chain and was previously registered as a U.S. company.

Wendy&apos;s began selling off its stake about two years ago and the Canadian retail icon is now widely held.

Operating income increased 5.4 per cent to $129.2 million in the third quarter compared to $122.6 million in the prior year.

Adjusted operating income, excluding $3.2 million in professional advisory fees and shareholder-related transaction costs associated with the reorganization, was up eight per cent to $132.4 million.

Analysts estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters, which usually excludes unusual items and the impact of currency fluctuation, had been for revenue of $552 million and 43 cents per share of earnings.

CIBC analyst Perry Caicco said in a report that the third quarter numbers were &quot;ahead of our forecast on most metrics, largely due to strong revenues.&quot;

Tim Hortons has been ramping up its presence in the United States this year, opening locations at several key tourist spots like Fort Knox and Times Square. The company also had its coffee featured on the U.S. network sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother.&quot;

The company also announced it would resume buying back shares up to $150 million worth of shares before March, after putting the initiative on hold while it converted back into a Canadian corporation.

Tim Hortons is the fourth largest publicly-traded fast-food restaurant chain in North America based on stock market value, and the largest in Canada. As of late September, the company had 3,527 restaurants, including 2,971 in Canada and 556 in the United States.

In trading on the Toronto Stock Exhange, Tim Hortons shares fell $1.16, or 3.9 per cent, to $28.48 Friday.

Who cares, there are much more important issues going on in the world than Tim&apos;s and its shareholders?

If you HAVE to have your Tims, so be it, you&apos;ll undoubtedly pay whatever they charge.

Move on folks.

How greedy is that!!! There is absolutely no justification for this increase in price- none!

We have a Tim Horton&apos;s in the war zone and they do not even give free coffee to our soldiers- shame on Tim Horton&apos;s! Isn&apos;t it time to do a little boycotting here- there are other places for getting a good cup of Joe!!

So did I get this right? Tim Horton&apos;s made better profits than most companies these days, except for the banks

and Tim&apos;s is increasing the price of coffee in Canda in order to earn more profits, especially for American investors

Have I missed something here?

 Here&apos;s another - June 21st, 2010 at 20:17:57 
So how much additional did Tim&apos;s make from the appreciation of the Canadian dollar?

Bought a lot of U.S. goods and services I&apos;d reckon.

A one-time gain? Oh sure. Ha. Ha.

Give your seniors customers a break.

 You&apos;re a bunch of jokers - June 21st, 2010 at 19:45:14 
What a bunch of jokers you all are. If you don&apos;t like Tim Horton&apos;s prices, service, or the colour of the staff&apos;s uniforms, just don&apos;t shop there. Don&apos;t bother coming on here crying about prices going up, just take you&apos;re money elsewhere. They&apos;re a company and they will sell their goods for a price the market will bear...and I&apos;ll bet you dollars for donuts their sales won&apos;t be hurt one little bit by this price increase.

I stopped drinking this a long time ago. Very overpriced to begin with and terrible service in all the outlets. They have 15 working the drive through and one trainee at the counter.
