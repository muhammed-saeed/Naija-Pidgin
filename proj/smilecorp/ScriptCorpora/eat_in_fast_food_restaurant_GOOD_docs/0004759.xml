The new Top End Crossfire T6 is as good as it gets.an ultralightweight rigid chair with a clean, minimalist open frame design, great looks, simple adjustments and super value.it is the total package!! The Crossfire T6 by design is one of the very lightest aluminum chairs on the market today. Just look at it. It&apos;s clean lines and &quot;just where you need them&quot; adjustments keep this chair light. The Top End Crossfire T6&apos;s total weight (that is qualified as) for a 16&quot; x 16&quot; chair with standard HP rear wheels/tires (24&quot;), adjustable tension upholstery, folding back, 4&quot; semi-pneumatic front wheels is only 19.43 lbs.!! And the transfer weight (without rear wheels) is 11.56 lbs. The new open frame makes getting it in and out of a vehicle easier than ever. But that is not all. The Crossfire T6 has some custom frame options not offered by anyone else in the USA. The tapered seat width option allows the front of the seat to be built narrower, like your body is, virtually making the chair disappear. Then there is the ergo seat option which offers improved posture, pressure distribution and propulsion by building a &quot;sweet spot&quot; into the frame for your pelvis to sit on. The key adjustments you need are easy and quick. We even provide the allen tools. The center of gravity adjustment has a range of 4.25&quot;. Let&apos;s talk about value. What matters the most on a wheelchair besides the frame? The wheels and the upholstery. The Crossfire T6 comes standard with high performance rear wheels and high pressure clincher tires plus semi-pnuematic front wheels. The Crossfire T6 also comes standard with adjustable tension upholstery w/straps which is another added value. Less
