 This is the place where you can personalize your profile!
But, how? 
 By moving, adding and personalizing widgets. You can drag and drop to rearrange. You can edit widgets to customize them. The bottom has widgets you can add! Some widgets you can only access when you get a premium membership. Some widgets have options that are only available when you get a premium membership. 
 

 We&apos;ve split the page into zones! 
 Certain widgets can only be added to certain zones. &quot;Why,&quot; you ask? Because we want profile pages to have freedom of customization, but also to have some consistency. This way, when anyone visits a deviant, they know they can always find the art in the top left, and personal info in the top right. Don&apos;t forget, restraints can bring out the creativity in you! 
 

 Now go forth and astound us all with your devious profiles!
