LARGE Vintage Antique Fast Food Restaurant Sign -- Highway Americana
 Fri, 03/12/2010 - 11:35pm -- Christopher Yetter 
This is a great piece of classic San Francisco Americana. This sign was recently removed from the Chinatown location. It would make a great addition to your store, loft, or wherever you need to hand a giant hand holding a hamburger.

The burger is 24&quot; in diameter and 17&quot; high. The sign is 41&quot; long, 36&quot; high at the hand and 24&quot; high at the rear. The sign is about 14&quot; thick.
