High School Students Filling Prescriptions
   Email 437 Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print 
The country’s major drug store chains are increasingly relying on pharmacy technicians, often as young as 16 with little training, to fill prescriptions involving even the most powerful drugs. Sometimes, there are tragic results. A high school-aged pharmacy technician at a Walgreens in Lakeland, Fla., made a typing error and dispensed a dose of the blood thinner Coumadin that was 10 times what the doctor had prescribed. THE BLOTTER RECOMMENDS Photos Unreported Pharmacy Errors Blotter U.S. Pharmacy Errors: Unreported Epidemic? Good Morning America Video What Your Pharmacist Doesn’t Tell You Click Here for Brian Ross Slideshows.&quot;She was in high school. Her prior job had been cleaning a movie theater and serving popcorn,&quot;said Karen Terry, a lawyer representing the patient’s family. The patient, Beth Hippely, suffered a massive stroke after taking the medicine she was incorrectly given, forcing her to stop chemotherapy for a treatable, stage II breast cancer. She died earlier this year. See Unreported Pharmacy Errors in Pictures. Under Walgreens policy, prescriptions filled by pharmacy technicians are supposed to be double-checked by registered pharmacists. In the Hippely case, the registered pharmacist failed to catch the high school student’s error. As big chain drug stores have rapidly expanded, thousands of pharmacy technicians have been hired.&quot;We depend on them very heavily in our industry,&quot;said Mary Ann Wagner, senior vice president of the National Association of Drug Store Chains. Click Here for Full Blotter Coverage. In a majority of states all that is required is that the student be actively working for a GED or high school diploma. The amount of training varies from store to store, with some chains requiring only that the students watch a short video before taking the job.&quot;They’re giving a huge responsibility to people that aren’t trained to perform those duties,&quot;says Karen Terry. The high school student who made the error with Beth Hippely testified she had watched a video and was taking classes in school to learn about the pharmacy job. Testimony in the Hippely case also revealed that stock boys and photo shop workers were also pressed into service behind the pharmacy counter when the store became very busy.&quot;They know mis-fills and errors are bound to occur because they’re giving huge responsibility and important responsibility to people that aren’t trained to perform those duties,&quot;said Terry.&quot;This is an intentional, system drive for profits, for money. If it wasn’t about that, they would hire more pharmacists,&quot;the lawyer said. Walgreens is the country’s biggest pharmacy and recently reported record profits. In a statement to ABCNews.com, Walgreens said,&quot;We deeply regret the few errors that have occurred among the more than 500 million prescriptions we fill each year at our 5,600 pharmacies.

ABC,
You’re not covering the real underlying problem. While undertrained staff is surely a problem, it’s the pressure and intense competition in pharmacy today that has lead to a perception; that a pharmacy is nothing more than a McDonalds for drugs. People’s expectations are unrealistic and we get customers everyday that give the“deer in the headlights”look when you tell them their prescription may take more than 10 minutes. People have no clue what pharmacists have to deal with–we are more or less the red-headed stepchildren of healthcare. Insurance doesn’t want to cover your drug? Oh, we’ll let the pharmacist get drilled by the unhappy patient. Copay going up? Let the pharmacist be the grim reaper! Take a look in a busy pharmacy…it looks like a taco bell on a friday night (after a highschool football game). BUT, there is one differnce…pharmacists are not making burritos. Yet the expectation is essentially the same in the lay person’s mind. Never seen an investigation on why pharmacists do not get a lunch break in almost every pharmacy in the nation. Yep, most pharmacists in the retail setting have a burger in one hand and are answein calls with the other (bathroom breaks, who needs‘em!). Cover than ABC and I’ll at least feel like this is a fair story for us pharmacists out there…some of the best, most genuine people in difficult circumstances. This is not an excuse, but it provides a more complete context for this error reporting issue.

This happens more than Walgren’s is telling. I use to be a faithful user of Walgren’s pharmacy in Grand Prairie Texas until they doubled my Blood Pressure medicine. After taking them all and getting another refill I questioned them and their attitude was you didn’t die oh well. I was refused their corp information when asked. This happened to me several years ago.

My husband received a prescription where the directions were to take“vaginally.”The pharmicist was from an Asian country and could not understand or speak enough English to comprehend when he was questioned. Needless to say we don’t use that pharmacy or that entire chain anymore!

This morning your reporter said on Good Morning America that pharmacies *never* tell you that when you sign to get your prescription you are waiving your rights to a consultation.
On the contrary, I have never picked up a prescription at a pharmacy and *not* had the person ask if I wanted more information and to sign here if I didn’t.
I realise some pharmacies probably don’t tell some patients that they’re signing to say they refuse a consult. But it’s hardly all the pharmacies all the time.
Patients also should check their prescription lable against what the doctor prescribed every time.
Millions of prescriptions are filled every day. It’s inevitable that some few will have mistakes no matter how well trained the people are. Patients checking their own prescriptions will cut down on those mistakes not being caught.
Stop trying to get EVERYONE TO PANIC!

Before you roast this young lady for this where was the pharmacist who was suppose to over see this prescription? It was his job to double check that it was correct.

My daughter-in-law was given incorrect medication at a Walgreen’s in Tennessee. She was to have been given a foot fungus medicine and what she got made her very ill. We were lucky that time but that was not the first time I got incorrect medicine or dose at a Walgreen’s. Noone but registered pharmacists have any business filling presciptions.

For Walgreens to say‘we regret the few errors. . .’is adding insult to injury.
I would be so insulted by this remark if I had lost a loved one.
We don’t this minimized; we need it STOPPED! IMMEDIATELY!

When studying to be a pharmacist, students should be required to work at least one year as a technician before they could be licenced as a pharmacist. This would be much like MD’s serving as interns.

I would just like to say that within this article it is stated,“Walgreens is the country’s biggest pharmacy and recently reported record profits.”Walgreens is not the largest pharmacy chain. The largest pharmacy chain is CVS/Pharmacy

The person for the blame is the pharmacy.They should have had good since enough to check behind her.She was only a high-school student and 16yrs.old.Now how do tht make them look?I understand they gave her a chance at a job because she was young ,but that was their responsibility to help and watch behind her.

When I was in college the tendency was to hire students away from Pharmacy programs before they graduated. Now they haven’t even finished high school? I am appalled.

Walgreens errors are not few. I have caught several mistakes they have made filling both mine and my families prescriptions. I tell everyone go to a mom and pop store, they still take insurance, you get better customer service and their employees, (who are usually only one or two) are better trained and watched. When it comes to things such as medications, I have found that a local person is a lot more careful than the big chains who will employ just about anybody.

I just have a few things to say. My son is a pharmacy tech. He works two jobs. One at Pacific Care in Oceanside and the other at CVS in Vista. The job he does in Oceanside is working with Doctor’s and there staff over the phone in the injectable department. To my understanding this position is very professal, stressfull at times but he does not deal with the public. The job at CVS he says is joke. The staff and the pharmacist are not professionl at all. They also let the employee’s from different department’s help when they get busy. My son did not go to pharmacy school. He graduated with honors from high scholl. From there he got a book and studyed for 3 or 4 months. Went and took he’s pharmacy tech test, passed with flying colors. My point is, retail pharmacy’s are a joke. I would never have any of my prescriptions filled at any of the retail pharmacy’s. When I do have a RX filled I do go to Costco.

I live in 3 states throughout the year and depend upon Walgreens, since I am asmatic and need 3 different drugs to control my condition. In the past year, the service has become appalling, particularly in Florida and Vermont. Rudeness abounds; unanswered messages for prescriptions; wrong answers as to a precription being unable to be filled.
After reading this article, may switch to a small pharmacy in Lexington, KY, that is conscientious. I pay a bit more to ship prescriptions to the location applicable, but this seems a small price to pay.

It’s crazy to put this kind of responsibility on anyone who is not properly trained! It doesn’t matter if it is a 16 year old high school student or a 40 year old mom, anyone doing this job should be trained. And if they don’t have time to train them correctly, have a pharamicist check EVERY prescription filled–no exceptions! I use Walgreens as my pharmacy, mainly because it is the only convenient one where I live. I will be verifying that a pharmacist has checked my prescriptions from now on! Thank you for informing the public to this dangerous situation.

I actually have used Walgreens pharmacy for years, but now that I know they put profits before safety of their customers, I will no longer be using their pharmacies in the future. If I see that they are cleaning up their act and taking responsibility for this problem and hiring more professionals and not letting barely-trained children fill prescriptions, I may reconsider. Thank You ABC for keeping the public informed on these important issues!

Like this should come as a big surprise to anyone?? In this day&amp;age the bottom line is all that matters. People don’t count.
So what if a few people drop dead from mis filled prescriptions. Paying off a few lawsuits is just part of the cost of doing business and will still be cheaper the hiring qualified Pharmacists.

I am speechless. A 16 year old can’t even serve beer, wine, liquor in a restaurant, so why the HELL is a 16 year old dispensing meds. The stores that allow this should be boycotted.

I feel for the patients family, very tragic. But the farmacy holds maybe 20% of the fault at most. Why didn’t the patient double check doctors orders with what was in the perscription bottle? That would have prevented the whole situation. We have to stop pointing the finger at other people and start taking responsibility for our own actions (or lack thereof).

Isn’t it interesting that this same girl would not be allowed by law to scan your beer or achohol through the register scanner and place it in the bag for you without the assistance of an adult (18 yrs)running the product accross the scanning belt for her at the grocery store but she can fill your prescription at the pharmacy with out limitations?

I fully agree with the statement made above by Anthony. The majority of the public do not fully understand everything that goes into medication therapy and expect getting a prescription to be no different than ordering a cheeseburger. As a current pharmacy student, we are made fully aware that unfortunately, errors do happen in every field of healthcare, including pharmacy. Everyone, no matter age or education, is capable of making a mistake, that is why we always prefer to double check with another source.
Also, in your preview of this evening special, you said that you were waving your ability to ask questions, that is simply untrue. Everyone at my pharmacy ALWAYS ask if you have any questions, but that DOES NOT mean that you cannot call later if you have a question. By law, pharmacy phone numbers are given to patients for a reason, we are there for them and more than willing to answer any questions they have.
Also, technically, not all patients in every state are actually required to be offered that consultation service, just Medicare patients. Pharmacies have extended that offer to counsel to all patients because they care about their patients, not to sidestep the law as you implied this morning. I understand that journalism is about making people pay attention to what you say, but in the future, it would be appreciated if you would at least be fair in your reporting. Pharmacy and pharmacists are the most underappreciated part of the healthcare system, an idea propagated by editorials like this one.

There is a right way and a wrong way to do everything. It is the patients responsibility to know their copays and coverages. Insurance companies notify plan members, either through group plans provided by the employer or the group administrator and individually through plan publications and mailings of coverages and changes. I’ve had group plan coverage for over 20 years and I have always received policy coverage and change information promptly. Don’t blame the insurance companies for dumb and impatient customers.
If your wait times vary, or tend to be long, put a sign out that informs the customers when they approach the counter what their expected wait time will be. If they don’t like it, they can go elsewhere. Each and every customer deserves accurate and exacting service. If that takes time, then it takes time.
The fact is that the patients deserve zero errors on their prescriptions. Zero, not 1 in 1,000,000. If you don’t have enough properly trained and qualified staff, then don’t fill the prescription. It is as simple as that. If you take money for providing a service and that service kills or sickens someone because you made a mistake, the only one to blame is yourself.

I really don’t think 16 yr. olds have any business helping dispense prescriptions.
I also have to say that I’ve used Kmart pharmacy in my town for over 15 years. Their pharmacists are overworked, but are always willing to take time to answer questions. They do have assistants helping them, but I’ve never seen one as young as 16!!
And yes, I’ve had to sign that I understand the doctor’s directions&amp;have gotten any questions (if any) answered.

Some of the above posts seem to require clarification. For one, mistakes in pharmacy can (and do) happen in EVERY pharmacy in the world. The only way to truly eliminate these errors would be to remove the drugs. Also, there are many pharmacy techs who are very well trained (some with college degrees). In response to one post, the VAST majority of pharmacists worked as pharmacy techs prior to pharmacy school. Also, pharmacy licences are not granted without many hours of work in pharmacy practice. Unless individuals begin to take a more proactive role in their own health care, it would be impossible to see dramatic change. If you want to criticize pharmacists, nurses, doctors, etc. you sould at least know what medicine you are talking about (as opposed to saying“for a foot fungus”).

Just yesterday i was given the wrong dose of a anti-depressent medication at a CVS. I gave my presciptions to a teenage-appearing worker at the drive in window. The bottle was a sealed month’s supply from the manufacturer. The pharmacy label and warnings completly covered up the label, so this mistake was not realized by me until i opened the bottle and the wrong pill fell into my hand. How can a pharmasist double check when all the external information is covered? He just has to trust the child who gave it to him. On top of that, another needed prescription that I had refilled was not even included! My husband picked up the medication for me, so he did not know which one was missing. This is one area where adults should be in charge, not children, so these mistakes are less likely to happen. Really, 18 or 21 should be the minimum for working with medications that could kill someone or harm them gravely if dispensed incorrectly.

As a certified pharmacy technician, I found this very disturbing. I’ve worked in 2 different pharmacies, one small and family owned, the other a larger chain and the pharmacist is always the last one to check the prescription. I think anyone who works as a pharmacy tech should have the proper training and certification. I received my certification only after I passed a test for each part of my training. I enjoy being a pharmacy tech and articles like this give the the good ones a bad name.

In response to a previous comment about pharmacists getting experience prior to graduation, I would like to point out that is currently the case. For anyone who graduates from a School of Pharmacy, they must complete a PharmD program, which includes at least of year of practical experience, similar to an internship. For all states, a person must have a certain number of hours in practical experience prior to even being considered for getting a pharmacist’s license.

The FDA should be involved in how prescriptions are filled in the U.S. and by all means a high school student should not be given the responsibilty of such an important job..

To RENA, I am a Certified Pharmacy Technician with 13 years of experience and the test your son studied for is NOT a joke and is very difficult. Apparently you are unaware that COSTCO is a retail pharmacy. I also work in a retail pharmacy and the biggest problem that ABC has not addressed is that there is a SHORTAGE of pharmacists in this country and they RELY on Pharmacy Technicians for help in filling a prescription. If you want to balk at 10 minutes, then it will take all day for a Pharmacist to fill the 600 Rx’s we fill a day, if he had to key them in and fill them alone. Not to mention ERRORS, they would be all over the place, due to FATIGUE! Just because this one girl made a mistake doesn’t mean that the rest of us are idiots and should not be filling prescriptions. And if you want experienced technicians, they have to start somewhere, and if you keep increasing their pay to a level that they can live off of, you might see that you get a better employee that is more accurate. Another thing, a Pharmacist is not GOD and GOD is the only one who is not allowed to make mistakes.

The biggest thing missing from this story is this: There is a huge shortage of pharmacists in the country. In a time where people are living longer, and a pharmacy is opening up on every corner, there is simply not enough staff to cover all of these stores. I used to work at a major pharmacy chain in Minneapolis. The staff shortage got so bad, that we had to fly pharmacists in from other parts of the country (all at overtime, and huge cost) to help staff the stores, and in some cases, close some pharmacies early, or open late, due to a lack of pharmacist. With the pool or experienced registered pharmacists spread so thin, these stores have no choice but to have pharmacy techs do more and more work. And errors unfortunately will happen.

I had a recent experience liek this. Except, the pharmacy technician at Rite-Aid clicked all my buttons in those electronic boxes. So, I never even had a chance to ask the pharmacist questions about my drugs! I will never be returning to Rite-Aid. Target has been very good about the pharmacist checking me out and telling me what I need to know!

For someone who has no idea what goes on in the pharmacy department, it’s very easy for them to look and point fingers at what goes wrong. People make mistakes. Everyone does-we’re all human. It’s absolutely no excuse for fatal accidents or even small mistakes, but there is alot of pressure from the general public when they walk into a pharmacy and get upset because the wait time is not as short as they’d like it to be and every 5 minutes there is that customer that keeps asking,“is mine ready yet?”. Or the customer whose co-pay has increased, unbeknownced to them becasue they ignore what paperwork is sent to them from their insurance company. Something isn’t covered, something requires a prior authorization, something isn’t clear on the rx, no reills, rx expired…the list goes on and on and the patient always askes the pharmacy,“will you call for me”. They rarely take any responsibility to look at their own bottle and see that they need to contact the Dr. for their next fill. This all adds extra pressure to those behind the pharmacy counter. So before you point your fingers at us for the mistake that are made because of the pressure to do things quickly, how about helping us out a bit and call your Dr. yourself for once.

The picture of the young girl, who entered the prescription information incorrectly, is misrepresenting the truth behind the story. By displaying her picture, the individual coordinating the information is placing the blame on the young girl. She is a technician, who operated under the license of a pharmacist. The pharmacist is responsible for the error. The real story behind this horrible accident is that the pharmacist failed to check to be certain the technician did in fact enter the information correctly. In addition, the pharmacist should have visited with the customer to discuss the medication. Ten times the dosage of Coumadin is excessive and should have been caught.
Do not jump to conclusions again. We need to know why the pharmacist did not catch the error. Not enough other licensed pharmacists to cover the prescription load? Inadequate technology? There are several reasons, and within these reasons is an answer that hides as details but holds all the strength of truth.

ABC,
Can humans ever be perfect? Even your computer or a bar coded system is still prone to error. With 500 million events such as filling prescriptions some errors would be expected. That would still be true of even trained personnel.
Although no level of error is“acceptable,”it is essential that continuing review of established protocols be done with the aim at reducing such error in the future. A report on those efforts would add meaning to any expose of the system.
Professionally,
Fred Teichman, M.D.

The media makes money of ratings. They need to sensationalize their stories. Health care, including pharmacy, is like any other business in Americia. It is here to make a profit. If the public has a 401K or stocks, I bet some of them are in health care including pharmacy. If the public wants safety, require pharmacies and hospitals and insurance companies to post what they do to ensure saftey and be ready to pay for it. Blame and hype does nothing to resolve the issue.

Did you know when u have a perscription filled the company isn’t responsible for in incorrect filling. My daughter was given the wrong meds and suffered a Grand Mal seizure. Not only was she hospitalized she also suffered long term affects. Who is responsible…Rite Aid said they aren’t….the pharmacists aren’t…so who is? My daughter is now 24 years old an has a handicap that is long term.

people are trying to make excuses for employees for why they make mistakes…ok people there should not be mistakes with medications, you are putting peoples lives in your hands by filling there meds. There should be no mistakes, how would you feel if you mistakenly filled the wrong perscription or wrong dosage and something happens to that person, dies, or is giving them brain damage for the rest of their lives. There should only be perfesionals filling medications and they need to know what their doing and full attention on what their doing. thats it..bottom line.

No one has considered the possiblity of illegible handwriting. Coumadin 1mg scribled fast can easily look like Coumadin 10mg. Both are resonable doses.

I was the owner of an independent pharmacy for 30 years until I was made an offer by a major drug chain which asured my retirement future. I accepted their offer and went to work for them for a short time for insurance benefits until I reached retirement age. While operating my own store I was more closely involved in the actual filling of prescriptions and only filled about half as many as I did while working for the chain. This gave me much more time to spend with each patient and to be more accurate in my work. At the chain store I had to over see 5 techs where before I had one. Even though I checked every prescription which went out,smoetimes because of time constraints I really felt like some things were getting by me without being checked closely enough. This problem could be corrected by removing the time constraints on filling prescriptions and by using more pharmacist and less techs. There used to be regulations of one tech per pharmacist but now that chain pharmacist make up most of the pharmacy board positions they have relaxed that requirment.

It does not take a college degree to count out pills and stick a label on a bottle. Mistakes are made by everyone. You cannot train a person to not make mistakes. And as far as getting the wrong perscription, shouldn’t the consumer know what perscription they are getting? If they are not observant enough to look at the label and make sure everything is right, then they shouldn’t be trusted to administer medication to themselves. Has anyone ever thought that the mistake could have been made by the doctor perscribing the wrong drug?

I can only hope that the 20/20 presentation tonight is not so one sided when it airs. This story did nothing but sensationalize the problem without offering any solutions, the view of the responsible pharmacist, or a response from the American Pharmacists Association, etc. I am truly disappointed in such unbalanced and irresponsible journalism. The conditions of American pharmacies, how they work, what role the consumer plays, and the role a corporation plays could have all been discussed. But NO ABC chose scare tactics versus actually educating the public. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

Where was the pharmacist when the technician made the typing mistake? In
Walgreen’s computer system the pharmacist checks the prescription for typing errors and then prints the prescription label. Then the technicians fill the prescription, and the pharmacist is supposed to check for typing and mis-filling errors AGAIN. I do not see why a technician is being held responsible. It is the pharmacist fault for not paying attention!!! I can almost guarantee the pharmacist only had a bachelor in that pharmacy and not the new doctorate of pharmacy degree. I think it should be mandatory for every pharmacist to go back to school to get their doctorate. I believe it would cut down the errors. The University of Florida has four campuses in Florida offering classes for pharmacist to update their degree.

Though I am making no excuses for errors, we check three times on all bottles and directions. Also everything should be CASH and no insurance. The Pharmacists and technicians who workin busy stores ought to have a limit. e.g. 70 Rx’s per day. If the store fills more thanthat, they have to hire more people. But Oh no the chains are thinking of only one thing MONEY, MONEY AND MORE MONEY!!!!!!

Interesting how people will post about the big pharmacy chains operating only for money, but don’t mention that the media is making money by their ratings. Is causing a panic really doing anyone any good? The story is way out of context and unfortunately more people will potentially be harmed by it should they stop taking their medications. I agree there should be zero errors…absolutely. The fact is, there are errors in every profession including the healthcare industry. For years pharmacy technicians have operated under pharmacists, this is nothing new. I’ve been a pharmacy technician for years, been yelled at by customer’s that they’ve waited“seven minutes already”, cussed out for an insurance issue that had nothing to do with the pharmacy itself. You want to make a diffeence in your healthcare?? Start contacting the insurance companies about the rising costs of medications…that is the bottom line. Are the lawyers for these individuals doing this pro bono?

The rule of thumb is never do business with a large corporate chain of any kind especially a pharmacy. To them the customer is a faceless dollar sign who’s health and well being means nothing. They could care less if you drop dead because they know that there will always be another faceless dollar sign right behind you to take your place.
Always do business with smaller independent companies. They will get to know you by name and will be more careful to properly service you. Yes, sometimes they will be a little more expensive but we are only talking pennies more. The peace of mind that you will receive and the fact that you are supporting a family owned business is well worth the extra expense.

FDA should be taking care of business on this one.I have been telling people about this for years. I have had the wrong prescription given to me.You should also count your pills. They have been wrong in the amount of these too. I know it is hard to count before you walk away from the counter but it needs to be done. I think that they are hoping you don’t count them. This helps save drug stores money. They get 1 pill from every customer…in a day this would add up. Rite Aid and other big chains would rather pay min wage. I also blame this on the FDA. They should make sure that you need a college education in order to fill a prescription. This could be a matter of life or death!

Many years back I had my daughters checked for eye problems and when filling the prescriptions Eckerd Drugs swithched the medication. Since we live in Colombia we couldn´t do anything about it and never reported it to the authorities. Thank God there were no consequences.

When the Board of Pharmacy in New Mexico tried to place requirements on Walgreens as to how many prescriptions one pharmacist was allowed to fill per day safely, the Govenor of the State fired the entire Board. The replacements were chain store representatives, three of which were from Walgreens.

I am a licensed&amp;certified pharmacy technician in California, and have worked in many areas of the pharmacy world. What I have seen in the retail pharmacy setting is there is a lack of“patient-care”on the corporate side.
Pharmacists and technicians are working horrible, long hours, all with minimal help. There are budget cuts in the pharmacy left and right, all to the expense of the patients. (I say“patients”because these people are seeking medical service from the pharmacy. Corporate sees them as“paying customers”, just another dollar in the company’s pockets.)
In poor work conditions, there is no way one can be error-free. Us technicians and pharmacists strive for the best service for our patients. And when we aren’t given the help needed to do these things, the patients end up paying the price.
Also, to the patient’s benefit, several pharmacies include medication information on the handouts along with their prescription bottle. These also include a picture of the drug along with imprint information.
I am curious about the story tonight, and will be watching. But from the sound of this article, it seems a bit one-sided. Please know that this does NOT happen all the time, and that the majority of pharmacy technicians are WELL TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. We take pride in our line of work. Hopefully the story tonight will shed light on that.

To hire a 16 yr old for the kind of responsibility Walgreens gave her is not acceptable. It appears to me that this is about“Profits”, not the safety of the public. I understand the pharmacist is busy; if he/she is that busy, maybe it’s time to hire another one or someone who has more training than what this teenager was given.

Actually, pharmacy students are required to work as technicians. In the state I am currently enrolled in you must work 500 hours on your own and then complete 1000 hours during your final year. I would also like folks to bear in mind that pharmacy technicians ARE NOT pharmacists and did not go through the minimum 6 years of a PharmD program to become a pharmacist. Yes, technicians are not required to have much training, but bring that up. Also, kudos to Anthony for stating the truth about how it is to work in a retail pharmacy as a pharmacist. You should all read his comment and stop and think the next time you want to yell or argue with the pharmacy about things they do not control (i.e. YOUR insurance, YOUR doctor, etc.).

As a former state investigator for the pharmacy commission, a few comments: 1. COUNT your pills. unethical pharms have been caught under-filling scrips and pocketing or re-selling the difference. Rite-Aid was investigated and fined and in several states–check the website for your state licensing agency for disciplinary action. 2. Pharm employees are required to offer customer counseling regarding the meds. Often i’m simply directed to sign“counsel declined”. 3. If you suspect problems with the meds, you can ask the pharm to re-count the pills in your presence.
4. If you have problems with accuracy and errors in a scrip being filled, contact your state oversight agency. There may be a pattern at that location or with a particular licensee.
5. Mistakes do happen. Consumers must be accountable to understand their meds and the correct dosage prescribed for them.

This investigation discusses patients signing away their right to counseling. National pharmacy associations and state boards of pharmacy are making efforts to have more counseling done by pharmacists. This is a huge shift in practice since 50 years ago it was illegal for pharmacists to discuss a patient’s medication with them. Laws are in place in many states that require pharmacists to counsel or offer counseling to patients.
The reason why pharmacists do not actually counsel on all prescriptions is because there is no reimbursement for a pharmacist’s counseling services. Along with this, cuts in prescription reimbursement by both government and private insurance companies necessitate that pharmacists increase the volume of prescriptions sold to stay in business. The expectations of pharmacists by employers, government officials, and patients are unrealistic. If patients want to get their prescriptions for the cheapest price, then they are going to have to sacrifice quantity for quality.
If patients want effective counseling services from pharmacists, then they will have to be willing to spend some money for them. Students graduating from colleges with degrees in pharmacy must have a Doctorate of Pharmacology to become licensed. (In the past pharmacists only needed a Bachelor’s degree). Medical doctors have much less training in pharmacology than pharmacists. Pharmacists are the medication experts. Patients would not expect to receive advice from a doctor with paying for it, and this same attitude should be applied to pharmacists.

The real issue here is the States need to pass laws mandating prescription volume vs appropriate staffing. One pharmacist should not be allowed to fill more than 150-175 prescriptions per day. In these busy stores doing over 300 prescriptions and only one pharmacist on duty, that is a prescription for disaster. These chains will lie to you because there is no one overseeing the staffing. I worked retail pharmacy for years and got tired of filling over 250 prescriptions per day by myself. If the states would regulate the staffing, we wouldn’t be watching these 20/20 specials on techs filling prescriptions and overworked pharmacists missing errors.

ABC,
One solution that the State of Maryland has created is a law that requires that a Pharmacy Technician have national certification before they are allowed to work in a pharmacy that is licensed to dispense medication in the State and/or for Maryland residents. How strictly will the law be enforced? We shall see!

That explains all the mistakes that have been made on my account at Walgreen’s here in my town.
I got tired of all the mistakes and recently moved all of my prescriptions to a“real”local pharmacy where we found that Walgreen’s had merged my account with at least 4 other people. It would have been understandable if the names had been similar to my own but they were not. It was just pure and simple somebodying doing a horrendously sloppy job with no accountability. I will never use any of the big companies again.
Local is much better and they care about what they are doing.

It all comes down to these money hungry corporations staffing with the absolute minimum amount of employees to save a few bucks. This problem needs to be adressed with updated labor laws requiring breaks for adults. In my state (michigan) only minors are guaranteed a lunch break. How exactly is someone supposed to perform their job with 8 or more hours on their feet WITHOUT FOOD?? Between that and the extreme impatience of society to have to wait for anything and you have a disaster waiting to happen.

First of all where the patients sign it doesnt say they are giving up their rights to talk to a pharmacist. you need to investiage more and read the paper your signing. it is for insurance purpose if the pharmacy ever get audit from insurance purpose. pharmasict are to always double check tech work.

Mistakes happen. This girl shouldn’t be blamed for a typo. The pharmacist should have caught the error but just because the error happened in that store doesn’t mean that pharmacist was at fault. Walgreens has a satellite system that allows other pharmacists to check prescriptions to help out busier stores. All prescriptions are checked by a pharmacist but can anyone honestly say, they’ve never had a typo. Can anyone in the news business say they’ve never had an editing mistake go to print. It happens, we aren’t God. You try to minimize errors and the likely hood of errors happening. You think pharmacists need to count out each pill?? where will you get these people. Pharmacy is a long and difficult study. It’s like doing away with nurses and making doctors collect vital signs. There is a pharmacist shortage and with the baby boomer’s getting older there will only be a greater need for more pharmacists in this country.

I would just like to comment to the person who said that a walgreens is like a taco bell. First of all and most importantly if taco bell gives you the wrong order you are not going to die from it. When people are given the wrong perscriptions you can die as you have read. I think walgreens as a whole should be in trouble with this matter. Yes the 16 year old should but so should the rest of the employees that work in the pharmacy. If a loved one of mine became a victim and died or suffered serious problems due to their irresponsibilities you better beleive I would be fighting them in court and so would everyone else. So think before you say you wouldn’t blame them for messing up your perscription!

I was a pharmacy technician for almost 4 years in west virgina and cared deeply about my patients. I always gave them advice on taking their med’s.

I know Janelle and she was not 16, she was 19. She had graduated from high school (2nd in her class) and she had taken a pharmacy tech course and had become certified. She feels horrible. There is no excuse for any mistakes, but it is the Pharmacist’s responsibility to double-check every script. That is why the pharmacist makes $100,000 per year. The pharmacist missed the error, but that isn’t as good of a story now is it? Instead they choose to exploit a young girl.

I have been a licensed pharmacy technician for 20 years. In order to receive my license, I had complete a year of study at a local college, followed by hands on training during my internship at a local hospital. In order to be come a licensed Pharmacist, one needs to complete a doctorate level degree followed by 1-3 years of internships. To state that a lack of training of pharmacy workers is solely responsible for mistakes is short sighted. Training is not the issue, a shortage of pharmacists, decreasing levels of reimbursement from insurance companies, an aging population, and increased cost of medications have lowered the profit margin for pharmacies. As a result, you are having an increasing workload placed on fewer people; people who often work overtime and with no breaks in order to make sure that the work gets done. It is crucial for the public to be active participents in their own healthcare. You need to know the name, dose and frequency of the medication that you are taking and what your are taking it for. You should also ask as many questions as you need to in order to make sure that you fully understand what you need to know regarding your medications. I would also like to point out that, by law, all work of technicians must be checked by a pharmacist and all patients must be offered counceling on the use of their medications by a pharmacist.

MORE TRAINING IS NEEDED! Watch a movie and you’re good to go??? WTF???!!! I agree with the comment on Walgreen’s apology note…who cares how little mistakes your company has made? A person died because of this and that’s a HUGE mistake! In ALL businesses ( not only pharmacies ), company’s pay the job and not the person. That happens everywhere…I fault Walgreens for hiring the inadequate 16-year old and the registered pharmacist who did not catch the error. This case is much more than an“everyone makes mistakes”error. Yes, people make mistakes, but in a workplace like a Pharmacy, where you should practice precaution…you can’t afford to make a mistake like that. Especially in a job where you fill perscriptions…that should ADD to the pressue to MAKE SURE you do your job correctly. If that was me…I’d rather take the precaution with doing it correctly, get yelled at for being slow, and get yelled at for a prescription taking too long, instead of rushing and typing a prescription incorrectly..causing someone to DIE from MY ERROR !!??!!! It doesn’t matter where you work…pharmacies, restaurants, construction company’s, ANY where….there’s no excuse for being THAT irresponsible.

This article is a disturbing one. A young girl, the person that was given the wrong medication, and the families of both, lives have all been tragically affected. My son was once given a medication that was double the dosage that it was supposed to be, it was my son that actually noticed the error, most likely because the pill was a different color than the one he was use to taking, of course I immediatly called the pharmacy (which was not a Wal Greens) the Pharmacist was very apologetic I returned the wrong medicene and got the correct one. I learned from that incedent. I now ask questions about all medications that I am prescribed, and I check the bottle to make sure it is what was I am supposed to be getting.
I have never had a pharmacist who is not willing to answer any and all question I may have. I know that there are unfriendly or unsociable pharmacists, but doesn’t that apply to almost every profession?We are now living in a time period where we are all in a hurry, we don’t take the time or effort to make sure that we are getting what we are supposed to get. Why does it seem we are so quickly to blame a whole chain of stores for a human error, by a person who had almost no training? What is the purpose of having a Pharmacist to begin with if it is a untrained person, of any age, that is doing the work?
I could go on forever about this matter instead I am going to end in saying I think that if you are going to handle anything to do with a persons life, you should have the proper credentials, and the ones who are responsible for it to be correct should be the ones punished!! We all need to remember that we are humans, and we do make errors!

As an experienced pharmacy technician I think that many of the people who watched this program really have no idea what goes on in a pharmacy. If a 16 year old was working as a technician she would be closely supervised by a pharmacist. It seems to me that this particular pharmacist fell down on the job.
A 16yr old is not dispensing your medication! She may be counting your pills and even typing things into the computer, but the pharmacist double checks (and often double counts) everything any technician does. I am an experienced tech and the pharmacist still checks me. He often has me re-read the ones he does by himself to be sure it is right. Anyone who expects NO mistakes is deluding themselves. That is of course the ideal, but humans are not perfect. Patients should be double checking with their doctor to be sure they understand any changes in their medications. Our pharmacists always offer to talk with patients about their meds.
It is awful that mistakes like the the one in this program happen, and they shouldn’t, but they do.
As a technician I work hard, as do all techs and pharmacists. We care about our clients. We all try not to make mistakes. There is a lot of studying involved in getting certified and working in a pharmacy before you get certified is a really good way of understanding what the job is, not everyone is suited to the task. I love my job and I’m sure many techs feel the same.

I have sat here and read all the comments and decided I have to say something. I am a pharmacist and realize that 1 mistake is 1 too many. There is never any intention to misfill a prescription. I take that very seriously and try my best to prevent that from happening. I work at a retail chain but that doesn’t take away from what I try to do everyday, which is to provide excellent service to my patients. Too many times we have to take complete responsibility for the patient’s medication. What I am referring to, for example, is when a patient is out of refills. We will tell the patient and many times get the response of“Well I’m out and you HAVE to call the doctor”We don’t have to call but we do as a courtesy.
When the insurance doesn’t cover a medication, many times we call the doctor to get a new prescription for something that is covered or less expensive. Many patients do not give us the correct insurance information until after we’ve been yelled at about the copay being too high. Why should it be so hard to accept the 10 to 15 minute wait to ensure that I have time to properly check your prescription. Many customers transfer their prescriptions back and forth between pharmacies which also takes time and makes it harder on the pharmacy staff. There are so many ways to improve the situation but criticizing the practice of pharmacy is not the solution. We can and do provide invaluable service over and over. Where are the stories about the pharmacists helping the patients? Why won’t we talk about that?
In my opinion, the consumer and the pharmacist should take the roles of building a relationship. Let’s work together for the benefit of the patient in a way for the pharmacy to do that. It should be a give and take relationship. We have many customers who understand that when it’s busy then the wait time goes up. The staring and glaring by the others doesn’t make the work get done faster. It’s very distracting and not helpful in any way.
I love being a pharmacist even though the job is very demanding. There are so many rewarding moments.

I am a pharmacist, who at one time earned a living as a statistician. Some statistics:
According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services,“pharmacies are filling over a million prescriptions per day”–and that number just includes Medicare prescriptions.
If 99.999% of those prescriptions are filled accurately, that would still leave more than 10 prescriptions per day that are incorrectly filled–10 opportunites a day for someone to be harmed, and possibly die.
Since the stakes are that high, I agree that even one prescription error is one too many. But is it reasonable to expect any human to *never* make a mistake?
 
Posted by: Roger | March 30, 2007, 4:46 pm 4:46 pm
 
Another thing that they failed to mention was that often times the 16 year old technicians are smarter and make fewer errors than the 45 year old technician you’ve known for years. Unfortunatly the shortage of pharmacists in this country is so bad that many companies are forced to look to other countries to help fill the gaps. In a perfect world sure we could have only highly trained top of the class pharmacists filling every prescription BUT here in the real world we have to make do with what is available. These companies don’t want any errors made at LEAST as much as the patients they serve. Instead of making the pharmacy staff scapegoats for the problem they should concentrate on the bigger problem with the industry. Give the staff in our neighborhood stores a break they are all doing their best to serve you quickly, professionally, and above all ACCURATELY.

Totally agree with this article…Walgreens in my area should be embarrassed and abhorred by their mistakes. I luckily caught a BIG error on my son’s medication last year. However, a co-worker was not so lucky and ended up in the hospital.
We now use Target and they are EXCELLENT, at least here. Personal, customer service; the pharmacist remembers you and will go above and beyond for service issues.

And yet again I have to take time out of a busy day to hold my nose and watch another of these stupid”investigative reports”(and yes I use sarcastic quotation marks)
There is shame to go around!
First: Shame on you for making the public believe yet again that a high school student is in any way responsible for the mistake you reported.
Second: Shame on the Registered Pharmacist on duty that day for not taking full responsibility for every aspect of the Pharmacy operation under her/his control as required by law in all 50 states and US territories! including the actions of each associate present.
Third: Shame on Walgreen’s corporation for not shielding non-professional associates from the viscious and predatory“journalism”of this report. Have they no policy of responsibility for Licensed Pharmacists and oversight in Licenced pharmacy areas? (Both Pharmacists and Pharmacies require Licencing by state boards of pharmacy.)
Why did your report not name the responsible Pharmacist instead of a
high-school student?
Cry havoc!! for yellow journalism!!

While no error is acceptable, they are bound to happen statistically. I’m sure that no educated viewer could look anyone in the face and claim that humans,machines, computers, etc are error proof. NO system is error proof. Pharmacists under go a great deal of training and care very deeply for their patients. Do mistakes happen? They do. Every day, mistakes are happening in every field and facet of life. The Phamaceutical industry has made many advances to minimize these errors, but absolutely nothing is error proof. From the moment a prescription is manifested, there are many people and operating systems that can catch an error…The Dr. can write the rx incorrectly,the patient may not ask what the Dr. is writing for, the technician may enter the rx incorrectly, the pharmacist may not interpret the rx correctly, the patient may not ask the pharmacist any questions. If you noticed, the pharmacist was one in a long line of people that could have averted an error.
Perhaps rather than leading a witch hunt, 20/20 could educate the public that their health care is just as much, if not more their responsibility as it is their health care providers. People cannot have blind faith in anything, you must be your own advocate. Work with pharmacists, not against them. Be realistic, no pharmacist or large company wants a mistake to happen…it feels awful, and it would be wonderful if there was never another mistake….but their will be and all we can do is make things better in out current system, provide adequate help to our pharmacists, take responsibility as patients to educate ourselves; and if a mistake does happen, correct it and make thing better.

I have been a pharmacist for over 30 years. I have practiced in many different health care settings.
Dispensing prescriptions has become a factory just as fast foods.
Over a number of decades, television broadcasts and news paper articles have repeatedly sited the increasing dangers and deaths associated with these issues.
There are only a handful of business controlling most of the prescriptions dispensed in the US.
Wal-Mart, Target , Walgreens , CVS and Rite Aid.
These mega players hold profit above all. They will most likely placate the 20/20 program this evening

According to the a recent study, 100,000 people die from medical errors each year. That is almost one plane crash a day. The number may actually be even higher since it is not yet well accepted for financial and legal reasons to report the actual number by the health care industry. Zero error is the goal but not achievable because of the complexity and the
number of steps involved in the process of providing care including medication dispensing. Every major error is tragic both for the patient and their loved ones and for the person or persons involved in the error. It is very unfortunate that the picture of this 16 year old is now plastered all over the place. As it is, it would have taken a lifetime for her to cope with the error&amp;its concequences even without her being depicted as a“criminal”. My heart goes for both the patient and her family and the 16 year old and her family. A 16 year old should not have been put in that position without extensive supervision. The ultimate responsibility lies with the pharmacist and the pharmacy. Here is the scoop with the pharmacy practice in the retail envionment:
1) The manufacturers have driven the cost of medications up
2) insurance companies have decreased their reimbursement to the pharmacies
3) Contrary to popular belief, pharmacies do not make a large enough margin to cover for enough staff to handle the workload
4) Pharmacy staff, especially the pharmacists are often working under very inhumane conditions (long work days, no break for food, and often no time for a bathroon break, this is not an exageration)
5) Chain pharmacies (i.e. CVS, Walmart, Giant, Safeway, Target, etc) do manage to make a profit by their high volume of prescriptions, lower cost of medications because of high volume purchases, and rebates from manufacturers, and the formulas they use for staffing. Often these formulas are set up so that they can squeeze the maximum out of the overworked of pharmacists and technicians. They do advertise about“caring”and“patient education”, but realistically they do not and cannot deliver on their promise because of the few staff and large volume of workload in their pharmacies.
6) Patients will most likely get better service from the small independet pharmacies. Because, there is more at stake for these pharmacies.
Errors are often the result of system failures. To reduce errors, processes need to be changed often by the frontline professionals (doctors, nurses, pharmacits, etc). Finger pointing and scape goating will not solve the problem.
Here are some solutions:
1) the government / FDA must require a realistic number of pharmacists and technicians per number of presctiptions. (i.e. at least one pharmacist and technician per 200 prescriptions per 8 hour shift. The # of presctiptions may need to be even lower if pharmacies are truely expected to provide real patient counseling as opposed to a paper printout with the medication which often are confusing and do not mean much to the patients) There is a price for quality. If we expect quality, we must be willing to also give enough staffing help to the pharmacists on the fronline.
2) Establish a non-punitive system so that errors can be reported. This way, enough data will be available to develop and implement change to reduce the number of errors.
3)Require pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to take a 1 hour break in between their shift AWAY from the filling area. I do not think that we would expect an air traffic controller to work intensely for 10-12 hours a day with no break (if that day ever comes, I will stop flying).
4) Require pharmacies to only staff pharmacies with board certified pharmacy technicians behind the counter.
Error often do not happen because some“bad people with bad intentions”made the errors. It is almost often a system error. Until what led to the error is not analyzed and the system changed, we should expect the same outcome from another well intentioned, overworked indivitual.
Thanks, Frank. (Pharmacist)

I agree with Anthony. Though the incident is tragic, it is not difficult to see how it might happen. Before people start pointing fingers and giving their haughty, uninformed opinions about a“zero margin for error,”why don’t they try to do what we pharmacists have to do day- in-and-day-out ftor 10 minutes at a peak rush. I bet they’d change their attitudes quite quickly. You see, the age of the technician is irrelevant, for any person, any age, can mistype any bit of information. Also, you don’t know the full circumstances. YOU try to read handwriting that resembles a 4 year old child’s! I’m not excusing the incident, but rather than point fingers and condemn, try to be empathetic for both parties involved. Trust me, no one INTENTIONALLY makes a prescription error and for ABC to present this piece with the slant I’m sure they’ll adopt is shameful. Funny that the LAWYER accuses pharmacy chains of using technicians in favor of pharmacists in order to increase the bottom-line. Nothing could be further from the truth. This nation is simply facing a momumental pharmacist shortage, and with the volume of prescriptions dispensed increasing each year, the disparity between available manpower and need grows wider by the day.

Situation will always exist that make mistakes more likely to occur. Training is vital to ensuring support staff (ie: pharmacy technicians) are utilized to their fullest capacity without creating unsafe situations. The final verification of all prescriptions and the offer to counsel should always be offered by licensed/registered staff.

I am a pharmacy student studying to get my Pharm.D. and I also am an intern with a chain drugstore. I have to go to school for 6 years, while logging at least 1500 hours as an intern. On the other hand, tech regulations vary from state to state, and it is true that oftentimes techs are just high school kids (that’s how I started out). However, it does no one any good to have a scare tactic report come out like this one and frighten the American populace into not getting their prescriptions filled for fear of error. It’s true that mistakes do happen; but we work very, very hard every single day to make sure that every patient receives the best service and care possible. For every rude or inept employee a customer might encounter, there are hundreds if not thousands of caring, sharp, and intelligent ones. And it is so important for the public to realize that a drugstore can’t be like a fast food restaurant and that it does take time to fill a prescription. This report blasts pharmacies for hiring inexperienced techs or for going quickly, but when we work quickly, I can guarantee you we’re not worried about profit margins; we’re worried about getting the customer home quickly, especially if they are in pain. Just because a pharmacy is part of a chain doesn’t make it awful or mean that the employees don’t care about the patients; I care very much about my patients, and my colleagues do too. And it’s also important for patients to be proactive about their health care and work with their doctor and pharmacist to understand what they’re taking, how much of it they’re taking, and why. Instead of blaming the companies or the techs or the pharmacists or anyone else we can find, we need to realize that good communication is phenomenally important and key to quality patient care.

YOU CANNOT WAIVE A RIGHT! (Look up the word Right)
When you sign the acknowlegment form in the drug store you are not waiving the right to anything. You may refuse counseling at that time, but you still have the right to be counselled. Many people prefer not to stand at the pharmacy counter and discuss their therapy in public. They can go home and call the pharmacy to discuss more privately with the pharmacist their concerns after reading the material provided at the point of sale. Others prefer to be content with the printed patient information sheet. While still others look up their medication in a book or online. Some even call my pharmacy after filling their prescription elsewhere (mail-order for instance) for“counseling”Never the less they have not by signing the acknowlegment of prescription receipt and refusal of counseling“waived their right to be counselled”Get with the program ABC! Not everyone wants to air their laundry in public.

ABC is being ridiculous with this story i mean COME ON! what the hell difference does it make what age the technician was 16 or 56? These young kids have to start somewhere dont they???? I admit the mistake that was made should have been caught and unfortunately it was’nt but wat the hell does the age of the tech have to do with anything?? i just got my license a couple of months ago and work for walgreens and our computer systems are advanced and from the point of dropping off the rx to the point of pick-up there are alot of things in between that are done to try to avoid any mistakes. MISTAKES HAPPEN PEOPLE DEAL WITH IT, ITS LIFE. Unfortunately this mistake caused a possible death but that doesnt mean you put down the entire profession. its the pharmacist’s fault, no ITS NOT the pharmacist’s fault. how the hell do you come into a pharmacy and not even look at your rx or even wonder..what the hell is my doctor prescribing me. alot of times if the rx isnt clear i’ll ask the patient if they know what the md prescribed 9 times out of 10 they dont. And yes try being behind that counter, its stressful people! dealing with the phones, insurances, annoying freekin patients, can you ring up my freekin stick of gum?, excuse me where are the potato chips? WTF go look for them. we got secretary’s in md office’s who call in the wrong rx’s for wrong pt’s..is that the pharamcists fault too???? i mean come on. you cant just attack the profession. And hellz yah we make over 100,000 but the sh** we gotta deal with sometimes its not even worth it. most patients dont know anything about their insurance plans, if their copays are $5 you’re they’re best friend. jumps to $10?? GRRRRR! CALL UP MY INSURANCE RIGHT NOW! what a waste of freekin time. dont get me wrong people i like my job, i got cool patients…but hellz no ABC dont even TRYY to make us pharmacists look like careless people who dont over-look our techs.

Very simple:
Long shift,no break, no lunch, double drive thru (both buzzers going off), 5 phones, customers asking questions,insurance problems, a cart full of non-prescription stuff needing to be rung up by the pharmacist, no cashier to help 2 people filling 300 prescriptions a day…Walgreens and all big chains who identify with this scenario, WAKE UP. Don’t let your entire store be rung up at the pharmacy counter and GIVE US A CASHIER to run the register. The pharmacist should
only be handling prescriptions. Your public derserves his/her entire attention.

As a Certified Pharmacy Technician, I am very offended at the comments made stating that only Registered Pharmacists should be the only people allowed to even be in the pharmacy and count prescriptions. The test in which one has to take to become Certified isn’t an easy test by far. I studdied for several months. I pride myself in passing with flying colors. My uncle is a Registered Pharmacist and he helped me study. He told me that there were questions on the test that were on his boards.(For those of you who haven’t the slightest clue what boards are, it’s the big test Pharmacists have to take to become a Registered Pharmacist.) You can’t tell me that everyone else is absolutly stupid and incapable of helping the Pharmacist. Yes, I agree that everyone should have the proper training before being thrown into the pharmacy and trusted to do everything that a regular full-time technician is capable of doing, but I do not believe that only a Registered Pharmacist is the only human being capable of doing varoius tasks in the pharmacy. Furthermore, the technician made a mistake entering the prescription into the computer system, but the Pharmacist should have caught the error. Keep in mind, I don’t think errors are acceptable, but I don’t believe the error is entirely the technician’s fault. There are a few bad technicians out there who do need more training, but for the most part most of us are well trained and fully aware of how important it is to not make a mistake.
On the subject of signing your name every time…We ALWAYS ask the patient if they have any questions about their medication and make sure that they understand that if they have questions once they get home to not hesitate to give us a call.

I hope this story is not just about critiquing the health care system (yes RETAIL is the lastline of the healthcare system!), we can better channel everyone’s attention and energy to solving this problem…Pharmacists are few, physicians and nurses outnumber us and they presribe the numerous prescriptions, you do the math, we (PHARMACISTS) are overworked, and underpayed. Only within the last 10 years has there been an awareness to pharmacy as a profession and its growth. Now a days there are plenty of people who would like to be pharmacists, open up more certified colleges of pharmacy and graduate more pharmacists, only then will this problem about busy pharmacists be calmed down.

I work as a Walgreen’s pharmacy technician in Florida, and know that Walgreen’s does NOT hire just anybody off the street to handle prescriptions. To work in the pharmacy, technicians must undergo extensive training and job-shadowing. Most of our technicians are very experienced, and a few of our younger technicians are pursuing college medical degrees. I am appalled that Walgreen’s is taking such a fall in the media. Of course, there is not excuse for filling a prescription wrong and employees must ALWAYS be careful of what they are doing. However, the negligent actions of one person does not accurately represent everyone in the Walgreen’s chain.

I am currently an employ for CVS and also in pharmacy school. I wanted to clarify one point an earlier reader said: Pharmacy students in most states are required to have 1500 hours of clinical and retail experience before graduation. Also, if anyone from another department is called to help in the pharmacy, they run the cash register only, no drugs are touched. I was 17 when I started working in an independent pharmacy. The blame for this situation should not be placed on any one individual, but the system as a whole. It can be a high stress job when there are people staring at you waiting for their prescriptions, 2 phone lines ringing, techs asking questions, and customers needing counseling. There are definitely things that need to be changed, but this story does not present the situation fairly.

Ultimately I believe the patients or the patient caregivers should be the final check. It’s your own health after all. If you feel something is not right, ask! Like any healthcare providers (eg. doctors and nurses), pharmacists are human beings and are vulnerable to error (especially when there are phone ringing with 2 or more on hold while 7 patients waiting in line and at the drive-thru all demanding 3 or 4 of their prescriptions to be filled within 10 minutes). Pharmacists are supposed to be the last one to check the medications, but even with 99.999% accuracy, there still a chance for mistake to be made. If you have questions, ask. If you feel something is wrong with your medication, ask!

Solutions
Errors happen and whether you like it or not, they are not going to go away. What can we do to minimize this.
1.Public. Know what you are taking and understand the changes your insurance company makes. Be patient, this is medication you are receiving, not fast food.
2.Pharmacetucal companies and FDA
No more allowing drug names to be similar
All generic forms of a brand medicaiton should be the same
color as the brand dosage form.
3.Insurance companies- Make all insurance cards universal and explain your drug formularies better to your clients. Give pharmacies the reimbursment they deserve.
4. Physicians- Either print or type out your prescriptions and say what the medication is for
5. Pharmacists- It is our responsibility to check the techs work. It is not about trust, we are looking for mistakes and correcting them. We help patients eery day and we are the number one trusted profession.
6. Pharmacies-Please give adaquate training and give the pharmacists breaks. It will not kill anyone if the pharmacy is closed for 15 minutes once or twice a day. Do not put filling quotas on the pharmacists.
I hope there is a follow up story on what is being done on everyones part on solving the problem.

It is the pharmacists job to double check the prescription filled by the technician. Where is the pharmacists excuse? Quit putting all the blame on the 16 yr. old girl. I am a pharmacy technician student and currently shadowing in pharmacy. The 2 pharmacists I work under make sure they check every prescription after it is filled and then again at the counter with the patient, and as a new prescription, the pharmacist is required to talk to the patient to make sure they understand what they are taking. The main problem is half the time a patient is being counseled, they just nod their head in acceptence of what is being said when they really aren’t even paying attention to what is being said to them. And as the patient, common sense check the prescription yourself when it is handed to you, 1mg is alot different than 10mg. I am sorry for the families loss, but if you think about it, there are 3 irresponsible parties in this whole situation…

The lack of full coverage on what goes on in the pharmacy when these mistakes are made is positively infuriating. I am a current Walgreens employee and only one year away from obtaining my Pharm.D. Our computer system at Walgreens will not allow the prescription to be sold at the register until the pharmacist has given it final verification. Though no health care related mistake can be considered acceptable, just remember that every person at every job makes mistakes because they are human. Pharmacists and techs are also human and it is unfortunate that their mistakes can be more devastating than those made in other industries. All factors must be taken into account before the country goes into a fit of rage over the story covered by 20/20.

As a pharmacy technician I was very upset by this story. I think that ABC is exploiting this poor girl. It is very sad what happened to the woman who’s presciption was misfilled. However, it not the pharmacy technician’s job to make sure that the medication goes out the door correct. It is the Pharmacists!!! She should not be held liable. Something that people have to understand is that Pharmacists are not perfect. They do make mistakes. What happened to that woman does not happen very often and when it does, at my particular pharmacy the pharmacists have to fill out an incident report where the patient is notified as well as the doctor. I just think that everyone should leave this technician alone.

I have worked as a pharmacy technician for the past 12 years and was very offended by what I saw this morning. I take pride in my job and what I do. My patients/customers care and well being are very important to me. I have studied and passed every exam within my company and nationally to better educated my self on the practice of pharmacy. In my state of Louisiana, not just anyone can work within a pharmacy. There are background checks, on the job training, and national certification testing required to work within the pharmacy.

Coumadin TEN times the amount?? The only person to blame here is the pharmacist! It is their responsibility to check and DOUBLE check the patient’s prescription regardless of who filled it before it is given to the patient.
Being a 3rd year pharmacy student, I know how busy community pharmacies are. However, the pharmacist should NOT be allowing unauthorized personal in the pharmacy such as the stock boy. That is against the law!
Also the lawyer states,“She was in high school and her prior job was seving popcorn.”What a great excuse! I was in high school once, and I’m planning on being a pharmacist. So does that mean I can skip the training part and immediately start filling prescriptions? Saves me alot of hassle!

This report is not correct. I work for Walgreens and it is very good company to work for. I am also Senior Certified Pharmacy Tech and during this report there were no techs interviewed to show the good side of being a technician. Not All Walgreens Stores break the rules and hire under age techs. It would be real nice if the report had a more positive out look. I think the article is somewhat bias. 20/20 just wants to cause problems, this show is usually very good when the right information is given, but report takes the cake…..

Overcharging is a problem not cited often. I had a major over-charge at Wal-Mart and the pharmacist told me in broken English,“Well that money doesn’t end up in my bank account.”
I changed to Walgreens and TWICE I was charged an incorrect amount, the first time, the pharmacist apologized and blamed“the computer.”The second time, he berated me in front of many customers and then finally admitted that I was, in fact, being overcharged by almost $100. Again I received exactly the same comment.“Well that money doesn’t end up in my bank account.”Is this an industry recommended response?
He won’t have another chance–I have dropped Walgreens for a local pharmacy.
In retrospect, no wonder Walgreens profits are so large–very few people probably realize they’re being overcharged.

I WORK AT A WALGREENS AND I KNOW MISTAKES HAPPEN, BUT IN A PHARMACY MISTAKES SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN ESPECIALLY WHEN DISPENSING MEDICINE. THE RESULTS CAN BE DEADLY AS SHOWN. ALSO I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IN THE HELL WAS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ALLOWED IN PHARMACY. I , BEING WITH THE COMPANY FOR 11 YEARS WAS ALWAYS TOLD YOU HAD TO BE AT LEAST 18YEARS OLD. IT SEEMS TO ME, THAT THE PHARMACIST AND THE PHARMACY SUPERVISOR/TRAINER FAILED TO GIVE THE PROPER TRAINING, BUT IT IS ALSO THE STUDENTS FAULT FOR FAILING TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TO HAVE HER WORK VERIFIED. SHE CLEARLY ALSO DID NOT PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN SHE TYPED IT IN TO THE SYSTEM. SHE SHOULD HAVE HAD HER WORK DOUBLECHECKED BUT FAILED TO DO SO AND CAUSED THIS WOMAN TO DIE. MY FEELING IS THE WHOLE PHARMACY THERE IS TO BLAME,…THE PHARMACIST, THE STUDENT AND MANAGEMENT FOR FAILING TO GET THE STUDENT TRAINED.

CJ,
I am a pharmacist at a busy retail store and I know the first name of virtually all of my customers. Like all people, pharmacists can make mistakes. However, its too bad that ABC has not reported on the countless number of incidences in which pharmacists have caught mistakes make by prescribers and rectified the problem all without the patients’knowledge.

I work as a certified technician at a local pharmacy in Orlando and mistakes do happen but the pharmacist is always there and catches mistakes if they are made. They way the media is making techs look incapable of counting pills, or matching number on a paper and a bottle. I feel that the pharmacist in charge while the mistakes are made should be fired not promoted. As a former employee of walgreens, we checked the prescriptions 4 times before the staple was put through the bag, sealing it. Also i agree with people thinking a pharmacy is a fast food place, people in the US need to stop being so lazy and take some responsibility. SO now everyone acting like they care about their medications should not treat the place where they get their prescriptions like the place where they get fast food. Today someone refused to signed the acknolegedment log because they heard on the news she was signing something that was giving her right away when in fact most signature logs are used as a way to keep track of the Prescriptions that had been picked up by the patients, so that not very responsible is it? Techs are to pharmacist what nurses are to doctors and what dental technicians are to dentists, without technitians most people would also complain that the doctors are taking too long or that their prescription is gonna take 10mins, people need to be patient and more aware that we are dealing with your health not your appetite.

About a year ago, I worked for Kmart. I started out as a cashier, so I was moved all over the store wherever there was a register and wherever was busiest….I worked a few times behind the counter at the pharmacy, taking customers’perscriptions and ringing them up, but the busier we became, the more I would have to help the pharmacist fill perscriptions. I was about 19-20yrs old and in college, but I’m not taking any classes for pharmacy….before I began to fill perscriptions, I was given a quick run-down of what to do, no video was shown, and I basically had to figure it out myself. I don’t work there anymore, but I know they still do this because I have friends who work there. Customers at the pharmacy need to CHILL OUT and let the pharmacist do what they need to do at the speed they can do it…..it gets crazy and they need your cooperation…..and to retail stores with pharmacies, don’t stick people back there who don’t know what they’re doing. Pharmacists went to school to become pharmacists. Let them do their job.

When I questioned the PHARMACIST about some possible drug interactions, he told me that what I was asking was wrong. And then handed me the pamplet from Walgreens which told me I was right. The next morning I called the manager and she was horrified at how very wrong the pharmacist was. I am hoping she talked to him. At least he didn’t kill me; maybe the next person wasn’t so lucky.

now,
i wasnt able to read all of the comments, but…
the first reply hit the nail on the head
and just for the record, this report, for what i have read, makes it seem as if the young girl counted the medicine and handed it to the patient directly.
now, unless she broke the law, this is never, i emphasize NEVER the case.
whenever a Rx is filled, a pharmacist will check it before being sold.
any of you who are claiming that the pharmacy is at fault need to go into a pharmacy while you are not there on personal errands and try to bird watch as to what it is like in there
it is a pressure cooker…
one minute it is a calm and a peaceful nights sleep. then, one customer walks up, there to pick up their medicine, but there is a problem with the insurence. a quick adjustment and it will be taken care of…by the time that is done, one person is starring at the tech through the drive through and 2 more people have gotten in line after the first lady.
by the time you get the first patient rung up, the phone is ringing…meanwhile, the pharmacist is on the phone checking the voicemail for called in prescriptions, so, the tech HAS to answer the phone (or that will turn into another unhappy person)
by that time, the tech has rung up ONE customer, 1 more person is added in the drive-thru line, and one more in the actual store and 2 more are in the drop off lane
this is common, everday examples of my store…one minute it is slow and calm so patients expect fast turnover times…next thing you know you are multi-tasking, helping, LITTERALLY, 8 different people…
this isnt even mentioning the acutally filling dutites a trained tech needs to handle
this is a problem that will never be solved, trust an expierenced retail technician.
solution 1: hire more pharmacists…for thier education and professionalism this is not realistic to the big chains, for it will cost more than they could make
solution 2: hire more technicians…well then you get into the same problem of experience and training
the truth of the matter is, for such a high demand, quality service can not be met.
it is a feild that requires top notch service, accuarcy, dedication, professionalism and efficiency
re-read the first reply…people expect 5 minute turnover times…all for their own reasons, 9/10 they just want to be on their own way with personal agendas…every now and again you are faced with the legitimate emergancy…
*Deep breathe*
this was a rant
P.S. i was supposed to work from 11-4 today, and i ended up working from 9:00 to 5:30 just to meet the demand and help out my coworkers

Has ABC reviewed the actual number of pharmacists that graduate each year? The number needed far outweighs the number that are graduating from pharmacy schools across the U.S. The same situation is occurring in other healthcare professions. Errors unfortunately occur (we’re human)–was it reviewed as to how many prescriptions are being filled each day per pharmacist correctly? Most pharmacist are filling an average of 150-200 prescriptions per day each (not counting time to assist patients and consultations). The problem is not specific to one retail chain over another. There are significant pressures on pharmacists secondary to patient needs, restrictions on dispensing over the counter products, insurance company drug coverage, patient’s lack of knowledge of their own prescription policy, poor prescriber handwriting and inappropriate dosing. Was it evaluated as to how much is corrected/caught by the pharmacist review? Please look at the whole issue. From, a tired pharmacist

I am about to graduate from a pharmacy school. The problems are real and serious. The retails (e.g. Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aids) only care about“customer service”, not patient care.
In California, if there’s only 1 pharmacist on duty, you can only have 1 tech. If there’re 2 pharmacists, then only 3 techs can work in a pharmacy. However, many pharmacies do not follow this policy. They would have 3 techs working while there’s only 1 pharmacist. In this situation, the techs suppose to take off their badge and work only as a clerk and therefore, can’t fill prescription. However, very few retail pharmacies follow this policy.

As a registered Pharmacist in a huge retail chain pharmacy, I am under lots of pressure to provide“customer service”and push out as many prescriptions per minute as possible…after all more prescriptions= more money!
So here is this pressure to stay up to 13 hours on your feet, counsel , answer doctor phone calls, double check medications, type prescriptions, call insurance companies, all while trying to give each customer your individual attention without even a 15 minute break the ENTIRE day! No, I dont believe that there is any excuse for misfilling a prescription. But I do have many ideas for improving this!
Lately the pharmicies are getting bigger, along with the drive thrus, and 25 dollar couppons are circul;ating, encouraging people to take advantage and transfer back and forth.. this adds to so much distraction, you cannot even believe! (sometimes a feel like a work at mcdonalds, and want to ask“would you like fries with that”) and after working 13 to 14 hour shifts, ask any pharmacist how they feel. i GUARANTEE most mistakes are done at the end of a very long shift. this should not be allowed
and they should hire more help..
do you know that more and more hours of technician help is cut back more and more, which puts pressure on the pharmacists
did you know that the retail companies (cvs, walgreens, eckerd, rite aid) and so money hungry that the increase the risk of mistakes at the cost of a patient’s health?
i didnt go to school for this
i iwsh there were laws about how long a pharmacist can work a shift, how much technician help you should have, lab coats that the pharmacist can wear opposed to technician to distinguish from each other, ban the transfering gift card coupons (which prevents me from checking drug interactions at other pharmacies), make cetification to work in the pharmacy imperative, and allow pharmacists to be able to take a break

I am a nationally certified pharmacy technician and I am completely sickened by the poor attitude that the media and others have towards pharmacy technicians. I started working for a local chain pharmacy when I was only 16 years old and was never looked down upon for being a high school student filling the prescriptions of hundreds of people. Ultimately, it is the pharmacists’ responsibility to double check prescriptions and to make sure that no mistakes have been made. When listening to the report both on Good Morning America today and also on World News Tonight, I could not believe how they made it out to seem like it was all the technicians fault for any mis-filled prescriptions. Pharmacists go to school for 6 years for a reason. Pharmacies/Pharmacists also have insurance to cover mistakes made by pharmacists because mistakes do happen. Why is it so bad to have a high school student working in a pharmacy anyway? Isn’t it known that you learn things a lot more quickly when you are young than when you are older? So these young technicians are probably just as good, if not better than any of the older technicians. Until there is research saying that teenagers are not capable of doing this job compared to someone who is older, they should not be looked down upon by the media. I now work for a larger chain pharmacy that is all over the US and technicians that are not capable of doing their jobs are let go, ensuring that only the smartest technicians will be working in their pharmacies. Is there any proof that young technicians are making more mistakes than the older technicians? Most likely not, because no matter what age you are, there is the same chance that you could misread a prescription and make the same mistake that the young tech made with the coumadin. Come on, have you looked at a prescription before? Doctors handwriting is notoriously horrible!
My second point is that when you are signing when you pick up your prescription, you are absolutely NOT waiving your right to talk to a pharmacist! For example, at the pharmacy I work for, we ask each customer if they have any questions for the pharmacist. If they do not, they sign in one column. If they do, they sign in another column. Patients are ALWAYS welcome to call the pharmacy if they have any question regarding their prescription. No pharmacist is going to turn you away because you have signed on a clipboard.

Walgreens no longer types in info, they sacn the scripts so no errors can be made that way, as a customer I always double check what it is, dosage and for length of time.My pharamacy Walgreens also has a prompt when they ring you up, do you have any questions for the pharamacist?Also the paper log in the pictures looks like a PSE log that I have signed to get Suda-Fed thank you to the Meth-heads

In 2000 I lost my beloved mother
to a presciption that was written by the doctor for a daily dosage when in fact it should have been taken weekly. The pharmacist at
Walgreens should have caught the error. My mother was in ICU for 33days before she died.
Make sure that when given the presciption that it is the correct drug and dosage.

I am absolutely appalled at the misinformation provided in your story this morning! The“people in the white coats behind the counter”receive intense training before they can even touch a pill in my store. They are also licensed and/or certified personnel. Every step of every process done every day is checked by a pharmacist. At least three hands touch and check every prescription processed, ending with the pharmacist dispensing the final product. Never can any one else determine when that prescription is correct for the patient to use. And you try reading those prescriptions! Do you even know what you were prescribed or who you saw? Never is a patient denied consultation at any time. They may return in months ,if they wish, to discuss the most recent refill. The signature is simply required as proof that the medication was received by the patient or their agent. You try preparing for an intense audit without the appropriate signatures! To say that any one person is at fault is ridiculous. Many people have the opportunity to correct any mistake, including the doctor’s office where it originated. Who is to say the doctor didn’t write the wrong strength or wrote illegibly? Get all the facts, GMA and ABC, before persecuting ANYONE!!!

Wow. How one sided. Pharmacies are generally understaffed and Pharmacists are generally overworked. We go for long periods without any breaks and deal with grumpy sick people on a daily basis. Although, I’m sure there are some bad apples in the field, for the most part, pharmacists are very hard working, concerned about people, and tolerate much abuse. I hope people realize there are two sides to this story.

It’s time for patients to stop leaving their lives on the hands of health care providers and start getting more educated about the prescriptions they are taking, strength, dosage, directions to take, side effects, etc.
Also it’s ridiculous that doctors scribble a bunch of important information on a piece of paper and the pharmacists and pharmacy techs need to deal with it. That not only is a waste of time but it’s dangerous.

Perhaps Isabelle&amp;others should have enough integrity, professionalism and ethics to find another job, rather than making excuses and trying to justify mistakes. I am also a pharmacist, and I would NEVER allow myself to be put into a position that I could not handle. Whether the store is too busy, bad supervision, inadequate technician help, inadequate technology. It doesn’t matter. When you initial that prescription, you are responsible. Period. If you are working under poor conditions, FIND ANOTHER JOB! There is still a huge pharmacist shortage in this country, and jobs are plentiful. Do not use your employer as a crutch. Take responsibility&amp;be accountable. You owe your patients at least that much.

Another reason pharmacies must collect signatures is to show insurance companies the prescription was picked up. If the insurance co feels the script wasn’t within their guidelines they can refuse payment to the pharmacy. Also the pharmacy must prove they offered counseling to Medicaid customers. The pharmacy must take time out of their extremely busy day to collect the info for these audits.

i worked in a mom and pop pharmacy at the age of 16 and yes, i filled prescriptions. was i a certified technician? nope. did i have ANY formal training? nope. did i ever read a book about filling prescriptions? nope. i was trained by the pharmacists that worked there. did i understand the importance that job at the age of 16? NOPE. but, i did it. honestly, counting pills and slapping a label on the bottle does not require a college degree. i caught more mistakes made by the VERY busy and VERY overwhelmed pharmacists more than they ever caught mine, and yes, everyone makes mistakes. i understand the value of pharmacy technicians, but i do think there should be a nationally regulated level of training that is required to be one.

Nina, darn good point. Minors should not be working around meds. Some are even absorbed through the skin. Some need mixed. Interactions should be checked for, people often have multiple MDs writing scripts. People filling Rx need to be qualified for the job. Reading the paper I saw job listings for what is basically a secretary requiring a bachelors degree yet a person in the process of obtaining a GED can fill med scripts? THAT is truly terrifying. I will go to a hospital pharmacy from now on.
I worked as a specifically trained nurse aide with certifications and had years of medical experience, yet it was still against the law for me to hand meds to patients. For good reason as I was not a license holding RN that had aquired pharmicalogical knowledge. WHY are there not similiar laws for pharm techs?

High school students in a pharmacy…. just check your local doctor’s office…. not a real nurse (RN/LPN) in sight. Instead the doc will use medical assistants/office clerks, dress them in scrubs and pass them off as“nurses”. Many patients do not know that their medical care is dependent on a person with a 3 week course and on-the-job training, who gets paid a little more than minimum wage. Next time you go and see your doc ask the“nurse”- are you a RN or a LPN?

As a pharmacist, I am always extremely stricken with fear and saddened when I hear about these types of mistakes. I speak for the pharmacies that I’ve worked in, but the pharmacist must double check everything that leaves the pharmacy. I am always shocked when I encounter a patient that is shocked that I have to even check it. I know that I take my job very seriously, but you must realize that this job is a very stressful one at that. It is not only the fact that most pharmacists do not get breaks (and a lot of the time I work 12 hour days which is not a rarity) but the fact that there are soooooo many interruptions and chances for errors to occur.

The story was incredibly dramatized. I am a pharmacy student. I have worked both as a technician and now as a licensed intern. Technicians are trained to input prescriptions, count, and fill. However, the final responsibility falls on the pharmacist to make sure that the prescription is correct. A prescription is counted and the original stock bottle and Rx bottle to be given to the patient is checked by the pharmacist. The pharmacist checks to make sure the tablets are a match. Mostly importantly, the pharmacist checks to make sure the script was typed in correctly and what is on the script was what was given. There is no reason the student should be blamed for the prescription. It truly was the fault of the pharmacist. So essentially, whether a technician is in high school or not does not make much of a difference.

I am outraged by this episode. I am a registered nurse in a hospital. In order to give medications I need a college education. Pharmacists have a higher education but yet don’t have to live up to any responsibility. I can tell you if I gave out the wrong medication not only would I be looking at losing my license but also potential jail time. I live every shift I work correcting the many mistakes pharmacists make when are they going to have to live up to the responsibility their salary is certainly more than mine and I have to report all the mistakes if I would make any, hopefully this broadcast will open many eyes.

I live in a small town, and use a small town, family owned drug store. Not only is the customer service great, but the prices are lower than if I had my prescriptions filled in the city. And they have time to offer advice about non-prescription medications etc. But even this small town pharmacy can make mistakes. Ultimately, we are all responsible for our own health. A big chain pharmacist has hundreds of patients to care for, you only have you, and your dependents. Pay attention to what the doctor tells you the dosing should be. Write it down even. If what’s on the pill, or on the bottle doesn’t match, don’t take the medicine! With the internet, we have more information these day than we have ever in history. You can get pictures online of what a medicine should look like. If it doesn’t, don’t take it. We are deceived when we put so much trust in our pharmacists, despite what the commercials lead us to believe.

Sadly, We do not place any responsibility with ourselves as consumers. I have stood in line at my local Rite Aid pharmacy and witnessed customers screaming at store personnel until they were blue in the face simply because they were told that it would be 10-15 minutes to fill their prescription. We live in a society where everything has to be now, now, now. If it takes more than 60 seconds to get your burger at McDonald’s, you deserve a refund. If your pizza does not arrive within 30 minutes, we demand a refund. We expect prescriptions faster and faster. The large chain drug stores are simply responding to consumer demand.
Interestingly, there seem to be many comments attacking large corporations and praising local pharmacies, yet, no one has even presented and real evidence that the local pharmacies are really better.

Give me a break. You guys are causing panic with your one sided reporting. Walgreens fills 500 Million prescriptions a year. There will be some mistakes.
I’ve worked in pharmacies and all pharmacy personel care about the lives of their patients. Patients need to be aware of the prescription they are prescribed and make an effort to ensure their own safety. Always write down in your own hand writting what doctor prescribes and double check it when you receive your medication.

Pharmacy technicians today are completing more of the tasks that pharmacists completed years ago. Many of these tasks require extensive training. As a director of a pharmacy technician program at a community vocational college and a certified technician myself, I see the importance of providing educational training for future technicians. Our one-year diploma requires completion of courses in reading prescriptions, sterile and non-sterile compounding, processing benefits, pharmaceutical calculations, pharmacy operations&amp;law, parental admixtures, and clinical experience in retail and hospital pharmacy (216 hours). Again, this is required prior to the diploma being rewarded. At this point, many students are better prepared to take the certification exam. Perhaps, at some point soon, ALL states will REQUIRE this examination be completed before such students can call themselves“pharmacy technicians.”

I work in a Walgreens that does ~700+ average. How are mistakes counted? We review every rx entered throughout the day (Mn regulation) and if an error is made the patient is notified. If mistakes include typos (cap instead of tab, or misspellings) we might get to an ave of 2 mistakes per day. Wrong drug…maybe 1 or 2 a year. Wrong strength…maybe 1 a week…max. Also, techs do not dispense meds. They enter the rx and fill the vials, using a bar code scanner. The fact that she was is high school is a“red herring”meant to inflame the public. The pharmacist who actually looks at the pills is the ultimate dispenser of the meds.

Why wasn’t the program entitled“Walgreen’s may kill you: and here’s a couple other chains.”What an attack against Walgreens! Since the program made the problem to be so widespread, why weren’t there people who have been injured by other chains? I am sure that there have been errors made by CVS, RiteAid or even the mom&amp;pops. It is very easy to attack the chains and be perceived as a hero, but mention mom&amp;pop’s and you look like a villain. In the future, ABC, please try to balance your stories fairly.

The lack of responsibility the so-called“spokesperson for the pharmacy chain industy”takes for the actions of employees making the errors on tonight’s broadcast is utterly dispicable. Why did she not offer up what they were doing to prevent such errors? She states time and time again that she“wasn’t there, so couldn’t comment”. Obviously she was not there. She is an executive. It is her job to come up with strategy to work on the so called number one initiative of the pharmacy industry,“patient safety”. This is what we wanted to hear from her. Could it be that she and her company spend more of their time thinking of ways to increase the bottom line?

ABC,
I work as a Walgreen’s Pharmacy Technician and I see errors everyday ,not by us or the Pharmacists but by the doctor’s writing the perscription’s. Let’s see that story. The millions of doctor’s that write scripts for drug’s and strnegth’s that do not exsist , for drugs that the patient’s are allergic to. Our Pharmacist;s call onthese mistakes all day long. We also do have a system that track’s all mistakes made by the Pharmay Technicians and the Pharmacists that is tracked by our company because we do care. I take my job more seriously and care more about a patient’s healthcare than the patient’s do themselves. I have patient’s everyday that have no idea the name of their medication, what it is for or the strength. How can customers expect others to care so much if they do not care for themselves. And please if you wnat 10 minute service go to mcdonald’s and see how well they fill your perscripton

I’m glad that a report has FINALLY been done. A couple of years ago my daughter had a prescription filled at a Wal-Greens in Jackson, TN we were told that the wait would be a least a hour or more. That was not a problem we had other things to do in the neighborhood. When we picked up the script it said“instill 2 drops by mouth every 4 to 6 hours. IT WAS EAR DROPS! Thank God that this was something that she had taken before and that I saw the deadly mistake. When we questioned the error they acted like it was no big deal. They said”Oh, were busy and will put the right sticker if you want us too. But the attitude from the techs was like well just be glad that you saw the error. Because of this I’m so much more careful regarding all scripts now filled no matter where any of my scripts are filled. My heart goes out to the families that suffered from needless deadly mistakes made by untrained and neglectful pharmacy employees.

I am a pharmacist myself and I do agree with some of this report. I agree that pharmacists are over worked and that there are probably an increase in misfilled prescriptions. I work 9 or 12 hour days on my feet with no breaks. I try to take lunch when I can but only to be interrupted most of the time. I have to multi-task at a very high paced job and have constant interruptions when filling and checking prescriptions. I am sure most people who go to a pharmacy to fill there presciptions do not know how much a pharmacist and the technicians are doing behind those counters. Bottom line todays pharmacies are too busy for one pharmacist. We can have multiple technicians but they do not equal a pharmacist. States goverments need to get involved to allow pharmacists to take breaks and to increase pharmacists. Corporations will not do this until it is required. Reports like this upset me because I really do care a great deal for my patients and I feel that reports like this only add distrust to an over worked and misunderstood profession.

No other Company had better systems or processes for filling prescriptions than Walgreens does. Why not show some of the good that Walgreens is doing. Like their new Anderson Distribution Center.

waiting to see the 20/20 .. but reading what is here it shows that not alot of people know or understand what goes on behind the pharmacy counter. all too often you see patients who are very impatient about waiting for their prescription to be filled. i say let them wait so i can do my job properly and correctly. i too am a pharmacy technician. where i came from you had to be ptcb certified. not all states require that. too bad, they should. i also feel strongly about making it mandatory that one has professional training thru a pharmacy technician program such as thru a college. there are so many harmful meds out there that if taken wrong can be life threatening.

22% errors? ABC is saying that 22 out of 100 test prescriptions had errors. Why didn’t they define“errors”? No individual or group claims a 22% error rate exists in pharmacy, and any pharmacy that might fall into that definition would be closed by the state board within days. For that matter, the staff would probably quit before the board was even notified. We take errors very seriously. ABC’s claim is nothing short of slander, thrown in at the end, without a rebuttal. Why?

There is a shortage of 6,000 pharmacists as of 2006. Trained and adequately paid Pharmacy Techs are valuable. Unfortunately, states do not yet register them as they do for even hair dressers. STEP ONE–REGISTER TECHS, STEP TWO–PAY THEM. I have 20 years in the business and have yet to see a rational approach.

I am a 6th year pharmacy student who is less than two months away from graduataing with my Doctor of Pharmacy degree. I currently work as an intern for Walgreen’s and have done so for the past 4 years. In addition, I have done clinical rotations at various hospitals in my area. The chain-bashing on here is ridiculous.“Hire more pharmacists”, too bad there’s a large shortage, there is pretty much 0% unemployment in the pharmacy field.“Impose limits on hours worked and number of prescriptions checked”, get ready for long lines and shortened hours at your pharmacies, because there aren’t pharmacists to make up those times. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHAINS WANTING TO SAVE MONEY AND NOT HIRE PHARMACISTS! I love retail pharmacy, I love the patient-pharmacist interaction. I love talking to my patients (not customers) and go over their medications with them because that’s what I went to school for, not to tell you why your prescription costs more than it did last month. Am I perfect? No, absolutely not. Do I try my best to ensure you get your prescriptions filled properly? Absolutely. Also in terms of techs being in high school. It’s not preferable to hire techs at that age, but is someone in their 20s or 30s with a college degree looking for an underpaying job and get yelled at by patients for hours a week for something you have no control over? I don’t think so.

I am a married 27 year old working on my master’s degree in special education. My 9 year career as a Certified Pharmacy Technician has supported my efforts. I currently work for a major retail chain as the lead technician. I have undergone extensive on the job training as well as completing 20 Continuing Education hours every year to keep my National and State registration. It makes me very sad to hear slander like this. It seems that there is only one piece of a very large puzzle being looked at here. First of all, the only other employees allowed in my pharmacy are the managers, who are certified as well. Absolutely under no circumstances, is a photo clerk or cashier allowed in the pharmacy!!!!! EVER! As with any business today there is a demand to provide cheaper and faster service. To me, that’s ok for my lunch, but not my prescription. Honestly, over the last nine years I have become very skilled at filling quickly and accurately. I try my best to keep my customers happy, but we fill over 400 scripts daily and most people don’t want to wait more than 15 minutes. Please call in your refills a day ahead of time. Please be patient with us. One will wait in a doctor’s office for an hour, but will give me attitude when I need 20-30 minutes to accurately fill a prescription. It is not a burger and fries, it is a medication that could sadly be disasterous if not prepared correctly. I understand that mistakes happen, but I strongly feel that the wrong image is being promoted here!

I missed the episode because i was at my work at a pharamcy. Some of these errors also come from the doctor that wrote it. A lot of times it gets to be really bad that we have to call the doctors office. In the busy world we live customers demand so much, often we get rushed, patients throw fits because their insurance rejects their prescription, etc. Everything we do get is checked by a pharmacist, i myself make errors i am only human, but the pharmcist will make me fix my errors. my pharmacy manager had recently told us to sacrifice more time into accurcy, getting everything right, then being rushed my customers. I dont think there will any difference between which store you go to. it depends on how good the pharamcist is, i work at a walgreens were their is some really good pharamcists. Even though techs at walgreens dont have degrees, some are certified, each one has to go through a long process of training.

This story got your attention, oooo aaaahhhh. Don’t blame it on a specific chain, blame it on the regulating agencies who haven’t set rules. As a manager at Walgreens, I know that training occurs for SEVERAL days before ANY tech is thrown to the wolf-like patients, regardless of age or work background. Journalism as such is sickening and to think this is limited to only Walgreens is absolutely obsurred. For those of you who decided to change pharmacies in light of this piece, good luck finding a pharmacy that is not affected by human error. Furthermore, from what I’ve been a part of, it is more like 1-2% of patients whose RX has an error, not the jaw-dropping 22% ABC dug for.

I find it absolutely disgusting that ABC did this report this way. It is so bias and lying to the American Public. I work at Walgreens as a manager. First of all the only people who are allowed in the pharmacy besides technicians are managers. You might see a photo personal in the pharmacy b/c that person is brilliant and is cross trained!! Second of all there wouldnt be so much pressure on pharmacists if the American people were patient and caring. Just today I had a customer complain b/c the pharmacist told them it was going to take 15 minutes to fill their prescription. The customer told me that”it is only two prescriptions all you have to do is slap a label on it“. Maybe if customers were more understanding and would be willing to wait 30 minutes for a prescription less errors would be made. Also, ABC never once mentioned that Walgreens does an excellent job at customer service. That we greet each customer we see, never let more that 3 people stand in line without calling for help. Or how about the fact that we are opening up a warehouse just for people with disabilities who wouldnt normal find work! ABC you should be ashamed of yourself!! One last thing THAT PICEC OF PAPER YOU SIGN IS NOT WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO TALK TO A PHARMACIST ABOUT YOUR MEDICATION. IT IS CALLED THE HIPPA ACT!! FEDERAL REGULATED ITEM. SO IF YOU WANT TO GO AFTER SOMEONe FOR THAT BLAME THE GOVERNEMNT.

I am a pharmacy technician and I resent the accusations that people are making about us. Mistakes happen everywhere and I agree with some of the people who have posted here, that consumers should be taking some responsibility for their healthcare. I have had to input prescriptions that were horribly written by doctors, meaning barely discernible, and when I ask the patient, which doctor did you see? or, did doctor tell you what this medication is supposed to be for? All I get are blank faces, I mean, come on, this is unacceptable. Know what medication you are supposed to be taking! I am not saying that prescription errors are acceptable in a pharmacy setting, but, seeing as how we are humans, this is inevitable. There are safeguards in place to minimize, if not eradicate errors completely, and the consumer should be part of this process! Retail pharmacy is still the best place to get your prescriptions filled.

I have been a Pharmacy Tech for 9 years and this story is so one sided. We are understaffed and overworked. Customers are always expecting the prescriptions in 10 minutes or less. When calling Dr.’s office for clarification half the time the person answering the phone takes a guess at what the Dr. wrote instead of asking Dr. Pharmacist are ultimatly responsible for the dispensed medication. You must be 18 or older to work in Pharmacy. Profit is #1 on the company’s list. Do not blame the technician’s for the pharmacy problems blame the corprate suits who make the rules!!! Ask for the Corprate office # and call and complain to make any difference the Pharmacy staff is just the puppets working for these large corps. Technicians are just doing what corprate tells them to do and are trying to make a living just like the rest of you!! Shame on ABC for being so one sided and not telling the whole story!! Come work in a pharmacy and see if you can do it better, and see what it is really like before making assumptions about how it works!!!

As a Pharmacist in trainingt and a daughter of a pharmacist, I have to say, that it isn’t that uncommon to see mistakes in Pharmacies made anywhere. It is our duty as consumers to double check what the Dr. has written and what the pharmacy has given you as well. I have seen on many occasions when Doctors have made mistakes and the pharmacist has to call and have the doctor change what he had origionally written and the patients have to wait. Technicians are not always to blame when mistakes are made, Pharmacists MUST check a prescription when entered into our computer system. I am not saying that what happened to these people should be shrugged off, but when a pharmacist goes through your consultation when you receive your medication, YOU MUST pay attention to what they are saying to you. Especially when receiving a new prescription, it is your right to have these and should get them if not to just double the check the work of the pharmacy.
There are only about 70 schools for pharmacy in the nation and only a small number of students graduating from each school. having the pharmacists do all of what is involoved in the pharmacy would require anywhere from 5- even 20 pharmacists at a time with out help of the technicians. And the small number of pharmacists that would be working, it would take a MUCH longer time for your script to be filled.

It is very interesting how everyone is focusing on errors that pharmacist are making. What no one ever made a mistake in their life/jobs? We are humans and mistakes are made. What everyone should focus on is next time you go to pick up your Rx:
1. Dont be inpatient. If your Rx is not ready sit down and wait. Like mentioned above they are not making burgers. This is not do you want fries/coke or diet coke with that. 2. Do not scream and yell to the staff. If you scream and yell to someone, they will be troubled and take them a while to concentrate and get back to what they were doing before. You dont scream and yell at the doctors office when you wait for at least 20 min in the waiting room. 3. If you have a question for the price and the Rx has been run through the insurance you need to call your insurance. Pharmacies are not insurance companies. Just as a supplemental service the staff will call for you but do go and demand the staff to call the insurance just because you never read the agreament that you insurance can change your plan withuot notifying you. 4. If you are on a maintanance medication make sure you know how many refills/pills you have remaining so that you do not call for a refill on saturday and you are out of pills. Doctors offices are not open weekends. Do not scream at us that you are out of medication, if it was such an important medication to you then you should have been more careful and kept an eye out on day of the week, pills remaining, refills remaining.
Do not call the pharmacy and ask ohh what am i supposed to do, I am completely out of my meds. If you do not care and wait till the last minute why should they care about it.
Stuart weiner mentioned that“the pharmacist should be required to work at least one year as a technician before they could be licenced as a pharmacist. This would be much like MD’s serving as interns”. Well Stuart looks like you have no clue on how to become a pharmacist. Just for your information last year in pharmacy school, pharmacy students work full time for free or as you want to call it intern in different health care providers for 1 month at a time. Also becoming a pharmacist will take you 6 years out of your life, and pretty soon it will be 8.
ABC this story is very unfair to the pharmacist proffesion. You should make a report on the above points I mentioned. People need to know that the pharmacists are dealing with life threatning medications so do not rush them. let the pharmacist do their job.

The consumer is just as responsible for their own medications. I have been a long time consumer of Walgreens and have never had a problem. I have always been asked if I need more information. There has always been an attached pamphlet with more information about the medication. It is also important for people to realize that somewhere in that pamphlet OR on the stickers placed on the bottle is a description of the pill you should be getting. It will tell you what the pill will look like (round white pill) and the special and individualized numbers or letters that will be on side 1 and 2 of the pill itself. People need to use a little more common sense in the use of their own medications and realize that yes, people are human and mistakes are made from time to time. That’s why you ask questions if you don’t understand or if something doesn’t seem right.

i have been going to walgreens since many years and have had no complaints.Walgreens has the latest technologies for auto-fills,express pay and the new express check,easy access to pharmacists ,the walgreens staff and the pharmacists have really been very good to me and always give advice on every prescription i take.I consider Walgreens to be one of the best and professional pharmacy chains.I still believe it is the pharmacy america trusts.

ABC 20/20 has miss led all of the viewers out there. I work for one of the retail drug stores that they did their story on. I do not know what pharmacy the people at ABC use, but retail pharmacies fill over 65 percent of all prescriptions written by a doctor. If you have ever been into a retail pharmacy, you know that they are busy. You have people dropping off prescriptions, picking up, coming through drive-thru, asking for consults, and calling. The retail setting is very stressful. Pharmacists do not even get a lunch break. ABC should be looking into the bigger picture, Doctors and nurses who write the prescriptions. All doctor offices should be mandated to have electronic prescriptions. I don’t know if you have ever looked at the prescription the doctor wrote for you but if you did you would say what the **** does that say. It is true that doctors have very poor handwriting. You cannot tell what strength the medication is because of their sloppy handwriting. When we call to question it, the doctors do not always get back with us. The patient is upset because we told them that we have to check the dose on their prescription and they go into a heated rage. Or when we tell them, it will take more than 15 minutes to fill. I love it best when the doctors write for a Zpack, a medrol dose pack, or a cream. The patient tells us that it is just in a box and all we have to do is put a label on it. That is not how it works. We have to scan in your prescription, then we have to type it in, then run it through your insurance, then fill it along with the other 7 waiters ahead of you and you want to know why it takes more than 15 minutes to get you prescription ready. That is why. It is not just as simple as to slap a label on it as you may think. If we tell you that it is going to take more than 15 minutes to fill your prescription, trust us that it will take 15 minutes to fill your prescription. We are not going to lie to you. What would you rather us tell you, give me 2 minutes and I we have it ready for you, and then when it is not ready you start to complain, why is it taking you so long. And just for FYI if you owned a company wouldn’t you rather pay a tech 9 something an hour verses 49 for a pharmacist when you could have 5 techs working for the salary of a pharmacist in just one hour. And don’t think that the retail pharmacy or any pharmacy is a McDonalds. We are not cooking your fries or flipping your hamburger patties, we are handling your medication. Medication that is very important to your health. We don’t want to rush your prescription because we do not want to make mistakes that can be avoided at all costs. I bet you money that when this patient dropped off their prescription they said that it was an emergency and that they needed it right away. They pressured the pharmacy staff to get it out in a certain time, she complained when it was not ready and in the end was given the wrong medication.

It’s a shame the companies would rather hire in for monitary reasons than experience. Either way, though, alot of responsibility is put on technicians, saying only a registered pharmacist should fill a prescription is not only unrealistic it’s also nearly impossible in a busy store. They barely have enough pharmacists as it is to fill work hours, so how do we expect them to come up with 4 others to do a job a technician is trained specifically to do? It’s not a financial reason so much as it is a shortage in pharmacists. On the note of rudeness in pharmacies, I’m certain most of you that receive rude service aren’t sunshine and rainbows when your insurance doesn’t cover a medication, and all of a sudden it becomes the“techs”fault, so you take it out on him. In our pharmacy we occasionally have a script under the wrong name, generally do to the PATIENT giving the incorrect birthdate or not knowing any information on who they’re dropping off for, and when we refuse to fill it we’re in the wrong when they cant give us such simple information. Go into your pharmacy and ask a tech the ridiculous things they deal with on a daily basis, the general populace is ignorant, I fear in a few decades they’ll be incapable of even eating without someone to hold their hand.

I place full blame on Big business. If Walgreens didn’t have 3 stores alone in my small town, then they could afford to hire more experienced workers and more help at one location. Walgreens and CVS exist to add to Urban sprawl.

I think we as a society are responsible. The attitude of I needed this yesterday, can’t wait. As big people (adults) we should be responsible for ourselves and loved ones. The world does not revolve around you and your schedule.
I see patients that do not know about their own medications.“I need a refill on my little blue pill. I don’t know the name or what its for.”Patients expect too much. They are not willing to be PATIENT. Call in refills 48 to 72 hours in advance. So if need the doctor can be contacted, the medication can be ordered. You are not the only one taking this medication.
I understand you are sick. Rushing things in anything in life does not help. Rush cooking that hamburger, it probably be raw. Rushing in your car, may cause and accident.
Be Proactive. Request your doctor get software which allows him/her to print our your prescription. Ask the doctor what the medication is for.
If the price is not right, understand that the pharmacy is not dictating what to collect from you. Go home and call who is. We are pharmacist not insurance agents. We did not sell you your insurance policy. Ask me all that you like about your medications.

In response to Judy,RN. I am a recent PharmD graduate of a midwestern university. Pharmacists are held up to some of the highest responsibilities and have to abide to laws in place that could result in jail time and loss of licensure. All in midst of tightened budgets and insurance scrutiny. I have respect for the job you do as a nurse,but when was the last insurance company that you dealt with in your current job. None? That is right your billing/claims dept deals with this. Retail Pharmacists are the claims dept and the copay collectors and source of endless amounts of medication information as well as the person who gets every single complaint. How many patients do you take care of in one shift. We fill 150-200 prescriptions in an 8 to 12 hour shift plus all of the above mentioned. Who do you ask if you don’t understand a Doctor’s order or why a patient is on a certain medication, 9 out of 10 it is your Pharmacist. Because the doctor is too busy or not available to answer that question. Just to make one point, maybe the reason you don’t make mistakes is because a Pharmacist checks over what you are administering to the patient first or at least controls the system in which you retrieve medications to give to patients.

I am a former Walgreen’s technician. ABS has not presented the facts clearly. Walgreen’s has a strict training program. It took me 80 hours to complete the training before I was allowed into the pharmacy. I was then shadowed for 2 weeks by a certified technician. After my training, I was allowed to take classes that Walgreen’s provided to prepare me for the PTCB national exam. They also paid for that exam. They do this for every technician to better train them. I understand that now this is a requirement for all Walgreen’s technicians. Also, they continually provided me with training programs and offered free continung education. I makes me sick to know that ABC has taken isolated incidents and exploited a great company that has done so much for this country-you see, they didn’t”pocket all of the profits”-but let’s not talk about the good they do, right? I found that this expose was quite one-sided. I have read all of the postings and I have to say, don’t criticize me until you’ve walked a day in my shoes. And as far as floor stockers and photo clerks working in the pharmacy, I have only ever seen them work in the capacity of a cashier-not what ABC made them out to look like. Congrats ABC-you’ve just terrified the general American public! Now people will be scared to death to go to a pharmacy to get their scripts filled. Is this your idea of population control? Why does news have to always be about the bad in everything? The other comments I have read tonight talk about how they have switched from Walgreen’s -I’m switching from ABC! There are 2 other major networks I can watch and over 100 chanels on my cable box-I’m done with you! And for the record-I’m staying with Walgreen’s. They have caught possible over dosing errors made by my medical doctor more than once and called to clarify, they have caught drug allergies that my doctor wasn’t aware of, and they have always answered any questions that I have had. That’s why eventhough I am not a technician for them, I continue to have my medications filled by them. They still have the best system of checks and balances in the industry. ABC- one day when you are so perfect that you can walk on water-then come back to the air waves with an expose like this one. That will never happen-but then again if it did, I wouldn’t be watching it anyway!

As a Walgreens employee I would like to apologize to the people who have been hurt because of an error made at a Walgreens store. It is not acceptable that mistakes occur, but it is inevitable that they will. Walgreens has over 5,000 stores and 200,000 employees…bad things are bound to happen. My favorite comments from all of this are that nobody is perfect&amp;everyone is human. I think that’s the most important thing to remember when looking at a huge corporation such as Walgreens. Just because some people in the company make mistakes (do their job poorly, cheat/steal, sexually harass…whatever the case may be) does not make the entire company bad. In fact, by making such a generalization, you are bringing down the thousands and thousands of quality employees that do a great job every day. Of course an under cover report on television isn’t going to show every side of the story…and the ignorant people in this country will be the ones to not even realize that there are two sides. We live in a society that not only strives for perfection but demands it. And why shouldn’t we? We assume we are so technologically advanced that errors should never occur, things should be done in a quick&amp;timely manner, and a company that has been around for over 100 years should know what the heck it’s doin. The reality is we don’t have perfection…we are always going to want things to be done faster so we’ll never be satisfied….and a company that is run by people, real live people, is bound to have mistakes. Granted, if I were placed in the same situation as one of these families I would have a completely different viewpoint. When it’s your child or mother that’s life has been changed because of an error it’s impossible not to place blame.
My hope is that this investigation has awakened people to see the real problems with our health care system&amp;pharmacies. With the rising senior population needing medical attention/prescriptions, the demand for Health Care professionals such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists… has sky-rocketed! The demand has also brought forth new technologies that need to be perfected. Walgreens has especially taken on this challenge, but it is a work in progress. My advice to everyone would be to be as pro-active as you can be. Be that annoying customer that asks a thousand questions when there are 10 people waiting behind you in line. Be the person that calls when you get home because you thought of another question. Look online and research…actually READ about what you are taking. If you are not getting the attention at the pharmacy you want&amp;deserve… ask for it.

It is obvious that there need to be some changes in the pharmacy industry, one of those changes is slowing down how fast the perscriptions are being filled and closely checking each one and not allowing untrained children to fill them. Although the sad fact is that Americans are in such a rush that they can’t be just a little patient and wait a little longer to get there meds correctly filled. I feel that some consumers are at fault for“rushing”the process which in turn over the years has run the system into this chaos. Which than effects everyone, even those of us that are very patient.

This report sited a university person saying that signing the prescription log essentially waives the right to counseling??? I DONT THINK SO! Every new prescription is required to be offered counseling BY THE PHARMACIST! The patient has a right to say no, and in our pharmacy we indicate this on our signing log. ABC, PLEASE SEND ME A LINK TO THIS LAW!

I will graduate with my Doctor of Pharmacy degree this May. I feel that after the intense educations pharmacists receive, they deserve more respect. I have had so many people ask me why I had to go to school 7 years to“just count pills.”People do not understand that there is more to pharmacy than counting pills. You may not realize it, but your pharmacist is using clinical knowledge to determine if your drug therapy has significant interactions etc…I have worked in a retail pharmacy for 10 years. It appears that everyone thinks that the pharmacy should have your Rx’s ready in a snap; yet, they get upset there is a mistake. There is no reason for mistakes, but we are all human. Also, mistakes are encouraged by those patients who peer at you over the counter huffing and puffing. A pharmacist cant help but feel rushed. It is imporant to realize that pharmacists have a very important role in healthcare and that they should be treated with respect. Also, you may not realize it but positive health outcomes occur everyday in the pharmacy. I wish that ABC would do a special on how many lives pharmacists have SAVED by interfering with prescribed medication.

PHARMACISTS ARE DOCTORS!!!! Show them some respect. Your doctors make mistakes, you make mistakes, every HUMAN being has the potential to make a mistake. The pharmacist takes responsibilty for every action in that pharmacy, regardless of who made the mistake. Talk to your pharmacist and ask questions! Don’t just stare them down and ask how much longer!!! The counseling session is available to you when the technician or cashier asks if you have any questions for the PHARMACIST!!!!! This session is there to catch errors and to prevent any misunderstanding. IT IS PARTLY YOUR FAULT IF YOU WALK AWAY WITH THE WRONG MEDICATION!!!! TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE!!!!!!

I think this is ridiculous! People who buy their prescriptions from the pharmacy take no responsibility anymore to make sure what they have is what they need. Nowadays it’s more to have a consumer check there bag to make sure they got both order of fries instead of checking to see if the pills are correct. People need to take some resposibility and learn how their insurance plans work, what medication they need, and not to blame others for mistakes that could easily be fixed. I’,m not saying that the pharmacy is blame free, cause it’s not, but this article pins the whole blame on people just trying to get through the day and do their jobs. I see this as extremely biased and unfair.

Hmmm…. i don’t know about this girl. I use to work at a walgreens pharmacy in my younger days. As i remember it, a pharmacist did check every order before it left the store. I no longer work there, because i moved on the a different field, but what i do remember is that Doctor’s handwriting is very messy. In this case i think it is possible this is a Tech AND the Pharmacist error. It seems that this girl could possible just be a angry ex-employee wanting 15 minutes of fame. I do remember a pharmacist checking EVERY rx.

I currently work at a retail pharmacy and I was very disturbed by the one sided program that ABC broadcasted. Patients are our number one concern and their safety is very important. What people have to realize is that they have to be understanding of what we are doing, which is looking out for their health, healthcare can’t be rushed. Where I work ALL employees inside the pharmacy are trained and certified. What was also not mentioned was the fact that we have to watch our doctors and how they write their scripts. If you can’t read it have him/her tell you what it is and you write it down yourself so you know what you are getting. I can’t tell you how many doctors we have to call to verify scripts and how many doctors write the wrong dosage. PLEASE check all your scripts, most people read ingredients of foods before they eat it so do the same with your scripts.
 
Posted by: BJ | March 31, 2007, 1:43 am 1:43 am
 
Agencies like this have safety checks in place. There is a screen on Walgreen’s computer that has a picture of the drug that is to be compared with the drug in the bottle by the pharmacist. Ultimately, this is the pharmacist’s fault. I am sure this young lady had no intentions of making this horrible error, but stuff happens. Whether it takes 10 minutes or 200 minutes, it should not have happened. We have to use the check system that is in place. Give us some grace, have some patience, we are very busy people. As the patient, know what you are taking! If it looks diferent, call and check!

Just to repeat what has been said:
This is sensationalism at its best; mistakes happen like this (as tragic as it is) in all areas of life. I am currently at one of the highest-ranked schools in the country completeing my PharmD. It is extremely challenging, and I spend hours upon hours studyiing. It is 3 years of academic coursework and 10 months of rotations. Overall, it is a 4 year program and over 90% of those in my class already have a BS or BA. We are all there for different reasons, but many of us see the flaws in the system/profession and hope that we can advocate for positive change. Unfortunately, Big Pharma’s role and the fact that civilization is driven by money has been ignored in this story. That I am even posting this is just adding to the hype; I wanted to let those know that the path to becoming a pharmacist and wearing that white coat is not an education or a job that we take lightly.
 
Posted by: Carrie | March 31, 2007, 1:51 am 1:51 am
 
The majority of the errors of this type occur because the doctor who wrote the prescription has illegible handwriting. The girl would not likely have made the mistake if the prescription had been clearly written. Granted, a pharmacist may have known better and caught it but any system that depends on a human to interpret another humans handwriting is bound to fail. The system needs to be changed to a computerized prescription system so that the any pharmacy, anywhere can dispense the drugs with as few errors as possible.

There should be more stories about how many pharmacists that do not speak English.The English they try to speak is incomprehensible.If they can not speak English,how can they read it well enough to fill prescriptions? We all know how poorly written the prescriptions are.Nobody but a well trained pharmacist can read them somehow. Several CVS in my state have had their share on disasters and almost killing people. It’s a shame. These places are taking our lives literally into their hands.

Yes, it would be nice if EVERYONE were PERFECT at their job! Pharmacists and technicians really don’t sit around trying to think of ways to harm the public; maybe patients should take responsibility, too. There are more problems than this. Everyone’s toddler is on an amphetamine and drug seekers plague pharmacies everyday. Pharmacists would like to slow down and give every patient one on one attention, but as long as the entire country is dependent on drugs it won’t happen any time soon.

Patients who take medications have to exercise a lot of care. This includes confirming the medication with the Doctor, checking the medicine label for accuracy when receiving it from the pharmacy and making sure to consume the right medicine in right doses.
ABC has created this program with great effort. But the aim seems to be on media ratings rather than inputs to patients to avoid this situation by stressing the importance doing self-check. This is the same as driving on the street.“It is not enough if you drive properly. You have to watch out for other drivers too”

I just filled a prescription at Walgreens this week and noticed that the dosage and directions were different from the doctors. I called the pharmacy and found out they did make an error in dosage and directions had been left out–because“there wasn’t enought room on the bottle for the directions!”Good thing I even noticed!

I just wanted to say that every state has their own laws. You can call your state board of pharmacy and know what the specific laws are. A lot of states do not accept any pharmacy technician as an employee unless they have completed school and have received their level A license.

Please look up the tragic story of Jose King and how after Jose’s unfortunate death, her family instead of suing, joind forces with the Johns hopkins Hospital (where the error occured) and made amazing things happen in improving patient safety. Thanks to this joint effort, many errors have been prevented at Hopkins and other institutions around the country.

ABC,
The story being presented was misleading to the general public. Yes, mistakes does occur in the phamarcy, but it’s the job of the REGISTERED pharmacist to check and double check the errors. The job of pharmacists and technicians are very stressfull and yes, very demanding. There will be never a“perfect”pharmacy. Errors will occur, but if the Pharmacists are willing to check/slow down checking prescriptions, then the errors will be significantly be less.

I would like to point out the huge staffing issue in pharamcy across the nation in both pharmacists and technicians. In our pharmacy, we had two technicians leave at the same time and even with massive recruitment strategies it took us 6 months to hire two new technicians.
Even while trying to explain a staffing shortage to customers, most demanded their prescriptions be filled in 5 minutes. I think the public needs to be realistic as to what a pharmacy can do. The public should not be asking the pharmacy where toothpaste is.
In addition, most pharmacist across the country work for 8 hours straight with no meal breaks. It would be safer for pharmacies to close for 30 minutes although the public outcry over such an“inconvenience”would never allow such a practice to occur.
But a lot of errors are propagated at the doctor’s office. I have transcribed prescriptions from receptionists who can’t even pronounce the name of the medication. When I ask for clarification most just say that is what the notes say. I have to insist they ask the doctor to clarify the problem.
Oftentimes its not the chain but the individual pharmacy. Some pharmacies are run like well oiled machines wheras others are rather chaotic.
And now with all pseudoephedrine product purchases requiring registration, pharmacies are becoming even more hectic.

This man, Mark Johnston is head of the National Association Of Pharmacy Technicians. Get an interview with him, and he can tell you all you want to know about being a pharmacy technician, and all about his organazition, and all the good they do for all of the pharmacy technicians. Call his office in Texas and he has all the information you need on being a pharmacy technician. Mark is the man….

As a pharmacist, I am very concerned and outraged. How dare the news media spin this story as if this was common in the world of pharmacy. Pharmacists have technicians to assist in the dispensing of medications to patients. In every pharmacy across the nation, every prescription must, by law, be verified by a pharmacist. The technician should not be blamed by this incident. It is always, always the responsibility of the pharmacist on duty to make sure every prescription is correct. However, in today’s society, who really is to blame, when patients demand speedy service more than accuracy? Patients need to understand–do you want your prescription fast or accurate??? Patients must understand that it takes extensive thought and consideration for your prescriptions, and it is more difficult than placing“30 pills in a bottle.”As pharmacists, we must evaluate and consider every medication and every dose you bring into a pharmacy to get filled. We are dealing with chemicals that alter the physiology of the human body. This is not“kids play”, and requires conscious and accurate thought of the pharmacy staff. The next time you go to your local pharmacy, please consider this: there was a customer before you and there will be a customer after you. If you scream and yell at the pharmacy crew because it will take 20 minutes to get your prescription filled, or your medication is not covered by your insurance company, or because you didn’t go to your doctor for refills and now need your medication, your actions will affect every single patient that will be serviced by that pharmacy after you leave. Think to yourself–how would you feel if you were the patient filling a prescription after some crazy, eradiate patient upset the whole pharmacy team? Not good, I hope. Pharmacists, by law, cannot leave a pharmacy unattended without coverage, this fact is extremely difficult for pharmacists to deal with. Would you want that responsibility? Could you handle that responsibly?

i work in a retail chain,as a pharmacy technician and i have never seen the problems like everyone is discussing.no,i am not in high school and yes,i did graduate,but i did not have any experience when i got hired and ive been at my job for 2 years.our system at my job is simple ,the tech enters the script,the pharmacist checks it and the tech fills it.the tech can not make a mistake becuz we have handheld computers that tell us what meds we need,and how to dispense them and if we pick up the wrong bottle,the computer lets us know.as far as wait times and insurance companies,nobody knows for sure,but i think that people need to stop being in a hurry,how would you feel if we rushed you at your job and asked for no mistakes.

A lot of what I read is crazy. I have learned differently. I am a pharmacy clerk not a technician at a CVS/Pharmacy in California, we also have techs and pharmacists of course. As a clerk I can’t handle the medication at all outside of the vial. Before after completing a certain amount of hundreds of hours working as a clerk you could take a test to become a technician, however that changed and now it is mandatory to go to a pharmacy technician school. However, experience is what I have heard a lot. Who has more experience a pharmacy clerk who’s been working for 6 years or a student who went to pharmacy tech school for 6 months? You tell me!!! In California you need to have a license to be a technician and students who are studying to become pharmacists DO HAVE TO do internships/externships at pharmacies to complete their pharmacy school. Our pharmacy manager, my boss, makes sure to pick qualified people to do the job and never I mean never allows anyone from different departments to work in the pharmacy even if it is really busy. Do to HIPPA reasons, no one other than pharmacy personnel is supposed to be in the pharmacy. This shows that it’s not every pharmacy in the United States. Also, it is true what another person mentioned about customers getting mad if you tell them 15 minutes wait time, and then they stand at the out window peering at you for the whole 15 minutes.
This story may be right about
some pharmacies, but not all.

I have been a pharmacy technician for 18 years now ( nationally certified for 7 now)….I do not believe in unexcussed errors..every error in our pharmacy“walgreens by the way”gets reported to the pharmacy board…just because one walgreens messes up or has a bad rap in your area doesnt mean that you should be critizing every walgreens store in the area….i work in a walgreens that fills over 700 scripts a day and we have 100′s of customers who seem to think that they are more important than all the other customers in the store..the customers complain about 1 hour wait times , drive thru not fast enough, druggies constantly wanting there scripts early……all i have to say about this is one thing…get a grip all of you“Do you want quality or speed?…”…last time I checked quality is more important..so the next time we have to ask you to come back in an hour or so….just remember we are trying to get your script right…so back off!!!!!

This is obviously a biased story by ABC. I have been a pharmacist for over 10 years working for 2 seperate chain pharmacies. I have read most of the comments made by other pharmacists and I agree that a lot of errors are caused by over demanding customers and not enough staff. I have to work 12 hour shifts like many R.Ph’s and there are no lunch breaks or any breaks for that matter. Yes we currently fill 200 scripts a day with one tech and no breaks at all! There are a few times I don’t even eat for 12 straight hours, just drink a bottle of water. I feel like I’m working in a sweat shop! Everyone at our store gets a schedule break including the techs but not the pharmacists because we have to be available all the times as long as the pharmacy is open. How are we supposed to accurately check 200 scripts a day for 12 hour straight standing on one spot. Are pharmacists robots? The last time I checked I’m still human. As for demanding customers? Don’t let me get started. I once told a customer that the script will be done in 5 minutes and he looked at me like I was from Mars. He said,“you have the medication in your hands, what’s the problem?”And how about the non-related pharmacy questions that we get on a daily basis? How many times have I been asked where’s the restroom? Maybe 15 times per day. There are just too many interuptions to focus on the task of checking for errors and drug interactions when filling a script. On Mondays, the phone rings non stop every 2 minutes. It seems like our customers don’t know how to use the phone or internet to refill scripts. How many times do I check someone out at the register? Maybe 60% of the time. Yes I am literally a very high paying cashier. I don’t really feel like a high educated professional. I wish I can use more of my knowledge and patient counsel as I thought that would be the case when I went to phamacy school where they taught us“Pharmaceutical care”. I wish the profession would be different but it is not and I don’t see any changes in the future. The big chain pharmacies need to give more staff even if just a cashier and the customers need to be more realistic and call ahead for refills. And for goodness sakes who thought of the idea for drive thru’s in pharmacies? That is the most ludicrous thing I have every experienced in my life. Just imagine your working in a pharmacy with only a pharmacist and one tech. The tech is filling a script at the drop off counter..the pharmacist is checking a rx..then the phone rings..you put it on hold…a customer walks up to the pick up side…the phone rings…you put them on hold…the pharmacist stops checking the rx and helps customer at pick up…the phone rings…someone drives up to drive thru window…the phone rings…the tech helps the drive thru…the phone rings…someone comes up to drop off counter…the phone rings…This is pharmacy!

Pharmacies are handled like many businesses the only difference is that when a pharmacy tech makes a mistake it can be a life or death situation. You have one person who has the necessary training and group of cheap labor unqualified and barely trained to get by and learn on the fly.

The entire segment seemed to me as an unbalanced attack on Walgreens. All the major retail drug store chains handle millions of prescriptions every year and each chain has undoubtedly dispensed incorrect medications. Why did ABC only bring up examples of mistakes by Walgreens? In contrast, they had a CVS pharmacist come running out just to make sure the new patient got their consult. This is truly disappointing journalism. ABC did a test of 100 prescriptions and found 22 errors. No details? How many of those pharmacies were Walgreens? How did the separate chains rank? If at the least, they had tested 100 prescriptions at each of the major chains and Walgreens ranked the worst, then it might justify the unfair negative coverage Walgreens received.

The report centered on obtaining signatures from pharmacists that state that they did not want consultation is not all true. At CVS/Pharmacy we have a great signature log. One side they sign if it is new and they will be receiving consultation the other states that they don’t want consultation such as for refills. Whenever it is new we ask them sign the side that states“Yes, I would like to speak to the pharmacist regarding my medication, etc.”and if at the time we let the patient know that we will have the pharmacist explain the medication to them, they deny the consultation, we ask them to initial the side that states,“No, I would not like to speak to the pharmacist regarding my medication, etc.”We also you the log for audits in insurance claims, when the insurance wants to make sure the patient picked up the medication and also in circumstances when the patient says they haven’t picked up the medication, we show them their signature of when they picked it up and the whole thing is resolved. This story was not completely correct.

I would just like to say that I have been a technician for 12 years now. I don’t think people realize how much we do and how much stress we are under. Add to that the patients who expect fast food service and it’s not a suprise that mistakes can be made. Plus, most of the patients don’t even know what medications they are taking.“It’s the little white one”does not help us to know what they need filled. I’m not making excuses but the demands on the pharmacist are extreme and constant. And does anybody stop to think that common mistakes are made because of the doctors? Half the time we can’t read their hand-writing and the other half a mistake is made because they select the wrong drug or dose on their computers. And furthermore, in my 12 years as a tech I have never had a patient sign to waive their rights to counseling. We have customers sign so that we can prove and verify who and when a rx was picked up. I have never been in a situation where it was to waive their rights. Live a day in the life of a tech/pharmacist and then tell me how easy it is to meet the demands. We play insurance agents, doctors and OTC experts. And that’s not including our regular duties. Did I mention that most pharmacies do not have lunch time/breaks for their staff. Pharmacists, and some techs, work 12 hour days with no break. People need to stop pointing fingers until they know what they are talking about.

For those who feel that:
They (pharmacists)“take their job more seriously and care more about a patient’s healthcare than the patient’s do themselves.”That sounds a bit over the top. I believe that pharmacists care (and some care a lot), but who cares more about their life than that actual person? Did you ever think that some patient’s just trust that that their doctors and pharmacists know best and they don’t feel the need to know all the details of the meds? I, myself, am not one of these people, as I am very knowledgable when it comes to my meds. Some people, however, (in particular, the older generations) are brought up to not question doctors or pharmacists and just believe they know best. They may feel it’s disrespectful to question their doctor (or pharmacist, for that matter). That’s how my grandmas are…it’s not that they don’t care about themselves–they just were brought up in a different generation. Even some of the younger generations just trust the doctors (and pharmacists) will take care of them. I don’t think it’s that these people don’t care about their healthcare…perhaps, they just don’t feel that need to question their care. (Not that I agree with that…I feel people should be more knowledgable about their healthcare, but to say you (a pharmacist) care more about their healthcare than they do is what bothers me.)

In response to the comments saying patients should check the doctor’s instructions against the filled prescription- I have rarely had an Rx that I could read! I think some of the errors have to be attributed to the chicken scratch doctors call handwriting. Also I dont think the teenager should be blamed–the pharmicist is the responsible party

I have worked in a major retail pharmacy chain for over 5 years. Never has a prescription gone out to a customer without being checked by the registered pharmacist on duty. To put blame on the 16 year old pharmacy technician is wrong. I also don’t believe she was a pharmacy technician at all, I know in my state you have to have a high school diploma and be at least 18 years of age. People think pharmacy is a mindless job and all we care about is making money. For one, I can barely keep my head above water with my wages, and the stress patients put me under is enormous. Nothing is ever good enough. I’m tired of the misunderstanding people have with how much it takes to fill your ONE prescription. It’s never just,“slap a label on a bottle”and give it to you. I know I personaly have to call the doctors office at least two or three times per day to verify a drug or directions on a prescription and 9 times out of 10 the problem is fixed and the patient never even knew there was a problem to begin with. If you feel better going to a mom and pop pharmacy, do it, that’s your business, but to say they care more than a retail pharmacy is bologne. The people who work at your retail pharmacy also probably lives in the same neighborhood as you do, we’re only human. If I were to speak for all of us technicians we take pride in our work and we care about our jobs. But I tell you one thing, a mom and pop pharmacy isn’t doing 500 prescriptions per day. If they were, i don’t think you’d want to go there, they wouldn’t be prepared to deal with that, and probably don’t want to for that matter. I think one thing that should be mandatory is for doctors to give out legible prescriptions preferably the computer generated ones that a lot of primary care and emergency room doctors are using these days.

I use to think of 20/20 as a reputable news source, but after this segment on pharmacy errors, I’ve lost almost all credibility for this show. The completely blow the storyline out of proportion and don’t even cover the news evenly from different angles. They kept reiterating the fact that there were 16-year old highschoolers that were filling prescriptions. How is this any different than letting a 16-year old drive a car at 60mph? At least in the pharmacy, there is a pharmacist that is ultimately responsible for the medication that is dispensed. In the case where there was a misfill of Warfarin 10mg instead of 1mg, this is not the technicians fault. 20/20 didn’t even show what the actual prescription looked like! Maybe it looked like 10mg a day! (Which is a high, but completely legitimate dose). At any rate, if a patient gets the wrong medication, the fault is going to be on the pharmacist. Let’s get something straight. Pharmacists are going to make mistakes. I don’t care how good of a pharmacist you are, everybody makes mistakes. I can’t believe 20/20 showed photos and names of some poor Walgreens pharmacist! What did they expect? Should that pharmacist be banned from practicing pharmacy ever again because he made an accidental error? Also, they showed patients getting prescriptions, and then adding a bottle of Aspirin to their purchase at the last minute. I am not surprised that some of the pharmacies didn’t catch the drug interaction because the patient did not ask about it! What happens if the patient decides to make the Aspirin purchase at the cashiers at the front of the store? Do we need to start carrying Aspirin behind the counter in the pharmacy now similar to Pseudoephedrine in certain states? 20/20 needs to do more thorough investigating to prevent more misleading news segments in the future. I am very disappointed in 20/20′s reporting methods.

Now, has anyone thought about the physician who prescribed the medication? He/she could be at fault too. They’re the one who write the prescription so maybe he/she made the mistake. Has anyone thought of that?

When I was living in the US, I never understood why you had to get a prescription“filled”in the first place. I’ve always found the system rather unsettling, there’s too much chances of mistakes along the way.
In Italy and Germany you bring your doctor’s prescription to the pharmacy, and the pharmacist just gives you a prepackaged box (from drug company) matching your prescription. The box is clearly labeled on the outside and contains instructions and warnings as well. You’d have to be blind not to notice, if you ever got the wrong box.

I guess I am very lucky that I never have any problems with the Walgreen’s stores I use.
At the same time, I also believe that patients must understand their prescription and its dosage BEFORE they take it to the pharmacy. Perhaps because I am a physician’s daughter, I always ask and repeat what my doctor tells me is my prescription and dosage.
Patients do have to take some responsibility, if for nothing else, for their own safety.

I am a licensed pharmacist and I teach at a school of pharmacy. It’s tragic that the technician made an error with the warfarin prescription, but the ultimate responsibility lies with the pharmacist, not the technician. For each prescription, the pharmacist is supposed to check the physical prescription against the computer-generated label and the against the label on the bottle from which the tablets were dispensed. In this case, it was the pharmacist’s responsibility to notice that the prescription said“1 mg”and the technician typed“10 mg”. To be honest, counting out tablets is not particularly difficult and there really isn’t any reason why people who aren’t pharmacists can’t be used to assist the pharmacist. But it’s the pharmacist’s responsibility to ensure that every prescription is dispensed correctly.
The signing away of counseling (an OBRA 90 requirement) is a common practice which I have found objectionable for years. I encourage everyone who picks up a prescription to read the small type next to the place where they have to sign and ask the pharmacist exactly what they are signing.

This explains why our Walgreens down the street is the most inefficient drug store I have ever seen.
They are the only pharmacy open 24 hrs. THerefore they are used most by most people.
If Pharmacists are required to check prescriptions filled by these techs then no wonder they are slow. Important to do, but the least effective use of manpower.
These poor HS age kids are doing all they can just to fill an order correctly and just don’t have time to do more to serve the 20 people standing in line for 10 minutes at a time not to mention the 15 cars backed up outside the store waiting in the drivethru line. (That does not help the reduced oil consumption goal).

Posted by: mari | March 31, 2007, 7:54 am 7:54 am
 
Some things you as a patient can do:
- While you’re still at the doctor’s office, examine your prescription, make sure it’s written clearly, ask about the abbreviations, and verify when and how the drug is to be taken. Keep a record of the prescription information yourself.
- Go to the pharmacy in the mornings, when the employees are less likely to be too busy or too tired. Go when your doctor’s office is open, so the pharmacy can call with any questions.
- Open your bag before you leave the pharmacy, so you can at least check that you received the right prescription.
- Arrange for your renewals well ahead of time, so you can handle any problems without time pressure.
- Purchase your ordinary store items at the main register, rather than making the pharmacy ring them up with your medicines.
- Save the drive-in facility for parents with sick children in the car, handicapped people, and routine renewals called in ahead of time. If your prescription is new or your insurance is complicated, it would be better to go into the store.
Multitasking is difficult for almost everybody. Do what you can to help the pharmacy’s work go more smoothly.

Does 20/20 Pharmacy Investigation cover mail order pharmacies?
Our Blue Cross insurance strongly encourages patients to use mail order. If a drug is refilled 3 times the prescription drug is a maintenance drug. All maintenance drugs filled at the local retail pharmacy cost raises to $75 for a 30 day supply, but through mail order the cost lowers to $5-25 depending on the type of drug. We can not afford to be paying the higher price and feel forced to use the mail order option.
There is no personal contact. All refill orders are through an automatic telephone service, website, or order by mail. All prescriptions are shipped via mail. The in personalization blinds the assurance of accuracy. How does a person find information about mail order pharmacies procedures and practices?

I have worked in retail pharmacy for 20 years. The checks and balances that every prescription goes thru before it is given to a patient is extreme. The general public needs to realize there is more to it than taking pills out of a big bottle and putting them into a small bottle. I think 20/20 should go“undercover”and show the measures Walgreens does to keep patients well and make sure they get the correct medication. This seemed like a story that usually runs during sweeps week that should have been called“Don’t shop Walgreens, they will kill you.”Talk about one sided reporting…Shame on you ABC…..

I work as a Pharmacist for CVS pharmacy and these big corporates try to grab the last penny possible by hiring untrained or not properly trained help for the pharmacist and then when something goes wrong they blame it on their own pharmacist and in the past few years they have also been hiring untrained and with no proper schooling pharmacist from foregin countries, i have had the displeasure to work with some of these pharmacist and the dont even know the basic interactions of some of the medications, all these foregin pharmacist have to do to be able to be liscenced to work in the USA is to do a 500 hour internship and pass the national pharmacy exam, this exam is a joke any decent pharmacy technician can study a book for about 3 months and pass this exam.

I am a certified Pharmacy tech and have work in pharmacy for 5 years. I have worked in two states. In both places, I would enter the prescription into the computer and fill the prescription. The pharmacist would then check the prescription against the script and check the medication against the bottle. Mistakes do happen and I have made mistakes but the pharmacist always caught it. Also, there were times when the pharmacist would fill a prescription and I would catch their mistake. We always had at least three checks to insure correctness. Everyone makes mistakes, even your doctor and nurses. My father was in the hospital after a major heart attack and his nurse was about to give him a medication and he asked her to have me check it for him and she was going to give him a double dose of blood thinner–when I pointed it out she got huffy and said it was correct but I insisted it was not and lo and behold he was supposed to get only one dose not two. If I didn’t know my drugs, he could have bled out and we never would have known it was the hospitals fault. Everyone needs to be carefull, everyone needs to be checked on.

I have been a technician for the past 10 years. I have worked both retail and independent pharmacies. In both stores I have seen the same mistakes so when saying independents don’t make as many mistakes where are you getting your information. Chains are targeted by the media because there are thousands of them and more chances of getting the information to report.
The fact they are a chain more people know who they are and the shock value effect is much higher. If ABC reported that say Peanuts pharmacy in Nebraska was hiring 16 year olds and mistakes have been made people would not have noticed because it is one store in one town. It cannot be related to someone in every state. It would not have been reported. The chain hires what is available with respect to the laws and the responsibility to the individual. When people are pulled from the floor to help they are generally used at the register only.

As a Walgreens Pharmacist for over 20 years, I can say that the culture of pharmacists do care deeply about the safety of patients. My patients continued health/safety is my primary goal and responsibility. The bottom line how to prevent/reduce errors is as follows: 1)MANDATE lunch breaks for pharmacists to increase concentration and accuracy. 2)MANDATE an increased pharmacist to tech ratio. 3)MANDATE the maximum number of prescriptions per hour that a pharmacist is required to verify and not exceed it. These changes should be enacted for increased patient safety. We need State Boards of Pharmacy to take note and change the rules/laws. If they can’t find the where-with-all to legislate these actions, then our only recourse may be to unionize the pharmacists to stand up to profit-motivated corporate america. Otherwise, errors will continue at the current rate and sadly, a very few, will truly be tragic.

I take a controlled substance prescription that I filled a few months ago. When I got home I realized that in my bottle were two different strengths of the same medicine, hydrocodone. I took it back to the pharmacy and told them of the mistake. It was looked into and refilled correctly the second time. The‘tech’that filled it was fired and the pharmicist is still there. Because it is a controlled substance, I was told that it has to be looked at twice by the tech and once by the pharmicist. That means that it was looked at three times and no one noticed that half of the pills were larger than the others. I don’t think so. I think that the pharmicist should have met the same fate as the tech considering the nature of the medicine. I asked them what would have happened if it had been a senior citizen or someone with impaired vision that might not have seen the difference. What if it were someone’s heart medicine? I also told the store manager this and the regional manager of this pharmacy to make sure that this would not happen again. I can tell you that I check all my scripts the minute I get home, for accuracy and quantity. I did receive many“looks”from the tech’s fellow employees in the weeks after the incident, like I was the one who had done something wrong and gotten her fired.

The report by 20/20 was absolutely biased against the chains, and especially Walgreens. It made no mention to the fact that the chains spend hundred of millions of dollars in systems to PREVENT as many errors as possible. These are systems that your small, locally owned pharmacies do not have.
These“mom and pop”pharmacies often give their technicianss MORE responsibility than the chains do yet the report made it sound like only the chains utilized technician.
In my experience I’ve found that the chains are more compliant with pharmacy laws than locally owned pharmacies.
Again, this report was a horrible example of journalism. But that’s what I’ve come to expect from 20/20 and shows like it. They’re just out for shock value with no regard for the truth.

I personally worked in Pharmacy for about 1 year and 4 months. Prior to employment I had received a certificate for Pharmacy Technician training and while employed in Pharmcy took and passed the National Certified Pharmacy Technician Exam.
From personal experience, I feel the underlying problem at the stores are favoritism within the ranks. I am 43 years old, have worked since I was 17 and feel I have a better work ethic than my younger counterparts. I have experience in customer service and in getting the job done CORRECTLY as opposed to avoiding situations. Younger employees have the habit of taking things too personal and throwing their hands up if there is a difficult situation to handle.
Also when the pharmacist is concentrating on how many prescriptions are being generated as opposed to making sure that each and every prescription is accurate makes for too many mistakes.
I had the opportunity to become a senior Tech at one of the stores that I worked at. The managing pharmacist didn’t want to give me the position because she said that I needed“more training”. The real reason was that she wanted to give the position to another tech that was her friend, was 24 years old, worked in pharmacy for 3 years and did not pass the same exam that I took. It got to the point that I could not take working there anymore because it seemed like it was“play time”for everyone else everythime I went to work.
I take Pharmacy work very seriously. We are the final step in a patients therapy. When this is compromised, the patient suffers.

I have been a Pharmacist for over 10 years for CVS and cvs has a lot of measures in place to minimize these errors, but we are under constant preasure from these insurace companies and state medicaid on reimbursement cuts and this impacts the quality of help we can afford, but as pharmacists we make sure that we check each and every prescription throughly before its dispensed to the patient. Still this is not to say that errors do not occur and we are constantly working on solutions to prevent these errors.

My 8 year old son was given an antipsychotic drug only approved for adults instead of his allergy meds for a runny nose. Not only did his allergies and asthma get worse, he suffered an accident and was in a leg brace due to the dizziness the meds caused, suffered mood swings, couldn’t stay awake, and suffered academically in school. We received an“apology”letter and a gift card to Rite Aid and the card was full of spelling errors.

It is unfair to attack both Walgreens and the girl who incorrectly filled the prescription. I do not live near a Walgreens so I get my prescriptions filled at CVS. I have been given the wrong prescription a couple of times from their pharmacy. Luckily, it was not serious either in either instance. I am not trying to cast blame on someone else, I am just saying that mistakes do happen, some more serious than others, and they happen everywhere. I feel for the families of anyone who has received the wrong medication and has suffered serious implications from it, but considering how many prescriptions are filled everyday, mistakes are bound to happen. People need to take charge of their safety and ask whether or not the pharmicist has double checked the prescription if a pharmacy tech fills it. Tell them why you’re getting the medication so they make sure they have the correct one. It is not right to put all the blame on Walgreens when the problem of overworked pharmicists and pharmacy techs and many demanding, impatient, and sometimes hateful customers is everywhere.

I worked the first 11 years out of pharmacy school in RETAIL HELL! The BIGGEST UNREPORTED PROBLEM in this story is PHARMACIST SHORTAGE!!! I graduated in 1994 with a B.S. the Pharm D. program started at my school in 1996, so instead of taking you 5 years to become a pharmacist it is now 6…and NO if I went back to school (which would take me 2 years because of still having to work 12 hour shifts and raise a family, not to mention the cost) I would get paid no more money by the retail chain I work for. B.S. vs. Pharm. D. it doesn’t matter, same pay.
By the year 2020 it is estimated that there will be over 150,000 holes, vacancies, and there is no increase in the amount of pharmacy students graduating. I graduated in 1994 with a class size 82 students and the graduating class in 2006 was 76.
In no part of my schooling did I get taught to be an INSURANCE AGENT!!! And out of a 12 hour shift filling 350+ rx’s I (or my technicians) spend at least 3 hours ON HOLD with insurance companies trying to get PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS APPROVED, Dr.’s to change rx’s because the med. isn’t covered, etc and after doing all of this the patient decides they don’t want it because the copay is too high!!

ABC News-
The story that you have uncovered to the viewers of 20/20 is very one-sided and undermines those pharmacy technicians, like myself, who take deep pride and care in the work that they perform. As a Nationally Certified Pharmacy Technician at a retail drug store, I am disturbed that ABC would suggest that the people filling prescriptions at any given pharmacy are just high school students who care more about what dress they’ll wear to prom than the medication that will be consumed by their customers. In most pharmacies, a high school diploma or GED is required to work. Requiring any further education would be very unrealistic. The first problem is that by raising the requirements, there are less people available to fill the much needed positions in the pharmacies. The second problem is that the average salary of a pharmacy technician is between minimum wage and $10 which is not an acceptable salary for a college graduate.
Placing the blame of the incorrectly-filled prescription upon the technician is completely unacceptable. Ask any pharmacist who is ultimately responsible for the correct filling and dispensing of medication, and they will tell you that the pharmacist on duty approves all prescriptions before they are dispensed. Whether or not the technician typed the prescription improperly is not important. What is important is that they pharmacist did not catch the error and therefore was not correctly performing his or her job. This is not to say that all pharmacists are as unreliable and irresponsible as the pharmacist working at this particular Walgreens.
Most customers do not realize that the pharmacist behind the counter of their local pharmacy has been through just as much schooling and testing as the physician that they trust with their life. Just as doctors, surgeons, nurses, and any other medical professionals are not all perfect, neither are pharmacists. There will never be a pharmacy in which there are zero dispensing errors. It’s unrealistic to think that there ever will be. Although we all wish that there were a way to prevent every single filling or dispensing error, there is always human error that will factor into the situation.

What is most upseting about people blaming the techs and pharmacies for errors is that people don’t read their prescription information prior to taking it. I went to a doctor who, although I made it expressly clear that I had an allergy to sulfa, continued to prescribe a medication containing it to me. I hadn’t even left the pharmacy when, reading the information given to me, did I realize that there was an error.
Doctors, Pharmacists, and technicians are all overworked, overburdened, and under-appreciated. To assume that they make no mistakes is ridiculous; you are the last line of defense before taking anything into your body and if you don’t havet the wherewithal to be informed about what’s going into your body, then you shouldn’t turn the blame on someone else. I have two sisters who are pharmacy techs and my husband is currently in school, working towards his PharmD., and I see the amount of schooling that is necessary for them to obtain their licenses, as well as the continuing education hours that are required each year in order to keep current. One girl makes a mistake, and it’s sensational so everyone gets all up in arms about it; she’s human, just like you are. Don’t assume that people in the medical community are infallible, because you are the one who will pay the price.

It’s appaling to read how casual business leaders have become in ever increasing attempts to take as much of the nation’s waelth for themselves. Their green knows no bounds. They will take any risk, jeapardized any life so long as they believe that the potential for profit is greater than the resulting payyouts from lawsuits. Unfortunetly, it’s not their pain when a loved one dies becuase there was a profit to be made. We need laws that treat these kind of events as the criminal acts that they truly are. We as a society killers in murder for hire cases, yet we let business leaders excape the penalty in what are in effect very similar situations–someone is killed for financial gain.

I am very sorry for the people who appeared in the report however I am discusted with the reporter, the producers and mostly the pharmacy school who put together such a report to destroy the image of trust that we as pharmacist have with our patients. I am all for such a report but you know why not mention the amount of effort we do on daily basis spending countless of hours on the phone with insurance companies anf physicianc trying to correct mistake and making sure the medication is ready when the patient comes back.
as for the high school issue, the last time I checked this was america, a place where you can not discriminate against someone based on age. so if you the reporter and the two professor you got to do the study with you have a problem, the right channel is the legislator to change the language of the law that say working toward a high school and ged not already graduated.
I was also discusted by the lawyer’s comment that the tachnician’s last job was cleaning popcorn in a movie theater, you know waht is the problem with that, are ashamed of people with low paying job getting traned and improving their lives. two years ago I was cleaning dishes, today I have two doctorate degrees, so maybe that lawyer would not like some one like me filling her prescription, not all of us are born with a silver spoon.

Thank you for the wonderful program. My question is what took you(or anyone) so long to expose walgreens for what they really are? When you let businessmen run the pharmacies, you put patients’safety at risk. Their shareholders’interest vs public safety. Their computer system is designed for speed, not accuracy. Staff members are under pressure to fill more Rx as quickly as possible at all time. How their top management run things makes good business sense, but poor pharmacy sense. If I was given a choice, I would not even fill my Rx at walgreens.

I am the wife of a Pharmacy Student at one of the top Pharmacy Schools in the nation. First of all, I want to address the shortage of Pharmacists. Do you ever stop to think that one of the reasons that there are shortages is because Pharmacists are now doctors when they graduate and the application process alone for pharmacy school is a very long and stressful ordeal. These applicants must have the best GPA’s and PCAT scores to even be considered. My husband graduated with a Bachelors degree in Biology with a minor in Chemistry before applying to Pharm School. So let’s face it, it’s a hard program, you have to be incredibly intelligent. Did it ever enter your mind that the shortage may be due to the lack of ability? Your average Joe wouldn’t even be considered for Pharm. School, let alone be able to graduate. I see my husband study for hours every night, and that’s just during his regular weeks of school. Don’t even get me started on what it’s like for him during Block weeks, when he has to endure 7 three hour tests over the weekend. This type of studying and learning will go on for the next two years, then his last year will be nothing but rotations. He will go through 10, one month rotations before he can graduate, just thought those of you who assumed Pharmacists just graduate and jump right in would like to know that they do have their time of internship!
Second, my husband currently works for an independent pharmacists so I know first hand what they go through. I can’t tell you how many 10 and 11 hour days I have seen my husband work and come home completely exhausted, and didn’t even get a lunch break. Pharmacists are so under appreciated. Their main concern is the care of the patient, and yes they are patients, not customers. A pharmacy is a clinic, not a store. So let’s try getting the terminology right. I can’t tell you how many times I have been out with my husband and his boss and they are both stopped, on their free time I might add, and asked questions by people who aren’t even their patients and they are always more than willing to help.

When I saw this episode on TV it was like Walgreen’s was made to be the worst pharmacy in the USA. Do you not realize that there are other pharmacies? Plus your investigation is so outdated. I saw Eckard Drugs and they when out of business about two to three years ago when CVS bought them. You have no dates for your story, just making it sound like it happened just yesterday. 20/20 probably did not even look to see if Walgreen’s have changed any of there policies. Pharmacy tech’s have to have a high diploma and either be finishing their tech schooling or have their tech license (and it must be posted in the pharmacy for customers to see). Even the managers have to have their tech license and posted.
Also, there is no such thing as 100% perfection. I bet 20/20 has not reported everything 100% exact. If we were all 100% perfect there would not be the word‘mistake’in our vocabulary.
Pharmacists do a lot of work. They have to make sure that the drugs that are getting filled do not interact with something that they are already prescribed. Such as when a patient goes to the ER or sees another doctor and that doctor might not know the“whole”history of the patient and writes a script not knowing if there will be a drug interaction with other previous prescriptions.
I know for a fact that Walgreens puts plenty of labels on the pill bottle for the customer. One is a picture and description of what the pill should look like on both sides. Also, a label of what not to take when taking this medicine.
Customers should know what is being prescribed to them from their doctor, so when there is a mistake at the pharmacy, they know not to take it.

The bottom line is that you have to be an EXTREMELY educated medical consumer…I go to my doctor with a list of written questions and, after every test, etc. I pick up a copy of the lab report, etc. and keep a file at home. I look all meds up on the internet for contraindications and examine each script, count my pills, etc. before I take anything. Because of greed, there is no business that does not cut costs and aim for sloppy, high-volume, to show their stockholders a profit….you have to be on it every minute…

In response to a gentleman who said the patient is responsible for knowing what the dr. prescribed…That is great if you check your prescription and the label says exactly what it should, the problem is when the medicine doesn’t match what the label says and you have never seen the medicine before. How then do you know you are getting the wrong med OR the wrong dosage??? Please respond to that!!

As a technician (and a damn good one at that) this“attack”on my profession is an insult. It is impossible to be perfect when you must cater to the customer, explain the insurance and it’s coverage, ring the register, answer the phone, and fill prescriptions, all under the scrutiny of impatient patients. You spindoctors hurt the reputation of pharmacists when it is the actions of these corporations who inhibit their ability to focus on the actual science of pharmacology in which they have been extensively educated and trained.

YOU HAVE LOST MY RESPECT ON REPORTING A FAIR AND BALANCED REPORT. ABC SHOULD BE RIDICULED FOR PRESENTING SUCH A ONE SIDED STORY. I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY DID THAT.

Consumers are just as responsible for their own medication as the pharmacists and technicians.
Even when the bottle of meds is labeled correctly, the label tells the consumer exactly what color&amp;shape the pill inside should be. For example, if your bottle says the pill is yellow and round in shape but what you received is pink and oblonged, do you not question why the difference and continue to take the medication, knowing that the pill is different than the bottle says it should look like or should you be ASKING the pharmacy FIRST before you take it? OF COURSE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS ASK ! BUT SOME CONSUMERS DON’T EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE BOTTLE AND THE INFORMATION THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT, THEN WHEN THERE IS A MISTAKE, IT’S NEVER THEIR FAULT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT READ THE INFORMATION OR ASK QUESTIONS WHEN THE EMPLOYEE SAYS“DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PHARMACIST”, WHICH IS ALWAYS STANDARD PRACTICE IN A WALGREENS. THEY DON’T WANT TO ACCEPT SOME OF THE BLAME AND THEY NEED TO., THEY ARE AS MUCH TO BLAME AS THE PHARMACIST&amp;TECHNICIANS. BUT IT IS ALWAYS EASIER TO BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR ONE’S OWN IGNORANCE.

I was so glad to see something like this finally come out. Five years ago after getting my wisdom teeth removed I got a dry socket and was prescribed antibiotics, but after a few days nothing was changing and I was lucky enough to know a pharmacist and when I told her the prescription that I was taking she informed me that one was a blood thinner and the other was for a heart condition. I immediately went to Walgreen’s and learned that they had given me someone else’s medication, but did nothing about it except give me my correct medicine. My dad was furious and called and complained, but nothing came from it.
I am lucky enough that nothing happened to me, but I am very cautious every time I get a prescription from any Walgreen’s location now.
Thank you again for making the public aware of this. Hopefully people will become more aware and careful.

Hi
My comment on this is that the pharmacist can’t be all over the place taking care of all the situations.I do understand that the techs need to be well tained before hiring them.They showed about te interaction bet a OTC and a blood thinner.I thins it is th comsumers responsibility to ask the pharmacist if there would be an interaction.The person ringing at the register is a cashier if you see the name tag!! so the pharmacist need to be directed any questions.Is is also the resp of patients to ask any questions.Why do you think they have a consultation window?? That is to make use of.The harmacist can’t be ringing the rx’s there are better ans importsnt jobs to be done behind………Just wanted to clear out things

As a pharmacy student one year from entering my lifelong practice as a pharmacist, this concerning matter is very important to me as well as all those working in the healthcare industry. The fact is that no one wants these tragic accidents to happen, but unfortuneately we are humans and mistakes will occur. The high school student was doing her job. I’m positive that she is accurate most of the time. She, however, made a mistake. 99.9% of the time that mistake will be caught by the pharmacist. In this particular case it was sold to the patient. It’s terrible that this happens, but the fact is that sometimes it just does.
At this point, we want our patients to be in charge. This is were the responsiblity leaves the pharamacy. At this point it is the patients resposibity to ask, and take an active role in the management of thier healthcare. We in the pharmacy do our part to make sure you get you the right prescription. After we give you the prescription, it becomes your responsility to make sure we gave you the right prescription. Ignorance is the biggest threat to healthcare. Quit relying on others to take care of you. Be proactive at the physicians office and ask why you are getting that particular medication. Be informed when you pick up your prescription at the pharmacy. You have the right to counseling…USE IT!
We are all humans and mistakes will happen no matter how many checks we put in place. Quit looking to put all the blame somewhere else, and start taking responsiblity for yourselves. I want the best for all my patients, but i tell each and every one of them that their healthcare is most importantly their responsiblity at the end of the day. My patients live with the disease not me, so be informed, be knowledgeable, and be ready to actively learn more about your healthcare needs so that i can better help you, and be sure you are getting correct treatment!

I have been a technician since I turned 18. I have been at the same store for six years now. I have been a pharmacy technician for 4 of those 6 years. In the fall I will be entering my senior year in Microbiology and plan on attending one of this area’s pharmacy schools. I know a great deal about the interactions of some of the big usage medications, but that doesn’t supplement the fact that information is to leave my mouth when a customer asks me a question. Unfortunately, the pharmacy is the one that gets‘shot down’for the mistake because it does control a very important tool. No one looks at the customer though. I have gotten to the point where I tell the customer it could be up too two hours, for a walk-in. I don’t want to make a mistake…I don’t want my pharmacist to make a mistake. And I will continue that practice through out my pharmacy career. Plain and simple:“People need to slow down, ask questions, and smile!!”

I would just like to say YES pharmacies can make mistakes, but just remember that they are human and human error is inevitable. However, I would just like remind everyone that a tech’s job is basically to make the pharmacist’s job easier so that they can pay more attention to what is important which is the patient. I do work at a small pharmacy with only a high school diploma&amp;I enjoy my work. I am grateful that I do not work for a large chain, because of the different problems that they see more of than we do.
What bothers me the most is what responsibility does the patient have?? I hear it at least 5 times a day…We have atenolol ready for you. Is this what you are looking for? The patient then responds by saying…I don’t know the little round white pill.(for those who don’t know atenolol is a round white pill) People need to remember that because mistakes can happen that it is sooo important that they ask questions, pay attention it is your health after all!!
As for large chain pharmacies I do agree that there is to much focus on the bottom dollar. I have no desire to ever work for Walgreen’s or CVS just because of stories I hear from my coworkers who have worked for either one. We have many patients that often come back to us after using mail order or any other big pharmacy because of the personal attention and special intrest that we take in their care.

As an example of how ABC-20/20 is doing everything it can to twist this story and make it look as bad as possible towards the drugstore chains, look at the way they quote Walgreens response in the article above.
They simply quote:“We deeply regret the few errors that have occurred among the more than 500 million prescriptions we fill each year at our 5,600 pharmacies.”This is the part that can be construed to reinforce what 20/20 WANTS you to believe about the chains…that they fill so many precriptions so they are likely to make errors.
If you go to the OTHER story which quotes the FULL statement from Walgreens (you know…the one with the tiny little link as opposed to the great big picture on the main page with the negative story about the chains) you see that they left out what Walgreens has done to try and PREVENT these errors. They’ve spent a BILLION dollars over ten years to implement computer systems and workflows designed to be as accurate as humanly possible and get their error rate as close to zero as it can be.
Why do they leave that part of the quote out? Ask yourself that question.

I dont think the public understands what goes on behind our pharmacy counters. They keep mentioning that a 16 year old was filling prescriptions. NO a 16 year old isnt filling your prescriptions, your pharmacist is! the only thing the technician does is type your prescriptions and pour the pills into the bottles. the pharmacist is the one who checks to make sure the rx is typed correctly and at the end point @ walgreens you scan the vial and a picture of the actual pill pops on the screen which is our last check before it is bagged. if the rx is for lipitor 10mg and the tech accidently picks up lipitor 20mg the error will be caught 10 times out of 10 b/c our scale’s scanning system will catch it.
They should have walked the public through point a to point z when dropping off an rx with walgreens just to show how error-proof our technology is. the technician IS’NT the one checking your drug drug interactions, your PEnicillin allergies, your duplicate drugs, your change of therapy. WE PHARMacists are the ones working our butts off behind those counters and our techs are hard working, and unappreciated.
Dealing with the public is not easy guys, especially with the older patients and LOrd help us trying to explain medicare part D and how they have to pay $3000 out of pocket b4 insurance jumps in. Im not putting down any other professions but what other profession do you have to deal with issues thrown at you all at once???

i wish there was a report on PBM’s and insurance companies. They are making ridiculous profits, especially since Bush allowed Medicare part D to be privately managed. Community/retail pharmacies have been the target of a lot of scrutiny lately—mainly unjustly for costs, and now for everything they do wrong…Is it cool right now to attack retail pharmacy? Investigate some other part of the healthcare system.
 
Posted by: badwriting | March 31, 2007, 1:42 pm 1:42 pm
 
Is there a reason that Walgreens was the focus/target? Did they do something to anger the people of ABC? There are other large and small chains that have similar work environments.
Just because they are in business to make a profit does not mean they do not care about patients.
It seems that pharmacy is to other professions, particularly health care professions.
When you go to the doctor, dentist, etc, there’s always assistants who are less educated (but hopefully well-trained) that help with the workload.
Even though this was really one-sided and unfair, hopefully it makes patients focus take charge of their own healthcare (calling the doctor yourself, etc). It should also make pharmacists slow down just a bit&amp;focus a little bit more.
The reporting did not look at the good that pharmacists do, but I’m trying to look for the good that this bad journalism can do???

I think this story is biased and does not depict the entire picture.
First off, the story about the woman with breast-cancer is sad and disheartening but one must question whether her death was in fact due to her underlying illness (breast-cancer) or due to the medication error itself. The story briefly mentioned how the woman was on chemotherapy (which indicates that her illness was severe). Not only does this indicate that the illness was severe, but that she was obviously on many medications. Was her death and partial paralyses due to one medication error or a cummulation of other factors?
To me, this story serves as a means to bash pharmacists and chain drug stores as a whole and exaggerates tremendously the stories themselves.

I have never been to a pharmacy where any of the customers were yelling, screaming or getting huffy over waiting. I give 24 hours to fill scripts. I drop them off and pick up the next day. The only exception being if we are at the Children’s Hospital urgent care or ER. Then we use the hospital pharmacy and are usually the onlt walk up patients there at that hour and we patiently wait.
I worked in patient care and I know how people can be at times. Just smile sweetly and say,”I’m so sorry dear. I’ll take care of you as soon as I can. Your health is important to me and I wouldn’t want to make a serious error.”

I graduated from pharmacy school in 1990, after first getting my BS degree in Chemistry. I“teched”from the age of 16 for both retail and hospital pharmacies.
The year I received my BS in Pharmacy…..over 50% of the pharmacists in my state (MD) left the profession—atleast downgraded to less than part-time status. Starting salary that year was atleast $5 an hour above any of my more experienced colleagues. The reason for this? The demand for a licensed pharmacist skyrocketed as many left full-time status (or left the profession all together) due to the ever-increasing stresses, demands and workload placed on the shoulders of basically one person…the pharmacist.
Tickled with my new job (and my new turbo sports car, clothes, jewellrey and cruise vacations!) I ignored this trend. Then reality set in. I was one person behind a counter filling 300 prescriptions with, maybe, a few hours of tech help after school….IF my volume of prescriptions“warranted”and IF the tech wasn’t pulled to cashier up at the front of the store. So, here I am answering all phone calls on the three phones on the wall by the second ring (you know, just in case it’s the District Manager calling to check up and make sure we’re courteous and fast with the service!)
Plus, I’ve got to call several doctors for refills, being put on hold or not having calls returned fast enough. I’m on the OTHER line trying to work miracles to get through to a customer service rep because ANOTHER patient’s insurance coverage has either been changed or terminated and the patient walked in with a prescription but not with the new insurance info, etc.

It’s not just Walgreen’s. As an RN, I was shocked to hear from my patients that, when they are given the wrong drug or dose at the pharmacy, they just get an“oh well”reaction…As the article said“they know errors are bound to occur”. Working as an RN in a hospital, if you make a medication error, you report it as an incident report, it goes to a committee for review, if it recurs, you are monitored and may get a warning, lose your job and/or your license–depending on the nature or number of occurrences. I wonder what kind of accountability, if any, occurs like this in the pharmacy business–or do they just hold their breath until there is a lawsuit…BTW, nurses have missed lunches and avoided bathroom breaks due to being so busy LONG before the insurance crises and for a LOT less money than pharmacists. We all choose our professions and we can choose a different one…

I am currently a Pharm D. candidate attending my last year of school. I have worked in the community pharmacy setting (chain store) for 3 years now in Philadelphia. Over my 3 years I have worked with exceptional pharmacists, who are diligent in checking the prescription and the medication over numerous times before letting it get into the hands of the patient. I agree that mistakes are terrible, and sometimes have devastating consequences. Though, it is impossible to cut them all out, we are working very hard to minimize as much as possible, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HEALTH PROFESSION IS(MD, nurse, etc.) I also agree there should be better selection of GOOD technicians and better technician training.
However, before you start pointing the finger at a 16 year old girl, technicians, huge corporations or pharmacists, take a look at yourselves. How many of you have NEVER made a mistake? Better yet, have you all worked 12-14 hour days with no lunch/break? How about getting screamed at for something that is not in your control, like insurance copays, all day long while trying to concentrate? I do not know any other job or profession that doesnt allow a break, that has such a shortage of help, yet asks for more scripts filled every day, where patients love to come screaming at you because THEIR insurance copay is too high.

ABC,
I work as a certified pharmacy technician for a retail pharmacy in New York State. While, your intentions for last night’s expose were high, the quality of your accuracy was not.
First off, I want to clarify that when people pick up their prescriptions and sign, yes they are signing as to whether or not they have received counsel by the pharmacist (usually they are asked if this is a new medication for the patient, if the patient says“yes”the pharmacist will counsel. If the patient says“no”, then they are asked if they have any questions, if not they have refused counsel). HOWEVER, they are also signing to verify that the prescription has been picked up. If an insurance company, patient, doctor questions whether or not a prescription has left the pharmacy, that signature shows proof of that. Your documentary made it seem as though this was a complete lie, and it is NOT.
Secondly, I really bothers me that you make a pharmacy technician sound as though we are random people off the street who needed a job. In most states, to be a pharmacy technician you must be at least 18 years of age with a High School Diploma or GED. Also, you must pass a complete background check. Many technicians, like myself, have gone one to take training courses and gain national certification as a technician.

I’m a certified pharmacy technician and I feel that the requirements for working as a tech are insufficient if existent at all. Granted that I hold a degree from a major university, it is unfair for me to demand the same expectations of other techs that I do of myself. However, I feel belittled when hearing that the only requirement to be a tech is to be actively working toward a high school degree, which isn’t much this day and age, and the only training is the watching of a video.
When going to other pharmacies as a patient, I am unfortunately not surprised when a tech cannot even pronounce the name of a medication correctly, let alone know basic drug facts which would alert the individual to a potential problem. Considering the enormous responsibility pharmacy professionals have, we must correct the current inadequacies, and the first step in doing this is to require all pharmacy technicians to get the national certification.

I have worked in the pharmacy industry for 20 years, first as a pharmacy clerk, technician, and now as registered pharmacist. I have seen vast changes in the industry. Pharmacist were once highly respected healthcare professionals, now we are treated like fast food workers and insurance adjusters.
I feel that some of the larger chain pharmacies put their registered pharmacists at great risk. We work often 10 to 12 hour shifts without breaks, lunches, or even access to a restroom. We have limited staff, usually only one pharmacist on duty per 5-10 technicians or clerks, depending on the volumne of the store. While I believe most of the support staff is highly trained, it still posses a risk for the patient. When a retail pharmacy is filling a high volumn of prescriptions (sometimes 800-1000 prescriptions per day) and there is only 2 registered pharmacist on duty to double check all rxs, answer phones, discuss pt therapies with md, discuss otc therapies with walk in customers, etc., the quality assurance is compromised.

ever notice how people are so quick to point a finger? maybe its time to stop blaming and take action. you dont go out and buy a car without checking it out very closely.why would anyone take a new drug without putting in at least the same amount of questions? all the pharmacist i know thrive on answering questions. its the best part of their job. i bet most peoples doctors dont know the patients name before going into the room.. how many of you have been greeted by the pharmacy staff by your name? pharmacys do care about people….. its our number one goal. and some people are saying smaller pharmacies are better? lol.. i know of one that was dispenseing generic at brand name and prices…just to show.. ya never know so do your homework.

This story is extremely one-sided and it’s obvious the story was done to get a rise out of the public. I am a third year pharmacy student at a highly ranked college of pharmacy and I can assure that your pharmacists are well-trained if they have earned a PharmD or RPh degree from the United States. I cannot speak for pharmacists from other countries. While in pharmacy school, each state has a mandate of how many intern hours we must have before getting licensed as a pharmacist upon passing the pharmacy board exam and the state law exam. For my state, it is 1500 hours. It is tragic that medical errors occur, but it is also very easy for the media to choose an extremely heart breaking story to publicize and leave out the fact that millions of prescriptions are filled correctly everyday.

i strongly feel that ALL states should mandate that a person hired as a tech needs hands on training thru a college program and passing of the PTCB Before being hired. one can study all they want for the PTCB and not begin to understand what all in involved in actually doing pharmacy tech work. yes, pharmacist are responsible for the techs work, but if techs were better trained before hiring, errors would decline. take a look at http://www.ptcb.org.. . point to PTCB news then click on national statistics…it shows states that DO NOT recognize the PTCB testing. Do you live in one of those states? i also have the urge to comment totally agree with the people who have mentioned the drs hand writing. most should have to take a hand writting class…it takes no longer to scribble than it would to ledgiblly write it as well as it may save a life.with so many drugs out there with look-a-like spelling.. it gets difficult. like predisone or presnisilone. readable handwritting would help everyone.

This is not just a Walgreens problem!! This is a problem at ALL larger chain pharmacies. Ive worked at many large chain retail pharmacies (Walmart, Fred Meyer, Costco, Safeway)and they all over work their pharmacist and technicians. I currently work as a relief pharmacist for a large chain (The busiest Costco in the entire chain) and a small compounding pharmacy. The difference in the work enviroment is astounding!! I feel when I work at Costco the mentallity is work“faster, faster, faster”and when I work at the compounding pharmacy I can work smarter, smarter, smarter. I can actually use the skills I learned in pharmacy school

As a 11-yr pharm tech and soon-to-be pharmacist, this story just shows the lop-sidedness of journalism that I have always despised. I believe in fair representation, minus the opinion of the network. Don’t trust everything you see or hear–learn to be a SMART/INFORMED consumer. YOU must help that relationship btw you and the pharmacist. If you can not build a relationship with your pharmacist, go find one that you can (there are MANY good pharmacists both in retail and independent pharmacies as there are in other areas of healthcare).
I am not defending medication errors (not just‘pharmacy errors’. medication errors range from the moment the patient has a problem, to visiting the doctor to when the patient receives the medication and takes/not take it. Not taking your medication and having adverse effects from your illness IS a medication error). All errors are mistakes, not intentional and those involve all all affected negatively…but that is human error. You identify the error, and you correct it. If it is truly a particular personnel, you retrain; if that fails, you fire. Most mistakes in healthcare (and any system) are SYSTEM FAILURES/ERRORS that must be analyzed and novel ways to approach the issue are introduced. This takes time, which is not something this country likes, everyone is impatient. Slow down, life is short.

What the story does not tell is the steps that all chain drug stores have taken over past several years to help prevent medication errors. The two stories that were told in happened 5 and 8 years ago. Within that time chain drug stores have implemented many new procedures and technologies to help prevent all errors. Some examples of these are bar code scanning for product selection, imaging of prescriptions, and automated drug delivery systems.
Furthermore, within the last 5 years many state Boards of Pharmacy have implemented licensing of pharmacy technicians to ensure proper credentials. In most states, pharmacy technicians must pass a national examination and have extensive training before they are allowed to work in the pharmacy.
To say that only pharmacists should be back in the pharmacy filling prescriptions is ridiculous. There are only 92 schools of pharmacy in the United States. Each school graduates about 100 to 150 new pharmacists per year. With the aging population needing more and more prescription drugs every year pharmacists rely on pharmacy technicians to perform the ancillary and technical duties while the pharmacist can concentrate on drug interaction review and patient counseling. One error is too many to any pharmacist

I have just spent a lot of time reading through these comments and the comments posted on the site. I work as a pharmacy tech. and I am a full time college student. I have had to add on the training required by the pharmacy to fullfill job requirements along with my regular studies. BUT, I did it because I care about our patients. Why else would any soul in their right mind work in this highly stressful job, for the small paycheck we receive every 2 weeks?
We, and I speak for the technicians who put in their time every day, do this because we care. We make less per hour than the high school dropout that works down the street at the fast food restaurant as a manager. Because we care. So, having this type of exremely biased coverage on the industry is sure to raise a few blood pressures throughout the nation.
I work at one of the largest chain stores, and our pharmacy is open 24 hours a day. We can not even enter a prescription into the system unless a pharmacist is signed on the computer.

Having been a pharmacist for 8 years now, this whole story disappoints me for reasons too vast to explain. Thank you to one of the MD respondants above that states that errors are unacceptable, but inevitable. I guess that I must ask a few important questions to other health care providers and patients:
1) Providers–Can you read what you actually wrote on the patient’s prescription?
2) Providers–When a RPh calls you for clarification, how do you intercept their phone call for clarification or intervention?
3) Patients–How many times have you actually asked to speak with the pharmacist? How many times have you“declined counseling”when it could have benefited you?
4) Patients–Do you value your own healthcare so little that you are willing to use a“drive-through”to receive your new or existing prescriptions? ( and if you do, how is the RPh supposed to counsel you?)
Healthcare needs to be a team effort by all individual healthcare providers and recipients (patients!).
I really believe to solve our medication problems, we need to work together and not continue to point fingers.

ABC and the General public are blowing this out of proportion. I am a certified Technician, I attended two years of schooling to become a certified technician and that Exam is no joke. Yes we do take on a big responsiblity in the pharmacy but all the technicians at my store are either Interns or Pharmacy students, so we all have had significant training. My store does not play around when it comes to training, we get a lot more than a video and a book. As for error, guess what we are all human and its going to happen sometimes. I feel that we have a shortage on Pharmacist and Techs because of the low pay and how expensive schooling is.
My company has a fool proof system, you scan the drug bottle and the script, then when it gets to the Pharmacist they pull up the picture of the pill and the copy of the script to match up to what you filled. I had more customers come in today complaining over this show asking us if it was true. How do you explain to a customer that the media is blowing stuff out of proportion? The errors aren’t on the tech because the Prescription does not leave the Pharmacy with out seeing a Pharmacist first!!

With all due respect and consideration, empathy, and sadness…I have been at a major chain for over 20 years. I am so proud of the people around me, the pharmacists who have caught errors that doctors have made, the caring, the extra attention.It is so easy to lose focus with a few bullet wounds of human error,but yet forget all the wonderful things that are done.Why are you condeming the good people along with the few
bad eggs that can happen in any major orginazation???You talk about bottom line ABC…looks like you are getting it at the expense of others. I happen to know that everything that can be done will be done to prevent these
things from happening, I am very disappointed in this coverage.you will see walgreens/cvs and others
are not just the profit behemoths

For everyone’s information, though very tragic, this error could have been prevented by the patient simply taking to the time to verify she was given the right medication. The pills are different colors. On top of this, Coumadin is actually used to prevent stroke from clots. As a result, a coumadin overdose would produce a bleed, not a stroke. This is just one example of the gross negligence and lack of thought that went into this report. Was the patient accurately counseled on this medication by her physician with regard to the correct strength? Was the prescription even legible?Did the patient even look at her prescription after receiving it to see that she got right medication, at the right dose, with the right directions? This report, along with the general public, forget that pharmacists are human and only one part of the medication process, a process that includes resposibility on the part of the patient. Im am truly empathetic to woman who received the wrong dose of medication as well as her family, but this report only blindly bashes a profession that has prevented far more medication errors than it has created.

The pharmacist who made the mistake is not a criminal. He shouldn’t have his picture plastered all over like a most wanted poster. Pharmacists are hard working people, who work under very stressful work conditions.
Throughout the workday we are pulled at all different directions (no matter how adequately staffed we are), verifying scripts, answering 10 questions and 10 phone calls a minute, trying to keep caught up so that prescriptions are ready when promised to customers (so that they won’t“tear us a new one”or call us incompetent for not having it ready in a timely manner, as though that’s more important than taking time to make sure that errors aren’t made), getting cursed out by customers anyway because they think we altered their copays, squeezing time to contact prescribers to refill scripts and to get new scripts that are“acceptable”enough to be covered by certain third party plans….etc…the list goes on. But you don’t hear us complain about it, because that is our job, and not everyone is able to handle working in this type of work environment.
We work hard, in spite of all the directions we get pulled into, to make sure that prescriptions are correctly filled. So when we actually do make mistakes, we don’t take it as“oh well, another day, another dollar, just goes with the territory…next.”It’s devastating, not because it’s a“blow to our ego,”but because of the fact that someone’s life could have been, or has been lost at our hands. And that is a very horrible thing to have to worry about at the end of each work day.

I am a 23 year old Doctor of Pharmacy student currently employed by Walgreen’s Pharmacy as a Pharmacy Intern. I was appalled at the one-sided story aired last night on ABC’s 20/20. I am familiar with all three national chain pharmacies highlighted on the show and can say that out of the 3 Walgreen’s has -by far- the most technologically advanced system that makes error very difficult. However, humans (in any profession) DO make mistakes. In both of the extreme cases mentioned, it is very sad and unfortunate that the pharmacist failed to catch the error and that the “inexperienced 16year old technician” was portrayed as a common site in Walgreen’s pharmacies.
ABC is doing a disservice to the American public by not including all the measures taken to prevent errors- not to mention all the errors that ARE caught- and by suggesting that the “people in the white coats behind the counter” are not highly trained. I hope that ABC will, in the future, include a piece on just exactly what it takes to fill a prescription. The filling process contains multiple double-checks but patients will never understand why exactly it takes “so long” to fill their prescription if the process is not explained.

I honestly feel that this story is bias and does not show both sides of the story but I’m not here to defend anyone or any side. We’re all human and mistakes do happen. Instead of sensationalizing it, the story could have focused more on what/how EVERYONE can ensure the best experience at the pharmacy.
Here are some things that customers can do in order to help themselves and protect their own health and lives. Who’s better to manage your own health than yourself.
1. It’s understandable to be in a bad mood when you are sick, but be patient and give the pharmacist plenty of time to fill and verify your RX.
2. Come to the pharmacy informed. Know your insurance coverage and co-pays. Know the name of your doctor, the location you went to, and a general idea of what he prescribed for you. Little things like this really helps to make the process faster and easier for people on both sides of the counter.

I also work in a pharmacy and agree with what has been said above. I am a nationally certified pharmacy technician. I went through an intensive training program by the company and took the national certification exam. I think that the media is taking a rare, but serious problem, making the general public think it’s an everyday occurence. I worked an 8 hour shift today and had no less than 100 people come in today and reference this newscast. The state of retail pharmacy today makes the opportunities for errors ample, and it’s due to the diligence of the pharmacy staff that these errors do not occur more often. People have come to expect that their prescriptions should be ready in 5 minutes and they should be able to wait at the drive thru. Pharmacies are not fast food restaurants. Filling a prescription takes time. In order to keep customers, the chains continue to put more pressure on their staff. I think that customers should take a more active role in their own healthcare. If you have any questions at all, ASK! That’s what we’re here for. We’d rather you ask any questions that you have than not be comfortable with the medication that you’re taking.

1. The 16 year old tech did not FILL the prescription, she entered the information. The Pharmacist filled,verified and made the error with the prescription. Stop making the public think that the tech FILLed the script.
2. Patients on Coumadin go through a long discussion with their doctors on how to take and with what medications they can and can’t take with Coumadin. There are warning on the bottles of medication and a leaflet that was attached to the bag giving information about the drug, how to take the medication, warning and side effects. Was any of that in your report? NO!!!
3. It is quite obvious that ths report was one-sided, did not report all the facts, just what you wanted to report. Just enough to make a good story, Who is interested in the bottom-line here? I think it is ABC news and their sinking ratings…..

I think it is time for pharmacists to start demanding better working conditions. Bathroom breaks, lunches, regulated hours, shorter shifts. If there are no pharmacist willing to work under the current terrible conditions then NO PHARMACIES WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE OPEN. The law states that there must be a pharmacist present in order to be open.
Bankers get better treatment from there corporations than pharmacist do from there’s. And bankers aren’t dealing with people’s lives.
Pharmacists in general are smart people that went through rigerous school. Many are very responsible and want the companies they work for to do well. But many pharmacist’s are sacrificing themselves for this and getting no appreciation. Yes the salaries are great, but I’m betting at this point they would all take a pay cut if they could just have the qualified help they needed to run the pharmacy better.
It sounds like Unions,OSHA, and the government need to step up to the plate and help make things better, Or the shortage of pharmacists will become greater and greater as more and more pharmacy personal realize that the job is“just not worth the stress”
In a world of nothing is more important than thyself. Why should pharmacist sacrifice there health for yours&gt;

Interesting how this report said nothing about patients taking responsibility for their health. I am a certified pharmacy technician and at the retail pharmacy where I work it is not uncommon to wait on patients who are too busy talking on their cell-phones to listen to information about their medication. You wouldn’t visit a doctor or a dentist and talk on your cell phone the entire time, how is the pharmacy any different? Yes, we do hold responsibility for patient’s lives and we try to have system in place that will minimize errors, but it is also your responsibility to take charge of your health.

Your“report”is extremely misleading and you need to have your facts straight before you put out such an impacting report. Pharmacy technicians are responsible for entering prescriptions into the computer and usually for filling prescriptions, however they are NEVER the only person who touches a prescription. It is not a“typical Walgreens practice”for a pharmacist to“double check”a prescription. It is required by all laws that the pharmacist do the final verification on every prescription filled in a pharmacy. In fact, in the Intercom Plus system (The computer system used at every walgreens in the country), the system will not allow ANY prescription to be sold to any person unless it has been verified by the pharmacists station, which cannot be accessed by anyone but the pharmacist.
Legally, ALL responsibility for prescription mistakes falls on the registered pharmacist and the registered pharmacist’s license. You cannot place ANY BLAME WHATSOEVER on this pharmacy technician in Florida. Even though she entered the prescription incorrectly (which unfortunately does happen from time to time, especially with more inexperienced pharmacy technicians) the Pharmacist is simply the ONLY person responsible in this situation. You should be ashamed of putting out such misleading reports, and you owe that technician an apology for publicly humiliating her with no merit to do so. Justin, CPhT

I think the program that aired was a one-sided view of a few bigger issues…pharmacist shortage, increased life expectancy, increased prescription need, increased pharmacy demand, and increased number of third party problems.
Was this show an attempt to scare people into questioning and second guessing pharmacists abilities to make sound professional judgement when it comes to dispensing prescriptions? People are already aware that medication errors are preventable and occur more frequently than we would like to admit. We should be focusing on how patients can play more integral roles in their own health care, even if it means that the patient catches an oversight by the pharmacist/pharmacy.
The most important thing is preventing the error from reaching the patient and having detremental effects. Take for example, a prescription turned in for hydralazine (which lowers blood pressure)is found to be filled correctly and dispensed to the right patient, but upon being counseled the patient realizes that she was supposed to get a prescription for itching/rash called hydroxyzine and not for high blood pressure.

ABC,
Please do a story that takes you behind the scenes in a pharmacy that will answer the age old question….why does it take so long to fill a prescription? I am a pharmacist and I can’t tell you the amount of times a day I hear that. People don’t realize that when they drop off a prescription, there may be a few other people that dropped off prescriptions at the exact same time. Once someone (a technician at times) inputs the prescription, a pharmacist often times has to override the prescription to check for any interactions/allergies. From there it gets sent to the insurance company for a price. That’s only if the prescription doesn’t need to be called on b/c the doctor’s handwritting is illegible or they forgot to write a strength! When it goes through the insurance, it may also get rejected for an infamous number of reasons. It then needs to be counted, and finally checked by the pharmacist.
I wish people could understand that a pharmacist has the ultimate responsibility to make sure that the prescription is correct. HOWEVER, to err is human. Everyone makes mistakes and no pharmacist enjoys causing an error. It is embarrassing! What people don’t know is that pharmacists are ALWAYS getting interruppted. There are countless number of phone calls from patients and doctors, there are counsels from people in the store, and there are the other distractions from technicians who need assistance.
Everyday doctor offices go to lunch from 12-1 and are not bothered unless there is an emergency. I would like to be able to close my pharmacy down from 12-1 as well and be able to eat a lunch with my staff. But that is just not possible!!! ABC…I think that story on 20/20 was extremely misleading. Next time you want to talk about chain drug stores, show the other side of the counter.

I worked as a relief pharmacist for Walgreens. It was the most miserable experience of my 15 year career. Profit and saving on payroll was without a doubt the most important thing to the company. I started out with two good technicians. They then cut me down to one technician. Then the put me with a tech that really had no business working in a pharmacy. The low quality of service I had to give my cutomers to keep up with volume made me miserable and demoralized. Walgreen’s isn’t the only guilty party. Many retail chains do the same thing. Until the public realizes that the medications dispensed can and do kill people or make them very ill they will accept convenience and price over service.

My apologies if a similar opinion has been posted. In my opinion, the entire story, morning and evening segments, was slanted. ABC only provided what info they wanted to. It was very misleading. The“issue”is NOT a pharmacy technician issue, but instead an entire pharmacy issue. ABC leads the viewers to believe that the technician was“filling”the prescription, a task that was at one time solely the pharmacists job. The technician was merely a part of the“filling process”. As was shown, she typed the prescription. That’s where the error occured. There were still at least 2 more opportunities to catch the error. Someone counted out the tablets, that’s a chance to catch the mistake. Next the phamacist would have verified the prescription through the computer before the prescription went to the customer. That was opportunity #2 to catch the error. Whether or not the customer was counseled was not mentioned, but that would have been opportunity #3 to catch the error. The pharmacist holds the ultimate responsibilty. That’s where the focus should have been. Regardless of the technicians age, education, or previous employment, she was functioning as was allowed by laws and regulations.
Also of interest, I would like to have seen the original hand written prescription, if it had been written by the doctor. A ten fold error such as this makes me wonder if the prescription was written as 1.0 MG. Taking into consideration the way physicians write, 1.0 MG could easily be mistaken for 10 MG, which is not an excessive dose either. If this was the case, there are guidelines for how to write prescriptions appropriately as to avoid this type of error. In this case, even the physician would be a part of the error.
Thanks for the black eye, ABC. Job well done.

The fact is nothing will ever be perfect. Mistakes will happen in both chain and local stores. It’s easier for people to point and blame though.

I think the biggest problem is that people don’t realize that their heathcare is their responsibility also. As a patient they should know what they are getting. I know I don’t trust anyone but myself because I care about myself and my family more than someone else does. Simply put consumers need to step up and quit passing the responsibility and blame. People also don’t realize that a Pharmacy is not a McDonald’s it takes time for a script to be filled. Especailly if you want it correctly. Basically errors happen and it is everyones responsibility to catch them. Your report was very one sided and obviously meant to scare the heck out of people. (makes for good ratings) Well I think you succeeded, but you just made the hard job in the pharmacy even harder because people are easily duped into thinking that your report is the rule and not the exception.

just so you know…ask any doctor what was the one subject they thought was very difficult and many would tell you pharmacology- with that in mind, these pharmacists are not incompetent people that can’t even get the right prescription filled. Healthcare is really falling apart at the seams these days and will be worse in the next few years. There’s just too many prescriptions to fill and too little pharmacists to hire. Why are there no pharmacists?? well if you spent 6 long and hard years at study would you want to be at a chain store overworked, understaffed, no breaks and just complete lack of respect and understanding even from your own patients that you serve would you want to work in a pharmacy?? nope- most burn out at retail in 3 years and move on into cushier jobs in hospital or maybe even pharmaceutical industry!!!
So what can a person do now~~ take a good guess…take care of yourself and become more knowledgeable and more active in your healthcare- it’s YOUR health not anyone else’s. Don’t pray ignorance and just point and blame. Learn why you are taking these medications and be informed on how to take them. This is the information age- information is readily accessible. But people are naturally lazy- some people are so lazy they don’t even take their medications everyday. What we need to do is have people take a more proactive role in their health…when you see your doctor–look at what he is writing you, ask questions, and don’t be so impatient- this isn’t mdconalds…. if you’re not in pain or really sick do you really need to wait 10 minutes for your acne medication?? give your pharmacist and technicians a break.. they only do what they can with very little.

And who is looking at the real problem? The HMOs that pay the pharmacy a dollar or two for the filling of the presciption! No wonder the chains are employing 16 year olds to fill presciptions! The HMO’s are doing the same thing to medicine and sooner or later we will have no private doctors to treat us! Just walk in clinics at WalMarts and overcrowed clinics!!!

while I usually enjoy your broadcast I found this one to be lacking in many ways. first of all you implied that this problem is due to untrained pharmacy tech’s and pharmacist that are just rushing around not paying attention. let me say that as a pharmacy tech in the state of california I was required to go through an intensive training before I was even allowed to get next to any drugs.. I also had to go through an extensive externship at a local pharmacy before I could even apply for my license, I also had to pass a national board to be licensed to work in a pharmacy . the said pahrmacy was of all stores a walgreens.. that is right the villan of your story. I found that I was insulted by your one sided story that did not protray the good that pharmacy techs and pharmacys do. you can find bad in everything but a proper report would and does find the good also.

What a coincedence this show was on tonite!! I had 3 major problems with Walgreens in the last three months. The first one was when I dropped off my presc for Morphine Sulfate 30mg IR. I didn’t pay attention to the bottle at the time and took it home. After 2 days of taking it I noticed I was feeling very lethargic, couldn’t concentrate..When I noticed they had given me Extended release instead!! No wonder I was feeling out of it..I took it back to them , no apologies,nothing!. The 2nd mistake was I dropped of my prescription for Morphine Sulfate and was told to come back in 2 hours, only to find out they had lost it!! Just yesterday I went to pick up 2 more presciptions that were supposed to be ready at 11 am, they weren’t ready, I told them I would be back in 2 hours. I got there at 4pm to find out they had not even started to fill them yet..And they left me sitting in the drive thru for an hour..Finally after getting disgusted I went inside to find out what was going on ,to have a teenager tellme“Oh theyr’e here , ready”I said, You know Ive been in my car for the last hour , what’s the problem here?”I asked to speak with the manager, someone took my name and number and I was told I would get a call from the manager today…WElll…no call nothing!!!!! Unfortounatly Walgreens is the only pharmacy that carries all the narcortics I need, so I dont have a choice but to go there…Something needs to be done !!!!!!!!!

I would like to CHALLENGE ANYONE who has made a comment critizing pharmacy workers to step behind the counter and see how he fares! If you have NEVER worked in a pharmacy before you need NOT even be commenting about the lack of what you call“incompetitence”in the pharmacy world because you have NO basis on which to speak on!

Interesting.. I agree witht the Drive Thru scenario. People get pissed when they have to wait 20 mintues.. that LONG? Why didn’t my insurance cover it? Where is your toliet paper at? God forbid our Pharmacist actually get to pee or eat! No, I need to ask questions that only a Physician should legally be asked. I can’t count how many times I have been asked things I honestly have no right to answer!
The best patients are informed patients. Instead of taking responsibility, people want to blame others!

People don’t want to take responsibility for their own health. The techs where I worked at thought I was insane for wanting to work back in the Pharmacy. After 2 years and extensive on the job training I can see why. People are selfish, rude, demanding and inconsiderate. Only someone who is a glutton for punishment would want this job!

Ladies and gentlemen;
Welcome to the world of the
Wal-Martization of everything. Everything is reduced to the lowest common denominator and driven by corporate profits.
It looks like the pharmacuticals are making a concerted effort to flood the ABC blotter with an“attack the messenger”campaign.
Regardless of all the people who claim to go through training, the fact is that there are some places where there is little to no training!
The best thing for people to do is go to a pharmacy and ask questions about the qualifications of techs. If they are not suitable, take your business to another pharmacy that maintains higher standards…;/The only way to combat these unethical practices is to shop around and reward well-managed shops with your business.

I would like to see you take this a step further and report on the insurance companies. They often refuse to pay for medicines prescribed by doctors, order fills with alternative medicines, make pharmacists jump through telephone hoops trying to get the ok to fill prescriptions. etc., etc. Talk to the pharmacists, their jobs are a living you know what.

As a pharmacist who moonlighted in retail for extra income while I was completing my pharmacy residency, AND as someone who was a Certified technician prior to pharmacy school, I feel compelled to reply.
As everyone before has stated, yes, there is a huge shortage. When you’re one person trying to oversee techs and interns, check 300 scripts in an 8 hr shift, answer the phone, talk to insurance companies about covering a new drug that someone saw on TV or some MD was persuaded by a drug rep into prescribing, running the register, comparing cough syrups in the aisle with a little old lady and counseling at the register, you’re going to make a mistake. This is not to say that they are excusable, but rather a fact of life.
Of course, there was no mention of the plethora of phone calls made everyday because of an illegible prescription or a blantantly wrong dose written by a 1st year medical intern who just doesn’t have the knowledge and experience yet to write correct prescriptions. I certainly didn’t attend college as long as I did to be an insurance agent, and the time I spent negotiating coverage could have been spent counseling patients. (And yes, I always ask if the patient has questions, even if they’ve been on the drug for years.) There was a huge deal made about the age of technicians…did you know that MANY of the people that call prescriptions into pharmacies are not medical professionals? To me, that’s no different than a young, uncertified pharmacy tech. But, I guess the network needed a scapegoat for media ratings and pharmacy hasn’t been picked on for a while.
Most of my class went into retail pharmacy because of the opportunity to talk to patients. The sad reality is that this opportunity doesn’t exist, because of insurance, prescription volume and impatient people who hover around the counter and are angry that there are 30 prescriptions ahead of theirs.
And to all those patients who complained about an error: my challenge to you is for you to know every medication you and your family members are on, and to know why you’re taking them. Why? Because MANY people don’t. So before you call in asking to refill your‘little white pill and little blue pill,’take the initiative to actually be involved in your own healthcare.

At the Walgreens where I work, the pharmacy techs are required to be high school graduates. They are then required to get a training license issued by my state’s board of pharmacy before they can do any filling of prescriptions or entering RX info into the computer. They go through 1 to 2 weeks of computer training and then 2 full weeks of on-the-job training with an experienced technician and pharmacy manager in one of our training stores before they can be put on the schedule in their own store. If they have not met all these requirements, they are only allowed to act as“cashiers”until we get their training license from the state board. Anyone who is filling prescriptions at my harmacy has a license from the state board–either a training license or a certification license once they pass the national certification exam. They licenses are required to be hung in the pharmacy in a“prominent location”. Look for them!!!
As far as the prescription processing goes….there are several steps.
1. The patient phone# and date of birth are to be written on the front of the RX.
2. The RX is scanned into the computer.
3. The technician types in the information from the RX into the computer.
4. PHARMACIST MUST REVIEW ALL INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN ENTERED BY THE TECHNICIAN BEFORE A LABEL WILL GENERATE; at this time the pharmacist is also checking for proper dosing and drug interactions.
5. After pharmacist has verified all info is correct and proper, the label will print.
6. The technician must scan the bar-code on the label against the bar-code on the stock bottle of pills before the RX can be filled. If these two don’t match the technician needs to find out why (wrong drug, different manufacturer, etc). They many times will ask the pharmacist for help with this.
7. Once the Rx is filled it goes to the pharmacist.
8. PHARMACIST checks to make sure the drug in the bottle matches the image of the tablet or capsule on the computer screen. This is done by scanning the bar-coded bottle.
To process one prescription in this manner takes an average of about 10 to 15 minutes depending on how many other things are going on at the time (read the other posts and get an idea of all the interuptions we have in a day!!)
I don’t know about you, but that is pretty good considering all the work that goes into making sure we do it right the first time!!!!

I work in a pharmacy and half the time people who fill their meds don’t even know what drug they are on or what dose they take. People need to take some responsibility and stop blaming it all on Walgreens. YOU take the medication, make sure it’s right and stop waiting for us to screw up. No one is perfect, especially when you’re breathing down my neck because you don’t want to wait for us to double check your RX. People do make mistakes. That’s life, deal with it.

I am a tech at a retail pharmacy and nearly every patient I have on Coumadin knows the dose they are taking. Doses are commonly changed by the patients doctor until the correct dose is established. When this medication is prescribed, the patient and doctor discuss the dose and interactions with other medications in detail and great length. In my opinion, I think a patient who does not notice the dose of medication they are taking(which is clearly written on the bottle) before they just swallow‘the little pill’, is careless. Yes, the pharmacist did make a mistake, but the patient made a bigger mistake in trusting their life to another person. You are the one who should care most about your health, not me. This world is far from perfect. You need to educate and protect yourself and stop relying on others.

I would like to thank abc for making life even more difficult to work in a pharmacy. Now paranoid patients may not even take their life saving medications due to fear. As a pharmacist I know the hardships of long hours, no breaks, standing all day, being under staffed, and hostile patients. At Walgreens mistakes are tracked by a quality assurance program in which the incidents are logged in the computer and resolved by the pharmacy manager. The work of pharmacy techs are always checked by a pharmacist but its true that over worked pharmacist can’t catch every mistake a tech makes. Especially those working double shifts over 12 hours with no lunch. Furthermore, state board inspectors do go under cover to make sure pharmacy laws are being followed and give out big fines if necessary. The solution to these issues is dialog not blame. We need to work together to fix the problems instead of being law suit happy. Putting the burden of responsibility solely on the pharmacist or drug company is in itself irresponsible. Patient self education is key.

the real underlying problem here is not the retailers who are understaffed, its the insurance companies that dont pay the retailers a fair fee for filling the rx’s. Walgreens stock price hasnt change much in the last 5 years. Longs pharmacy is in the process of closing down 30 plus pharmacies in the Washington Oregon Idahoe are, the reason being profitabilty. We are filling prescriptions that cost the retailer $100 and we get paid $5 for a total of $105, how can you afford to pay a pharmacists wages of $37 to $50 dollars an hour at these reinbursement rates?
How come the company Purdue can charged $800 dollars for a bottle of Oxycontin 80mg to a retailer. How come the FDA only grants Purdue the right to sell the product. Their is so much corruption in the medical profession its pathetic. And why dont we go after the real problems in health care, Insurance Companies and Drug Companies not the Retailers the Walgreens of the world are only the symptoms.

Anonymous–at Walgreen’s technicians DO fill prescriptions. They do not JUST type in the information, they type it in at the“in-window”then they fill the prescription, then they give it to the pharmacist for verification. Once the script is verified, they are then responsible for filing the script correctly as well as ringing out the customer.
And yes, Walgreen’s does hire 16 year old high school students to perform these jobs in states where pharmacy technicians do not have to be certified. In many cases, these individuals make maybe a dollar or two more than minimum wage.

When Warfarin is prescribed to a patient, they are fully informed by their doctor they are not to take aspirin. 20/20 was out of line for doing such an“investigation.”Individuals are responsible for themselves, not a pharmacy.

The only comment I have is regarding mis-filled prescriptions. I work in a large volume chain pharmacy, and if anyone after watching this segment comes off with the impression that mistakes are frequent occurrences, they’re not. But when they do happen, people ignore the hundreds of factors that can possibly create a mistake on your prescription.
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist to ensure that your prescription was typed correctly, and filled correctly. There are millions upon millions of prescriptions filled each year, mistakes will happen, the world is not perfect.

I am a nationally certified pharmacy technician in a big chain retail pharmacy. we do on average 500+ prescriptions daily we only have 2 staff pharmacists they work on average 12 hours a day. i think this story was very one sided. a story needs to be done on what goes on inside the pharmacy on an average day. we have many different policies in our store to double and triple check prescriptions before they go out the door. unfortunatley mistakes have happened with the wrong drug being dispensed and patient getting a similar named patients order. It is also against the law in oregon for the tech or the clerk to ask the patient if they would like to talk to the pharmacist about their rx, or if they have any questions. every patient with a new rx in our store gets shown the counseling window and told the pharmacist will be over to answer any questions, they then can deny a counsel to the pharmacist. keep in mind also that if you ask a tech or a clerk a question on an otc product or your rx, they get the pharmacists not because they do not know they answer, but because it is against the law to answer the question. again this is the law in oregon where i live. things may be different in other states.

reading some of the comments that people wrote has really outraged me…I AM A PHARMACY THECHNICIAN AND WORK FOR WALGREENS PHARMACY and i agree with anthonys comment. pharmacist and technicians both get the blame for problems with insurances like its our fault that their medication is not covered or any other bliing problem that might occur. and also what he said when they look at us in shock when we say their medication is gonna be longer that 10 minutes. the walgreens i work at happens to be a 24 hour pharmacy and one of the bussiest in the district. peole are in and out non stop…all day long. people might think its as easy as putting pills on a bottle and sticking on a label, but its so much more than that. i didnt get to watch the show but i feel its is not the young ladys fault for what happened…she shouldnt be held responsible…nobody is perfect…everyone makes mistakes.

I work for a Walgreens. There ARE younger employees working pharmacy, but the ones that actually handle‘scripts are actual pharmacy techs, who have been well trained.
Whenever it gets really busy, and they call for“backup”, they don’t let mere“stock-boys”and“photo people”fill prescriptions. All that the“extra help”is allowed to do is ring a customer up. This means they can ask the customer their name, look in the bins of completed‘scripts, and get the meds for the person.
They also have to ask the customer for their address and check it against the label to make sure the correct meds go to the correct person.
When ringing them up, an option comes up where you ask if they would like to speak to the pharmacist, like if they have questions about their medicine.
This news story is tragic, but not looking at all the facts.
And even if it’s something wrong with the Walgreens this happened at, it doesn’t mean all Walgreen’s are this way…

My Question is, what is the truth behind this called“report”?, instead of mentioning“retail pharmacies”which is a title just to mention and put mistakes only for“walgreens”without having to explain why only Walgreens Pharmacies are mainly in the report?
Is it that the other big chain“CVS”, Winn-Dixie, K-mart, Walmar and all other retail pharmacies were not under the report? May I ask why? or is Walgreens the only place where errors are commited in the pharmacy? ABC should investigate more no just in Walgreens because that is not fair, although I agree with some against that retail pharmacy, but Walgreens is not the only one where errors have been done.

I am very disappointed at ABC’s bias message. ABC would usually present both sides of the story, but this time what ABC presented is not only misleading but is slashing the many years of pharmacy reputation. Pharmacists is one of the most trusted profession and we work very hard to ensure the safety of our patients. Unfortunately mistakes do happen, but the story has to presented in a way so the public understands what is the cause of the problem. When reporters present only one side of the story the public might understand especially from a well respected source like ABC.

I have been going to my Independent Local Pharmacy in Los Angeles for over 30 years and he has NEVER made a mistake. As a matter of fact he has caught and corrected dozens of mistakes that my doctors and dentists have made while writting my prescriptions. The chains are way too busy to build that personal relationship with you and they are believe it or not more expensive than the independently owned pharmacies too.

Did(could) any one read the hard copy of the prescription? As a pharmacy tech. i can tell you that maybe the doctor didnt write legibly enough for the tech to read. There has been many times when a Doctor writes a perscription and the pharmasist can not even read it. Then they have to call and verify what the script is for…and then Jane Customer is upset because its taking too long to fill her perscription. You see the blame cannot be put on one person: Doctor,Pharmacy Tech., Pharmasist, Patient, Chain Drug stores, we all have to take responsiblility for any medication we put into our bodies, because we’re all human. We ALL make mistakes.
Walgreen’s was made out to be the villian in your report. however I have had prescriptions filled in many drug chains and mistakes have been made in 4 of the 5 that they we’re filled in.
Walgreens has been the the only one to not make a mistake.

It is NOT true that we keep pharmacists to a minimum to raise profits….we continously recruit pharmacists…there are just not enough pharmacists graduating to meet the DEMANDS of the growing population. Yes, the pharmacists do work long hours, with no breaks…but they do that for YOU. To make sure you can get your medication when YOU need it. We pay so much money in overtime to these pharmacists (which they deserve and most companies do not pay overtime!!), when the ideal solution is to have more pharmacists on hand (goes back to not enough pharmacists period to go around). If it were up to me (a mgr) I would just keep the pharmacy open 9-5. Make the patients leave work early accomodate THEIR schedule to make sure they get their medication on a timely basis. Heaven forbid you have to pick one up after going to an urgent care in the middle of the night….Pharmacists work these hours because the DEMAND by the people is there for them, they want to make sure you get them when you need them. Believe me, no amount of pay can truly pay a pharmacist enough for all they do for the public. So think twice before you run out of medication, think twice before you find out your child is ill at 8pm and you take them to an urgent care and need that antibiotic/pain reliever at 10pm, think twice before you go to that counter and ask about a over the counter medication to take…who knows, because of irresponsible one sided journalism, they may decide to cut the hours of the pharmacy…then where will you be??? Who will you call after hours when you have a reaction to something??? Who will be responsible then? I appreciate my pharmacy staff and know how difficult a job they do every minute of the day, with very little thanks from the patients they serve…I actually think they should mandate 24hr turn around on all refill prescriptions…only prescriptions of triage nature should be filled immediately…maybe then people will be more responsible for their medications instead of waiting until they have taken the last pill to get a refill and scream“but I am going on a cruise this afternoon…what do you mean I can’t get this NOW??

I am a pharmacy technician at Walgreens Pharmacy and have been for about over 6 months. I have been with the company, however, for about 2 years and was hired when I was 16. I was excited to become a part of the pharmacy staff because that is what I was considering for my career. After working in the pharmacy for sometime now, I have met many people that made me want to quit.
Customers are rude, impatient, and incompromisable. If customers would give us a chance to get some work done instead of standing at the check-out counter asking when their prescription will be done, then less mistakes would happen.
The pharmacists work very hard with little or no respect and thanks. No wonder retail companies are short staffed on pharmacists, no one wants to deal with impatient, rude people all day and come back the next. I have so much respect for the pharmacists that I work with because of what they deal with on a daily basis.
A word to patients bringing their prescriptions to Walgreens or any other retail pharmacy, check what your doctor wrote for you, check what the pharmacy gave you, ask questions, and be understanding

It’s not that pharmacies don’t hire more pharmacists because they want to save money, they don’t hire more because there aren’t any to hire. It isn’t their fault there are 70,000 fewer pharmacists than there ought to be.

People need to look at all sides of a story before they start making their own opinions. As a female in this world, i am responsible for my own life. When i go to the doctor i make sure i know what the doctor is giving me and what it is for before i leave. I check my prescriptions when i recieve them to make sure i have been given the correct drug, strength, and i know the side effects, and it’s the correct copay. My life depends on the medicine I take, so i make sure i am getting the correct information.
Yes pharmacy technicians are filling your prescriptions. Some chains do require more from employees than others. I am a pharmacy technician and my chain does not hire under the age of 18, and you HAVE to have a high school diploma. And if we make a mistake, it has to be documented. Also, when filling a prescription (at my chain), the correct bottle has to be scanned before you can fill it. So it can not go into the computer as one thing and be filled as another. When pharamacists are being hurried are when: the patients can’t wait 15 minutes for their prescriptions, or they want a price NOW (even though they can call the number on the back of their insurance card to get one). We occasionally close for lunch (30 minutes) and they look at you like that’s the craziest thing in the world!!! Pharmacists have to be very detailed people. So do doctors, nurses, and PATIENTS!!!! Take responsibility of your own lives.

Ok, enough is enough, I work for Walgreens. You people need to think, we operate 5,500 stores, and an average store fills between 100–150 scripts a day. Mistakes happen, we are only human, and even the best trained human can make a mistake, can any of you who posted a comment previous to me say you have honestly never made a mistake? I highly doubt it.
Regardless what language our pharmacists speak they are highly trained, along with out pharmacy techs that undergo 40 hours of training sitting in front of a computer! learning regulations and procedures. Not to mention the weeks of training we undergo in the actualy phamacy itself with the pharmacist literally breathing down our necks the whole time. I find it sad and pathetic ABC would go to such lengths to rip apart an industry in which the American population relies on so much just to live! How many lives has Walgreens saved with its medication? How many children were able to go to school last week becasue of the antibiodics we gave them for their cold? How many cancer patients are able to live somewhat comfortably from our medications?

Why is the pharmacy always to blame? What about the doctors whose handwriting is so bad because they write with their left hand so no one can forge prescriptions in their name! Or the customers who get angry that they have to wait 2 hours to get a prescription. Maybe people should realize that this isn’t a fast food business. How hard is it to call refills in a few days ahead instead of dropping it off the day you run out and expecting it in 10 minutes. No wonder there are mistakes going on. Because it is so hard to work in a pharmacy no one wants to put up with customers who blame you for everything that goes wrong with their insurance, or where you are working more than 8 hours daily to get the prescriptions filled. What about the people who come to certain pharmacies just to get the bargain and keep their other prescriptions at their normal pharmacy. How are the pharmacists supposed to catch drug interactions when they don’t know all of the medications that people are taking??

I just hope that pharmacists are not discouraged by this report…as Carl stated…there is a true shortage of pharmacists all across the country. This will not just effect the larger chains but on down to the“mom and pops”…and if there is a mass exodus of patients to the“mom and pops”…guess what….they will get busier…not have the staff either…not have any where near the technology…and a mistake will happen…People need to wake up, companies aren’t asking pharmacists to pump out more prescriptions a day…the public is…and its true, if there is something wrong with the script that they have to call the doctor/insurance co etc, that patient wants us to do it. They don’t care that there are other people ahead and behind them. Just the same as the person whom has no problems wants theirs filled immediately, however, if the time comes that the staff needs to take extra time for them, heck yeah they want you to take the time and figure everything out…which is the patients responsibilty (calling the doctor, calling the insurance company). All we get is compliants that it takes too long..takes too long..what do you expect?

Why dosnt ABC research and find all these extra pharmacists that should be hired. The fact is there isn’t any. There has been a shortage of pharmacist for years. The answer isnt to petition for the big chains to stop expanding to areas where volume is high and work as a tech or pharmacist will be stressfull, the fact of the matter is that walgreens or cvs dosen’t generate these extremly high volume fast food like pharmacies. The high volume generates the walgreens.
people dont go and get a prescription from the doctor because there is a walgreens next store, they go because they need the prescription. The fact of the matter is the pharmacy workforce is set in america. every pharmacy school in america is graduating pharmacy grads at full capacity. prescription counts are increasing every year faster than the country can increase pharmacists. the precriptions have to be filled somewhere. if you closed every walgreens in america, the remaining pharmacies would just get increases in volume that they could handle.
The answer is not to hire only pharmacists to work in a pharmacy because as nice as it might sound it is a fantasy and impossible with todaqys drug market. instead why dont we put more energy into developing systems that can streamline the prescription filling process withput sacrificing safety, where non pharmacists, even high-school students can count out the drugs that there told to, overseen and checked by a qualified pharmacist. lack of these systems are what are causing mistakes.

I am a pharmacist and I agree with Anthony 100%. It would have been nice for 20/20 to at least shed light on the fact that a Pharmacist is a human being and work in a very stressful environment. The phones are ringing, we are trying to concentrate on each prescription, customers have questions, and we are trying to fill presecriptions for everyone. So please be patient and do not rush me just so you can get the prescription quickly or you need your question answered right now or you hate waiting on the phone for me to get to you. Trying to rush me means you are demanding me to spend less time focusing on your prescription. BE PATIENT! Give us time to do our job!

How about we stop blaming pharmacies for these errors and start coming up with ideas to prevent these tragedies from happening? My heart goes out to the families that have lost their loved ones but to say it’s only Walgreens or CVS who are commiting these errors is truly naive. That’s why I think it’s time for doctors and pharmacists to work together in preventing these errors from happening.
Write to your State Reps and Senators to pass a bill that will mandate that all doctors should carry a palm pilot and have a computer system set up to transmit computerized prescriptions to the pharmacy of the patient’s choice and have it reviewed and ready for them instead of having the patient wait at the pharmacy. This will cut down tremendously on errors and the time-constraint pressures that pharmacists face. It will cut down on the illegibility factor, prevent mistakes from happening in the typing of these computerized prescriptions, and help pharmacists to have more adequate time to review the prescriptions for drug interactions, high doses, drug allergy/health conflicts, and accuracy. It also allows pharmacies more time to call the doctor back if there is a problem with the medication, such as those things listed above, and changing medications due to insurance restrictions.
We have the technology to do this in this day and age of computers, let’s use it to make a difference so we can prevent these tragedies from happening in the future. Write to your State Reps and Senators to mandate that all doctors carry a palm pilot and have a computer system set up to transmit computerized prescriptions to the pharmacy. It’s time for a change in business as usual.

California law only allowes pharmacist ration is 1 to 1. Although, there are more than one techs work on the same shift bot only one can perform tech’s task if there is one pharmacist. As a pharmacist, i have to work 10 hours straight without break. Technically I am allowed a break but due to the work load and the demands of the patients I normally work through my break just ot make them happy and cut down the wait time.. Pharmacists work really hard but get the least respect.

There are several factors that contribute to medication errors that this article fails to mention. First of all, people should be aware of their medications and what they are taking. Patients should check their prescriptions at the counter before purchasing them to make sure there is no problem. Second, many errors are due to poor communication. Patients will often pick up their medications through the drive up window and not listen to the directions the pharmacist gives them. When patients are in their cars, they are more concerned with what is on the radio than their medications or more interested in their cell phone conversations than anything a pharmacist would tell them about their medications, even if it is a brand new drug for them. Finally, a medication like the one that led to the death of this patient is one that should not be prescribed without strict monitoring by the physician. Patients should have their levels checked every 3 days while on this medication because it is so toxic. Why is any of the blame not placed on the physician? Also, since this occured, did anyone take a look at the hard copy written by the physician to see if it was legible? Doctors hand writing is so poor these days that pharmacists have to call the doctors for clarification on far too many prescriptions daily. One last thing to note, pharmacists catch many more errors than they cause. Often young receptionists at doctors offices are calling in many of the medications for patients and they don’t even know how to pronounce the names of the drugs. Why is there not more training required for them?
As you pass judgement on this article, ask yourselves why pharmacists only pay $130 in liability insurance a year while physicians often pay over $100,000 yearly. These numbers should alert one as to who is being careful and who is making the mistakes. I have been a pharmacist for 20 years now and I have seen so many errors by physicians and nurses it would make your head spin. The fact that most people haven’t a clue as to what actually goes on behind the pharmacy counter should be addressed. We do a lot more than counting and pouring.

As a graduating pharmacy student this year, I have to say that I find this subject to be very important, but also VERY biased. While I think we all know that corporate America is, in the end, all-consumed with making the almighty dollar, but why cast a devastating shadow upon a profession that has traditionally been known as one of the most trusted professions. What other medical profession GIVES health advice away for free without charging? A doctor will not even see you without charging you or your insurance company, but in our pharmacies, patients who are not even patrons can come up and ask us questions and we put a smile on our face and answer the question. WHY? Because its for the good of the PATIENT. I think that the real problem is not blaming the practice of pharmacy but rather blaming corporate America for these mistakes.
And since we’re pointing fingers of blame. Why not do a special on the doctor who writes Coumadin 10mg 1 QID (four times a day) which would most likely make the patient bleed to death? Its times like those you will be glad pharmacy is there. Point being, who doesnt make mistakes?
 
Posted by: Ryan Racino | April 1, 2007, 3:30 pm 3:30 pm
 
Everyone needs to stop pointing fingers at everyone but themselves. Ultimately everyone involved is responsible and should be accountable for the outcome. Fix the system as best you can! Work together from the doctor to nurse to pharmacy technician to pharmacist to patient. Patients remember this is your life so take control of it. lastly, ABC you should be ashamed of the kind of“journalism”you are reporting to the public. It is one sided and inaccurate and only serves to scare and intimidate the general public.

Just a comment on strokes. There are 2 types of strokes that can occur: ischemic (clot) or hemorrhagic (bleeding). Even though 20/20 didn’t mention what type of stroke this woman suffered from the incorrect Coumadin dose we cannot assume that it was from a bleed, there should have been other symptoms. Great medical back-up. 20/20 went on to report that she died because her chemo was with-held because of the stroke.
My condolences go out to this family. No one came out ahead in this story.
Heres a solution:
For patients who don’t want to wait at the pharmacy, how about having your physician e-prescribe your rxs? They will be legible: Medication, name&amp;address&amp;dob of patient, and prescriber’s name.
Next we can schedule appointments.
Get paid for consultations. Provide Medication Therapy Management aka MTM services.
The best bottom line is SAFETY.

First of all, it isn’t even legal in most States for a Pharmacy to hire a tech under the age of 18, so who did the research on that one?
I have been a Pharmacist for 15 years–we are all human and make mistakes; any Pharmacist who says differently is a liar. There is no way that all errors will be eliminated as long as that human factor is involved.
Many of us are overworked (people don’t realize that many of us work 12 hour shifts without breaks) and understaffed. Pharmacy technicians are so underpaid that the companies have no choice but to turn to inexperienced help–each State also has its own licensure requirements (or none) for Techs.

After reading many of the comments posted about this story I find myself amazed that people can believe anything that they hear. No one other than people who actually work in a pharmacy have any idea what we go through.
Its easy for ABC or any member of the media to spin this story and make it seem as though“the big bad chain pharmacy”is at fault and don’t get me wrong in some instances that may be the case but we need to look at the entire healthcare system as a whole. You notice that this story didn’t once recognize have often pharmacist catch possibly fatal errors that are often written by doctors. Just try reading one the prescriptions your doctor gives you after your next appointment.
The story made it seems as though we just take anyone in off the streets to come and work in our pharmacies but again ABC seemed to neglect the fact that each technichian must be registered within the state her or she is working in. The story made pharmacies seem as though we are a minute part of the healthacre system. Patients don’t recieve“Oh Well”reactions if a mistake is made. There are certain procedures that need to be followed if a medication error is made and we follow them accordingly. My question to many is when does personal responsibility come in? As a society we are often looking for someone to blame but no one wants to take the responsibilty including the patient. This story didn’t even once look into all of the safegards each pharmacy puts into place to prevent erros. As a pharmacist I find that this story to be highly offensive.

The first comment from Anthony is right on the money. I have been working for the Walgreen company for some time, starting in Chicago and in Florida where I went to Pharmacy school. I agree than many medication errors are preventable, however they do happen and they arent made with the intention to harm anyone.
Walgreens has essentially turned into a fast food restaurant for people that are completely clueless about what it takes to fill a med. They expect us to pull out a vial with a label containing all thier info out of our rear ends. And if the doctor makes a mistake writing out a script which happens entirely too often, there is a problem with us calling and getting it corrected since it wont be prepared immediately. I have worked for them long enough to see the many changes they have made to prevent these errors. So much money has been spent on technology that makes prescription filling so basic, that a monkey can do the job of a pharmacy technician.
The real problem in the pharmacy world is not errors, less people suffer adverse drug reactions from this. Its the fact that many people are what I call pharmacy cowboys, where they fill thier scripts at multiple pharmacies, preventing pharmacists from identifying drug interactions. Honestly pharmacy has changed so much to the point where I had to get out of being behind the counter. Im glad that there were other management paths available to prevent from any of these headaches.

Target Pharmacies are the best, hands down. They are very professional, they always talk to me about my meds, and they get me in and out very fast. They know me and my family personally and no matter how busy they are, they Always take the time to talk to me about my meds!!! I am not just a number to them, I am a person.

I watched the show about the pharmacy errors. I also noted that while you mentioned Florida, you never mentioned which states you were investigating in. You also did not mention,(other than Walgreens), which chains you were in. While the mistakes are tragic, what is more tragic is the sensationalist kind of approach you took to this issue. It was as if you were out to induce panic, while making sure you weren’t to blame for it.
 
Posted by: Doug | April 1, 2007, 7:31 pm 7:31 pm
 
What could prevent alot of errors is to require typed prescriptions or electronic prescriptions that would then be legible. I know i can barely read my doctors hand writing. there’s the old joke of not being able to read a persons signature as having a doctors signature. not to funny when you think about the amount of errors it may cause.
Then if the pharmacy tech follows procedure and calls the doctor to clarify what was written, the patient becames irate because it wasnt filled on time.
everyone has blame to share in this. The doctors for assuming there in-a-rush handwriting can be read. the RX techs and pharmacists for taking shortcuts. and not just the young ones. laziness and irritable comes in all ages, and the patient for not becoming more informed on what they’re putting in there body.
remember a few months ago how the FDA gave everybody a wake up call as to following the dosages of over the counter drugs or suffer future consequences. Why? Because people abused what was there, took it for granted and have nobody to blame. Read your perscription labels. that should tell you you got the wrong script.
Talk to your doctor about what they’re perscribing you and what dosage. Dont let him/her off the hook so eaily, just so they can move on to the next patient. Talk to your rx tech when their typing it in. be patient. they have insurance comapanies, doctors, clinics, and other patients to handle.

Ted’s message of March 30 sounds like a defensive pharmacist. It is a good idea–but putting un-needed full responsibility on the patient. Patients pay a fee for service and that should be fail safe. Unfortunately the driver is profitability.

I noticed a comment which stated that a person should have to work as a technician for at least 1 year prior to becoming a registered pharmacist. I am a pharmacy student in PA. It is a 6 YEAR program to be a pharmacist. I need at LEAST 750 intern hours at a pharmacy IN ADDITION to 1 YEAR of clerkships (which is my last year of schooling). Once I graduate, I am still NOT a registered pharmacist. I have to take TWO tests–one on pharmacy law and the other on ALL of the drugs.
Additionally, did anyone ever wonder about the other end of pharmacy? You know, the doctors who phone in the prescriptions…oh wait…doctors don’t always call them in..do they?! No! They can have any moron who works in the office (a secretary) who may have as much schooling as the pharmacy technicians that everyone is complaining about. You can’t always put the blame on the pharmacy. There is a lot more which goes on than you know!

I think people are forgetting the fact that a pharmacist is required by law to check, not fill, every medication. It does not take 6-8 years of schooling and extensive training in pharmacotherapy and pharmacokinetics to count to 30 and put the pills in a bottle. Much of the filling is an automated process and requires scanning of the drug bottle versus the label before the medication can be filled. Filling a medication is not difficult with common sense and technology. Technicians should be allowed, high school and older, since it really doesn’t require a lot of thought. It would be a waste of a pharmacist’s time, education and resources to fill all prescriptions. Why they get paid so much is not because they can put 30 pills in a bottle but because they screen for drug interactions, resolve insurance issues, talk with doctors, check proper dosing and administration protocols and provide patient counseling about the medication.
 
Posted by: Kristina | April 1, 2007, 9:43 pm 9:43 pm
 
Mistakes do happen, whether made by an inexperienced teenage pharmacy tech or a 50 year old experienced surgeon (that’s why all those health professionals have malpractice insurance). Especially in this case, age is almost irrelevant. Counting pills and filling them into bottles do not take a 35 year old and 3 years of experience. Exploiting the age in this case by ABC is disappointing. The only issue with age in this“news”is: it is surprising to me that anyone under the age of 21 cannot serve alcohol but yet, they can have easy access to powerful medications which can have a much higher risk of addiction and/or serious health consequences, if abused, and NOT that she made the mistake because she was young.
Responsibilities of pharmacy techs are limited, that’s why they are not paid $100K/yr. It is ultimately the pharmacist’s responsibility to ensure mistakes are kept to the minimum.
In response to a comment posted earlier about pharmacists are not paid for each consult they made, I have to say that attitude is surprising, especially coming from someone that is possibly a future pharmacist. You ARE paid to do it. It is part of your duties as a pharmacist. That comment is almost to say that a doctor provides exam, makes diagnosis and provides treatment but if a patient have questions, it is ok for him/her not to answer that question because“they are not paid to do so”.
I also agree with a lot of the earlier postings about how big corporate pharmacies are putting profits in front of their employees’wellbeing, which in turn affects patient care. I was surprised to find out that my friend, a pharmacist, sometimes doesn’t even have a lunch break. I thought it is government regulations that allow employees to have at least 1/2 hour lunch break after 4 hours of continuous work?
Pharmacies are often understaffed and flooded with patients with unrealistic expectations on how long it takes to fill their prescriptions. Middle management are sometimes more inclined to keep upper management happy than pharmacists and techs.
In order improve the situation, lower the number of mistakes, it is everyone’s responsibilities. Big companies like Walgreens, CVS, Target (I have been using Target Pharmacy for a while and they are not really much better), etc. has to take steps to ensure the wellbeing for their employees. Pharmacists, techs and other staff needs to take their responsibilities more seriously and yes, patients like you and me are also part of it. Write down the prescription information on another piece of paper before handing it to the pharmacy staff and double check the label(s) and maybe even the pills to make sure you get the right one. Because ultimately it is your health that is on the line. If you have any questions or doubt, forget about signing to waive consultation. You can always ask to talk to the pharmacist and they cannot say no.

Just as if tending bar, handling liquor, and in some states….handling tobacco, there should be a minimum age of 21.
Because Walgreens and other pharmacies take their time filling your prescription, in hopes of you shopping while waiting…maybe those youngsters should be stocking shelves.

I have been a pharmacy technician for 11 years. When I first started, I was 16 and trained on the job. Looking back, I realize a child should not have been hired for that type of responsibility. I now train individuals in an intensive 9 month program to enter the pharmacy world as a certified pharmacy. It is time that certified technicians are recognized for the skills and knowledge they possess and that the money they should be paid is better than killing an innocent person.

Sadly people are giving their input on a subject in which they don’t have the slightest clue. As a pharmacist, nothing ever leaves the pharmacy without being checked by myself or another pharmacist. Technicians can be seen as“aides”or“helpers”in the prescription process and are never solely responsible for filling a prescription. The age of a technician should not be an issue as long as proper training has been completed. If a person questions what a technician really does, go to your local pharmacy and apply for the job so you can see their responsibilities. Or ask your local pharmacy if they have a training program for new hires, most states require it. I think doing this would open the eyes of many individuals on here.
The pharmacacist is the final check of the healthcare system in dispensing a medication that originates with physician and patient contact. So before you leave the pharmacy and when your doctor writes a prescription for you, take some responsibility and become involved in the process. Sure it is easy to play the blame game, but at what point does a patient have to take an interest in their own health care??
Just to show what a pharmacist deals with in a normal day…I had young man come in today because he had a rash all over his face. Apprently at a“black light party”they were smearing Tide soap all over everything and he thought his face would be a good thing to get also. So yeah, after recently going to school for 6 years I love helping people like this while otherscustomers glare at me because their prescriptions are not done yet. All because I have to help another bright young soul.
I think ABC should do a follow up on what the pharmacy industry is really like to help educate the public.

I sent my husband to Walgreens to fill a prescription for me tonight. When he brought it home he gave it to me, and after seeing the show the other night I decided to look it up…. I had this pill before, and I didn’t remember it looking like what I had in front of me. Well I sent my husband to get DIFLUCAN 100MG TABLETS (which is only ONE pill) which is used to treat certain fungal infections…. what he came home with was DILTIAZEM XR 180MG 30 CAPSULES…this is used for people who have High blood pressure…there is a BIG difference there! When we called, the store manager said, oh I dont know how this happened, we hardly ever make mistakes. My husband took the meds back up there, and pointed out to them, that in the past I have suffered from low blood pressure, and this medication was to lower high blood pressure…it also has some very serious side effects! Not only did they give me the wrong meds, and I am very thankful for seeing the show the other night, or I may not have checked because you just expect them to be giving you the right thig (I will be checking from now on) but they acted like it was just one mistake…and it was no big deal. When someone has died, from the same mistake that your company has just recently made it IS a big deal! And should be looked at better. All scripts should be double checked to avoid this problem, people are human, and we all make mistakes, but having things checked twice can avoid this!

No matter how busy they are, they are always there for me to ask questions. Keep up the great work, Walgreens.

Your story led people to believe that errors in prescription filling is a new problem. It isn’t. In the 1950s, my mother was sick and needed a prescription filled. She had it filled at a family owned drug store where there were two brothers who were pharmacists typically on duty. When my father brought the prescription home, my mother knew it was a different pill than what she had had and had my father question the pharmacist. They had given her the wrong pill, one that could have gotten her very sick.
I am currently a pharmacy technician. Your story didn’t touch on the fact of people’s impatience and lack of responsibility where taking drugs is concerned. They drop 5 prescriptions off 15 minutes before closing and get angry when they won’t be done that night. Or they are told 10 minutes and 2 minutes later they’re asking if it’s ready. And many have no clue about what they’re taking, how many refills they have left, or even what it’s for. They also get angry when you ask if they have any questions which by law we must do. Many don’t want to be bothered answering and give a nasty reply.

Please continue to investigate chain store pharmacy services. Pharmacists have to work 12 hours a shift with no breaks and no lunch. They work with minimal staff and have tremedous responsibilities. You might start in Massachussets as they are one of the worst states. Don’t blame the technicians or the pharmacist, but the state laws and the chain store policies.

I was unable to see the 20/20 piece, but I would like to vent at the ignorance that is being presented on this chat board, and that I deal with on a daily basis. First off, many of you don’t even know what a pharmacist does. Every prescription that is typed in by a technician is verified to be the right drug and direction by a pharmacist. Secondly, the pharmacist checks this drug against all those you are taking to check for interactions. We can even see those prescriptions filled elsewhere through links with your insurance provider. It is ridiculous to expect the pharmacist to actually count the pills, so a technician usually does that, except with highly controlled substances that are counted by the pharmacist. Then the pharmacist does another final product check to ensure what is in the bottle. I went to school for 8 years to become a pharmacist. I have a PharmD. (Doctor of Pharmacy) degree. We go through more classroom time than MD’s who spend more time at practice(3 instead of 2 years). We have a year of rotations where we pratice clinically, not to mention most students work as interns throughout school. We have a great deal of knowledge, and should be respected. I want a story on how ignorant, ungrateful jerks can consistently come into a pharmacy and curse and yell at me. Do I go into a bank or resturaunt and begin cursing and degrading the employees there. NO, and neither do most other people, but people seem to think that behavior is just fine in the pharmacy. Don’t forget…the pharmacist probably has more education than you, especially the younger generation of pharmacists…so show a little respect. We don’t get paid as much as MD’s who take half the abuse that we do. We offer free medical advice to people all the time. We are there in the middle of the night when nobody else is. I have fielded suicide calls, helped with over-the-counter dosing for very young infants for those unable to go to a doctor, and helped numerous people who are having emergency medical situations. Sometimes i’m just a friendly ear to an elderly patient. Some people value pharmacists and have taken the time to assess our true value, and those individuals get to reap the benefits of that. The rest of you are just missing out. I’d like to add one final word. I am willing to bet my savings that very few individuals would be able to maintain the stress level of a pharmacist for a week, or even a day without completely losing their minds. Try verifying all of the previously mentioned information, answering a question from a patient at the consultation window, have a dr. calling in a new prescription on the phone, have a pharmacy calling to transfer a prescription, and overseeing your whole staff, all while having people mumbling and complaining and being on your feet all day. Those who haven’t walked a mile in those shoes should best keep their comments to themselves. Thank you.

I’m a nationally certified CPhT(Certified Pharmacy Technician). I am also an aspiring pharmacist. (30 yrs old, for the record.) The retail chain I work for requires pharmacy employees to be 18 years of age or older. Period. We are horribly understaffed for the volume of business that comes through our doors, both in regards to Pharmacists and techs. Most pharmacists in the district refuse to work there because it’s so busy. Regardless of staffing, the responsibility falls on the pharmacist on duty when a prescription is dispensed. EVERY script has to be verified by a pharmacist before it can be bagged and given to a patient. It doesn’t matter who input the script or who counted the pills. The pharmacist has to verify that the prescription was transcribed correctly, DEA# is valid, dosing is reasonable, check drug interactions, open the vial and visually verify the contents against the contents of the stock bottle, etc. Mistakes should NOT leave the pharmacy. People are human and mistakes are possible, but there is always an accountability. There is really no excuse why that script should have gotten past the pharmacist.

In regards to your episode on pharmacy mistakes I found offense to it. I am a program director for a pharmacy technician program. My job is to verify that the students are receiving a quality education and are well trained for the pharmacy field. Let me say that these students are not idiots. The requirement in California is to have a high school diploma or GED before they can receive a Registration from the Ca. Board of Pharmacy. There is also a req that they must attend school or pass the national certification exam (by the way they can’t pass unless they have attended school due to the information that they need to know.) Why hasn’t 20/20 mentioned that most states require this? I am an advocate for mandatory education for pharmacy techs. Everything that is filled is supposed to be checked by the pharmacist. If there wasn’t so much pressure to fill Rx in a timely manner and a shortage of pharmacists there wouldn’t be a problem. When dealing with humans (no matter how well trained) there will be mistakes.

Look at the procedure. one tech may put in the rx but someone else may fill it. we dont question a 10 mg dosage of warfarin . to fix the doctor handwriting, why dont they type the script. its not the tech’s fault. if we cant read it the pharmacist and tech work together and call the doc. this was a one sided report.

I blame this all on the patients!! If you choose to use a drive-thru for service, you get what’s coming to you. I am a pharmacist and own my own pharmacies, and try to counsel every person on what they are taking. This is one of the advantages to getting your script filled an an independent. Most pharmacy schools now mandate getting a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, and really don’t want you going to work in the retail setting. We are for the most part trained to do something in a hospital or something clinical, and none of this entail dispensing a prescription…mostly doing rounds on a team and figuring out as a team what is best for each patient. However, many of us do go the retail route. I can tell you from first hand experience that big chains like CVS and Walgreens dont want you counseling patients. With the amount of training/education that we go through we would love the interaction with patients, but these chains frown upon that. Everything at these chains depends on volume. Corporate does not want you taking time out to counsel…they want you to fill more and more. To make problems worse, they won’t let you have the help that you need because of the“cost”to the district managers and other corporate officers. At CVS your job depends on something called“Triple S”…which is all about volume, and how long a patient must wait for their rx. Safety, patient monitoring, and counseling are not even included. This is the problem with these big corporations, it’s all about money, and the pharmacist has no say so in what happens. If an error occurs it is not the fault of the staff, it is the fault of the system! However, the corporations only feed off of what most patients want…they want their damn precription filled in 5 minutes in a drive-thru, just like ordering McDonalds. Patients want their prescriptions without having to wait, or even walk into the store, but get upset if something is wrong. If this is the case, they should do a“20/20″special on mistakes made at fast food restaurants. If patients want professional service, then they should portray this to the corporations, and eliminate drive-thru service. I don’t think anyone can go get an examination from their doctor my going through a drive-thru window…why do this at the pharmacy.“20/20″also does not tell you how many mistakes that are caught due to the physician making an error, before a patient even picks up the medication.

Did anyone read the very first post by Anthony?
Great description of how much pharmacists have to deal with. The root of the problem lies in health insurance becoming a beauracratic disaster. Pharmacists are now spending more time on the phone trying to sort out plans than anything else, and it isnt getting any better.
We are leaving it up to pharmacists to be the go-between patients and their healthcare insurance, relaying co pay increases to the client (and getting an argument mostof the time), generic vs. name brand decisions, and many other variables that cant simply be taken care of in a few minutes.
There are always 2 sides to a story, I am disappointed only the few mistakes were shown, and not the nightmare caused by problems outside the realm of what pharmacists should be taking care of.
I agree, and Im not going to say I am all that happy about someone barely trained doing what they do. But until the SYSTEM is changed, you cat blame the people who are forced to adhere to it.

As a side note, I am married to a pharmacist, and know many of them. Not one I know of has ever had a lunch or dinner break, may not just call in sick because that means the pharmacy closes, or has the time for simple bathroom breaks.
Not an excuse, just an observation.

lol…one more note…ummm, did personal responsibility get lost somewhere? If I am taking a medication, I make sure when I receive the medication, I check to see it is what it is supposed to be.
I check the dosage against what the doc told me.
I wouldnt just accept food somewhere and eat it if I didnt know what it is…
America is getting lazier and lazier. We rely on others to do the thinking for us.

ABC,
Of course you must only show the bad in something (that very rarely happens in pharmacy practice), instead of all the good that pharmacists and pharmacy techs do for their patients. To everyone reading these comments: The truth to the situation is that this story was extremely one-sided and from all the attention it has received, it has served its purpose to increase 20/20′s ratings. Of course, these scare tactics would draw lots of attention, but the story is simply distorted and did not show the entire situation and circumstances! I am a pharmacy intern, in pharmacy school to receive my Doctorate of Pharmacy degree. Before getting accepted into pharmacy school(which is one of the most difficult professional programs to be accepted into, with only about 1 in 20 qualified applicants getting accepted), I was a Registered Pharmacy Technician, Nationally Certified, and was going to college to become a pharmacist. This program traditionally takes 7-8 years, since it is a Doctorate degree, with about 1 year of externships/internships (40 hours/week) while not getting paid and receiving massive amounts of information and experience. PHARMACISTS ARE the drug experts in the medical profession. They are probably one of the most disrespected and unappreciated professions. This report only adds more stress to the growing problem that pharmacists and pharmacy techs( who must be registerd by the state board of pharmacy and/or Nationally Certified by taking a very intensive test, which requires much preparation) must now deal with. The truth of the matter is that 2 patients fell victim to medication errors that should not have ocurred. The fact is we ALL are HUMAN and WE ALL make mistakes. The situations were definitely not handled properly. At the least, an apology should have been granted to the victims of this horrible incident. But, more than likely there were other circumstances that 20/20 did not present to us (the viewers). I am glad that the spokesperson at least agreed to speak with 20/20 on the issue, however she did not even get a chance to say anything that she felt was important to the matter. She was hurried along and interupted during the interview. And we all know that when it comes to the media and television, that the show cuts and deletes most of the interview and only uses what they believe will be good attention grabbers to boost there ratings. But I just hope that patients(not merely called customers), will not discontinue taking their life-saving medications because of this scare tactic by 20/20. I encourage for patients to ALWAYS ask there pharmacist if they are unsure about something or if they have any questions about anything regarding medications or their health. I do NOT know of many pharmacists, who would not stop what they are doing (no matter how swamped with all the day-to-day stress)and be more than happy to assist their patients. After all, patient care and interaction is the whole reason we have decided to become pharmacists. I do ask that some patients try to be a little more understanding and patient while waiting on the prescription. Because we should want the very best when it comes to our health. Try to put yourself in the pharmacists’or pharmacy techs situation. If you were in the same situation, you would not want to put up with some of the disrespect and unappreciation that we as pharmacy staff have to just“deal with”.
And about the signing the form to waive your right to counsel: This was not a waiver to deny counseling, instead it was a HIPPA form, in which prescriptions must be documented if they went on insurance and/or to see who picked up the RX after verification or in some instances it was a Psuedoephedrine Purchase Log to keep track of sales, since the government now keeps track of this medication. Yes, pharmacists and techs are overworked and the work enviroment is EXTREMELY STRESSFUL, and the demand is very high and the supply of pharmacists are limited. The growth in technology has allowed more and more new drugs and more diseases to be diagnosed and treated. Along with the rapid number of“Baby Boomer”patients, pharmacy is outgrowing it’s resources as far as the number of prescriptions needing filled to the number of pharmacists available. Our nation is going to have to slow down and allow time to catch up with the growing demand. This may mean having to wait 30 minutes for a prescription. How come we can go to the doctor’s office and wait hours to be seen by the doctor, to receive a piece of paper(prescription), but we can’t wait 20-30 minutes to allow the pharmacy staff adequate time to prepare very important medication and information that will affect our health? Not getting away from issue, but these potential drug errors do not just occur at Walgreen’s, CVS, RiteAid, Walmart, and independent pharmacies, but also occur in hospitals and other health instititions, due to all health-care professionals, pharmacists, nurses, physicians, and no one person is ever at fault in these situations. It is the responsibiltiy of all health-care professionals to double-check each other. 20/20 failed to mention all the billions of times pharmacists catch errors made on prescriptions written by doctors or find important interactions, or allergies that the patient never knows about. Because these are just a few of the good things pharmacists do every day. They catch many more errors from prescriptions and phone-in prescriptions than they make errors. Pharmacy practice is at least 99% accurate. Of course, we want everything to be 100%, but nothing in this world, including medications and health-care, is going to be, because we all make mistakes, no matter who you are! Even robots make mistakes!
I hope this comment has shed some light on the truth of the matter!

My husband has a Pharm D, works retail and also for his family store pharmacy (barely hanging on). He often complains that the retail store tries to have too many pharmacy techs per pharmacy and that the techs they hire are inexperienced (once trained they leave) and that he (pharmacists)never gets a break (not required by law in Fl). The chains have minimum skeleton staff scheduled and when someone calls in it is horrible. At his family store, the techs are well trained, know all customers by name and know their patient’s medications. Also added to the list to investigate are the insurance companies and drug companies who set the price paid to the pharmacy. There is not enough of a profit to pay for full staff. The front stock makes most of the profit. If you want to find where the profits are, look to the companies who make the drugs, sell at a high price. The insurance companies pay below cost of the drug qand give you pennies per perscription: therefore, you must sell a lot of RX.
PS There will never be a honest change in their way of doing business (of the large drug companies) because they can buy anyone and make billions and pay just a small fine when they are actually fined for wrong doing. It is worth the risk. It is always about following the money trail.
For those who want good service and comparative prices: Try a family local owned drug store. Oh, I forgot, it’s all about the money!

Errors in the pharmacy does, and will always, happen. I’m not trying to make an excuse for my profession but I think patients need to take a more active role in their healthcare.“Oh, I need a refill on the little pink one.”“Oh…I don’t know the name of my medication. I think it’s something for my heart.”The pharmacy counter is not the same as the counter at a fast food store. Do not be appalled when I tell you that the wait time will be 20 minutes. THAT IS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO SAFELY AND ACCURATELY FILL YOUR PRESCRIPTION. I often hear patients griping and saying that it would take me 30 seconds to throw the pills in a bottle but it is more complex than that. They simply don’t relize that I have 20 orders ahead of them, I have one pharmacy waiting for a transfer, a doctor’s office on hold calling in a new scipt, 3 insurance rejects because the patient was soooo sure their coverage was still active, on hold with an insurance company because the patient is not happy with their copay, and three people at the window wanting to know where the toilet paper, greeting cards, and beer are!
The patient’s expectations of pharmacists and pharmacies are ridiculous. God forbid I close down my pharmacy for 30 minutes while I rest from my 12 hour shift. God forbid I get a chace to use the restroom.
Technicans are a huge asset in our profession when properly trained. I did not go to school for 6 years to lick and stick. That‘child’counting by 5′s and filling your medication is what allows me to screen for drug interactions, espcially when you want to go and buy 15 herbal products because you think they will help you. So the next time you go to the pharmacy and they tell you the wait time is going to be 30 minutes…that is how long it will be to ensure that they don’t cause you any harm.

ABC is bias for reporting only one side of the story. Did they forget to mention that pharmacy technicians had formal education and training before becoming licensed? Did they forget to mention that doctors have horrible handwriting and mistakes can happen? Did they forget to mention that people these days are in such a rush that they don’t communicate with their doctors about what medication they are taking and what dose they are on? I feel horrible that the lady had a severe adverse effect to the medication error but could she have prevented it if she knew the dose of her own medication? Pharmacist and technicians are humans and humans make mistakes…like walgrens said a“few mistakes”in millions of prescriptions we fill. If anything should be learned from this, then people should be more active in their own health outcomes and know exactly what they are taking, name of drug, dose, route, frequency, and indication.

A few weeks ago a local pharmacist was shot and killed by a patient who was waiting in line for her medication and decided she had been waiting too long. The very next day patients in that same pharmacy advised the staff that if they filled prescriptions faster, their pharmacists wouldn’t get shot. They were on a low-income plan and were recieving the medications for free.

While the stories that ABC highlighted are tragic and it is certainly true that medication errors occur in retail pharmacies, the manner in which this issue was covered in this report is absurd. Errors are made in every profession in every industry. Roofers make leaky roofs, lawyers inadequately defend clients, reporters report false information, and healthcare professionals make medical errors. Healthcare is specifically burdened because the errors made during the course of one’s work often result in significant adverse events for the patient. However, in such cases the goal should not be to blame those committing the errors, as this report does quite clearly, but to bring their errors to light and determine where they, or the system they work in, failed. A culture based in blaming will only serve to further incentivize those who make errors to cover them up. Humans will always make errors, even in healthcare. Increases in workload, stress, and role burden will only further serve to increase error rates. However, changing the systems in which our healthcare professionals work can serve to significantly minimize the errors that are made. Instead of blaming the individual, it would serve everyone better to evaluate the work systems and change them so that the work environment is“wired”for patient safety, so to speak. The one thing that the report got right was that the onus is on those in healthcare to remedy the current situation. I will freely admit that too many medication errors are made in the United States and the costs of such errors place an added burden on the healthcare system. A story such as this does nothing to aid in developing a solution to reduce medication errors. It is nothing more than an inflammatory, fear-inspiring report on an issue that is already well known among many Americans, both in and outside of the healthcare industry. I fail to see the purpose of such a report as it offers a sincerely biased opinion and does not offer nor promote any actionable solution.

I am firstly appalled by this story and by the comments I am reading. I have worked as a pharmacy technician since I was 16 and I take my job very seriously. I am currently in pharmacy school, and in most places pharmacy students work as interns and graduate interns before they become pharmacists, and are required to go on rotations in the last year of school; so future pharmacists have plenty of training in the pharmacy, including the 6 years of schooling required to get a degree. This story is so unbelievably one-sided and skewed. The technician is not to blame; her job is to enter and fill prescriptions. The person who is liable for her mistakes is the pharmacist. At Walgreens, the system is set up so the pharmacist must check the prescription twice before it is ready to be picked up. According to all these comments, people are disgusted that a 16 year old can fill their prescriptions and that this mistake was missed. However, if the public was more willing to wait longer than 15 minutes for a prescription, pharmacy staff would not have to feel so rushed in filling a prescription. With all their is to do in a pharmacy, the last thing a 16 year old girl needs is to be pestered the entire time she is entering and filling a prescription. The pharmacist doesn’t need that kind of stress. So yes, the girl shouldn’t have misfilled the prescription and the pharmacist should have caught the error, but this is missing the big picture. If the patients did not have the“fast food”mindset that they all do, the staff would feel less stressed and less pressured, and medication errors overall would decrease. Not many people understand how pharmacy works and how much pharmacists truly know; the people who are leaving the rude comments about pharmacy should try to find out more information about pharmacy, besides listening to this skewed story, before making a conclusion about this profession.

So, my understanding of what the majority of people want is this, they want people who know everything to work in a pharmacy and have a pharmacist check every single little detail for himself. Am I correct? Well, if this is the case then there are many things you have to do. All pharmacies must share information about who bought what drug. Every drug bought by a customer must then be listed under that customer.
Let’s also just forget that drugs and food interact with each other too and cause deadly combinations sometimes and the fact that sharing patient confidential information with other places violates laws. And the fact that new drugs are being brought to the market all the time and that not everyone can remember all the interactions between the top 200 drugs used in the US.
We’d all basically have to wait about 5 hours for a prescription then and most people these days are too impatient to wait even 5 minutes.

I work for walgreens pharmacy as an intern. Our staff go out of their way to help customers. ABC report on 20/20 was one sided story. When you go to Dr’s office, is everybody a Dr? No absolutely not, So why everybody is so shocked when they hear not everybody is a pharmacist at pharmacy. ABC report basically puts fear/doubts in people’s head. Pharmacist check and double check things before drug gets to patients. Walgreens is very advance in technology to prevent errors. Company sure is sorry for the two bad mistakes that have occured in 500 million rx they fill everyday. ABC needs to come up with better stories than this. A lot of times mistakes happens in pharmacy b/c of poor hand writing on MDs. How come nobody points finger at them. ABC should apologize to pharmacist and retail pharmacy(especially walgreens) for making false statements. Come up with truthful/realistic sotries Brian!!!

1) If doctors wrote more legibly, there would be less of an issue. Who says the pharmacy staff did anything wrong, maybe the doctor wrote it incorrectly
2) Half of the people complaining about medication errors and problems in their pharmacies are probably the people saying“all you have to do is slap a label on it”. But when someone dies, you better believe it’s our fault that we only slapped that label on it.
3) I am extremely disappointed with ABC’s one-sided report. Disgusting. And I’m even more disgusted with the public for believing it and not trying to get more information before jumping to conclusions- the media is NOT always right.
4) Pharmacy technicians do the grunt work in the pharmacy. They ring out prescriptions, enter them into the computer and fill the bottles. It is the pharmacists responsibility to check and make sure the medication is correct. Stop freaking out, the technicians are not filling without having a pharmacist check it after. They are allowed to handle the medications, just like a 40 year old person could.

I first want to thank all pharmacists, students, technicians, and those that realize people make mistakes for their support. Pharmacists have a tough job. We go to school for at least 6 years, and often pursue a 1 or 2 year residency programs after graduation. We are in the front line of decision making with physicians in hospitals. Often the physician turns to the pharmacist to find out what blood pressure medication to use, which antibiotic to choose, what dose to give to a patient with extensive kidney disease. We calculate nutrition requirements, and re-adjust dosages to avoid toxicities. We track how many doses of a medication a transplant patient has had. We double, and triple check doses for infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. We answer your everyday questions at the pharmacy counter regarding the sun burn on your arm, or the cut that is infected and just wont heal. We are there when you call and say that your son has a fever and you don’t know how much tylenol he can have. Pharmacists compound the chemotherapy that saves your life. Pharmacists take the time to speak with a patient about their coumadin, what the medication is, how it will be monitored, and what medications you can and cannot take. We are on the front lines of medicine, expected to oversee and participate in everything. I wish the general public knew all that a pharmacist does, or is capable of doing. We are more than“pill pushers”We are the experts in your medication disease management. Mistakes happen in every profession, they are unexcusable, but they also teach us how to become safer. Does the public know about all of the safety catches that are in place. In retail…. the drug and dose are screened for appropriateness, the bottle is bar coded with the prescription to ensure they are the same, a photo of the pill appears on screen to verify it is what is in the bottle. Hospitals are using patient bar coding, med errors teams are in place, nursing, physicians, and pharmacists are always participating in continuing education. Learn the facts. Make suggestions for improvement. No profession is perfect, pharmacists try our best. We love our patients.

As a pharmacy student, I just would like to say to all those people who are ragging on the retail pharmacy hiring high school workers to stop and think for a moment if they would be willing to pay more for their medications. Because I’m sure if you, as the the customer, said“I’ll be willing to pay more for my medications if you only hire pharmacists to work behind the counter.”And you stuck to your word, then the big retail chains may be less apt to hire high schoolers. Sadly the truth is that as the consumer you demand the lowest cost possible which in turn forces the pharmacy to cut costs whereever possible, including overhead.

I am a pharmacy technician in a very well-known chain pharmacy(won’t say which one), and I am horrified at this, but not surprised at all. I started working as a tech when I was 16 also, and I feel that the amount of training is a big factor in this. You are just thrown in after a brief training module. It’s quite a shock at first. At the same time, the pharmacists are the ones who are verifying each and everything that leaves the pharmacy. Verification is the last step- where errors are caught. Most people (and I believe the corporate offices also) think that in order to be the best, you have to be the fastest, which is NOT the case when dealing with things that could potentially kill a person. I think our pharmacists are overwhelmed and these chains are just trying to save money by hiring brand new“techs”right out of high school, and having 1 pharmacist 12 hours a day with no break (not kidding). It’s sickening. Pharmacists are not robots. We’ve all got to be so careful, but with the proper help we can certainly hinder these mistakes. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the people mentioned in this article, and all of the families of the receipients of the countless other unreported mistakes!

I cannot believe how little people know and understand about a pharmacist’s job. Just about everyone has gotten a prescription filled at one time or another. I am a pharmacy student and to clear up any misunderstandings…. #1 It is now required that all pharmacists complete the PharmD (Doctorate of Pharmacy) degree, #2 Pharmacy students do rotations before graduating (just like med school students), #3 Pharmacists catch MANY mistakes made by doctors before the medication even reaches your hands. #4 All prescriptions ARE checked by the pharmacist prior to dispensing. Like others said, it was a mistake by the young technician (most likely due to poor handwriting of the doctor) and was not caught by the pharmacist
People should realize that pharmacies do not make up the cost of your copays (if you have insurance). If you think the price is too high, take it up with your insurance company.
Just out of curiosity, did you know that over 100,000 deaths occur each year in hospitals due to PREVENTABLE mistakes made by doctors and nurses???

Being just a year away from my Doctor of Pharmacy degree, I know very well how much I will depend on well-trained pharm techs. The ABC story was extremely biased in that it gave the impression that techs do jobs that require clinical expertise. Quite to the contrary, state law requires that techs only do jobs that do not require this expertise–finding the right bottle on the shelf by matching the identification number, then counting out 30 pills, sticking a label on, and handing it to the pharmacist. They cannot legally counsel or scan for interactions. A pharmacist on the other hand, is required BY LAW to to verify the label, the drug in the bottle, and any interactions and then must sign off on each prescription. Law requires this check by a pharmacist. When done as the law prescribes, the role of a technician is very appropriate and a life saver for pharmacists. Meanwhile, while your program focused on pharmacy erros, you never once mentioned the many times each day that pharmacists catch major and minor errors from prescribers. We save the lives of people every day, yet rarely get thanked. Instead we get crabby customers who demand their RX in 10 minutes or less and complain when their insurance in inactive. I attempt to counsel every patient I meet at my pharmacy, but very often I get a cold should or the patient refuses to put down his cell phone long enough for me to talk. You, the public, are responsible for your health care too!! You should have a list of questions to ask your pharmacist every time you pick up a prescription!

I would like to clear some things up At CVS you must be 18 and have a HSD. I feel you are giving pharm. techs a bad name. My mom is one at CVS and she dose a stressful job for little pay but yet does a good job. It dose not take a Pharm.D to fill prescriptions.

I am a Pharmacy student, graduating next year with my Pharm D. I have worked in many different health care settings from community corporate owned to hospital based pharmacy. My advice to the public would be GO TO YOUR LOCAL FAMILY OWNED HOME-TOWN PHARMACY. This is what I tell everyone in my family who complains about CVS/Eckerd/Walgreens. They will know your name, and know what medications you’re on as soon as you walk in the door. CVS is a mill!!!

I’ve been a pharmacy tech for 18 years, most of them in Washington state. I began working just out of high school. I was supervised and trained on the job by the pharmacists on staff. In Washington, technicians are licensed: required to complete so many hours of training in different aspects of pharmacy and take a test before a license is granted. Not all states have stringent requirements for techs, BUT the pharmacist is the ultimate last check and authority for okaying the finished prescription before it is dispensed to the patient. Period. And yes, there are pharmacist shortages which results in needing more pharmacy techs. The corporate giants have pushed this trend, preferring to pay cheaper wages to techs than hiring the much higher paid pharmacists. At the same time, many of them also cut back tech hours in order to save money. What do you get then? Overworked staff trying to do the job of more people than there are present, because of corporate greed. Plain and simple. The fault of all this lies with the corporations, but also with the insurance companies, who have reduced dispensing fees to laughable figures. I freely admit that I have made mistakes which have, thankfully, been caught by my supervisor. I do not think that I am perfect in any way, despite my years of experience.

As a first year pharmacy student, I have a few comments to make. While all medication errors are tragic, and the goal is for zero errors, it is unreasonable to expect perfection from a human, even a pharmacist that went through a 6 year PharmD program. More training is always desirable, but in many cases is not feasable due to the severe shortage of qualified pharmacists AND technicians. Many patients do not realize just how much work goes into filling their prescriptions. The only way the patient can be sure the medication they receive is the right medication is to become more proactive with their healthcare. You should trust your pharmacist, but don’t be afraid to question them if you think something is wrong. Become familiar with the names of the medications you are on and what they look like. If anything changes, you should immediately ask your pharmacist. We do not mind answering questions, and would much rather prefer that you do ask them instead of not following through with your intuition and end up being hospitalized or worse. Many doctors do not tell their patients what is being prescribed, and I know this from personal experience. Don’t leave the doctors office unless you have been told what you are on and have a typed (not hand written) explanation of what medication you are to receive, the correct dosage, and how the doctor wants you to take it. Double check the prescription you receive against this paperwork. If there are any inconsistencies, contact your pharmacist. Healthcare is a collaboration between the physician, the pharmacist, and most importantly, the patient. Each have equal responsiblity to make sure the quality of care is excellent, and each have equal responsiblity to make sure errors aren’t made, especially with medications. Zero errors is impossible, but fewer errors can be made if patients are more proactive with their healthcare.

OK, ABC…you want to know what the REAL problem is with medication errors?
1. It’s not age. Let’s face it, there are PLENTY of 40 yr olds out there that are just as immature as a 16 yr old. Just as important, there are MANY 16 yr olds that are more mature than 40 yr olds.
2. Regardless of age, and no matter what previous jobs a person may have had, there has to be proper TRAINING. I’m a pharmacy technician and I used to work for a smaller home-town chain here in Minnesota, and now I work for CVS. Comparatively, I have received more training already at CVS in the three months I have been with them, than the 1 year I was with my previous pharmacy. It’s all about maturity level of the individual and the training given to them by the company.
3. Doctors NEED to write legibly. Period.
4. We need to STOP being a fast-food nation. Whomever invented the drive-thru pharmacy (sorry, this is just my opinion) wasn’t thinking ahead as to what might go wrong with their idea. People assume that because they can get their burgers in 5 minutes, that they should be able to go through a pharmacy drive-thru and get the same treatment in the same amount of time with drugs that can potentially make you sick or kill you. Customers, make use of your time, drop off your prescription before you do your 5 other errands, and make your pick-up the last thing on your to-do list.
5. Customers, PLEASE know what insurance you have and always carry your card with you. Open those packets you get in the mail from your insurance company. Please remember that there are HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of different insurance companies out there, and even if your insurance is Medica, they may have their prescription coverage through another company, like Express Scripts. KNOW YOUR HEALTH INFO, PLEASE don’t make us do your work for you…that is why mistakes are often made, because our pharmacists are on the phone for HOURS trying to figure out why your card from 1992 won’t go through.
6. ALWAYS check your bottles before you take your meds. People are human! Even with the bare minimum (one tech and one pharmacist) two people can miss a mistake, and yes, even two people can not realize that your doctor screwed up your prescription in the first place (always check with your doc that its the right med and dose they are giving you).
All of that said (sorry for my rant here, but I am a well-trained tech who is well over 16 and damn good at my job), even though I did not get the chance to see this report, it makes me sad to see that our media is taking a small number of unfortunate events and turning it into scare tactics.
People, please. I’ve been on both sides of the counter (patient and technician) and I can tell you…if I had been better informed as a patient as to how things worked in a pharmacy, I would have had much more respect for those working there, and been in better charge of my healthcare concerns before I even decided to take a job as a technician.
That respect, in itself, helps those of us in retail pharmacy to do our jobs effeciently and precisely, and to help serve you better with less mistakes.

It is sad to say that some stores are setting a bad example for the other walgreens around the U.S. We do try are very best to insure that mistakes are not made.. And its tough when you tell some one that their prescription is going to take twenty minutes and they stare at you like”its going to take that long,”It is not a simple job to prepare a prescription like most people assume..Until you work in a pharmacy, the customer will not understand…It is a process.. I just hope.. This is why our pharmacists are to double check the work that is done by the pharmacy technicians..This should insure that the right medications are being dispensed

ABC,
What the news cast failed to portray were all of the mistakes that pharamcists did, in fact, prevent. I work in a hospital setting where I work in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary health-care team. We’re talking physicians, nurses, dieticians, social workers, physical therapists…all with suggestions for patient care. As a pharamcist on that team I have prevented countless overdoses, underdoses, adverse reactions, allergic reactions, etc, and have talked to nearly all of my patients. We discuss new medications and discuss how they take their medications at home. And when mistakes do happen, we report them, and, as part of a member of the Adverse Drug Event Committee, we problem-solve on how to prevent them in the future. So please, when presenting the supposed terrible things that pharamcists do, please represent the positive side of things. Pharmacists are the most accessible health-care professionals and the most educated about medications. In fact some reports will tell you that they are one of the most trusted professionals.

I usually use Walgreens to have my prescriptions filled. Some are good, some should be shut down. There is one Walgreens I refuse to go to. My sister needed to get antibotics for my 3 year old niece. When she picked up the prescription they“forgot”to actually mix it. It was still in powder form. They did not put the liquid. When she took it back they were like“oh well”. How they made that dumb mistake I will never know. Common sense. If it’s supposed to be a liquid, don’t had someone the powder and act like nothing happened.

Not all Walgreens are this irresponsible. I have worked front end at the same Walgreens for 3 years, and every one of our Pharmacy Techs and Pharmacists are over the age of 21. Corporate policy states that you have to be 18 before you can even work in the Pharmacy. All stores should have to follow company policy. In cases like this, we need to look at the individual stores and not the company as a whole. There are many qualified and talented Pharmacists and Technicians working for Walgreens, and you should not be punishing them for following the rules.

Many times the errors do not occur, because of the pharmacists’lack or knowledge, but rather the working environment they are placed in. Pharmacists have long hours, are contstantly on their feet, they have to deal with customers who want their medications as soon as possible, customers who blame the pharmacist if the insurance companies don’t pay for their medication, and they also have to figure out how to read what the doctor wrote on the prescription. Doctors are infamous for their handwriting. If the patient can’t read their own prescription, how are the pharmacists? Pharmacists also get tons of prescriptions everyday where the doctor has wrote the wrong dose, wrong medication, wrong indication, or even wrong patient and the pharmacist has caught the mistake. I’m currently a pharmacy student on rotations and couldn’t be more proud of my profession. Human error always occurs, just look at how many typos are on this wall. People just need somebody to blame and in this report it’s the pharmacists.

PharmD resident? What does that mean? Do you learn how to count pills in a hospital?
The public is miseducated as to what the role of the pharmacist is expanding to in our generation. This newscast is just another example to show the public that a pharmacist (or“16-year old”tech, in this case) is merely a tool for counting pills and dispensing medications in the fastest and most efficient way possible. I agree that age should have nothing to do with competence level. I know plenty of incompetent older people.
As I read through these posts, it made me angry as to how uneducated most of these people sounded as to what a pharmacist does and what the supposed laws should or shouldn’t be. When I tell people, even my family members, that I will be completing a pharmacy residency next year, most of them have no idea what I’m actuallty talking about. Also, I have worked in retail in two different chain stores for the past 8 years and just because a pharmacy is a chain, doesn’t make it a bad pharmacy. Your staff is an incredibly huge part of making the place run, in addition to the corporation giving you enough pharmacist hours to staff appropriately. Perhaps the biggest problem in this Walgreen’s is the lack of staff altogether, which makes mistakes a lot easier to come by.
I wish ABC would do a story on the difference that a pharmacist can make in hospitals, nursing homes, and retail locations. Pharmacists are constantly involved in providing better patient care and correcting mistakes made by other parts of the patient care team.

As a PharmD, we go through extensive training to be the best pharmacist we can be, including keeping up to date with current therapies, generics, etc. to ensure patient safety to the fullest. Patients need to understand that we do everything we can to educate them about their health and disease states, including medication. This ABC documentary singled out Walgreen’s for some reason, which is unnecessary.
If you are a patient, instead of typing a 3 page essay on pharmacists not doing things properly, all you have to do is ask us for advice at the counter. I am at the register about 50% of the time ringing out patients’Rx’s, but often times I cannot even speak important information about antibiotics or interactions,etc. because people are too preoccupied with their cell phones or asking me if i can ring out their pepsi and other items with the Rx. Pharmacists, contrary to what technicians or consumers say, are MORE than willing to spend an extra 5 minutes with a patient educating them on their conditions.
Think about it: would we go to school for 6 years, become doctors in pharmacy, spend all these years in training so we can ring out your pepsi and forget about disease states and medication? I’d be more than willing to discuss coumadin or any other medication 100% of the time over ringing out a pepsi and saying have a nice day.
Just my 2 cents, and i’m sure 99% of the pharmacists out there agree!

PharmD resident? How can a pharmD candidate not know what a resident is?
A resident is a pharmD graduate that pursues their interest in a more clinical setting. They are pharmacists, just like you will be one day.

What did the prescription look like? Was it a careless key-in or a horribly written script? Were the two doses right next to each other alphabetically? Was the patient on warfarin before? If so, what dose? (They would have had to been on warfarin or another anti-coagulant because starting therapy needs bridging with heparin, lovenox, fragmin, etc.). Was the patient going to the pharmacy for the first time? Didn’t the patient notice a different colored pill? Wasn’t a MD have a lab checking the patients INR regularly? And Walgreen’s has no screen that flashes and warns that a high dose of a dangerous drug is being dispensed? Etc, etc, etc.
Blaming THE company, or THE tech, or THE pharmacist won’t prevent ANY future mistakes…A medication error often has multiple causes and is the result of an error in the process involving many people…Less blame, more critical thinking and changes…to reduce the chances of ANY ONE else being harmed in this way.

I am a licensed pharmacy technician for the state of California. I have been so since 1999. I am now a pharmacy technician program director for a vocational school. I think the story that aired on Friday was extremely biased.
In California a ptech must attend 720 hours of an accredited school, have a high school diploma, be over the age of 18, and submit to a background and drug test prior to employment prior to even being able to handle medication.
Dispensing medication is an extremely important job that must be done with a precise knowledge and practice. I take my professional seriously and it was unfair and inadequate presentation of the pharmacy technician.

ABC,
You are missing the point of prescription errors. Yes, they are unfortunate, and at times, deadly. You spend an entire news story discrediting Pharmacy Technicians. What you seemed to have glossed over is the facts that under no circumstances do Pharmacy Technicians dispense medications without that prescription being verified and double-checked by a Pharmacist. I myself am a Certified Pharmacy Technician and I am appalled at your portrayal of the Pharmacy Technician role. What you also fail to report is that there are very few regulations mandated by the Federal government. The pharmacy industry is, in large part, regulated by the individual state. In my state, the Pharmacy Technician cannot even go so far as to hand a patient a filled prescription. The state requires that prescriptions being dispensed are done so by the Pharmacist. You have purposely gone out of your way to ignore the real truth of the matter: That there are simply not enough federal regulations governing the pharmacy practice. One of your reports stated that …you are “…Naming names…” Well, you named the wrong name. You spent all that time “roasting” the Pharmacy Technician. What you also miss is the fact of how many medication errors physicians make, and how many errors are caught and corrected by the pharmacy. This is not only appalling, but misleading. I never thought of ABC as a sensationalist news program, until now.

I have worked as a pharmacy tech since I was 16 years old, I am now 27 and Lead Tech for a major chain. I think all pharmacy techs deserve an apology for the broadcast. I understand that there are misfills and that is very unfortunate but every prescription should be checked by the Pharmacist before ever leaving the pharmacy. So the fault really lies on the Pharmacist on duty not the Tech. If a mistake is made the Pharmacist should have it corrected before it ever leaves the pharmacy. It is very unfair to single out technicians. sincerly, very upset in dayton ohio

I am a tech. at Walgreens. Yes I feel rushed. Not by the company but by the patients. Everyday I get yelled at because I ask someone to wait 15 minutes. Even though my store fills 600+ prescriptions a day and I have worked there for 4 years, I have only seen maybe 4 or 5 misfills. Most were caught and corrected before the patient ever took the medication. Yes, this is unfortunate. Yes, I feel sad for families that aren’t as lucky as that. Let me ask everyone this:“Have you ever made a mistake at your job?”We are only human. Even with all the checks, we do still make mistakes. Doctors, nurses….they make mistakes just like us. A lot of the time our“misfills”is because the doctor wrote the prescription out wrong. They just push the blame onto us. Sorry for being human.

Anthony and many others are correct; ABC is completely missing the point. Pharmacy staff are generally quite competent, but the consumers have unrealistic expectations. They do not grasp the sheer complexity of the job behind the counter, they effectively see pharmacy as a“McDonalds for Drugs”and they treat it as such.
There are many different parties at play here: doctors writing the prescriptions, insurance companies being billed for the prescriptions, corporate structures constantly messing with different drug manufacturers and more. Each of these things has the possibility for error, and while the mistake may be the doctor’s, or the insurance company’s, or whoever else, it is the pharmacy that gets the blame.
If you want to eliminate mistakes from the pharmacy, then don’t expect to get your 14 prescriptions in less than 25 minutes! That is completely ridiculous, and you should feel stupid for expecting it. This is your life after all, maybe you should make sure that the pharmacy staff has the time required to appropriately double and quadruple check your prescriptions.

It is funny how this happened ten years ago but no one points that out. There have been a lot of improvements sence then.
When consedering the job the pharmaceys do you should keep in mind how hard it is read the doctors writing and how difficult it has become to deal with all the different insurance companys

I have been reading most of the comments on this page. I have been hearing both sides of the story (even though the show only showed once side). I noticed, a lot of people try to defend the pharmacist, and many try to blame them. With the situation with the Warfarin 1mg which was given 10mg, I haven’t seen a single mention of the doctor. How do we know that the doctor’s handwriting wasn’t horrible, which made it seemed like a 0 after the 1? Everyday, while at the pharmacy, about 1 out of every 4 prescriptions are not readible. We have people that come to the pharmacy for unrelated items as well; one lady was yelling at me because the soap was not on sale. In situations of errors, everyone is at fault; the pharmacy, the customer, the doctor, and the insurance company. While I agree the pharmacy needs to be more staffed, I think it is ridiculous to mention that technicians fill prescriptions. Of course they do. They fill the VIALS, but every vialis checked by the pharmacist, and the vial does not leave the verification are unless the pharmacist checked it. There isn’t enough time or money to have only pharmacists fill the vials. Customers need to be more responsible for their own medicine, and not wait until Friday night to ask for us to fax the doctor when they are closed on weekends. Some customers just expect the pharmacy to do all of their work. I’ve had customers drop off prescriptions and I quoted them 10 minutes (even though they waited HOURS at the doctor’s offices), and they tell me, why 10mins, it’s already in a box (for ex. eye drops, or creams). And why is insurance companies not paying for medicines, and asking for prior authorizations (and take up to a week to approve)? Why would they need a prior authorization when the doctor already authrorized it by writing the prescription themself??? Every side needs to take blame, and be responsible. Everyone just wants to find a scapegoat, and this needs to change.

I am a pharmacist and what I got from reading these comments&amp;watching the show is, regardless of the employer’s desire for profit at all costs and the impatience and unhappiness of the people holding the rx’s, I hold the license and have to live with what I do in my practice legally, morally, and professionally. Therefore I must tell myself every day: do not fall into the trap of hurrying. I’d rather be like the pharmacist who Walgreen’s constantly fussed at for being“too slow”than the ones videotaped for depositions because they harmed someone’s baby, mom, or spouse. Believe me, none of us pharmacists want to be in that position.
None of us went into this profession with nonchalance or an uncaring attitude. Sometimes we seem stressed and maybe less than fully attentive. As the comments above may indicate, we may have a blood sugar of 60 and a very full bladder. God bless us all, the health care providers and the people in their care. Because as it has been mentioned the large corporations, especially insurance providers, are not on OUR side. We must look after ourselves, as pharmacist employees, and as health care consumers.

I am a walgreens employee, and have been for 6 years. as a technician I can say, the first comment on this train is absolutly right. People expect their medications to be done in less then 10 minutes. How can we as pharmacy employees be accurate when so much is expected by the public? I don’t know how many times I get comments from the customer about,“It’s in a prepack bottle, how long does it take?”Well, to insure the saftey of my customers we let them know,“yes, it is, but we have a policy to follow and it well take no less then 15 min to insure that it is filled correctly.”They may not want to hear that, but what else can we do? To have to answer phone calls, call the insurance, read the doctors handwriting, ( which we have to call if not clear enough for us to read), and everyone wants it now. Please do the other side of the story and ask the Pharmacy staff how we feel on the customers and our procedures.

I was absolutely appalled at the editorial by ABC. Sure what they were reporting on was a mistake and a newscast nonetheless. Unfortunetly that newscast was an issue that was negative toward the retail pharmacy setting. It’s going to be negative and the only reason the media used the sotry is because it would turn an eye of the consumer/professional/observer to it.
I literally have 12 days left of school until I graduate, and I am going to be going into the retail setting. A pharmacist in those setting is not meant to lick,stick,count,pour. The behind the scenes work that a pharmacist does that goes unnoticed especially by an article such as this needs to be reported on. I would challenge ABC to follow up and interview some retail pharmacists anonymously and see exactly what they do and how mistreated they are.
I absolutely love talking with patients which in one reason as to why I am going into retail pharmacy. I hate drive through windows, retail pharmacies are not fast food chains and you will not recieve your medication faster so stop ringing the bell.

I have been a registered pharmacy tech for the last 10 years and I am quite disturbed about the report that was on Tv last week.
I knew that before I watched the show that it was going to be one sided however, I wanted to be prepared to answer any questions that my customers/patients had about the coverage.
The focus of the article should not have been about the 16 year old from Florida, whose mistake caused the death of a woman, but on the fact that the corporations are only in the business for the money. Unfortunately your story did not express the facts of pharmacy correctly.
There are many states in the US that require more education, than that of a high school student. For example, California, New York, and Hawaii are the strictest states when it comes to techs. Also California has one of the hardest exams for pharmacists. Which I am sure is to ensure the safety of people. In the past (in California) technicians needed to be trained by a pharmacist and work 1,000 hours before they received their license. Now, techs need to not only go to school to be a tech, and pass the national exam, but also need to fulfill so many hours of continuing education. So to question weather a tech is qualified or not to fill medication is not only ridiculous, but down right demeaning.

I happened to have GMA on while getting ready for my job as a pharmacy tech at CVS.
Our pharmacy is very conscientious about our service to customers and I was appalled at the scare tactics used in this report. There is no way a high school student could dispense a prescription at our pharmacy. In my state, you have to be 18, take the approved training and pass a state exam to be a pharmacy technician.
We constantly have checks on our procedures and only qualified technicians can fill prescriptions which are in turn checked by the pharmacist. If the customer in the report received an erroneous RX, then the blame lies solely on the pharmacist who checked it. At our company, with cutbacks increasing, pharmacists are becoming more and more scarce and trying to fill the enormous volume of scripts is becoming a losing battle. The pharmacist is at risk of losing their license if errors are made, while at the same time dealing with customers who want their prescriptions filled IMMEDIATELY. In our“fast food society”, everyone wants it NOW and prescriptions are NOT fast food—Do u want it RIGHT or do u want it FAST?? Next time you get a prescription at a pharmacy, think about it. There are so many variables involved–did the dr. sign the rx, is the med available, are the instructions legible, is there a problem with insurance coverage,are there drug interactions, the list goes on and on. You’d be surprised how many people call to ask US what their meds are prescribed for, or IF it’s time for a refill. We are not your doctor. The public needs to be proactive and not be unduly alarmed by these types of stories. Typical media hype.

I wonder, if this girl was so‘untrained’and such, how did she know how to use the softwear to fill the script in the first place? ohhhh wait, she prolly was trained eh? good call.
Thanks ABC for making a thankless job, that much more difficult. People calling me 14 times a day to interrupt my filling process to tell me how they will no longer be signing pickup logs. Any pharmacy that has a councling window open to the public has their rears covered. Bloody Brilliant.

How does pharmacy chains like Walgreens expect pharmacy technicians that have graduated from high school to support their families on $8.00 hr? They obviously attract high school student due to very, extremely poor, poor living wages, who else can live on that and not have to still live with your parents? I’ve been with Walgreens for 10 years and get a 10 cent raise every year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This article is a joke in itself. It’s completely biased.“oh walgreens is the worst pharmacy”. Don’t you people realize that this has happened at ALL pharmacies at one point or another. If you have never been behind a pharmacy counter, then you have no insight that is accurate. I have people kick and scream when they have to wait more than 5 minutes. When we fill 700+ scripts a day, how can it be less than 5 minutes. This girl is not at fault at all. Techs, type in the script then it must be reviewed by the Rph before it can be filled. Then we fill it. Again it must be verified by the Rph before it can be sold. Often these mistakes you are seeing are from your dr. himself. We on the phones all sorts of hours of the day trying to get ahold of your physicians to make sure that they wrote it correctly because it does looks suspicious. We don’t tell you that the dr. made a mistake. No, we take the grief when you are yelling that you had to wait an extra 10 minutes.
Then you bring your heaping cart full of crap that may or may not be on sale for me to ring up. This takes way more time away from what I am needing to be doing. So I ring up your cart of crap and you yell because something was on sale, and I am trying to overcharge you, when only YOU forgot to get the coupon. How can I get your script to you in a timely matter, when everyone else just like you wants me to take more than 5 minutes to ring them up. Think about that next time. The techs have the training they need as do Rph’s. Mistakes are made sadly. You should do your own part on checking for your own safety.

I currently work as a Pharmacy Tech for another pharmacy and am in Pharmacy School. Why doesn’t ABC do a special on how hard pharmacists and techs have to work in retail and how much crap they have put with their patients since patients don’t realize that this is not a fast food joint as previous people said. When pharmacies say, give us time to fill, it really means GIVE US TIME so we can fully check and make sure your prescription is dosed correctly. In every profession people make errors, this doesn’t make this error ok because its not but it also doesn’t mean you do a special report on it bashing the profession. Without Pharmacies, where are you going to get you’re medications, from whom are you going to get medication advice since doctors aren’t always free. Learn to appreciate what these people go through before you sit here and say“oh I will never go to Walgreens again”. Pharmacists and techs always ask do you have any questions? If you do then SPEAK UP then. That’s what they’re for, to COUNSEL you and make sure you fully understand what you’re taking=patient care. Did you know there’s a huge shortage of Pharmacists? Did you know these people go through an intense load during Pharmacy School? Check your facts before you speak.

When you see a dr. they go over the RX with you, ask if you have any questions. Then hand you a RX to look at the whole way to the pharmacy (in some cases it may take a week or so to get there)nevertheless, you should know what med. you should be taking or getting from your dr. If it is something you’ve been on for years, you should know what it looks like. If you see it looks different, why risk your LIFE and take it before checking. Do you really have that much trust in someone else? Again this is your LIFE. Me and the other pharm. staff are always calling Dr.’s to verify meds., strength, qty, dose (pediatric)on Rx’s and more than half the time the Dr.’s asking the RPh what the recommended dose is? So now who do you trust? When people call for refills they don’t even know half the time what the name of the med. is. All they know is it is for blood pressure, fluid, etc. SO, this brings us back to the inevidable, Why be so lazy, look at what your getting before leaving your pharmacy!!! If you have questions on something you’ve never takin before ASK.

As a pharmacist who holds a doctoral degree (yes, many pharmacists, and all those who graduated after 2005 hold doctoral degrees), let me say a couple of things.
1. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PHARMACISTS TO GO AROUND–There will be a shortage til about 2025 or even later.
2. Therefore, we must have technicians to ASSIST us
3. THE PHARMACIST IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE, NO BLAME SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE TECHNICIAN
4. Yes, we sometimes need extra help, so we get the manager or photo clerk to help RING UP PRESCRIPTIONS–at no time, is a photo clerk allowed to count pills and put them into a bottle unless he/she is also a certified technician
5. It is unreasonalbe to think that a pharmacist should work the“in window”where you drop off prescriptions and type them in–at the doctor’s office, who comes in to check your heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and obtain various other information (ie. chief complaint, recent medical history, symptoms…)? Its a nurse or even a medical assistant. I have colleagues who employ medical assistants who do this very thing and have high school diplomas/GED’s, but have earned their certificate degree for medical assistant.
6. Your average Walgreens/CVS/Rite Aid…fills about 250 to 300 prescriptions per day. Do you know how many SERIOUS errors occur each week at said pharmacies? ZERO. I define serious as a patient receiving the wrong drug, wrong dose, or wrong directions such that a harmful outcome occurs.
7. Often,“mom and pop”independent pharmacies have out dated technology. For example, I spent 8 weeks while in pharmacy school at a respected independent pharmacy. The computer software used did not have automatic drug interaction and health condition checking! Many of the independent pharmacies don’t have the extra money to continually invest in technology–DO NOT ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE A LOWER ERROR RATE, ERRORS ARE CONSISTENT AMONG ALL RETAIL PHARMACIES
8. We as pharmacists are the drug experts and we understand the patient’s knowledge is limited.
9. Even if you don’t know what to aks about, say this to the pharmacist–IS THERE ANYTHING IMPORTANT I SHOULD KNOW REGARDING THIS MEDICATION? Or try, COULD YOU PLEASE LOOK AT ALL MY MEDICATIONS AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY INTERACTIONS OR CONCERNS.
10. Find one pharmacy you like and stick with it, using coupons for transferring prescriptions only hurts your overall care
11. Don’t use the drive through, get off your ass, go inside and look your pharmacist in the eye and ask him/her some questions.
12. Pharmacists are glad to answer questions, but be to the point. Sometimes, we don’t have time for stories that are long preludes to your actual question. Get to the point, be direct, and you’ll get an honest answer.
13. Do not yell, rush, or otherwise harass the pharmacy staff–treat them as you would like to be treated. If they don’t treat you kindly in return, go to a different pharmacy.
14. YOUR DOCTOR MAKES MISTAKES TOO–I’ve lost track over the years for dispensing medications EXACTLY as it was written and by all accounts, the precriptions were medically correct and appropriate. However, they were nonetheless wrong (dose was changed incorrectly, or, dose wasn’t changed as it was supposed to. wrong quantity or refills written by doctor, and even the wrong medicine is written)
15. DON’T EVER LEAVE YOUR DOCTOR’S OFFICE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS ARE FOR
16. KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEDICATIONS YOU’RE TAKING AND WHAT THEY ARE USED FOR
17. DON’T GO TO THE PHARMCY AT LUNCH TIME OR IMMEDIATLEY AFTER WORK AND WAIT FOR YOUR PRESCRIPTION–As a pharmacist, I feel that more errors are likely to occur during those times because they are the busiest times. Drop it off and come back later in the day.
18. Call your insurance company if you have questions about your policy or your copays- IT IS NOT THE PHARMACY’S JOB.
19. If you don’t have refills on your medication, the pharmacy will most likely give you enough medicine till we can contact your doctor. We will contact him/her as a COURTESY. However, we will not chase your doctor for days becuase YOU RAN OUT OF YOUR MEDICINE. THATS RIGHT, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE YOUR MEDICATIONS ONCE YOU TAKE THEM HOME.
20. Grocery stores and Costco are considered retail pharmacies and suffer the same problems that“major”retail pharmacies do.
21. Find a pharmacy that provides you with good service. Get to know the staff and believe me, you’ll have a great experience for years to come.
22. As the patient, take responsibility for your own health care. Simple things like checking the name on the bottle when you pick it up, looking at the tablet and checking it against what is says it should look like on the pharmacy receipt are all simple things you can do as the patient to protect yourself.
22. I AGREE THAT ONE ERROR IS TOO MANY, BUT WE’RE ALL HUMAN AND NO PHARMACIST WANTS TO BE THE ONE WHO MAKES A TRAGIC ERROR. BUSY PHARMACY OR NOT, WE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON OUR JOBS AND MY PATIENTS’HEALTH AND SAFETY COME FIRST
23. Feel free to contact me with any questions/comments

As far as the tech in court for giving the wrong dosage. This had to be cleared by the pharmacist before reaching the patient. This tech should have never been to court.

A year or two ago, i was working a shift with one of our staff Rphs. He had been with the company for many years. For the month or so before, he had several dispencing errors. Nothing overly serious, no one was hurt or anything from them, but they were there, mostly from him rushing because people today want everything now.
At any rate, we are working away. I was rocking the register and he was on the phone with one of our frequent fliers, arguing with the man bc the patient wanted his narcs filled early. Long and short of it is, the People, the selfish people with their constant harrassment had finally pushed this fine man to the edge, burned him out. he got off the phone, looked at me and told me he quit.
After watching ABCs take on retail pharmacy, i can honestly say i understand how he feels. i can handle the people who treat us like their own personal secretaries. the ones that treat us like doormats. people who accuse us if money grubbing. Ive stood there and took it when folks have ripped up one side of me and down the other. Taken it when they throw things, no i am not exaggerating, pens, meds, insulin, Clipboards. The whining, rude comments, harrassment, rolling of the eyes, and screaming, it all rolls off my back. and my colleges’s backs. bc we are helping. whether arrogence inhibits people from seeing it, we are here, providing a necessary service. And frankly, it breaks my heart to sit down and watch a show that makes us look like monsters, uncaring money craving parasites leeching off the healthcare world.

THANK YOU ABC!!!!
I am and have been an employee for walgreens for 17 years now and a technician for them for 12 years. I am state registered and nationally certified. I work in a busy 24 hour store and since Katrina our work load has doubled if not tripled because of the pharmacies that were destroyed.
Many of our pharmacist lost their homes and loved ones and instead of crying over their personal loses they came to work and we were the first pharmacy on the coast to open. Not for the money but because we knew our patients needed medicine. We worked with no computers and no phones for days. When we did get generators we worked for weeks with limited staff and limited computers. We were not their for the money we would have been paid whether we opened the doors or not because Walgreens cared about its employees.
There was I know atleast 3 or 4 days right after the storm we gave away medicine because we couldnt take credit cards or bill insurance companies. We knew people had limited amount of funds at hand an no way to access any more. Walgreens sent down word to give everyone who needed medicine 3 days worth at no charge. Does that sound like someone who does not care about the patients they serve.

Here’e another hint for all consumers. Don’t come at closing time. At closing time, the whole staff has probably been working at least 10 to 12 hours. We have close-down procedures to do with our computers and cash registers in order to get out“on time.”We don’t need a handful of your prescriptions written a week ago to test our mental stamina and keep us over when we already have aching feet, legs, backs and cannot wait to get home to eat, use the bathroom, and get off our feet. Thanks.

In response to many of these responces…Pharmacist DO work in various chains and hospitals before they graduate, they have internships just like MD’s. Whether a technician is 16 or 50 doesn’t matter, it is the Pharmacist who does the final check on the medication.
Does everyone realize how the news always points out the bad instead of all of the good pharmacists do??
Just a little fact for everyone: Drug companies take more than 80% of their profits and put it back into research for new medications. Did the news ever mention that???
 
Posted by: A | April 10, 2007, 6:56 am 6:56 am
 
As a pharmacist myself I am appalled that a news program would dare report something of this magnitude. Did you go to pharmacy school? Do you know what it takes to be a pharmacist on a daily basis? No, you don’t. Yes, there are mistakes made in pharmacies everyday. Where were the prescribing physicians who wrote these prescriptions that were misfilled? Why were they not questioned? Doctors make mistakes everyday just like Pharmacists. I am outraged by this event. Did you happen to focus on the number of medications that are filled correctly everyday? Did you focus on the fact that pharmacists catch dosing errors, medication allergies, drug interactions, etc. all day long b/c most physicians aren’t aware of these things? No. And why Walgreens? Why not investigate CVS, Kroger, Wal-mart, Eckerd, etc.? Do pharmacists at these chains not make mistakes? This is completely unprofessional on the part of 20/20 and ABC.
 
Posted by: Jeremy | April 15, 2007, 12:47 am 12:47 am
 
This is the one point everyone needs to remember: ABC took 100 scripts from 100 pharmacies in their case study. Walgreens has thousands of pharmacies that each fill on average thousands of scripts a day. If they find 3 scripts that are not perfect out of 100, that is pretty near perfect. People here have said they would rather go to a“mom and pop”type pharmacy instead of retail. It’s the“mom and pop”type pharmacies that get to run it however they want. Pharmacies like Walgreens are run with standards and practices that the other pharmacies don’t have to. If you want the real and consistant type service, you want Walgreens.
 
Posted by: Justin Roberts | April 16, 2007, 3:54 am 3:54 am
 
Well First let me say this. Those folks who think they can walk into a pharmacy and demand that us techs and pharmacist give them there prescription in 2 minutes should not expect perfection. I can not understand why people will wait 4 hours in doctors office and them come to the pharmacy and want it in 20 seconds. I would love to tell you people what you can do with the prescription but i cant. I work in a chain pharmacy and i hate it because of yall!!!!!! You expect us to be like burger king, have it your way….WRONG! We do the best we can as fast as we can but our main goal is to do it accuratley. YOU PEOPLE DONT WANT THAT!! YOU EXPECT THE IMPOSSIBLE AND GET MAD WHEN REALITY SLAPS YOU IN THE FACE. How many times do you holler at your doctor for the wait? WHen the doctor writes a script and you cant read it and we cant read it why do you get mad at us? WE DIDNT WRITE THE SCRIPT DID WE? Yes its horrible what happened at that walgreens and nothing can excuse the fact that a mistake happened. HOWEVER, UNTIL YOU PUT YOUR SELF IN THE PHARMACY TO SEE WHAT GOES ON, AND WATCHING 20/20 DOES NOT COUNT, YOU SHOULD NOT JUDGE ANYBODY!!!!!

Us pharmacists need to stand up for ourselves and not be bullied by IMPATIENT, DEMANDING customers, and Corporate GREED monsters who demand us to fill hundreds of prescriptions a day with promises of prescriptions out in 10 minutes or less. Many times we are understaffed with NO LUNCH BREAK AND BARELY ENOUGH TIME FOR A BATHROOM BREAK! It’s no wonder mistakes happen! Don’t blame the pharmacist…we are overworked and underappreciated! Customers rush us to get prescriptions out in 2 minutes and wonder why there are mistakes!? It doesn’t make sense. What I really love are people who will wait hours at a MD office for a Paid doctors visit but can’t wait 30 seconds for FREE advice from a pharmacist…it’s gotten to be ridiculous. I had a customer give me a dirty look b/c I had to excuse myself to the restroom while she was waiting for her prescription. Little did she know I had gone almost 8 hours before taking that bathroom break…people are animals. Enough said.

You know what i find interesting…if you look at the other stories on this website, most of them dont even come close in number of respondances. Usually its just a few ppl taking the time to put down what they think. yet this one has Pages of people’s thoughts and opinions and yet nothing has been said about doing another-better informed- story on pharmacies. Very Interesting. how long can you ignore these voices ABC?

I had to have surgrey on my back last year. I was in the hospital 5 days, and my wife had my scripts filled at CVS. After 2 days I started to bleed out the staples in my back ( 50 of them were there ). I went back to the hospital and was told that I had a very bad infection that found its way to my bones. I showed the DR what I was taking, and 1 of the scripts was for a YEAST infection–that caused the problem I had. That pill that I was taking twice a day created a blood dis-order, that caused my infection. I spent 21 days in the hospital because I was given the wrong meds. I could have died. I blame no one—I just believe that that they are over worked and underpaid.
Lets take some money we are sending to Iraq and help get more people involved with Pharmacy work.
The man with the yeast infection !!

The pharmacy tech certification process is a joke,regardless of what anyone else says.For my State of Il.license,I filled out the form and paid a fee and received it in about a week.As far as the PTCB certification goes,I showed up one Saturday morning to take a test I never studied for and still managed to pass because they grade on such a huge curve.And yes I work for Walgreens.

As a state registered and Certified Pharmacy Technician I am disapointed by the reporting of this issue. While it is important to acknowledge the fact that errors occur, as they do in all areas of medicine, it is also extremely important to report on all sides of this issue.
As Anthony and others have pointed out, the“fast food”I want it now demand is a big part of the issue. With the volume that most pharmacies handle, it would be impossible for the pharmacist to handle all data entry and preparation of the prescriptions that they fill. The pharmacy technician is an absolutely crucial and under appreciated part of the pharmacy team. Pharmacists are lucky if they get a restroom break and with out the help of technicians, it would be impossible to fulfill the needs of the patients that we serve.
That being said, of course accuracy is the most important thing. The case in fla. has little to do with who preformed the data entry on the prescription. The pharmacist is responsible for double checking ALL prescriptions. The error was not caught and that is unfortunate, but to report that 16 year olds are dispensing medications is inaccurate and irresponsible. Pharmacists are dispensing medications.
The public can play a big role in improving pharmacy accuracy by not only educating themselves and ensuring that they know what the Dr. prescribed, but also by understanding the importance that time plays in achieving accuracy. Don’t complain about how long your prescription takes. Give us time to do the job right, and realize that it is something that requires concentration and addequite time to complete. Urge your state and the federal government to provide Pharmacists with trained assistants. Practice empathy when dealing with the staff at your pharmacy. Let them know that you understand the importance of what they are doing.

I am a registered pharmacist and can agree with those comments about how stressful the work environment is. Mistakes are never intentional but unfortunately they happen because we are human. That’s not an excuse, it’s just reality. Ultimately, it is the pharmacist’s responsibility to check the RX no matter who filled it. Everyone working in the pharmacy is basically working under the pharmacist’s license.
I was angered by a comment earlier from someone who would“guarantee the pharmacist only had a Bachelor degree and not a Pharm D.”A pharmacy bachelor degree is a 5 year degree and is certainly sufficient in retail pharmacy. Stating that every pharmacist must be required to get an“updated”degree is ignorant.

I am a store manager for Walgreens, and I have to honestly say that I regret having watched your report. I was shocked by the misleading information you aired, and even more disappointed at the way you portrayed Walgreens.You have misinformed the viewing public, and as far as I am concerend you have damaged completely the credibility of your show. I don’t see how I could ever again watch your show, and be confident that your reporting is/was fair, honest and balanced. I used to enjoy your show, and felt more informed afterward.Now, I can only view your program as entertainment value- similar to that of the National Enquirer.I am a firm believer of‘if the shoe fits, then wear it’but you sir dont seem to know the difference between a foot and a shoe. I had no idea that ABC News was in so much trouble with ratings that they would resort to the bogus tabloid route.

I have been trying to get legal help regarding a time when Walgreen pharmacy repeatedly gave me wrong medicine. I was pregnant. My only child lived to be 18 months old after she was born. The medication was so strong that I have suffered numerous stokes for days even while driving.
My family had to kick my house door in and they have found me unconscious.
To date, I feel so cheated because it appears that I have been trying to be heard, but no one will listen. Now, my speech is slurred, my balance is off, I have brain damage, and my life will never be the same.

The problem is massive, almost astronomical when considering the cost of human lives that it affects. It’s a chain of events and many can be blamed, not just one source. It’s a spectrum of errors, not just one. The health industry is complex, and the steps taken to prevent such tragic cases must be handled on a multi-level scale. Firstly, the doctors should take precautions when writing a precription ( a common error ) because they don’t take out enough time, or are over worked and simply over look the drug history of the patient or potential OCD’s can also have serious interactions. Then comes the pharmacist, who with the right education and high quality training should be the second part of this complex chain, and detect possible life altering or life threatening interactions. Now here is where the chief pharmacist should be held responsible for providing proper training to the pharmacist technicians. Another important area is of course the company itself. They should allow their workers with off-time, and while on the job, give them sufficient time to concentrate at what they are doing. The health industry is what every person depends on, and therefore such issues cannot be taken lightly by any party. Therefore quality assurance and control cannot be compromised at any cost. No one company is to blame, it must be the duty of every person working in the industry to realise the gravity of the situation. I feel this is a‘wake-up’report and should should make us aware as consumers, that errors happen, and we should also be aware not ignornant of what we put inside our bodies.

For those who are of the opinion that higher doses of anticoagulants could only further prevent a stroke:
Not all strokes are ischemic. The high-dose anticoagulant taken by the patient would increase her risk of having a hemorrhagic stroke.
I am currently on rotations working towards my Pharm.D. I have worked at Walgreens for over 6 years and was hired at the age of 16. If a college degree was required to work as a pharmacy technician, I would currently be deemed unqualified…

all i have to say is ive been in the pharmacy business for a little over a year but i take my job VERY serious and i am ABSOLUTELY careful and cautious of every little thing i do in the pharmacy where i work…everyone knows that everyone makes mistakes but in this business when there are people’s lives at stake there are no room for mistakes.i do have to say i have made some but none were life threatening…i always double sometimes triple count and check anything and everthing that i do that is concerning a medication that i fill and even check my fellow employees as well as the supervising pharmacists because needless to say that the supervising pharmasists where i work have made plenty of mistakes that are definetly not excuseable and most of the time they are lucky because i am the person that cathces the mistakes so it never makes it to the customer/patient to actually harm them. unfortunatletly i cant be there 24/7 to watch over everyone and do everything as much as my boss would like me too if he could believe me he would but he definetly doesnt pay me enough to do what i do..but point being i feel that a pharmacy technician can do just as good if not better than a pharmacist ..anyone can for that matter as long as they are cautious and actually care about making sure that their customers and patients are safe with no question what so ever.of course plenty of training needs to be done along with alot of studying, researching, schooling,and all the information to actually know everything that a pharmacist knows but i am just as capable as filling and checking prescriptions, i just dont have the degree and definitly not the $100,000 income each year and i would still like to know a lot more there is to know about medicine so that i can be able to answer ANY question that was asked of me. many people do ask me plenty of questions that i am not sure of how to answer so being a responsible person i ask a supervising pharmacist because i definitly do not want to give any false information to anybody that could possibly harm them at all. but i would like to be able to answer them myself with no help from anyone else but my own brain and knowledge. i learn new things every day and i am very greatful for that because i did also graduate a half year earlier than my class with honors and i believe myself to be a smart person and i always like to learn new things especially things that are helpful in life and things that can possibly save someone oneday or everyday. i like to believe myself to be one of the best pharmacy technicians because i feel like i do more work than is actuallly described in my profession and i have better than great customer service qualities and i remember about 90-95% of everyone who walks into the pharmacy where i work and we do an average of 200-400 prescriptions everyday. i am very friendly and people love me. many customers call and ask to talk to me rather than the pharmacist because they trust me more with their prescriptions and that makes me feel so wonderful to make people feel that way about me.ive gotten presents from my customers on holidays and ive only known them for maybe months at times .its really great i love my job i just get very frustrated with my boss at times because i dont believe he appreciates the work that i do for him and it is way more than any tech probably ever does. he never shows thanks by even saying thank you and im only making 8.25 an hour. he wont pay me overtime and im lucky if i get a lunch or a 5min break because i am so busy with everything. i work more than 80 hours every 2 weeks and i get one day off a week. i live, sleep, and breath that place. ive never called in for an actual day off to myself, there was jsut one saturday a 3hr day that i had a 24hr bug and my face was in the toilet i was so sick i had to have my boyfriend call in for me, and an hour later tried to go in just because i felt bad but i got up and had to lay back down because i was so dizzy i thought i was going to fall over. i have been thinking about goin into pharmacy school to become a pharmacist. i am 20 years old as of now and i would like to have at least one child before i turn 25 and i know school would take longer than that ..im not looking forward to the schooling but i know it would be good and intellengent for me to go. my boyfriend keeps trying to talk me into it because he knows what a great pharmacist i would be and believe me i could give you my word that i would live up to any expectation that a pharmacist should have. i would do it not just becausue i could make a great life for my family and myself but i would make a difference on the people that get prescriptions. everyone should feel comfortable and safe with there pharmacist because really their lives are in their hands becasue one wrong pill could really hurt someone and even kill someone. so jsut to ease hopefully many minds i just wanted to let everyone know that i have everyones best interest at heart and in my hands and i ALWAYS make sure that no mistakes are made by mine and i try my best to avoid any mistakes that are made by my supervising pharmacists and any other fellow emplyees of mine so that nobody gets sick, hurt or otherwise. but i cant be everywhere so also just make sure that, even though you shouldnt have to, always check your prescriptions and if you have ANY questions ALWAYS ask because you ALWAYS want to be positive and there are no stupid questions, so if you have any doubt always double check it never hurts okay. i wish there were more people like me but unfortunatly there isnt so good luck to everyone and hopefully you can find a loyal and trustworthy person to fill your prescriptions. thank you all for taking the time (if you did) to read my comments becasue i know i can talk a lot but that is who i am and i am a wonderful person and love to help anyone that i can whenever i can especially when they are appreciative and understanding and even when they are not because in my book everyone deserves a chance. -katie

The ultimate blame is on the pharmacist, because he is completely responsible for every chemical agent that leaves that pharmacy (including over-the-counter drugs) and their safe use in the patient. However…retail pharmacy is viewed by the lay public as being a McDonalds like atmosphere where one simply exchanges a piece of paper for a product, and that the transaction should take place IMMEDIATELY. As a pharmacy student, let me say that the actual task of manually filling the prescription and dispensing it is the least of the entire process that occurs. Multiple times per day during my internship at Publix pharmacy I detected and resolved life-threatening problems and issues with a patient’s prescription that, had we simply“put pills in a bottle”as was dictated by the prescription, then that person would have been harmed or killed. All-the-while the patient was irritated because it was“taking more than 10 minutes,”even though I was taking the time to call her physician to alert them of the problem and suggest alternatives. So what I’m saying is that the public needs to WAKE UP and realize that public pharmacists are not pez dispensers, and that their doctoral education is being put to use to keep YOU, AS THE PATIENT, SAFE and in good health.
