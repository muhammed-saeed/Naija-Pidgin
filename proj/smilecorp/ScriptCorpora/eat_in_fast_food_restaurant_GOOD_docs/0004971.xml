Improve Retail Sales by Pumping Up the Right Music

 By Lance Winslow 
 
We all know that retailers use music to get us into a buying type of mood. The retail industry knows this works, and consumers are pretty aware of it also. And yet we allow our impulses to go into hyper-drive and we make purchases that later we wish we hadn&apos;t and we wonder why we were so naive or were not thinking logical about it. The reality is that the music they use, and the tempo in place has an effect on our brains.

Have you ever been in a coffee shop or a fast food restaurant where the music was less than comfortable? There is a reason why, they play a certain type of music that puts you in a certain type of mood, one which actually makes you want to leave. There is a method to their madness, because they want to turn tables. They want you to leave the place, so other people can come, buy something, and sit down.

If everyone came into a coffee shop and they loved the music, they would sit there all day and never leave taking up all the tables and space, and yet, they only purchased one cup of coffee. Not long ago, many coffee shops in New York City stopped allowing people to come in and use their computer WiFi system for more than an hour for free, because the people would come in and buy the smallest cup of coffee and sit there all day.

They would actually use more electricity, and the free air conditioning and take up a table making it difficult for other customers to come in and sit down. They also modified the music, and guess what all the people with their laptops stopped coming in, and no one stays longer than 20 minutes now. Problem solved, for them.
