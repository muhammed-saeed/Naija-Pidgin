 Limited expectations yield only limited results. 
Susan Laurson Willig as quoted by Mark Shapiro at http://irascibleprofessor.com/comments-03-04-04.htm   

 To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to
educate a menace to society.  
Theodore Roosevelt as quoted recently in an email message from Ceil Pillsbury 

 Especially a neighbor with perpetually barking dogs.
 It is easier to love humanity as a whole than to love
one&apos;s neighbor.
 Eric

 A Woman in Georgia was once sentenced for seven years after taking a chair
from the porch of a vacant house.
The Association of Defense Lawyers wrote the following in a lobbying letter --- http://snipurl.com/DefenseLawyers  
 Note that a $1 million theft may ultimately get you
41-51 months. 
 
 The incremental increases in offense levels at the
 higher end of the consolidated theft and fraud table instituted via the ECP
 significantly exceed those of their previous separate tables. For example, a
 $1 million loss in year 2000, even with application of the more than minimal
 planning offense characteristic, would result in a 30-37 month sentencing
 range; in contrast, the same offender after the implementation of the ECP loss
 tables is subject to a 41-51 month range, an approximately 25% increase. Thus,
 the upward trend will accelerate over the next few years as the sentence
 increases built into the ECP begin to take effect.

 Granted, there are a few parents who support the
school&apos;s endeavor to provide a rigorous, challenging curriculum. Unfortunately,
these parents are few and far between. In over ten years of teaching high school
in California, I have encountered two or three such parents. Most parents of
high school students, however, appear to believe that their proper role is to
defend their children against the school.

 On
 the 100 th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Seuss, it seems fitting
 to revisit his insight into peer review and the Public Company Accounting
 Oversight Board: 

 Oh,
 the jobs people work at!
Out west, near Hawtch-Hawtch,
theres a Hawtch-Hawtcher Bee-Watcher.
His job is to watch...
is to keep both his eyes on the lazy town bee.
A bee that is watched will work harder, you see.

Well...he watched and he watched.
But, in spite of his watch,
that bee didnt work any harder. Not Mawtch.

So somebody said,
Our old-bee-watching man
just isnt bee-watching as hard as he can.
He ought to be watched by another Hawtch-Hawtcher!
The thing that we need
is a Bee-Watcher-Watcher!

WELL...

The Bee-Watcher-Watcher watched the Bee-Watcher.
He didnt watch well. So another Hawtch-Hawtcher
had to come in as a Watch-Watcher-Watcher!
And today all the Hawtchers who live in Hawtch-Hawtch
are watching on Watch-Watcher-Watchering-Watch,
Watch-Watching the Watcher whos watching the bee.
Youre not a Hawtch-Watcher. Youre lucky, you see!

Of course the huge problem is that Internet links get broken quite often. It is very important to give other details such as the name and address of the
authors, journal reference specifics, publisher address, etc.  

 

 A major problem arises when they are
permanently deleted to create storage space on the server for newer items. 

 

 A major problem arises when the path
to a particular document is changed without providing a new path at the old
site. 

 

 A major problem, especially in Bob
Jensen&apos;s Web documents, is that the link may be the same but the content is
being continuously updated and otherwise revised.

 There is an enormous problem of assuming that students who
wrote high evaluations of any course actually learned more than high performing
students who hated the course. Happiness and learning are two different
things. 

 Reasons why students often prefer online courses may have
little or nothing to do with actual learning. At the University of North
Texas where students can sometimes choose between an onsite or an online section
of a course, some students just preferred to be able to take a course in their
pajamas --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#NorthTexas  
Some off-campus students prefer to avoid the hassle and time consumed driving to
campus and spending a huge amount of time searching for parking. Some
Mexico City students claim that they can save over five hours a day in commuting
time, which is time made free for studying (Jim Parnell, Texas A&amp;M, in
partnership with Monterrey Tech, deliver an ALN Web MBA Program in Mexico City)
--- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/0000start.htm   

 In general, comparisons of onsite versus online test and
grade performance will tend to show&quot;no differences&quot;among good
students, because good students learn the material under varying circumstances. Differences are more noteworthy in weaker students or students who tend to drop
courses, but there is a huge instructor effect that is difficult to factor out
of such studies. For more on this, go to http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm   

 Online Learning Styles 

 Here are a few links
of possible interest with regard to student evaluations and online learning
styles.   In some cases you may have
to contact the presenters to get copies of their papers. 

 Probably the best place to start is with the Journal
 of Asynchronous Learning --- http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/index.asp 

 For example, one of
the archived articles is entitled&quot;Identifying Student Attitudes and
Learning Styles in Distance Education&quot;in the September 2001 edition --- http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/v5n2/v5n2_valenta.asp 
 
 Three opinion types were identified in this study:
 Students who identified with issues of Time and Structure in Learning, Social
 Interaction in Learning, and Convenience in Learning. These opinions can be
 used to aid educators in reaching their students and increasing the
 effectiveness of their online courses. At UIC, this insight had direct
 application to the evolution of course materials. Early application of
 technology merely supplied a web site on which were posted syllabus, readings
 and assignments. No opportunity existed for conferencing; thus, there existed
 no opportunity for social learning. In a subsequent semester, conferencing
 software was made available to the class, in addition to the website. Thus,
 the opportunity was added for social learning. The faculty learned, however,
 that every time a new technology was added, it experienced an increase in the
 level of effort necessary to support the student. Ultimately, the University
 made available a course management system, which significantly streamlined the
 effort on the part of faculty to make course materials available to the
 student. The system provides through a single URL the student&apos;s access to
 course materials, discussion forums, virtual groups and chat, testing, grades,
 and electronic communication. 

 This study is qualitative and confined to University
 of Illinois at Chicago graduate and undergraduate students. The three opinion
 types identified through this study, however, correlate closely with results
 reported in the literature. All three groups of students, representing the
 three opinion types, shared a belief in the importance of being able to work
 at home. The studies of Richards and Ridley [9] and Hiltz [10] described
 flexibility and convenience as both reasons students enrolled in online
 courses and as the perception of students once enrolled. On the other hand,
 all three groups of students thought unimportant the need to pay home phone
 bills incurred in online education, whereas Bee [13] found that students felt
 the university should provide financial assistance to offset the associated
 costs of going online. There is evidence in the literature (viz., studies by
 Guernsey [8] and Larson [18]) that support the opinion identified in this
 study of the need by some students for face-to-face interaction. Since none of
 the students taking the Q-sort had ever taken an online course, they were
 unaware of the opportunities provided by technology [8,10] to potentially
 increase individual attention from instructors above that normal in
 face-to-face course offerings. Since no post-enrollment Q-sorts were
 administered, there was no way to tell whether students continued to hold that
 opinion, or whether that opinion has changed. It is anticipated that even if
 the Q-set were administered to a larger number of students, similar viewpoints
 would still emerge. 

 The authors wondered whether there was an association
 between the opinion set held by the student and his or her learning style.
 Preliminary data using the Canfield Learning Styles Inventory [27] show that
 the factor one group--Time and Structure in Learning--exhibited a much higher
 than expected proportion of independent learners. (74% of the students who had
 high factor loadings on factor one were also classified as independent
 learners. This difference was significant Z = 3.00, p&lt;.025.) One might be
 tempted to hypothesize a relationship between being an independent learner and
 having the time and structure opinion of technology and education. Similarly,
 one might also expect that individuals who had high factor loadings for factor
 two (Social Factors in Learning) would be more likely classified as social
 learners. Further research is necessary to understand how learning styles
 contribute to the experience of online education. 

 There is a movement in both education and business to
 harness the power of the World Wide Web to disseminate information. Educators
 and researchers, aware of this technological paradigm shift, must become
 invested in understanding the interactions of students and computing. The
 field of human-computer interface design, as applied to interaction of
 students in online courses, is ripe for research in the area of building
 better virtual learning communities (thus addressing the needs of the social
 learner) without overwhelming the ability of the independent learner to excel
 on his or her own.

   &quot;How Do People Learn,&quot; Sloan-C Review , February 2004 --- http://www.aln.org/publications/view/v3n2/coverv3n2.htm 
 Like some of the
 other well known cognitive and affective taxonomies, the Kolb figure
 illustrates a range of interrelated learning activities and styles beneficial
 to novices and experts. Designed to emphasize reflection on learners
 experiences, and progressive conceptualization and active experimentation,
 this kind of environment is congruent with the aim of lifelong learning. Randy
 Garrison points out that: 
 
 From a content
 perspective, the key is not to inundate students with information. The first
 responsibility of the teacher or content expert is to identify the central
 idea and have students reflect upon and share their conceptions. Students
 need to be hooked on a big idea if learners are to be motivated to be
 reflective and self-directed in constructing meaning. Inundating learners
 with information is discouraging and is not consistent with higher order
 learning . . . Inappropriate assessment and excessive information will
 seriously undermine reflection and the effectiveness of asynchronous
 learning.  
 
 Reflection on a big
 question is amplified when it enters collaborative inquiry, as multiple styles
 and approaches interact to respond to the challenge and create solutions. In
 How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, John Bransford and
 colleagues describe a legacy cycle for collaborative inquiry, depicted in a
 figure by Vanderbilt University researchers (see image, lower left).

 From MIT&apos;s Emerging Technologies on March 10, 2004 

 
 
 Productivity&apos;s
Technology Iceberg 
Productivity may be economists&apos; single most important statistic. Productivity
determines the ultimate success of companies; it is the source of the wealth of
nations; and it is the key to our standard of living. From the 1970s into the
1990s, U.S. labor productivity grew by barely 1.4 percent a year. Many
economists thought it would be stuck at that level forever. Fortunately, the
growth rate jumped to more than 2.5 percent in 1995 and has averaged more than 4
percent since 2001. MIT productivity expert Erik Brynjolfsson writes that this
boom is rooted in a revolution in the way American companies apply information
technology. However, he warns, organizations that sit back and waitassuming
that technology alone will quickly or automatically introduce gainsare
setting themselves up for failure.

 Everyone
 Guns for Google 

Microsoft ( MSFT ) has already made it known that it&apos;s planning to invest massively to build
 its own search engine. It has even started hiring key personnel from
 Overture, among other places. Yahoo! ( YHOO ) is doing the same, having snapped up Overture as well key assets of search
 companies AltaVista and FAST.

However, a new wave of startups is also taking aim at Google -- as well as
 at Yahoo, the two search leaders (see BW Online, 12/16/03, &quot;Google
 Here, There, and Everywhere&quot; ). Kanoodle provides paid-search
 placement technology that it claims is better than Google&apos;s or Overture&apos;s.
 Groxis, a search tool that works as a desktop application, has just launched
 with Google clearly in its sights. Vivante, a new entrant aimed at giving
 surfers better geographically specific search capabilities, is tuning up for
 battle. And Ask Jeeves has improved up its Teoma search engine to the point
 where it&apos;s a very solid Google competitor.

More competition is on the way as venture capitalists are throwing money at
 search startups. That&apos;s no surprise, considering the eye-popping $15 billion
 pre-IPO valuation that Google-watchers are placing on the company. Google is
 a tempting target, and it&apos;ll draw an increasing number of competitors in the
 coming year.

 Your Cable Company Is Your Phone Company 

The Baby Bells that provide local phone service to most of America are in a
 nasty fix. They rely on old-style phone technology for the majority of their
 revenues. Yet Americans will begin cutting that local cord in droves in
 2004. Instead, they&apos;ll opt for wireless phones or Internet-based calling
 (known as voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP). Wireless number
 portability now lets mobile customers take their number from plan to plan,
 making cell phones far more attractive as a full-time replacement for land
 lines.

At the same time, VoIP has soared in quality. And a host of cable and big
 long-distance companies are set to offer it to tens of millions of local
 customers. To fight back, the Bells are going to have spend big bucks to
 further upgrade their already outdated DSL broadband networks. To date,
 they&apos;ve spent close to the bare minimum to compete with cable.

Now the moment of truth is coming, and if they don&apos;t improve their networks
 enough to deliver, say, a viable video service, they&apos;ll be toast. Otherwise,
 they&apos;ll have to somehow support an incredibly expensive legacy network
 mainly by selling Internet access, a service that&apos;s rapidly becoming a
 near-freebie offering from competitors.

 Wi-Fi: Wait Til Next Year 

Everyone expects 2004 to be the year that Wi-Fi finally hits the mainstream.
 Intel ( INTC ) is busily building Wi-Fi into every laptop it makes. And announcements of
 public Wi-Fi hotspot networks are coming fast and furious.

Too bad it&apos;s still a technology not quite ready for prime time. Installing
 Wi-Fi nodes at home remains a big problem because configuration isn&apos;t always
 intuitive, and many people get frustrated with what they thought would be a
 plug-and-play system. Also, they have concerns about the security of data
 passing over wireless networks, and setting up even the most basic security
 isn&apos;t as easy as it should be.

What&apos;s more, services offering hotspot networks for paying subscribers are
 still glitchy at best and totally awful at worst. All of these things should
 improve quickly as phone companies and wireless providers roll out their
 networks and slowly start to work out the same problems that originally
 plagued DSL access when it launched in the late 1990s. But if you&apos;re
 expecting 2004 to be the year of Wi-Fi, you&apos;ll be in for a disappointment.

 The International Digital Divide Shrinks 

In December, the U.N. held its first annual Internet Summit in Geneva. The
 event drew 12,000 attendees from 150 nations. The main goal was to discuss
 the Net&apos;s future governance and how the developed world could help the
 developing world close the digital divide.

Many delegates had beefs with how the U.S. now dominates Internet
 governance. Others proposed that the developed world set up funds to assist
 poorer countries in getting wired. But on the eve of the summit, the
 International Telecommunications Union released its first World
 Telecommunication Development Report, which examined Internet access and
 other communications trends -- and came up with some surprising results.

Most important: that the digital divide in the developing world has been
 grossly overstated. The study found that Net usage in Lima, Peru, alone
 actually eclipsed government estimates for usage in the entire country. And
 in Jamaica, user surveys pegged Net penetration at 23% of the population vs.
 the government&apos;s estimate of 5%. The discrepancies came from the complete
 lack of real research into this area. Governments had given estimates
 floated from headquarters with no field studies to back them up.

This points to the rapid disappearance of the digital divide in terms of
 barebones Internet access. In 2004 as the technologies that provide this
 access become cheaper and telecom and data transport costs remain very low,
 an increasing percentage of the world&apos;s population will get a chance to at
 least surf the Web. Much of this will be driven by Internet cafs, a
 wonderful way to provide cheap access and distribute the costs of the
 computers and bandwidth.

None of this is to say developed nations shouldn&apos;t help erase what remains
 of divide even more quickly. But it&apos;s heartening that the Net&apos;s basic
 qualities have made it also totally adaptable for both the rich and the
 poor.

 And That&apos;s Not All... 

Of course, loads of other interesting things are in store for the Internet
 next year. Digital music downloads should hit the mainstream, while America
 Online ( TWX ) hits the
 skids due to the proliferation of low-cost dial-up Net access. Microsoft
 will likely struggle with more viruses. True, that&apos;s no revelation,
 but...expect the period between vulnerability revelation and malicious code
 that attacks it to shrink.

Here&apos;s one thing that&apos;s certain: The coming year will bring many more
 changes to the Internet compared to the past few years. That seems
 inevitable given how many more people will be using it, the key court cases
 coming down the pike that could affect it, and more capital investments and
 startups now looking at it as a rejuvenated source of income. Here&apos;s hoping
 that your 2004, both online and off, is a safe and healthy one. 
 
 
 &quot;Leading-Edge Technology
 Trends,&quot;by Peter Cohan, Financial Executive , March/April 2004,
 Page 70 
 
 Since March 2000, a change in the way
 technology is financed has changed the way it is bought and sold--money for
 technology is not&quot;free&quot;anymore. With cash scarce,
 companies are looking to squeeze more performance out of lower IT budgets. Technology vendors that offer cost-cutting tools--like VolP, Linux and
 outsourcing firms--are taking a growing share of these dwindling budgets. This dynamic will produce the following 12 technology trends through 2004: 

 Convergence of cable and telecom
 industry services.
 Targeting digital advertising to
 consumers who are skilled at avoiding it.
 Shakeout among medium-sized software
 companies.
 Pressure to squeeze higher
 performance from lower-cost IT infrastructure.
 Chine will continue to emerge as an
 important market for IT, but it must be approached cautiously.
 Spam avoidance as a major venture
 investment opportunity.
 Industry-wide focus on security.
 Linux as an emerging standard.
 Outsourcing IT will continue.
 IT suppliers will learn to sell
 products that solve real business problems and generate tangible
 investment returns.
 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
 is likely to fall short of the hype.
 Wi-Fi growth will continue. 
 
 &quot;Whither the Stock Option? by
Ira Kay, Financial Executive, March/April 2004, pp. 46-49 --- http://www.fei.org/mag/articles/3-2004_comp.cfm   
    While stock options
 lose more luster as executive motivators, compensation committees face
 challenges, including selecting other forms of stock incentives. 
    During the late
 1990s, companies issued billions of dollars worth of stock options to
 motivate their employees. Those days are likely over, for a variety of
 reasons, including potential new rules requiring companies to expense them.
 But getting the best out of executives through other forms of stock
 incentives - including actual ownership - will no doubt continue, according
 to a recent study of executive compensation conducted by Watson Wyatt.

   Indeed, stock options&apos; best days may be behind them - not
 just because they will soon have to be expensed, but because institutional
 investors are increasingly worried about them. Moreover, there is perennial
 concern over perceptions of excessive CEO pay and disconnects between pay
 and performance. Finally, there is the crisis in governance created by
 corporate accounting standards and a gap between the cost and value of
 options created when a company&apos;s future accounting cost of stock options
 exceeds their value to employees.

   These factors do not appear to be lessening in importance
 and have already resulted in a huge drop in the value of options granted to
 employees. From 2001 to 2002, the value of stock option grants at major
 companies fell by 29 percent, from $139.6 billion to $99.6 billion.

   When data for 2003 becomes available, it will likely show
 a further decline of 10 percent to 15 percent from 2002. The magnitude of
 this drop cannot be overstated: the only other event in the history of
 executive compensation as important is the sharp increase in executive pay
 levels that took place during the 1990s. However, the recent bull market has
 softened this trend, as 2004 values are expected to be up from 2003.

   Some analysts believe that the decline in option value was
 caused entirely by stock price declines - for example, a company granting
 one million stock options at $30 in 2001 and one million at $20 in 2002.
 Other things being equal, their value would have declined by 33 percent,
 solely due to stock price movement. But this is not what happened. In fact,
 declines in both stock price and the number of stock options granted are
 responsible.

   For the average company, the 29 percent total decline in
 stock options value cited above came about as a result of a 20 percent
 decline in the average number of stock options granted to all employees,
 from 7.6 million to 6.1 million, and a 16 percent decline in the average
 value per option, from $17.25 to $14.50, almost entirely due to stock prices
 falling. 
 Options
 Reflected in Stock Prices
 
   Consistent with findings in a prior study, investors
 consider stock option expenses as real expenses, even if reported only in
 the footnotes. As expected for a bear market year, the relationship was
 negative: those with the highest option expenses in 2002 had the lowest
 total returns to shareholders (stock price appreciation plus dividends).
 Dividing up the 998 major companies in the recent Watson Wyatt study into
 three groups, the companies with the lowest option expenses - those with a
 2002 expense of $266 per employee - had total return of negative 4.3
 percent. Those in the highest expense group, with a 2002 expense of $3,997
 per employee, had a total return of negative 12.4 percent. 
 Pay and
 Performance Linked 
 
   Another important finding is that pay and performance are
 strongly linked. Analysis shows a strong, positive relationship between
 company performance and executive compensation levels. For example,
 companies whose CEOs had higher total pay opportunities from 1998 to 2002,
 as measured by their total direct compensation over the five years, had
 higher total returns to shareholders during the period than those with CEOs
 having lower pay opportunities. The relationship between pay and performance
 is apparent in other measures as well: 
 Annual increases in a CEO&apos;s total cash
 compensation are positively related to the company&apos;s stock performance. CEOs of companies that performed below a
 one-year total return to shareholders median had a decline in actual pay
 and stock option profits in 2002. Companies having CEOs with high stock ownership
 were superior investments compared to those with low ownership.
 Companies with high CEO ownership realized a three-year median total
 return of 3.9 percent for their shareholders for the period ending
 December 2002, while low CEO ownership companies saw a return of
 negative 3.4 percent on their investment during the period. Investors are willing to pay a premium for
 companies where senior management and shareholder interests are aligned. 

 Stock Option
 Overhang Declining
 
   Stock option overhang has continued to grow - despite
 efforts by a large number of firms to reduce their overhang levels between
 2001 and 2002 - primarily from a large reduction in the amount of options
 being exercised. Stock option overhang is a measure of potential dilution
 from granted and approved stock option programs (calculated as options
 granted and outstanding, plus shares that remain to be granted, expressed as
 a percentage of total shares outstanding). The average stock option overhang
 increased one-half percentage point over the average of the same time last
 year - from 15.6 percent in 2001 to 16.1 percent in 2002 for companies with
 December 2002 year-ends.

   However, there is strong evidence of a decline in the
 growth rate of overhang during this same period. Between 1997 and 1999,
 overhang levels increased at an annual rate of 11.8 percent, while growth
 slowed to 7.9 percent between 1999 and 2002. Moreover, the earlier growth
 occurred as a result of larger option grants and more extensive programs
 covering more employees during a bull market. The current increase can be
 attributed to fewer options being exercised as they are increasingly out of
 the money (worth more than the current price of the stock), due to declining
 share prices without an offsetting decline in new share authorizations.

   There are substantial differences in overhang levels by
 industry (see Figure 2). Technology and health care firms have consistently
 exhibited higher overhang levels than other industries, while utilities have
 exhibited the lowest levels of overhang. This is consistent with economic
 theory, which predicts that stock-based incentive compensation is more
 important in industries with a high share of value derived from intellectual
 property.

   The study also found that firms with higher overhang
 levels have more options outstanding and higher run rates (a measure of
 shares granted annually to employees, which are calculated as options
 granted and expressed as a percentage of total shares outstanding).

 &quot;Equity Compensation: The Future Is Now,&quot; by Blair N. Jones
 and Jesse Purewal, Financial Executive , March/April 2004 --- http://www.fei.org/mag/Exclusives/3-04.cfm   
 
 In lieu of simply replacing stock options with
 the next &apos;big thing,&apos; two consultants say companies have an opportunity to
 strategically rethink their approach to equity compensation. 

 Although the spate of corporate
 scandals and accompanying backlash on stock options are seemingly starting
 to recede, changes resulting from these events are just now taking hold as
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) moves ahead with issuing new
 rulings on stock option accounting. 
 A number of high-profile companies
 as diverse as Microsoft Corp., Kraft Foods Inc., Progressive Casualty
 Insurance Co. and Amazon.com Inc. have replaced at least some stock option
 grants with restricted stock. Dilution caused by large stock option grants,
 the egregious behavior of a few executives who allowed short-term stock
 price to serve as the hallmark of success and tighter corporate governance
 requirements for shareholder votes (loss of the broker vote), have made new
 equity authorizations less of a sure thing. 
 The implication of these events is
 that board compensation committees and management teams have had to start
 with a clean slate when designing long-term incentive strategies. But,
 therein lies an opportunity: Rather than simply basing changes and
 adjustments to equity plans on accounting considerations and stock
 performance, companies now have an chance to strategically rethink their
 approaches to equity compensation. Which begs the question: Are companies
 doing so in a thoughtful manner, or simply acting like lemmings by chasing
 the&quot;next big thing&quot;to replace stock options? 
 Before answering that question, it
 is important to consider the changes companies have already begun making to
 their stock option and other equity incentive programs over the last two
 years. For the most part, companies have responded to the stock option
 backlash by making some changes to stock option programs, but not by
 eliminating stock options altogether. According to a September 2003 survey
 of 336 publicly traded U.S. companies, conducted by Sibson Consulting and
 WorldatWork, the prior 18 months had seen companies make changes to the size
 and mechanics of stock option grants, including vesting, terms and the
 timing and frequency of grants. These changes have occurred primarily in
 response to shareholder concerns, accounting scandals and internal concerns
 about the company&apos;s ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. This
 survey was a follow up to a similar Sibson/WorldatWork survey conducted in
 March 2002. A comparison of both surveys&apos; findings provides insight into the
 direction these changes are taking. 
 Fewer stock options for lower
 levels. Any discussion of changes to stock option accounting invariably
 raises concerns that reported earnings will suffer even if there is no
 change in company performance. Associated with this concern is the warning
 issued by some opponents of stock option expensing that an accounting change
 will cause companies to reduce or rescind stock option awards to lower-level
 employees, thereby hurting certain segments of the workforce more than
 others. So far, that warning is proving to be prescient. Changes to stock
 option plans are primarily affecting lower-level employees, according to the
 both the 2002 and 2003 surveys. 
 Eligibility for stock options
 decline at lower levels. While eligibility remains largely unchanged for
 employees at the professional level and above, employees below that level
 saw eligibility decline. For example, two thirds of sales staff were
 eligible for stock options in 2002, but only half were eligible in 2003.
 Eligibility among nonexempt employees fell from 37 percent in 2002 to 27
 percent in 2003. Additionally, the survey found that the value of stock
 option grants over the 18-month period of March 2002 to September 2003
 decreased more for non-exempt employees than for any other group. 
 Restricted stock on the rise. With stock options losing appeal, companies are looking for alternative
 equity-based incentive vehicles. Enter restricted stock. More companies use
 or plan to use restricted stock than any other vehicle to replace or
 supplement stock options. Approximately 60 percent of companies responding
 to the survey plan to grant restricted stock by September 2004, and more
 than 40 percent have already established restricted stock as a component of
 compensation for at least some employees. (See box at the end,&quot;Restricted Stock: Caveat Emptor,&quot;for cautions about this trend.) 
 Performance counts. Companies are taking steps to tie stock option eligibility more strongly to
 company performance and evidence of value creation. The survey found that 28
 percent of companies now use group, unit or company performance to determine
 stock option eligibility, compared to 17 percent in the earlier survey. 
 Stock option effectiveness still
 a question mark.   
 Despite changes in programs,
 companies still struggle to achieve their key goals for stock option plans.
 A majority of respondents report that their plans are only moderately
 effective at helping to achieve key objectives such as attracting and
 retaining talent, focusing employee attention on corporate performance and
 aligning shareholder and employee interests. Even so, equity is still a
 compelling benefit to most employees. Sibson Consulting Group&apos;s 2003&quot;Rewards of Work&quot;study, which focused on the attitudes of 1,108
 workers about the&quot;deal&quot;between employer and employee, found that
 one fourth of workers who have not received stock options or grants in the
 prior 12 months would switch employers for just 40 shares of a $10 stock.
 Workers who had received stock options or grants in the prior 12 months were
 a little harder to entice but would still change employers in exchange for
 100 shares of the same value. 

 The future of
 incentives
 
To avoid the lemming syndrome, companies need to clearly define design
 objectives for long-term incentive plans. Few companies can depend on a
 single incentive vehicle to address all objectives, and simple tweaks to
 existing stock option plans are likely to be insufficient. A complementary
 plan or plans that focus on intermediate drivers of shareholder value may be
 in order. 
 If a new performance-based plan is
 to be introduced, financial executives will play a central role in
 identifying appropriate measures and goals for these plans. Performance
 measurement is at the heart of good long-term incentive design. Poorly
 chosen measures, at a minimum, can lead to a sub-optimal plan and, at worst,
 to significant unintended consequences. Well-chosen measures and goals can
 enhance organizational focus and lead to superior performance.

 Future
 wars will be fought over the issue of survival (especially with adverse
 weather) rather than religion, ideology or national
 honor. 
&quot;Key findings of the Pentagon,&quot; Guardian , February 22, 2004
 --- http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1153547,00.html   
 
 By 2007 violent
 storms smash coastal barriers rendering large parts of the Netherlands
 uninhabitable. Cities like The Hague are abandoned. In California the delta
 island levees in the Sacramento river area are breached, disrupting the
 aqueduct system transporting water from north to south. 
 Between
 2010 and 2020 Europe is hardest hit by climatic change with an average
 annual temperature drop of 6F. Climate in Britain becomes colder and
 drier as weather patterns begin to resemble Siberia. 
 Deaths
 from war and famine run into the millions until the planet&apos;s
 population is reduced by such an extent the Earth can cope. 
 Riots
 and internal conflict tear apart India, South Africa and Indonesia. 
 Access
 to water becomes a major battleground. The Nile, Danube and Amazon
 are all mentioned as being high risk. 
 A
 &apos;significant drop&apos; in the planet&apos;s ability to sustain its present population
 will become apparent over the next 20 years. 
 Rich
 areas like the US and Europe would become &apos;virtual fortresses&apos; to
 prevent millions of migrants from entering after being forced from land
 drowned by sea-level rise or no longer able to grow crops. Waves of
 boatpeople pose significant problems. 
 Nuclear
 arms proliferation is inevitable. Japan, South Korea, and Germany develop nuclear-weapons
 capabilities , as do Iran, Egypt and North Korea. Israel, China, India
 and Pakistan also are poised to use the bomb. 
 By
 2010 the US and Europe will experience a third more days with peak temperatures
 above 90F . Climate becomes an &apos;economic nuisance&apos; as storms, droughts
 and hot spells create havoc for farmers. 
 More
 than 400m people in subtropical regions at grave risk. 
 Europe
 will face huge internal struggles as it copes with massive numbers of
 migrants washing up on its shores. Immigrants from Scandinavia seek warmer
 climes to the south. Southern Europe is beleaguered by refugees from
 hard-hit countries in Africa. 
 Mega-droughts affect the world&apos;s major breadbaskets, including America&apos;s Midwest, where
 strong winds bring soil loss. China&apos;s
 huge population and food demand make it particularly vulnerable. Bangladesh becomes nearly uninhabitable because of a rising sea level, which
 contaminates the inland water supplies.

 So-called&quot;environmental
 accounting&quot;seems to have faded from glory, but I can&apos;t help but wonder
 what impact the following NASA findings may have in the long run: 

 http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/05mar_arctic.htm   

 Some speculate that your
 property on the French Riviera may shortly look like Bob&apos;s New England retreat
 in January. 

 I&apos;m still dismayed that no one
 has looked at the effect of&quot;pavement&quot;on the global climate. Anyone
 who has walked across a Florida (or Texas) parking lot in July, and then gone
 into the adjacent woods, can&apos;t help but wonder whether the&quot;pavement
 quotient&quot;is outstripping the&quot;greenhouse gasses&quot;effect in
 terms of warming things up. And then there are those maddening wastemongers
 who drive those huge gas-guzzling SUV&apos;s, which require not only more gas, but
 more pavement! (There was a local petition in our paper to enlarge parking
 spaces to accommodate the larger vehicles!) 

 I&apos;m going to spend my fall
 semester in Antwerp, Belgium. The preliminary orientation meetings have been
 eye-openers in terms of recognizing the wasteful practices of American
 culture. It&apos;s a wonder that the Europeans are still speaking to us. And if the
 NASA report is true ... 

 (Of course, I&apos;ve always taken
 these reports with a couple of grains of salt... is anybody on this list old
 enough to remember the&quot;Club of Rome&quot;and their book&quot;The
 Limits to Growth&quot;? giggle giggle...)

 &quot;SCO
Broadens Its Attack on Linux,&quot;by David Bank, The Wall Street Journal ,

 Suits Against AutoZone,
DaimlerChrysler Claim
Breach of Rights on Unix 
 SCO
 Group Inc. filed lawsuits against auto maker DaimlerChrysler AG and auto-parts retailer AutoZone Inc., broadening its legal attack on Linux to users of the popular operating
 system. 

 SCO, a
 software company based in Lindon, Utah, claims copyright ownership over the
 older Unix operating system, and contends that part of Linux violates those
 copyrights. The company already is in litigation with Linux vendors International
 Business Machines Corp. and Novell Inc., and said the new actions were the first of many against corporations
 that use the open-source software. 

 Darl
 McBride, SCO&apos;s chief executive, said he was taking a page from the playbook of
 the Recording Industry Association of America, which has filed more than 1,000
 lawsuits against computer users it claims illegally distributed music over the
 Internet. In a conference call, he said those suits highlighted the legal
 risks facing those computer users.&quot;We believe that the legal actions we
 have taken and will continue to take will have a similar impact on end users
 of Unix and Linux,&quot;he said. 

 The
 suit against Germany&apos;s DaimlerChrysler, filed in a Michigan state court,
 involves software license agreements that SCO says the auto maker signed for
 using Unix. In December, SCO sent DaimlerChrysler a letter demanding that it
 certify compliance with the license, including restrictions on the transfer of
 the underlying source code to Unix. SCO&apos;s suit doesn&apos;t allege such a transfer
 from Unix to Linux, but said DaimlerChrysler&apos;s failure to respond implies
 violations of the terms of the licenses.

 So-called&quot;environmental accounting&quot;seems

 I&apos;m still dismayed that no one has looked at the
 effect of&quot;pavement&quot;on the global climate. Anyone who has walked
 across a Florida (or Texas) parking lot in July, and then gone into the
 adjacent woods, can&apos;t help but wonder whether the&quot;pavement
 quotient&quot;is outstripping the&quot;greenhouse gasses&quot;effect in
 terms of warming things up. And then there are those maddening wastemongers
 who drive those huge gas-guzzling SUV&apos;s, which require not only more gas, but
 more pavement! (There was a local petition in our paper to enlarge parking
 spaces to accommodate the larger vehicles!) 

 I&apos;m going to spend my fall semester in Antwerp,
 Belgium. The preliminary orientation meetings have been eye-openers in terms
 of recognizing the wasteful practices of American culture. It&apos;s a wonder that
 the Europeans are still speaking to us. And if the NASA report is true ...

 &quot;Missed
Moments: Pitfalls of Buying A Digital Camera,&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The

 Like
 all high-tech products, digital cameras are described by a dense jargon of
 techno-babble, designed in part to confuse civilians and separate them from
 their money. As the cameras have soared in popularity, this terminology
 problem has actually grown worse. 

 So
 here&apos;s our first annual buyer&apos;s guide to digital cameras. It&apos;s a quick road
 map to the most important features to look for when buying a digital camera,
 and to the terminology sales people and&quot;experts&quot;are likely to hurl
 at you. 

 This
 guide is meant for average, casual photographers. If you are a photo hobbyist
 or enthusiast, you will likely want to consider many more features than these,
 and you may want to focus more on such traditional photographic issues as
 lenses and optics. This guide mainly focuses on the cameras&apos; basic digital
 characteristics.

 Honey, They Shrunk the Cameras 

 In tests of the newest crop of mini
digital cameras, it turns out that the best pictures came from the camera with
both the lowest price and the lowest megapixel rating, writes Walt. Go figure. 

 &quot;Honey,
They Shrunk the Cameras,&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal ,
February 18, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107706028702331957,00.html?mod=gadgets%5Fprimary%5Fhs%5Flt   
 
 In
 technology, as in the rest of life, numbers don&apos;t tell the whole story. When
 comparing digital cameras, you might expect that the best pictures would come
 from the most expensive models in any given class, or from the models with the
 highest megapixel rating -- a measure of maximum picture resolution. But it
 ain&apos;t necessarily so. 

 In
 fact, after testing four similar, name-brand digital cameras for this column,
 it turned out that the best pictures came from the camera with both the lowest
 price and the lowest megapixel rating. Go figure. 

 My
 assistant Katie Boehret and I tested four slim, lightweight digital cameras
 from Casio, Sony, Konica Minolta and Pentax. These are point-and-shoot models
 that are designed to be tiny enough to carry around in a pocket, while still
 capturing high-quality photographs. Each camera measures slightly larger than
 the size of a credit card and has a 3x optical zoom lens. 

 Whenever
 high-tech products get really small, their price tags get bigger, and these
 cameras are no exception. The least expensive of the four cameras goes for
 $300, while the most expensive costs a whopping $550. 

 Each is
 under an inch thick, but all have plenty of features to keep an amateur
 photographer happy. All can take short videos as well as still photos, and all
 have multiple shooting modes and flash settings. Two of our test cameras even
 boasted the hot new trend in digital cameras -- larger liquid-crystal-display
 screens that take up most of the camera&apos;s back side. 

 In our
 tests, I took mostly indoor photos with each camera at a favorite hangout of
 mine, my local cigar store. Katie snapped outdoor pictures of landscapes,
 monuments and people while wandering around Washington, D.C. 

 All
 four cameras took good pictures, and deciding which did best is necessarily a
 subjective judgment. But, after comparing similar pictures from the four
 cameras side by side on a computer screen, Katie and I consistently found the
 images from the low-end $299 Konica Minolta Dimage Xg to be the best overall. 
 
 The fast and easy way to print pictures, but the price at fifty to seventy cents
per picture is about double the price for online prints.  Newsweek recommended the Olymbus P-10 and the Sony PictureStation DPP-EX50 on Page 65,
February 23, 2004. Both models sell for under $200.

 Houses that make your coffee, lock your doors and
 even measure your health are closer than you think  

 As you pour the detergent into your last load of
 laundry, you realize the bottle is almost empty. But instead of making a
 mental note to add it to your grocery list, or running to the kitchen to
 scribble it down, you simply say out loud,&quot;Remember: Buy laundry
 detergent.&quot;The word&quot;remember&quot;is picked up by a microphone in
 the wall and triggers a computer to transcribe your words to your to-do list. 

 It might sound like a sci-fi vision of
 the future. But it&apos;s actually a project called Audio Notes, currently in the
 works at the Georgia Institute of Technology&apos;s 5,000-square-foot Aware Home, a
 combination house and laboratory in Atlanta where scientists are dreaming up
 futuristic housing technology. 

 &quot;I love that shopping list,&quot;says Eileen Lange, a 68-year-old retiree from Lithonia, Ga., who toured the
 house and tried out some of its projects last year. 

 Researchers and commercial labs around
 the country are building experimental homes to test technology that could make
 domestic life easier and extend the independence of older homeowners. Such
 efforts go beyond so-called universal design, a trend toward building houses
 with wider doorways, grab bars and adjustable kitchen cabinets that took off
 in the early 1990s. 

 &quot;These are lifestyle services
 empowered by a new generation of technology,&quot;says Joseph Coughlin,
 director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&apos;s AgeLab in Cambridge ( web.mit.edu/agelab/research/hnh.html ). 

 In many cases, the mechanics for the
 gizmos already exist -- mainly wireless sensors, cellphones, broadband access
 and home computers. What&apos;s been missing, and what researchers now are trying
 to develop, are ways to harness the hardware to run your entire house with
 little effort or technological savvy -- letting you turn up the heat remotely,
 anticipating when you want the lights on, or deciding automatically how long
 your food should cook.

 &quot;European Smart Phone Is Trim
and Sharp, But Poor on E-Mail,&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The Wall Street
Journal , March 4, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,personal_technology,00.html 
 
 In cellphones, as in so many other
 things, Europeans are different from Americans. I was reminded of this again
 last week in France, where I attended the world&apos;s biggest cellphone conference
 and exhibition, an event called the 3GSM World Congress. 

 What I saw at the show was an
 impressive display of cellphone features and designs. Many of these advances
 are unavailable in the U.S., where we have crippled our wireless phone system
 by failing to adopt a single transmission standard and by handing too much
 power to slow-moving wireless carriers. 

 The European cellphone industry is
 preparing for the widespread rollout later this year of so-called 3G phone
 networks, which will supposedly operate at broadband speeds. And the carriers
 and phone makers there were showing off various services they hope to sell
 over these networks. 

 At one booth, I was amazed to be able
 to carry on a perfect real-time video phone call, via a small cellphone, with
 a woman in Japan. At another, I was able to surf the Web almost as quickly and
 easily on a cellphone as on a networked PC at home. Numerous companies were
 showing advanced phones on which you could play games, and take and send
 photos and videos, at speeds and quality levels far exceeding what&apos;s available
 in the U.S. 

 Yet there is one aspect of wireless
 communications that the Europeans and Asians don&apos;t do as well as the North
 Americans -- the melding of a phone, an organizer and serious e-mail
 capabilities in a small, portable device. 

 U.S. and Canadian companies have
 produced two fine high-end smart phones that are also great e-mail devices:
 the Treo 600, from PalmOne, and the BlackBerry, from Research in Motion. A
 third combo gadget, the Danger Sidekick sold by T-Mobile, is also an excellent
 portable e-mail device, but it&apos;s too clumsy as a phone.

 Has Apple ( AAPL ) fallen back into a school daze? It sure seems that way from a recent series of

state of Michigan to tech giant Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ). These state programs, which seek to give every student a laptop and tightly
integrate the machines&apos; use into the curriculum, are seen as the holy grail of
the now stumbling K-12 education business. And the Michigan contract was the
proverbial mother lode. Worth $68 million over four years, it calls for HP to
provide laptops to as many as 132,000 middle-school students in the Wolverine
State.

 An Innovative Cookie Jar 

 The big question is whether Microsoft will adapt to StealthSurfer or
introduce a competitive product for Internet Explorer. My guess is no! We may have to install Netscape once again just to keep pesky cookies off the
main hard drive. 

 &quot;Furtive Surfers Find a Way to Keep Their Travels Secret,&quot;by
Howard Millman, The New York Times , March 4, 2004 --- http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/04/technology/circuits/04quie.html   
 
 A new thumb-size U.S.B. drive from a company called
 StealthSurfer aims to guard your privacy by keeping the records of your Web
 activity close to the vest. When you plug in the StealthSurfer and use its
 customized version of the Netscape browser, the device stores the cookies,
 U.R.L. history, cache files and other traces of your Web browsing that would
 ordinarily accumulate on your computer&apos;s hard drive. When you&apos;re done surfing,
 you unplug the drive and take the records of your travels with you. 

 StealthSurfer&apos;s name is a bit of an overstatement. It
 does keep your Web-hopping and file-sharing activities away from prying eyes
 after the fact. But since it uses your computer&apos;s Internet connection, the Web
 sites you visit can still track your Internet protocol address as you move
 around online. 

 The StealthSurfer comes in four capacities, ranging
 from 64 megabytes ($70) to 512 megabytes ($299). You may experience a slight
 reduction in performance when you use the device because its flash memory
 writes data at slower speeds than a full-size hard drive does. 

 On the other hand, installation is a breeze -
 computers running Windows Me, 2000 and XP recognize the StealthSurfer as a
 drive when it is plugged in. (If you&apos;re running Windows 98, you must download
 a driver

 Hi Deborah, 

 The AICPA has some standardized achievement tests at http://www.aicpa-eca.org/   

 You might be interested in the broader spectrum of the AICPA&apos;s resources for
educators at http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/career/edu/index.htm   

 Also see http://www.troyst.edu/sacs/selfstudyreport/chapter3.doc   

 Trinity University does not require uniform examinations at any level of the
program. In many ways standardized examinations are dysfunctional in that they
encourage faculty to&quot;teach to the tests&quot;rather than teach to
educate. We consider our main goal to be one of teaching students how to learn
rather than filling them with facts to be memorized. 

 The closest thing we come to standardized assessment is the performance of
our students on the CPA examination. Trinity&apos;s success in this regard is
generally at or near the top for the State of Texas. However, we don&apos;t take full
credit since most of our students take coaching courses such as the Becker
program of courses before they sit for the examination. Our success probably
lies more with the quality of students coming into our program than our teaching
toward the CPA examination.

 THE EDUCATIONAL COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT (ECA) WEB
 SITE IS LIVE ! http://www.aicpa-eca.org   
 
 Lanny Arvan&apos;s&quot;dialogic approach&quot;to Teaching and Learning. I think Amy Dunbar
has been using this approach for some time but just did not have a clever name
for it --- http://www.sba.uconn.edu/users/adunbar/genesis_of_an_online_course.pdf   

 Lanny Arvan is a veteran distance
education economics professor at the University of Illinois. I wrote about
him some years back when he was engaged in one of the most intensive control
group experimentation of performance and communication differences between live
(traditional) classes versus distance education classes taught by the same
instructor. He was one of the leaders in this expensive SCALE project
funded by the Sloan Foundation and the University of Illinois --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois   

 You can also read about and listen to
Dan Stone&apos;s evaluation of the SCALE experiment at http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/000cpe/00start.htm#2000   

 The SCALE program focused on 30 courses
from various departments (science, humanities, social sciences, economics, etc.)
over multiple years in which communication and performance was compared for
full-time resident students partitioned into sections that had a traditional
onsite course versus an online course from the same instructor in each
course. Lanny taught an intermediate microeconomics course and helped
supervise the entire SCALE program. He experimented over the years with
how to best handle distance education and achieved some amazing success with
what he learned. 

 The University of North Texas followed
the University of Illinois in allowing for selected courses to be taken by
full-time resident students either online or onsite in a traditional classroom
--- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#NorthTexas   

 Lanny just came out with a short
overview about what he discovered in his own &quot;dialogic approach&quot; experience
(although this article does not delve into the amazing results of the SCALE
program itself). 

 &quot;eLearning Dialogue: Dialogic Learning Objects: Inviting the Student Into the Instructional
Process,&quot;by Lanny Arvan, Syllabus News --- http://www.syllabus.com/news_article.asp?id=8949&amp;typeid=155    
 
 Arvan argues that properly
 employed, course management systems can change the model for teaching and
 learning in ways that engage students more and increase their learning. He offers the&quot;dialogic approach&quot;to using a
 question-answer-feedback cycle to accomplish this and provides sample files
 for reader experimentation. 

 Viewed from the
 vantage of the student, the typical instructor uses a course management system
 as a publicly accessible file drawer and little more. We know from the
 literature ( Faculty Use of Course Management Systems ; Morgan, 2003),
 and Student Satisfaction and Perceived Learning via a Course Management
 System ; Bielema, 2002) that the main CMS use is posting lecture notes and
 the syllabus. Perhaps this offers convenience over distributing notes
 through the copy shop, but does it have a fundamental effect on
 learning? How can we get beyond the&quot;lecture note phase&quot;and
 have instructors produce sites with interactivity, where there is an overt
 benefit to the learner, where the online part of the course complements the
 face-to-face part, and vice versa? 

 On most campuses,
 there are some exceptional course Web sites that are well regarded by the
 students and faculty alike. Nonetheless, the earlier adopter faculty who
 produce these well-done sites don&apos;t have the broad coattails that might help
 change overall campus behavior ( Interesting Practices and Best Systems in
 Faculty Engagement and Support ; Hagner, 2000). Many instructors who
 are not doing innovative online course development feel overburdened. A
 common concern, especially among those who have been teaching the same course
 for some time, is that what they are doing is stale. Their reading lists
 are not current, their assignments need to be redone (the fraternities and
 sororities have on file papers that received high marks on these assignments)
 and their own enthusiasm for teaching has waned as a consequence; it is hard
 for them to be straight-faced with the students when they are not proud of the
 content they teach. They see the need to re-invest in their course, but
 where do they find the time? 

 It seems incumbent on
 those of us who support educational technology to make the teaching and
 learning benefits more obvious to the typical instructor, and then help them
 to deliver those benefits, regardless of their aptitude for designing Web
 pages. One important benefit is the ability to co-mingle presentation,
 absorption of content, and assessment of student comprehension, moving from
 the traditional pedagogy toward something that is closer to the way people
 actually learn. 

 One promising
 approach is to model instruction as question-response rather than lecture, a
 challenging idea for a large course but ideally suited to CMS delivery. On my campus, where there has been extensive reliance on sophisticated quiz
 software (which allows the students to repeat the quiz until correct) we have
 found that students often go directly to the quizzes and only seek out the
 presentation material as needed to complete the quiz. A well-designed
 quiz encourages the student to absorb the material in the process of
 completion. A poorly designed quiz, on the contrary, allows the student
 to mechanically get the right answers while remaining puzzled why the
 responses were correct or how they were related to the course learning
 objectives. The framing of the questions as well as the associated
 response and sequencing of the dialog are critical to learning. 

 Imagine that instead
 of lecture notes, instructors delivered&quot;content surveys&quot;where
 similar to the TV show Jeopardy , every few paragraphs a special text
 insert appeared&quot;in the form of a question.&quot; This would
 require a written response from the students, then more instructor content
 followed by additional questions. The effect is to move from a
 discursive to a dialogic approach to learning. 

 For these exercises
 to have meaning to the students, their responses must be reviewed. Conceivably, the instructor could critique these individually. Yet that
 would entail substantial effort. An ensemble critique done in class
 places more modest demands on the instructor&apos;s time and should make the live
 class relevant for the students, since the focus will be on their work. What insights did the responses show? Where did students react in a way
 the instructor didn&apos;t anticipate? Were there patterns or commonalities
 among student errors? Can those errors be used to help steer the
 discussion&quot;on course?&quot; 

 After a few
 experiences with these content surveys, students will become comfortable with
 the format. At this point the instructor can&quot;go meta.&quot; Instead of assigning a term paper, have the students design their own content
 survey. On campuses that have the third-party quiz software, Respondus
 (which works with Blackboard, eCollege, and WebCT), the technical part of
 making the survey is easy to manage. Students can submit Respondus files
 and the instructor can upload them into their course site so that other
 students might take the student created survey. (On campuses without
 Respondus, this can be done with the students submitting text documents as
 long as the instructor is willing to do some cutting and pasting to make the
 surveys.) The hard part is designing and researching the survey,
 selecting the right topic, and creating a presentation that is compelling and
 illustrates the key points. Whereas students often view term papers as
 drudgework unconnected to the rest of the course, here the motivation for the
 student should be much greater because their work will be viewed and
 utilized by other students . This is a powerful way to promote
 student engagement and interaction. 

 The fundamental
 change we are after is to encourage students to become the creators of
 learning objects and to move the instructor&apos;s role from the reluctant author
 who doesn&apos;t have time for the task to the enthusiastic mentor whose main job
 regarding learning objects is choice of topic and coach of the students during
 the creation stage. If this strategy works and students willingly donate
 their intellectual property, then we have an organic learning system. Instructors can use the better content surveys made by students in prior
 semesters to amplify or even substitute for their own creations in subsequent
 offerings. In this way, the online materials in the course and the
 topics that are covered grow and are refreshed over time. 

 Can this really
 work? Certainly there are places for both the instructor and the
 students to stumble. It is just as apparent, however, that the benefits
 from making this approach work are substantial. Students become more
 engaged in the learning process and faculty exercise their instructional
 skills in rewarding new ways. With proper faculty training, our course
 management systems can support this new approach to learning.

 From The American Assembly --- http://www.hypermediative-dev1.net/index.php  
 The Future of the Accounting Profession --- http://snipurl.com/AccountingFuture   
 
 What Went
Wrong?  
As the bubble economy encouraged corporate management to adopt increasingly
creative accounting practices to deliver the kind of predictable and robust
earnings and revenue growth demanded by investors, governance fell by the
wayside. All too often, those whose mandate was to act as a gatekeeper were
tempted by misguided compensation policies to forfeit their autonomy and
independence. The technology stock bubble of the late 1990s and the
puncturing of that bubble in 2000 coincided with significant failures in
corporate governance. 

 Preface  
On November 13, 2003, fifty-seven men and women, including leaders from the
worlds of accounting, finance, law, academia, investment banking, journalism,
non-governmental organizations, as well as the current and former regulatory
officials from The Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB), The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) gathered at the Lansdowne
Resort, Leesburg, Virginia, for the 103rd American Assembly entitled The
Future of the Accounting Profession. Over the course of the Assembly, the
distinguished professionals considered three broad areas of the accounting
profession: its present state, its desired future state, and how it might reach
that future state.  

 This Assembly project
was co-directed by Roderick M. Hills, Partner, Hills&amp;Stern, and former
Chairman of the SEC, and Russell E. Palmer, CEO, The Palmer Group, former CEO,
Touche Ross&amp;Co. Initiated by the co-directors in fall 2000, this project
showed an extraordinary prescience of the material events that subsequently
unfolded. The project benefited greatly from the advice and active guidance of
an eminent steering committee, whose names and affiliations are listed in the
appendix of this report. 
 
 There are too many conclusions and
recommendations to summarize concisely.

 So they&apos;ve had a year before they really had to do
this. There are two complicated standardsthe financial-instrument standards (IAS
32 and 39)  so we&apos;ve said don&apos;t do the
comparatives. But basically, we were given the 2005 deadline, so we have to meet
it.
 Sir David Tweedie  

 New World Order
Sir David Tweedie explains the relationship between good governance and
international accounting standards. 

 IASB chairman Sir David Tweedie says global accounting standards are within
reach. 
 
 A CFO Interview, CFO Magazine , http://www.cfo.com/article/1,5309,12320||M|827,00.html   

 March 01, 2004 

 Sir David Tweedie is on a quest. The 59-year-old
 chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is overseeing
 the development of a single set of international accounting standards for the
 European Union (EU) by March and intends to converge those standards with U.S.
 rules. 

 Can it be done that quickly? It must be, according to
 Sir David. The engine of capital formation and investment has been stalled
 long enough by the anachronism of 26 separate European accounting methods,
 with another in America. Developing a single international system is&quot;not
 about arcane bookkeeping matters,&quot;says the former head of the UK&apos;s
 accounting standards board.&quot;It&apos;s really about something much
 bigger.&quot;Indeed, what the IASB is really targeting when it designs an
 accounting system for the world&quot;is inward investment, growth,
 employment, and world trade,&quot;he says. 

 The accounting scandals infecting both the New and
 Old Worlds give convergence more urgency. While Sir David won&apos;t blame the
 Enron and Parmalat fiascos on an absence of international standards, he
 believes that some frauds would be much harder to pull off. Having a set of
 standards based on principles, rather than mere rules, might dissuade
 executives from simply&quot;checking the boxes and not looking at the whole
 picture.&quot; 

 Sir David&apos;s quest, however, has not been uniformly
 well received. There&apos;s been much displeasure among European banks and the
 French government over the new rules for financial instruments. And the
 implications for expensing stock options have already met opposition in the
 States. Meanwhile, critics everywhere charge that without a European
 enforcement agency on the scale of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
 Commission, the rules will lack teeth. Sir David says that a plan to address
 enforcement is in the works. 

 He firmly believes that now is the time for
 international standards. In January, during a break at an IASB meeting in
 London, he sat down with CFO deputy editor Lori Calabro and CFO Asia editor
 Tom Leander to discuss the board&apos;s hopes and his vision of a&quot;three-legged-stool&quot;arrangementrules combined with good
 corporate governnace and auditing standardsfor deterring abuses. 

 The IASB promised a workable set of standards by
 March, and the European Commission mandated that all European companies switch
 to international standards by 2005. How has the process evolved? When we
 started in the summer of 2001, we inherited 34 standards from our predecessor
 body [the International Accounting Standards Committee]. Now, of those
 inherited standards, 30 had been an attempt to get together with the
 International Organization of Securities Commissions [IOSCO] to produce
 standards of appropriate quality, so that users could list on any stock
 exchange worldwide. But 14 of the standards were heavily criticized. Then,
 only about a month or two after we began, the EU announced this 2005 deadline.
 So we had a choice. We knew we had to fix these [inherited] standards, if
 international standards were going to be acceptable to New York and the SEC.
 But we also had the 2005 deadline. So should we just gradually change them,
 meaning that anyone coming on board would have to change twice in a matter of
 a year or two? Or should we have a real blitz on these standards, and really
 change them? That&apos;s what we did. We ended up publishing in November, and we
 actually changed 17 of the 34pretty fast for a standard setter in two and a
 half years. 

 Are the changes drastic? We&apos;ve tried to keep the
 fundamentals as best we could. But we did make changes. And we also produced a
 standard last year [that covers] what you do the first time you switch to
 international standards. Broadly speaking, you have to show in 2005 all the
 assets and liabilities that we require, measured as we require them, with
 certain cost-benefit allowances. We are not, for example, going to make you
 undo all business combinations you&apos;ve done before. 

 The upgrades were to be completed in enough time for
 companies to meet the 2005 deadline. Is there any flexibility? None. 

 None? They&apos;ve known for ages that it was coming.
 We&apos;ve had the standards up on our Website since October. We said here are the
 17 we altered. There may be cross-reference differences, which is why we
 aren&apos;t publishing them officially. But all the standards are here. So they&apos;ve
 had a year before they really had to do this. There are two complicated
 standardsthe financial-instrument standardsso we&apos;ve said don&apos;t do the
 comparatives. But basically, we were given the 2005 deadline, so we have to
 meet it.

 &quot;Al Gore Keynotes AIU Online Graduation Ceremony,&quot; Lycos, March 5, 2004 --- http://snipurl.com/LycosGore   
 
 Millions of future students will owe a debt of
 gratitude to those who today are blazing a new trail in online education, said
 former United States Vice President Al Gore during the online commencement
 ceremony of American InterContinental University (AIU) Online, one of the
 nation&apos;s fastest-growing universities. 

 &quot;Even those of us who have promoted and believe
 in this new technology stand in awe of what you have done,&quot;Mr. Gore told
 the AIU Online graduates and their families and friends during the Web-based
 event held Saturday, February 28.&quot;You are the ones who have supplied the
 hard work, the stamina, the dedication, the endurance and the will to succeed
 that we recognize today.&quot; 

 In addition to Mr. Gore&apos;s remarks, a highlight of the
 online graduation ceremony was the reading of the names of recipients of
 bachelor&apos;s degrees and master&apos;s degrees in the curricular programs of
 Information Technology, Business Administration, Visual Communication and
 Education. Also announced were the names of students who had earned Honors
 designations. 

 Mr. Gore said that with the information revolution
 replacing the industrial revolution, education is far more important today
 than at any other point in human history.&quot;America&apos;s gross domestic
 product has tripled in value over the last half-century while the gross
 tonnage of everything we make and sell actually has declined slightly. That&apos;s
 because materials like steel and wood and rubber and plastic are being
 replaced by ingenuity, knowledge and the ability to use information in more
 creative ways. 

 &quot;The degree you receive today certifies that you
 have obtained the knowledge and skills to deal with information more
 effectively than those who lack this credential and who have not gone through
 the experience that you have just successfully navigated,&quot;Mr. Gore said.&quot;But the value of your online education extends beyond opening up new
 career opportunities for you. It also will enrich life for you and your
 families.&quot; 

 American InterContinental University is a wholly
 owned subsidiary of Career Education Corporation ( NASDAQ:
 CECO ). CEC operates 78 campuses in the U.S., Canada, France, the United
 Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates and had approximately 83,200 students as
 of January 31, 2004. AIU Online is the Web-based virtual campus of American
 InterContinental University, an international university with onsite campuses
 located in Atlanta, GA; Los Angeles, CA; Ft. Lauderdale, FL; Houston, TX;
 London, England; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. American InterContinental
 University has been educating students for more than 30 years and is
 regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

 Pivot Tables Should Be Used More Often 

 Roberta has a new article on pivot tables.
&quot;Make Exel and Instant Know-It All,&quot;by Robert Ann Jones, Journal
of Accountancy , March 2004, pp. 40-43 --- http://www.aicpa.org/pubs/jofa/mar2004/jones.htm   
 
 Youre sitting at your computer working on a
 spreadsheet that displays revenue generated by individual salespersons. Your
 CEO, hovering anxiously at your elbow, asks you for one employees
 third-quarter sales total. You sort the Salesperson column and then the Order
 Date column. Then you write you write a formula to identify third-quarter
 sales. Finally, you sum the order amounts and give your boss the number he
 wants. Just as you congratulate yourself for coming up with the answer in less
 than three minutes, he says, OK, now compare that with the results of the
 whole sales team. 

 You roll your eyes in frustration, scrap all the work
 you just did and re-sort the columns and rows and write a new set of formulas. 

 There has to be a better way, you think. 

 And there is. Instead of repeatedly sorting columns
 and rows and customizing formulas to answer each question your boss asks, you
 take a new tack: Immediately after you initially put the worksheet data
 together you can spend a minute or two using Excels PivotTables, which will
 let you easily reconfigure the data with a mouse so you can produce
 near-instant answers to most any question about them.

 Jenkins: The
Christian Media Counterculture 
Over the past several decades, culture war rhetoric has served both to estrange
evangelical Christians from the American cultural mainstream and to blind
liberals to just how many people are consuming Christian media. But many
conservative Christians simply want to protect and promote their own cultural
traditions in the face of what they see as the onslaught of contemporary media,
and they have been quick to embrace new technologiessuch as videotape, cable
television, low-wattage radio stations, and the Internetthat allow them to
route around the gatekeepers of the media establishment. The result, writes
columnist Henry Jenkins, has been the creation of a Christian media parallel
universe with products that mirror the genre conventions of popular culture but
express an alternative set of values.

 &quot;Justices Hear Arguments on Internet Pornography Law,&quot;by John
Schwartz, The New York Times , March 3, 2004 --- http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/politics/03SCOT.html   
 
   The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on
 Tuesday about Internet pornography, one of the most vexing issues at the
 intersection of technology and First Amendment rights. 

 Neither side got a free ride from the justices in the
 discussion of the Child Online Protection Act, a 1998 law that makes it
 illegal for commercial Web sites to make available to children 16 and under
 material that is not necessarily obscene but could be considered&quot;harmful
 to minors&quot;under a complex, three-part formula in the law. 

 Just minutes into his argument, Solicitor General
 Theodore B. Olson was interrupted by Justice Sandra Day O&apos;Connor, who asked
 why the government was fighting for new laws when it was not enforcing the old
 ones.&quot;There are very few prosecutions, and there&apos;s all kinds of stuff
 out there,&quot;Justice O&apos;Connor said. 

 Mr. Olson said the Bush administration was stepping
 up its prosecution of pornography cases in the online and offline world and
 had issued 21 indictments in the last two years. 

 Regulation of Internet pornography is urgently
 needed, Mr. Olson said, because&quot;it&apos;s causing irreparable injury to our
 most important resource our children.&quot;The materials are&quot;as
 available to children as a television remote,&quot;he said, and turn up when
 youngsters make the most innocuous searches. 

 He argued that the world of online pornography was
 exploding, and said that typing the words&quot;free porn&quot;on a search
 engine produced 6,230,000 sites.&quot;I did this this weekend,&quot;he said.
 When asked whether all of the sites could be considered obscene, he said,&quot;I didn&apos;t have enough time to go through all of those sites,&quot;drawing laughs from justices and spectators. 

 At another point, Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked for
 specific examples of Web sites that were not pornographic but could run afoul
 of the law&apos;s prohibitions. Justice Breyer said that he looked at examples
 provided by the American Civil Liberties Union in its legal brief and could
 not find one that fell that into that middle ground. 

 Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the civil liberties union,
 cited examples that included&quot;lesbian and gay pleasure&quot;and&quot;the pleasure of sex outdoors,&quot;and the works of a sex columnist,
 Susie Bright. But the discussion moved on without growing more explicit, and
 decorum was preserved. 

 Congress passed the Child Online Protection Act in
 1998 after the court struck down its first major effort to restrict
 pornography in cyberspace, the Communications Decency Act, which Congress
 passed in 1996. That law, which would have made it a crime to provide&quot;indecent&quot;material to minors online, was declared unconstitutional
 by the Supreme Court in 1997. 

 In passing the Child Online Protection Act, Congress
 was trying to produce a law narrower in scope than its first try, Mr. Olson
 said. The new law prohibits commercial Web sites from publishing material&quot;harmful to minors&quot;unless the site can show that it has made good
 faith efforts requiring a credit card, for example to keep out all Web
 surfers younger than 17. Violators could be fined as much as $50,000 and spend
 six months in jail, with higher penalties for repeat offenders. 

 The civil liberties union challenged the law in
 federal court and was joined by a broad coalition of Web sites, booksellers
 and civil liberties organizations, as well as online stores like Condomania
 and online publications like Salon, which discuss sex frankly. 

 The oral arguments on Tuesday were the second time
 the justices have taken up this law. In a ruling last term, they reversed a
 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which
 had declared the law unconstitutional. The appeals court said that the law&apos;s
 reliance on&quot;community standards&quot;would mean, in practice, that the
 most tolerant communities would still be held to&quot;the decency standards
 of the most puritanical communities.&quot;The Supreme Court said that the
 lower court should not have declared the law unconstitutional based on a
 finding of only that single major flaw. The Third Circuit reviewed the case
 again and, last March, found multiple grounds for declaring the act
 unconstitutional.

 Ethical Dilemma for Writers: Toot or Not to Toot Your Own Horn 

 Question
What recently sent a shudder through the writing community? 

 Answer
&quot;The Amazon Epidemic: Writers Addicted to Rankings,&quot;by Sara Nelson, New
York Observer , March 5, 2004 --- http://www.observer.com/pages/covers.asp   
 
 Most writers have a lot of romantic notions about
 what will happen to their lives the minute they publish a book. Fame and
 fortune figures in, of course, and some of the most ambitious dream that soon
 theyll quit their days jobs to enjoy the writerly life full-time. But the
 most common and immediate change upon publication is far less anticipated:
 From the day their book first lands in stores, most writers will start
 spending minutes, hoursnay, days, weeks, months and yearstracking its
 progress on Amazon.com. 

 Never mind that the online retailer accounts for only
 about 10 percent of a trade books total sales (slightly higher for business
 books, somewhat lower for childrens). By my count, the reviews and the
 ranking system on Amazon.com count for about 95 percent of writers hopes,
 anxieties and dreams. 

 Which is why last months glitch on the Canadian
 version of the sitewhich for a week revealed the reviewers real names sent
 a shudder down the collective spine of the writing community .
 Even if few were as publicly honest as the author John Rechy, who cheerfully
 admitted to The New York Times that he had praised his own book on the site,
 many had their own dirty little secrets. I, for one, was suddenly panicked
 that the world would know that several (though, I must say, far from most) of
 the positive reviews of my book, So Many Books, So Little Time, were written
 by people I know. (A further sign of my insanity: When a negative review of
 the book would appear on the titles home page, Id suggest to friends
 that if someone were to write a positive one, the bad guys piece would slip
 further downand maybe even eventually offthe home page.) The writer
 Katherine Russell Rich, for example, told me that when her book, The Red
 Devil: To Hell with Cancerand Back, was published in 1999, she was
 coincidentally seated in a restaurant next to a colleague whom she knew had
 hated the book; after making uncomfortable pleasantries, Ms. Rich said, the
 two diners left the restaurant and raced home to Amazon. Ms. Rich wrote a
 positive review to offset the negative one she knew was coming from her
 colleague. (Sure enough, both reviews appeared shortly.) Even far more
 established authors pay attention, if not homage, to Amazon: James Marcus,
 author of the forthcoming Amazonia, an incisive and funny account of five
 years working for the Seattle-based company, says that he once came upon a
 review posted by Paul Theroux, defending his own book, Sir Vidias Shadow. 

 As for the rankings: Dont get me started. At a
 publishing party last fall, I met up with a well-known and very successful
 journalist who kept making trips to the hosts bedroom to check his (and my)
 books status on Publishers Marketplace, one of several sites that allow
 users to track the movement of many books at once at both Amazon and
 BarnesandNoble.com.&quot;Do you want to check one more time before you
 leave?&quot;he asked me as I headed for the door. (It goes without saying
 that I did.) In the ensuing months, Ive had dozens of friends and
 acquaintances comment, unsolicited, on my books rise and fall, and one
 radio interviewer told me hed decided to invite me on the show because&quot;your Amazon numbers have gotten good again.&quot;It doesnt matter
 how many times editors and agents tell us that&quot;Amazon doesnt
 matter&quot;authors are addicts, and Amazon is easily as habit-forming and
 even more accessible than crack. Not to mention, of course, that its also
 free.

 Airline Ticketing Advice March 3, 2004 Message from Jim McKinney [jim@MCKINNEYCPA.COM ] 
 See the WSJ 2/25/2004
 article (note www.sidestep.com  which searches Southwest airlines: 

 Using Connections
 (the Airport Kind) And Other Tips on Scoring Cheap Fares 

 It&apos;s the question I
 get asked most often by readers and relatives, especially at this time of
 year: How do you get the best price for an airline ticket? 

 Carriers have dozens
 of different prices for the same seats on the same planes, and they sometimes
 change those prices several times a day -- all trying to scrape an extra
 dollar out of your pocket. If airlines ran grocery stores, you&apos;d have to
 cruise the produce aisle several times just to see if the price of green beans
 changed. 

 But there are some
 excellent tricks to help beat the system. Here are my favorites. 

 Watch carefully for
 airline announcements of new routes or flights. When carriers add service,
 that means a lot of empty seats, at least initially -- and airlines typically
 offer cheap prices to build traffic. 

 Looking for new
 routes or added service isn&apos;t as much of a shot in the dark as it sounds:
 After all, planes generally go places where people want to go. If you want to
 go to Europe this summer, for example, lots of airlines are adding seasonal
 capacity and rebuilding trips canceled after the 2001 terrorist attacks.
 Airlines list new service additions on their Web sites, along with other press
 releases. (And we run new service announcements in The Wall Street Journal.) 

 This month, for
 example, American Airlines said it would add a second daily round-trip between
 Los Angeles and London starting April 4. Armed with that news, I checked for a
 weeklong trip leaving March 27 -- before the new flights -- and was quoted
 $1,503. One week after the new service begins, when American had twice as many
 seats to sell, the same Saturday-to-Saturday itinerary was 56% lower at $662. 

 On top of scouring
 the usual Big Three online ticket-buying Web sites -- Expedia.com2,
 Travelocity.com3 and Orbitz.com4 -- I add an extra weapon, SideStep.com5. In
 fact, it&apos;s my newest favorite tool. You download SideStep onto your PC, and
 then when you launch an online search, it pops up asking if you&apos;d like
 SideStep to try the same search. SideStep searches airline Web sites
 themselves and lots of other travel vendors you wouldn&apos;t normally search, such
 as discount carriers like Southwest Airlines, that aren&apos;t in the big
 centralized reservation systems. SideStep is only a referral service -- it
 connects you to the airline or Web site you want. 

 Sometimes it finds
 the same prices, sometimes it does better. I searched for New York-Paris fares
 in early June on Travelocity, and the best price was $797 on Air France.
 SideStep found a $532 Air France price on onetravel.com. 

 Online search engines
 have radically changed the ticket marketplace, of course, giving travelers a
 lot more power. And while they are still far from perfect, they have a few
 tricks up their sleeve. Travelocity and Orbitz will show when the lowest
 prices are available -- handy if your dates are flexible. Orbitz has a&quot;Deal Detector&quot;that lets you register a price you want, then alerts
 you if it shows up. Travelocity has a&quot;Fare Watcher&quot;function that
 alerts when prices change on a route. All offer packages of airfare and hotel
 bookings that can yield savings. And they&apos;ll search alternative airports near
 your destination -- a key money-saver. 

 But I still recommend
 searching all three of the main online booking sites because I&apos;ve found each,
 at any given moment, may produce a better result. Orbitz, for example, last
 week listed the best prices for a nonstop Chicago-Zurich trip in June at
 $1,261 on American Airlines or $1,322 on Swiss. Travelocity and Expedia, in
 turn, both had a $586 fare on Swiss. Orbitz has its winners, too, and its
 matrix display gives the most information in the easiest format. 

 Airfare consultant
 Bob Harrell says his research shows very little difference -- on average.&quot;Route by route, they can be quite different. They do have different
 pricing negotiated with different carriers,&quot;says Mr. Harrell, president
 of Harrell Associates in New York. 

 Connections are
 usually cheaper than nonstop flights. Struggling to find a good price to Rome,
 one of the pricier cities for trans-Atlantic airfare? Instead of paying $824
 to Alitalia for a nonstop New York-Rome trip leaving June 2 and returning June
 9, why not pay Swiss $563 with a connection in Geneva? Some may not like the
 hassle of a longer trip or the risk of missing a connection. Still, a few
 hours of extra travel may be worth saving enough to afford an extra day at
 your destination. 

 And pay attention to
 consolidators, either the online variety like Priceline.com, or those that
 advertise in travel sections. But these days the savings over published fares
 may be small, and restrictions can be high -- I&apos;m not sure the pain justifies
 the gain. 

 Another route:
 Bestfares.com, a membership club, also offers unpublished fares. Ken Day of
 Baltimore couldn&apos;t find tickets to Rome in June for much less than $1,000 on
 Travelocity and Orbitz, but nabbed a $750 round-trip on Bestfares.com after
 paying a $60 annual membership fee. And for many people, a top-notch travel
 agent who can do repeated searches for you and find good deals can be worth
 far more than the fee you&apos;ll pay for the agent&apos;s service. 

 For ambitious
 do-it-yourselfers, try building itineraries with discount carriers in Europe.
 Barcelona is another pricey nonstop European city -- New York-Barcelona is
 currently $824 in early June on Delta Air Lines. Why not use that $532 Air
 France fare to Paris, then easyJet to Barcelona? Together you&apos;d save about
 $150 a ticket. One issue: easyJet flies to Barcelona from Orly Airport in
 Paris, so you&apos;d have to change airports -- a shuttle bus runs for about $10. 

 Or just enjoy some
 time in Paris. What better way to spend your airfare savings?

 2004) Stephen Downes
 makes some predictions based on what he thinks is&quot;driving the hearts of
 those who will make the final decisions on the future of the Internet, those
 who use it.&quot;He believes that the&quot;deluge of spam&quot;will be
 addressed in the near future, although not without mass marketers going to
 court to block anti-spam legislation. 

 Some other
 predictions: We will begin to see more personalization of Web browsing

 little non-essential Web reading) will be available through a single
 application.&quot;We will also see the resurgence of videoconferencing in the

 Department of
 Education Funds Study on Education Technology The U.S. Department of Education
 is undertaking a study to determine the effectiveness of educational
 technology for learning reading and math and to measure how technology can
 improve student achievement in those subjects. The $10 million study, to begin
 during the 2004-05 school year, will be funded by two divisions of the U.S.
 Department of Education, the Institute of Education Sciences and the Office of
 Educational Technology. 

 The study fulfills
 the presidents education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, and
 involves testing the effectiveness of 16 different software products in the
 areas of early reading, reading comprehension, pre-Algebra, and Algebra. The
 study will be conducted by Mathematica Policy Research and SRI International,
 two independent research companies who will assess student achievement gains
 over three years using a random-assignment study design. Although the study is
 aimed at K-8 learning, its results will be useful in establishing
 benchmarks for the effectiveness of educational technology overall.

 IMA Launches New
 Research Program! 

 In a recent survey,
 members indicated that one of the reasons they join IMA is to keep up with new
 developments in management accounting that focus on the best tools and methods
 for planning, control, support, and decision making. As a result of this and
 other input, IMA is reentering the research arena. IMA is already the premier
 organization in managerial finance and accounting, but to maintain this
 leadership position, IMA must not only be on the cutting edge of research - it
 must create it. 

 Therefore, IMA&apos;s
 Foundation for Applied Research/Management Accounting Committee (FAR/MAC)
 invites academics to submit research proposals for consideration. The goal is
 to create discussion papers, Statements on Management Accounting, and
 practitioner-oriented articles based on completed research for publication in
 Strategic Finance magazine and/or Management Accounting Quarterly. 

 The research program
 brochure provides complete information about the program&apos;s objectives,
 research topics and proposal guidelines. Please contact James Cooke, Assistant
 Vice President - Research, for more information about the program at (800)
 638-4427, ext. 1526, or via e-mail: jcooke@imanet.org .

 &quot;10 Colleges with Dorms Like
Palaces,&quot; The Princeton Review --- http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/departments/college/?article=dorms   
 
 Most colleges are notorious for their
 prison-cell dorm rooms. But a few colleges have dorms like
 palaces--spectacular views, loads of space, and convenient amenities. The
 Princeton Review surveyed college students around the country about their
 campus digs. These ten sport the swankiest dorms. 

 2004 Rankings 

 This year&apos;s rankings are in! The
 Princeton Review ranks The Best 351 Colleges. This is just one on the
 list. Get the full set! 

 1. Loyola College in Maryland 

 Welcome to a New Yorker&apos;s paradise, a
 place where&quot;people have walk-in closets so large they debate what kind
 of room they can convert the closet into&quot;and&quot;even the
 freshman-year dorms are gigantic.&quot;When students tell us that their
 campus is a truly&quot;positive living environment,&quot;their comments
 reflect not only the quality of the dorms but also the fact that&quot;The
 school keeps the campus spotless, the flowers are changed regularly, the grass
 is always green, and every morning they have people who not only clean up any
 litter but every cigarette butt on the ground.&quot; 

 2. Smith College 

 Smith College has&quot;a unique
 housing system...where everyone lives in houses instead of dorms.&quot;These
 houses have&quot;at least one professor serving as House Fellow&quot;who
 typically&quot;comes to teas, candlelight diners, and altogether make
 students feel important and valued.&quot;Students love the system as well as
 the houses themselves, which provide&quot;country-club comfort.&quot;It&apos;s a
 good thing too, because the housing system plays a major role in Smith&apos;s
 social scene. According to one student,&quot;Life at Smith revolves mainly
 around the housing system. On average, 80 percent of your friends are in your
 house.&quot; 

 3. Bryn Mawr College 

 Bryn Mawr&apos;s&quot;unparalleled&quot;dorms serve as an integral part of the college&apos;s support network. Here,
 incoming students are assigned to custom groups,&quot;groups of freshmen
 separated by dorm and hall, and led by sophomores in order to adjust to the
 college life together.&quot;Also,&quot;Every dorm and every hall is mixed
 with all four classes, and even in the throes of thesis-writing, seniors are
 supportive of freshmen.&quot;When they grow tired of all the support,
 students can retreat to their&quot;cavernous&quot;rooms. 

 4. Scripps College 

 Scripps&apos;s residence halls, in which&quot;almost everyone has a single,&quot;are&quot;ridiculously luxurious. We
 have living rooms with grand pianos and fireplaces in every dorm. Between the
 residence halls and the good food, my mom thinks I&apos;ll never live this well
 again.&quot;One undergrad gushed,&quot;We have the best on-campus housing I
 have ever seen! I mean, I have a balcony, a walk-in closet, a sink and two
 windows! I&apos;m in love with my room!&quot;Perhaps best of all,&quot;because
 the school is all women, the dorm environment is relaxed,&quot;so it&apos;s easy
 to get studying done. 

 5. Agnes Scott College 

 Scotties enjoy&quot;homey and
 spacious&quot;dormitories.&quot;Even the worst first-year room beats the
 best room at Georgia Tech,&quot;wrote one undergrad at this all-women&apos;s
 college (she didn&apos;t elaborate on how she knew so much about Tech dorm rooms).
 One student admitted,&quot;Really, we are spoiled with our historic dorms
 with high ceilings and hardwood floors.&quot; 

 6. Skidmore College 

 Skidmore housing not only offers&quot;the biggest rooms of any campus I&apos;ve seen, but our residences also build
 a sense of community that makes it really easy to meet people when you&apos;re a
 freshman.&quot;Student housing is&quot;arranged in suites, so that you don&apos;t
 have to share a bathroom with a lot of people,&quot;and&quot;there are pool
 tables in dorm basements,&quot;meaning you needn&apos;t brave the chilly Saratoga
 Springs winter to enjoy a fun study break. On the downside, perhaps,&quot;The
 dorms are absolutely teeming with bongos and guitars!&quot; 

 7. Claremont McKenna College 

 CMC provides hotel-style amenities to
 its appreciative students. One student explained,&quot;Our rooms are great,
 and we have cleaning service that takes out our trash cans, dusts our rooms,
 and stuff.&quot;If the school starts placing mints on the pillows and tiny
 complimentary bottles of shampoo in the bathrooms, it may just top this list
 next year. 

 8. Bowdoin College 

 At Bowdoin,&quot;first years have
 two-room triples, which are good&quot;but&quot;really feel like they are
 made for two people.&quot;Housing improves as students move up the ranks.
 Some upperclassmen move to social houses,&quot;converted frats&quot;(Bowdoin
 did away with its Greek system in 1997) that&quot;provide a place where
 anyone can socialize with just about all types of students.&quot;Residents of
 the houses&quot;are given budgets by the school to have parties, community
 service events, art shows, concerts, and annual events such as the school-wide
 Olympics or softball tournament.&quot; 

 9. Mount Holyoke College 

 Many of Mount Holyoke&apos;s&quot;lovely&quot;dorm rooms&quot;have hardwood floors, huge windows, and
 high ceilings,&quot;and nearly all&quot;are huge and really nice.&quot;The
 accommodations are luxurious enough to move one student to opine that&quot;the dorms are better than most four-star hotels.&quot;They&apos;re also&quot;usually very quiet and easy to study in,&quot;which, given the mountain
 of work Holyoke women usually face, is definitely a good thing. 

 10. The George Washington University 

 GW has&quot;put a lot of money into
 making the dorms comfortable,&quot;and students have responded by telling us
 that their housing ranks among the nation&apos;s best. The school places students
 in apartment-style dorms. One undergrad bragged,&quot;In my freshman dorm, I
 have a kitchen and a bathroom that is shared with my three roommates. The
 college is proving to us they think we&apos;re ready for responsibility by granting
 us this living environment.&quot; 

 Think this list is bunk?

 Discussion Board of The Princeton Review .

 surveys tens of thousands of college students to get the inside word on what&apos;s
 going on at the nation&apos;s top colleges. For more inside information about these

   Cooking the Books 
 March 1, 2004 message from Mike Groomer 
 
 Bob, 

 Do you have any idea
 about who coined the phrase Cooking the Books? What is the lineage of these
 magic words? 

 Mike 
 
 Hi Mike, 

 The phrase&quot;cooking the
books&quot;appears to have a long history. Several friends on the AECM found
some interesting facts and legends. 

 However, there may be a little urban
legend in some of this. 

 I suspect that the phrase may have
origins that will never be determined much like double entry bookkeeping itself
with unknown origins. And I&apos;m not sure were the term&quot;books&quot;first
appeared although I suspect it goes back to when ledgers were bound into&quot;books.&quot;

 &apos;cooking the books&apos; were first put together. Shakespeare was the first to
 refer to&quot;books&quot;as a business ledger (King Lear, Act III, Scene iv,&quot;Keep...thy pen from lenders books&quot;). The American Heritage
 Dictionary of Idioms cites 1636 as the first time the word &apos;cook&apos; was used to
 mean falsify (but it didn&apos;t also include the word &apos;books&apos;). Combining &apos;cook&apos;
 and &apos;books&apos; may be a 20th century innovation. Even the origin of&quot;cooking

 According to http://www.businessballs.com/clichesorigins.htm , the phrase dates back to the 18th century, to an (unattributed) report that

 Hi Bob, 

 Yes very
 interesting See below Thanks for your efforts. 

 Best regards, Mike 

 cook the books -
 falsify business accounts - according to 18th century Brewer, &apos;cook the books&apos;
 originally appeared as the past tense &apos;the books have been cooked&apos; in a report
 (he didn&apos;t name the writer unfortunately) referring to the conduct George
 Hudson (1700-71), &apos;the railway king&apos;, under whose chairmanship the accounts of
 Eastern Counties Railways were falsified. Brewer says then (1870) that the
 term specifically describes the tampering of ledger and other trade books in
 order to show a balance in favour of the bankrupt. Brewer also says the
 allusion is to preparing meat for the table. These days the term has a wider
 meaning, extending to any kind of creative accounting. Historical records bear
 this out, and date the first recorded use quite accurately: Hudson made a
 fortune speculating in railway shares, and then in 1845, which began the
 period 1845-47 known as &apos;railway mania&apos; in Britain, he was exposed as a
 fraudster and sent to jail. Other cliche references suggest earlier usage,
 even 17th century, but there appears to be no real evidence of this. There is
 an argument for Brewer being generally pretty reliable when it comes to first
 recorded/published use, because simply he lived far closer to the date of
 origin than reference writers of today. If you read Brewer&apos;s Dictionary of
 Phrase and Fable you&apos;ll see it does have an extremely credible and prudent
 style. The word &apos;book&apos; incidentally comes from old German &apos;buche&apos; for beech
 wood, the bark of which was used in Europe before paper became readily
 available. The verb &apos;cook&apos; is from Latin &apos;coquere&apos;

 When It Absolutely, Positively Has to Get There
 Eventually 

 According to the Wall Street Journal , studies
 find that the United States Postal Service&apos;s Priority Mail, priced at $3.85
 for a letter, is slower than standard first-class mail, priced at 37 cents.
 Only 65 percent of Priority Mail is delivered within three business days,
 versus 81 percent for standard first class.

 If you FedEx a letter from one place in your city to
 another part of the same city, the letter is first flown to Memphis, Tenn., to
 be sorted, then flown back to your city. Today a letter can be picked up,
 transported to a distant location, transported back and delivered a few blocks
 away the next day for $12. Only in America! 

 To TMQ, this reached the height of absurdity the
 other day when I received a FedEx from another company located in my
 building . Someone had made out an address label not realizing my address
 was identical to their address; FedEx had picked it up without the courier
 noticing. The parcel had been flown from Washington, D.C. to Memphis, sorted,
 flown back and delivered to the same building where it originated. All for
 only $12!

 The OCW (Open
Courseware) announcement, almost three years ago, was open
for easy inference. MIT officials insisted that the university was not offering
online courses to students; rather, MIT faculty were putting their course
materialssyllabi and supporting resourceson the Web for others to use. In
other words, one could see the syllabus and review some of the course materials,
but not take the class. And not just a few classes. OCWs announced goal
is to make the complete MIT curriculumeverything in the undergraduate and
graduate curriculum, across all fields, totalling some 2000 coursesavailable
over the next few years. Speaking at the November 2003 EDUCAUSE Conference, Anne
Margulies, executive director of the OCW project, announced that MIT has made
significant progress towards this goal: as of fall 2003, the resources for some 500

 In
the first week on the Web, the OCW site received more than 13 million visits
from users, about 52 percent from outside of the United States. The OCW team
also processed more than 2,000 e-mails in those first days, more than 75 percent
of them supportive of the project. The remaining 25 percent were a mix of
technical questions, inquiries about specific course offerings, and questions
about content. Less than 2 percent of those e-mails were negative.

 All
 these can be subsumed by the biggest issue that does not seem to be more than
 a blip on the land grant radar, the highly visible trend called institutional
 repositories. For example, the DSpace project is
 building an institutional repository for public use ,
 aiming at posting as much of their content as possible. Extension services and
 land grants routinely post free, online content, but the DSpace
 partners led by MIT have bet the farm . Will
 the extension service create institutional repositories too? How far do the
 land grants go? DSpace, Merlot, and other &apos;open content&apos; efforts cannot help
 but appear as paradigmatic land grant projects. But we&apos;re apparently not at
 the table.

Subject: Difficulty of Examinations 

 Sometimes our
 students complain about accounting exams being much tougher than those for
 other classes. That certainly seems to be the case as compared to the final
 exam of the University of Georgia&apos;s Coaching Principles and Strategies of
 Basketball class taught by former assistant coach Jim Harrick Jr. A copy of
 his final exam can be seen at: http://www.ajc.com/uga/content/sports/uga/0304/03test.html   

 Not surprisingly,
 each of the students in Professor Harrick&apos;s class&quot;earned&quot;an A in
 the class, including three starters for the basketball team coached by his
 father Jim Harrick. Those particular student athletes apparently never
 actually attended the class but they were still able to ace the challenging
 final.

 Student
Derivatives and Course Notes: The Gray Zone of Knowledge Sharing
What students take away from a course falls into the&quot;gray zone&quot;of
property rights. We cannot erase what a student learns in a course, nor
would we want to ever do so. However, we are uneasy when that student
commences to write about the content of the course or blends the contents of the
course into his/her writing. 

 

 &quot;In
the meantime, University of California faculty generally own their
copyright-protected property (see the UC Policy on Copyright Ownership, August
19, 1992) and, if concerned about notes being distributed on the web, have
rights to stop it.&quot; (See
below) 

 

 

 &quot;Student
Notes on the Web,&quot;Business Contracts Office, UC Davis --- http://vcadmin.ucdavis.edu/contracts/Student%20Notes.html   

 
 
 First, the October 1,
 1999, issue of The Chronicle for Higher Education contains an article entitled&quot;Putting Class Notes on the Web: Are Companies Stealing Lectures?&quot;Interestingly, one of the companies discussed in the article is also the one
 prompting the current round of complaints - StudentU.com. If you do not have
 access to The Chronicle in your office you may wish to borrow this issue from
 a colleague. The article, while not going into depth on the legal issues
 involved, makes clear that many institutions of higher education across the
 nation are facing this same problem. 

 The issue of making
 individual student notes available to others is not new to the University of
 California, of course. Here at Davis ASUCD has provided the&quot;Classical
 Notes&quot;service to UCD students for some time, but authorization has not
 been a complaint as note-takers are required to obtain the written permission
 of the instructor. In 1969 a UCLA instructor sued a commercial publisher for
 hiring a student to take notes for publication without the instructors
 permission, and the court held that such action was a violation of the
 California common law copyright (California Civil Code 980 et. seq.) as well
 as an invasion of privacy, and both enjoined the company from continuing while
 ordering compensatory and punitive damages. (Williams v. Weisser (1969) 273
 C.A.2d 726.) This settled the issue in California at the time. 

 However, the
 world-wide web and the value of E-commerce have brought the problem back to
 California in the last few years, likely because the individuals (often
 students) who are starting these nationwide companies are not aware of state
 laws, instead operating under the assumption that the federal copyright law
 governs all. I believe it is helpful to understand how federal law does not
 clearly protect instructors in this situation. Federal copyright protection of
 the rights to make copies, make derivative works, distribute, perform
 publicly, and display, applies to&quot;original works of authorship fixed in
 any tangible medium of expression, from which they can be perceived,
 reproduced or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a
 machine or device.&quot;(17 USCA section 102.) Although the federal law was
 written long before the Internet was conceived, its application is no
 different whether applied to paper class notes or the Internet version posting
 of them. 

 Certainly, no one
 will dispute that federal law creates a copyright interest in the
 instructors written/printed lecture notes, to the extent they are original
 work. If an instructor is reading or reciting from his/her lecture notes,
 he/she is exercising his/her performance rights under copyright law, and a
 duplication of that performance by taking notes so accurate as to allow a
 repeat performance would be a copyright violation. However, most instructors
 do not lecture so precisely from their notes, although portions such as a poem
 or critical passage may be read. If the words being said in a lecture are not
 otherwise&quot;fixed&quot;the public performance does not of itself
 constitute publication (17 USCA section 101, definition of publication), so
 does not trigger federal copyright protection. Even if it did, in a federal
 court case that looked at the applicability of copyright to course lectures,
 the court held that most statements made in a lecture can be categorized as
 facts or ideas that do not belong to anyone, neither of which is
 copyrightable. (University of Florida v. KPB, Inc (d.b.a.&quot;A
 Notes&quot;), 89 F.3d 773; 1196 U.S. LEXIS 18778 (11th Cir. 1996)). 

 The argument being
 made by the web-based services, however, is that even if the lecture is
 protected by copyright under federal law, each note-taker is merely writing
 down his/her perceptions of the instructors exercise of his/her copyrights.
 Rather than violating the existing copyright, the note-taker is creating a new
 original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium, and, as the author,
 can exercise any of the rights provided by federal copyright law, including
 transferring ownership to a note-distribution service. The services have been
 very careful not to duplicate class handouts or syllabi, which would clearly
 be a copyright violation. The merit of this argument has not been tested in
 court. One response to this might be that the note-taker is creating a
 derivative work rather than a new work. However, if so, every college student
 who takes notes is creating a derivative work without express authorization of
 the instructor, leading some campus attorneys to advise instructors to begin
 expressly authorizing notes made for personal use to differentiate notes for
 personal use from notes for sale. 

 Fortunately, we
 dont have to get into this can of federal worms so long as the California
 common law copyright continues to be good law and is not preempted by federal
 law to the contrary. In the meantime, UC faculty
 generally own their copyright-protected property (see the UC Policy on
 Copyright Ownership, August 19, 1992 ) and, if concerned about notes being
 distributed on the web, have rights to stop it. Since an ounce of prevention
 is worth a pound of cure, instructors can announce at the first class, and put
 in every syllabus, on their course web-sites, and in/on any other
 teacher-student communication, a statement to the effect of: 
 
 Copyright (authors
 name) (year) . All federal and state copyrights reserved for all original
 material presented in this course through any medium, including lecture or
 print. Individuals are prohibited from being paid for taking, selling, or
 otherwise transferring for value, personal class notes made during this
 course to any entity without the express written permission of (author). In addition to legal sanctions, students found in violation of these
 prohibitions may be subject to University disciplinary action.

 &quot;Scientists behaving
badly,&quot;by Jim Giles , Nature , March 4, 2004 --- http://www.nature.com/nsu/040301/040301-9.html   
 
 They lie, they cheat and they steal. Judging by the
 cases described by a group of medical journal editors, scientists are no
 different from the rest of us. 

 Last week&apos;s annual report 1 of the Committee on Publishing Ethics details the misdemeanours that the group
 of journal editors grappled with in 2003. Although the number of cases - 29 -
 is tiny compared with the tens of thousands of papers published in medical
 journals every year, the cases cover a wide range of unethical activity, from
 attempted bribery to potential medical malpractice. 

 Many of the tricks will be familiar to
 schoolchildren. Two complaints concern cases where researchers were accused of
 copying someone else&apos;s work. When editors investigated, they agreed that the
 papers were almost identical versions of previously published material, and
 that plagiarism was the most likely explanation. 

 Confronted with the evidence, researchers behind one
 paper insisted that their paper contained only 5% overlap with the original.
 Another author, when eventually reached by mobile phone, admitted some
 similarities; but at that point the call ended abruptly. 

 Duplicate publication, where the same paper is
 printed twice in different journals to boost publication records, is the most
 common offence, accounting for seven of 29 cases. This fits with previous
 studies of the practice. 

 A 2003 survey of opthalmology journals estimated that
 at least 1.5% of all papers are duplicates 2 . Some
 researchers seem to have perfected the art: a study released last month
 identified two papers that had each been published five times 3 . 

 Compulsory action 

 Conflicts of interest also rear their head in the
 report. One journal ran a paper on passive smoking from authors who omitted to
 mention that they had received funding from the tobacco industry. Further
 probing revealed that the author had received tobacco company money throughout
 his career and even lobbied for the industry. 

 In cases where the misconduct concerns medical
 treatments, the report becomes more disturbing. The editors discuss several
 studies where medical procedures were run by researchers who did not have
 proper ethical clearance. 

 One paper revealed that blood samples were taken from
 healthy babies to set up a control group for a study. This was a painful
 procedure that the paper&apos;s authors later said wouldn&apos;t normally be sanctioned
 for research purposes. The nature of their ethical approval for the procedure
 was never cleared up. 

 When confronted with such issues, journal editors
 usually contact the researchers&apos; employers or ethics committees, who may take
 action. But this is not compulsory. 

 The publishing committee wants to formalize this
 course of action in a code of ethical conduct for editors. It has published a
 draft of such a code alongside its report, and a final version should be ready
 in the next few months. The committee wants all editors of medical journals,
 including its 180 or so members, to sign up to the code and agree to be bound
 by the associated disciplinary procedures. 

 Such a code should clarify editors&apos; duties. It should
 also make clear, if it is not already, which activities are inappropriate. The
 report describes one bid to persuade an editor to accept a manuscript, in
 which an anonymous caller offered to buy 1000 reprints of the published paper.&quot;And,&quot;the caller added,&quot;I will buy you dinner at any
 restaurant you choose.&quot;

 Better Than Beta: Read About a
Three Factor Market Risk Model
Jim Maher pointed this article out to me. 

 &quot;Interview with Kenneth French,&quot;Index Funds --- http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/kennethfrench_20031015_interview_with_kenneth_french.htm   
 
 Kenneth R. French was the former NTU of Professor of
 Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management (and is now on the Tuck
 School faculty at Dartmouth) . He is an expert on the behavior
 of security prices, investment strategies, and the management of financial
 risk. His recent research focuses on tests of asset pricing models, the trade
 up between risk and return in domestic and international financial markets,
 the cost of capital and the relation between capital structure and firm value.
 Professor French is past director of the American Finance Association, a
 research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and an
 associate editor of the Journal of Finance, the Review of Financial Studies
 and others. Despite this impressive history, he defers, modestly, to
 Eugene Fama: &quot;Our partnership is supposed, total misunderstanding
 because Gene turned in this good stuff.&quot; 

 Kenneth French and Eugene Fama are credited with
 identifying multiple risk factors in the stock market and developing the
 three-factor model to measure different types of risk. This three-factor
 model changed the world of finance. &quot;I guess we were trying to
 answer the question: If you were trying to form a portfolio with high expected
 returns or low expected returns, how would you go about doing that? At the
 time, the capital asset pricing model was the basic theory that said high beta
 stocks--high expected returns, low beta stocks--low expected returns. And so
 we looked at that and we looked at a bunch of other things that people had
 already identified and what we discovered was, gee, beta didn`t seem to work
 very well, knowing the stocks beta didn`t seem to tell me anything about what
 its average return was going to be.&quot;  

 French remembers that others had already developed
 results indicating that small stocks tend to buy average returns more than big
 stocks. &quot;And the result was that variables, like the ratio of the
 book value of equity to the market value of equity, mattered a lot in terms of
 identifying stocks with high expected returns and stocks with low expected
 returns. What we`ve discovered since then is there`s no magic about
 book-to-market. You can measure it with dividend yield, earnings price, cash
 flow to price, basically anything where you have some fundamental value in the
 numerator and price in the denominator. So, it`s a way to scale price,
 basically, and the way I like to think of it is, we`re looking a discount
 rate. You get a discount, for example, for future cash flows at the expected
 return on the market. If you have a high-expected return, you get a high cash
 fair price. So a high cash fair price maps in higher expected return.
 Basically, it`s using the idea that the expected return that we as investors
 are looking at on the stock is the same thing as the discount rate or the cost
 of capital that the firm has to be thinking about. That`s an easy way to
 identify differences in expected returns.&quot; 

 Since the three-factor model seems to be so
 effective, investors may be wondering if the capital asset pricing model is no
 longer relevant. &quot;That`s a tough question. The evidence is
 pretty strong that as far back as we can see, there seems to be little
 relation between beta, the fundamental variable of the capital asset pricing
 model, and average returns on stocks. Maybe it`s my upbringing, but if
 the argument is so compelling that stocks that vary a lot with the market
 bring a lot of risk to people`s portfolio, they`re bringing a lot of risk,
 people are going to demand a higher premium. So, I`m not willing to say no,
 there`s nothing that the cap end tells us about differences in expected
 returns, but what I think we can say is, you have to add other variables. In addition to beta, I think what matters is sensitivity to what we call size
 risk and then, sensitivity to something we call distress risk . And
 the size risk, it`s basically the size factor we see. Small stocks, again,
 have more of this size risk and more of the expected return. The distress
 risks, that`s the book-to-market, or the cash flow to price, earnings price,
 that`s that variable that we`re talking about. Companies that are really sick,
 bad opportunities, poor investments, they have a higher expected return.&quot; Professor French opines that investors are seeking a premium when investing in
 a company with poor prospects. &quot;Companies that have great
 opportunities, very robust, things are going well in their industry, it
 appears that the market is willing to invest at a lower expected return for
 those companies.&quot;

 WOW! 
What a great article The equity risk premium has puzzled researchers for
 years. In a nutshell it is the finding that the equity risk premium demanded
 by investors is too large to be explained by changes in stock returns or
 changes in consumption unless very high levels of risk aversion were assumed.
 (See Grossman-Schiller, 1981, Mehra-Prescott 1985). In a forthcoming JF
 article, Ait-Sahalia, Parker, and Yogo may have taken much of the mystery out
 of the puzzle. Acknowledging that the puzzle can not be explained by looking
 at co-movements with overall consumption, the authors, break consumption down
 into basic and luxury components. Predictably the luxury component of
 consumption is more volatile AND covaries significantly more with stock
 returns than does aggregate consumption. Then when the equity premium is
 examined relative to the consumption of the luxury consumption, the size of
 the premium can be explained by a much lower risk aversion. Additionally,
 rather than relying on inaccurate government data or biased reported data, the
 authors look at actual consumption of luxury goods. A VERY cool paper!!!!!!! I
 was so excited by this one I ran down and interrupted a colleague. Be sure to
 read it!
 http://www.afajof.org/Pdf/forthcoming/AitSahalia-Parker-Yogo.pdf   

 While there now seems to be evidence that herding
 happens, I still am not really sure what to make of the herding papers. Of
 course they conflict (at least partially) with the more extreme views of
 efficient markets, but I am not sure how much. For example, it is logical to
 watch and observe other traders in order to better gauge the supply and demand
 curves other investors have. That said, the papers are always almost always
 interesting (especially Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995)). A forthcoming
 JF article by Feng and Seasholes is no exception. Using a cool data set that
 identifies where the locale of the individual Chinese traders, the authors
 find that trades are&quot;highly correlated&quot;even when geographically
 separated. This suggest to be&quot;evidence of market-wide shocksand
 little evidence ofgroup psychology.&quot;Additionally it appears that
 those traders who live nearer firm&apos;s HQ have better information. http://www.afajof.org/Pdf/forthcoming/feng_seasholes_20031023.pdf   

 In spite of an abundance of studies that suggest the
 existence of calendar anomalies (days of the week, late summer, year end,
 month end) they make no sense to me. (and yes I realize some can be explained
 away using microstructure or tax explanations). That said I was very happy to
 stumble upon this paper by Gerlach when at the Southern Finance Association
 meetings. He finds that macro news events can describe most of the anomalies
 away. So score one more for efficient markets :)

 STANFORD GRADUATE
 SCHOOL OF BUSINESS  In the &apos;70s and &apos;80s, women battled for
 equality. They wanted to enter the workplace, work as hard as men, and be
 rewarded the same way. Unfortunately, says Myra Strober, Stanford professor of
 education, many of them got most of what they wanted. Now their daughters
 realize that their mothers didn&apos;t ask for enough. 

 Strober drew a
 primarily alumnae audience in January for her talk&quot;Work and Families,
 the Unfinished Revolution,&quot;sponsored by alumni Lifelong Learning. Many
 professional women are finding that they cannot work 50 or 60 hour weeks,
 travel at the drop of a hat, and still care for their children. Many men whose
 wives are employed also cannot adequately balance work responsibilities and
 their desire to help raise their children. Society, she said, needs to
 reconstruct the workplace, to rethink responsibilities for raising children,
 and to learn to talk about a work life balance, not simply work and family. 

 The roles of men and
 women have changed in the past 30 years, but there has been no serious
 discussion of changing the workplace. Strober called for part-time jobs that
 are not labeled as&quot;mommy tracks&quot;designed for people who aren&apos;t
 serious about their careers, for pro-rated benefits for part-time employees,
 and for genuine flexibility in career tracks. She also suggested that the
 United States enact legislation that provides for a one year partially paid
 parental leave for the arrival of a new child, which both parents can share;
 and for an overhauled child-care system she estimates will cost $26 billion
 per year. 

 At the heart of many
 of her calls for change is the need to overhaul our attitudes toward child
 rearing. If we don&apos;t change services available and attitudes toward raising
 children, Strober warned,&quot;people will opt out entirely and choose not to
 have children.&quot; 

 &quot;Children are a
 public good that we all have to support,&quot;she said. 

 To see how lives have
 changed, Strober cited statistics showing that in 1977 the average combined
 workweek for a couple was 81 hours per week. In 2002 that had risen to 91
 hours. The time parents spent with children increased from 5.2 to 6.2 hours
 per day in the same period. Not surprisingly, the time men and women spent on
 themselves also changed. In 1977 fathers spent an average of 126 minutes on
 themselves, compared to 78 minutes today while mothers dropped from 96 minutes
 to 54 spent on themselves. 

 Strober&apos;s most recent
 book is The Road Winds Uphill All the Way: Gender, Work, and Family in the
 United States and Japan that surveyed 1981 men and women graduates of
 Stanford and Tokyo universities. 
 
 
 
 HooRay
for Google! Down With Yahoo! 

 

 Yahoo
is expanding a program that lets advertisers pay to ensure that their sites are
included in its search results. 

 

 Is
this new Yahoo policy an abuse of advertising? I don&apos;t seem to mind the
tiny advertising boxes that appear on many Google searches, because I know they
are advertisements, and they are not obtrusive.  But I can&apos;t say that
I go along with the following new policy of Yahoo.  It&apos;s
just one step away of the highly abusive policy of listing all advertiser sites
before listing the most relevant sites in a search outcome.   

 

 The
new Yahoo policy is CAO --- Crap Always Out

most abusive in what I call CFO --- Crap First Out. 

 

 

 &quot;Yahoo
Search Results To Include Paid Links,&quot;by Mylene Mangalindan, The Wall
Street Journal , March 2, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107817895456643322,00.html?mod=technology_main_whats_news 
 Approach Means Surfers
 Won&apos;t Be Able to Tell
Which Sites Made Payments to Be Included 
 Yahoo Inc., the nation&apos;s second largest search engine, is aggressively expanding a
 program that lets advertisers pay to ensure that their sites are included in
 search results. 

 Yahoo
 executives say the payments won&apos;t improve a site&apos;s ranking on the list of
 results that appear after a search. But at the same time, Yahoo acknowledged
 that there will be no distinguishing marks to alert Web surfers that a company
 had paid to be included. 

 Yahoo&apos;s
 new approach is expected to begin Tuesday. The Sunnyvale, Calif., Internet
 company has already been using a similar approach on its shopping-oriented Web
 pages, but it&apos;s now expanding the program to its entire site. 

 The
 move is likely to add fuel to the growing battle between Yahoo and its main
 rival, Google Inc., which has surpassed Yahoo to become the nation&apos;s most
 popular search site. 

 Google
 ( www.google.com ),
 of Mountain View, Calif., says it doesn&apos;t let advertisers pay to be included
 in its traditional search results. Google does allow advertisers to pay for
 promotions that appear alongside search results, but these are clearly labeled
 as&quot;sponsored links.&quot;Google executives say their users favor this
 neutral, technology-driven approach. (Yahoo also continues to have a separate&quot;sponsored&quot;section for advertisers.) 

 Google co-founder
 Larry Page said Google separates and labels advertising, much the way
 newspapers distinguish between news stories and advertising. He questioned
 whether Yahoo would prevent advertisers from influencing search rankings, as
 well as results.&quot;It&apos;s really tricky when people start putting things in
 the search results,&quot;he said. 

 The problem for Yahoo
 users is that they won&apos;t be able to tell which results are paid for and which
 aren&apos;t. Currently, search results are divided into two parts: For example,
 type in&quot;dog walkers&quot;and hit&quot;return.&quot;At the top of the
 page that then pops up -- and also in the right-hand column -- are&quot;sponsored&quot;links, listing dog walkers or related businesses that
 paid for the premium position. Below that are what until now have been
 unsponsored findings listed under the heading,&quot;Top 20 Web Results.&quot; 

 Under the new system,
 that second layer of findings will include both paid and unpaid links. But
 there is no way to find out if a specific company that comes up has paid or
 not. Yahoo will include only a general disclosure about the new program, on a
 separate page. (To read it, Web surfers must click on the phrase&quot;What&apos;s
 this?&quot;) 

 If Web site operators
 want to be included in the new program, they must pay an annual subscription
 fee of $49 to list one Internet address and $29 each for their next nine
 addresses. On top of that, companies must pay Yahoo a fee for each person that
 clicks on their search listing. 

 The move comes two
 weeks after Yahoo dropped search technology from Google in favor of its own
 technology. Google is the top-ranked site that Internet users visit when
 conducting Web searches. About 35% of all Web searches in the U.S. are
 conducted on Google&apos;s sites, while 28% of them are done on Yahoo&apos;s sites,
 according to comScore Media Metrix, a unit of comScore Networks Inc., a
 market-research firm. 

 Analysts say Yahoo&apos;s
 move may arouse suspicions among computer users that the search results, and
 rankings, are being influenced by advertisers. It&apos;s a&quot;trust issue,&quot;said Charlene Li, an analyst at market-research firm Forrester Research Inc.&quot;Is this really the most relevant result or not?&quot; 

 Yahoo says the
 program helps users by delivering information that its own or other search
 technology might miss.&quot;Our goal is to deliver the highest quality search
 results,&quot;said Tim Cadogan, Yahoo&apos;s vice president of search.&quot;We&apos;re
 going to gain users,&quot;he says, because&quot;we&apos;re delivering better
 results.&quot; 

 Under Yahoo&apos;s&quot;content acquisition program,&quot;advertisers pay to have their sites
 surveyed by Yahoo software that&quot;crawls&quot;the Web periodically,

 &quot;Ask
Jeeves Discontinues &apos;Paid-Inclusion&apos; Search Plan,&quot;by Mylene Mangalindan, The
Wall Street Journal , March 3, 2005 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107827881934145010,00.html?mod=technology_main_whats_news 
 
 Ask
 Jeeves Inc., an Internet search technology company, is dropping its
 program allowing advertisers and Web site operators to pay to ensure inclusion
 in the company&apos;s search index. The company&apos;s&quot;paid-inclusion&quot;program adversely affects the results that Internet users see, Ask Jeeves
 said. 

 &quot;We&apos;ve
 found it impacts relevance of the results&quot;for the users, said Jim
 Lanzone, vice president of product management at AskJeeves.&quot;That&apos;s
 something that we don&apos;t think is in the best interest of our users.&quot; 

 Paid-inclusion
 programs have been controversial because some users worry that the payments by
 Web site operators influence their ranking among the search results. Instead,
 some users prefer a neutral, technology-driven approach that clearly
 distinguishes advertisements from the results generated by search technology. 

 Ask
 Jeeves is eliminating its paid-inclusion program called Index Express over the
 next 30 days, when most of its remaining contracts expire, said Mr. Lanzone.
 The Emeryville, Calif., company says it makes enough money from search-related
 advertisements that it can afford to drop the paid-inclusion program, which
 doesn&apos;t have a material impact on the company&apos;s revenue. 

 Yahoo Inc., the second-ranked search site, began aggressively expanding its own
 paid-inclusion program Tuesday. Google Inc., the top-ranked Web search site,
 doesn&apos;t have a paid-inclusion program. 
 
 How
About a Game
of Bingo for Ethics Fun and Learning? 

 Using Games to Enhance Student Understanding of Professional and Ethical
Responsibilities, by M. Elizabeth Haywood, Dorothy A. McMullen, and Donald E.
Wygal, Issues in Accounting Education , February 2004, pp. 85-100 --- http://aaahq.org/ic/browse.htm 
 
   ABSTRACT: Given recent corporate scandals, the
 credibility of the accounting profession has been called into question. In
 order to restore public trust, accounting educators need to devise ways to
 convey the importance of ethics in our profession to our students. An
 alternative approach to using a traditional lecture to teach ethics is to use
 games. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a game strategy to teach
 ethics and professionalism to students. Using games makes learning more fun
 and also helps to maintain student interest and involvement in the learning
 process. Student feedback has been positive and encouraging on the use of this
 format to teach ethics and professional responsibilities.

 Where
are some great resources (hard copy and electronic) for teaching ethics ? 

 &quot;An
Inventory of Support Materials for Teaching Ethics in the Post-Enron Era, by
C. William Thomas, Issues in Accounting Education , February 2004, pp.
27-52 --- http://aaahq.org/ic/browse.htm 
 
 ABSTRACT: This paper presents a&quot;Post-Enron&quot;annotated bibliography of resources
for accounting professors who wish to either design a stand-alone course in
accounting ethics or who wish to integrate a significant component of ethics
into traditional courses across the curriculum. Many of the resources
listed are recent, but some are classics that have withstood the test of time
and still contain valuable information. The resources listed include texts
and reference works, commercial books, academic and professional articles, and
electronic resources such as film and Internet websites. Resources are
listed by subject matter, to the extent possible, to permit topical access. Some observations about course design, curriculum content, and instructional
methodology are made as well.

 I
have some comments on Billys fine contribution that provides a start to
inventorying resources.   It is
especially great for early history to some of the classic works such as Carl
Devines great essays.   There are
huge historical oversights as well, notably the early warnings of the decline in
ethics and professionalism from Abe Brilhoff --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm#References 

 Where
Billys inventory is really weak is on the current books and journals that
probably provide more interesting reading to young students in ethics courses.   For
example, he makes no mention of the truly shocking books by Watkins, Tofler,
Glass, and the various other more current books listed at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm#References 

 He
makes no references to the truly important articles written by Paul Volker ( The
Culture of Greed Sucked the Blood Out of Professionalism )
and Art Wyatt (They Still Dont Get It).   See http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm#References 

 There
are Web citations and   links to the
literature of scandals in the big accounting firms such as those listed at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm#others 

 I
guess my criticism is that Billys inventory is better for teaching the
history of accounting ethics literature than for teaching current documents,
current learning games (e.g., Bingo ethics),   and
current videos available on the Web such as the Enron party and the Worldcom
party videos --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm 

 Billy
provides the start of a great inventory, but it badly needs to be expanded and
updated.

 &quot;Where
Are All the Poison Pills?&quot;by Robin Sidel, The Wall Street Journal, March 2, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107818176447743400,00.html?mod=home%5Fwhats%5Fnews%5Fus   
 
 The
 poison pill, one of the most popular corporate-takeover defenses of the past
 two decades, is getting tougher to swallow. 

 Faced
 with opposition from activist shareholders and new pressures to clean up
 governance after corporate scandals, companies are dismantling what has been
 one of the best known of the antitakeover mechanisms. In the past month, Circuit
 City Stores Inc., Goodyear
 Tire&amp;Rubber Co., FirstEnergy Corp., PG&amp;E Corp., and Raytheon Co., among others, all took steps toward eliminating their pills. 

 So far
 this year, a dozen companies have taken steps to dismantle their pills,
 compared with 29 for all of 2003 and just 18 in 2002, according to TrueCourse
 Inc., which tracks corporate-takeover defenses. Although such actions
 typically are heaviest just ahead of the annual-meeting season in which
 shareholders air gripes, people who follow corporate-governance issues say the
 trend is likely to continue through the year. 

 Meanwhile,
 fewer companies are putting the measure in place: The rate of new poison-pill
 adoptions fell to a 10-year low in 2003, according to TrueCourse. About 99
 companies adopted new plans in 2003, down 42% from the prior year. 

 While
 there may still be a net gain in pills this year, the figures show the sharp
 decline in the rate of increase.&quot;In the current environment, there is an
 increasing desire by boards to be viewed as following good governance and not
 be entrenched,&quot;says Alan Miller, co-chairman of proxy-solicitation firm
 Innisfree M&amp;A Inc.&quot;This is the flavor of the day, and it&apos;s going to
 accelerate.&quot;

 Our wonderful English language! 

 There is a two-letter word that perhaps has more meaning than any other
two-letter word, and that is&quot;UP.&quot;If you are not confused after
reading this you must really be messed&quot;UP.&quot; 

 It&apos;s easy to understand UP, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list
but when we waken in the morning, why do we wake UP. At a meeting, why does a
topic come UP? 

 Why do we speak UP and why are the officers UP for election and why is it UP
to the secretary to write UP a report? We call UP our friends, we use it to
brighten UP a room, polish UP the silver, we warm UP the leftovers and clean UP
the kitchen. We lock UP the house and some guys fix UP the old car. 

 At other times the little word has real special meaning. 

 People stir UP trouble, line UP for tickets, work UP an appetite, mess UP and
think UP excuses. To be dressed is one thing but to be dressed UP is special,
and this is confusing. 

 A drain must be opened UP because it is stopped UP. We open UP a store in the
morning but we close it UP at night. We seem to be pretty mixed UP about UP. 

 To be knowledgeable of the proper uses of UP, look UP the word in the
dictionary. In a desk size dictionary, UP takes UP almost 1/4th the page and
definitions add UP to about thirty. 

 If you are UP to it, you might try building UP a list of the many ways UP is
used. It will take UP a lot of your time, but if you don&apos;t give UP, you may wind
UP with a hundred or more. 

 When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding UP. When the sun comes out
we say it is clearing UP. When it rains, it wets UP the earth. When it doesn&apos;t
rain for a while, things dry UP. 

 One could go on and on, but I&apos;ll wrap it UP, for now my time is UP, so I&apos;ll
shut UP...!!!!!! 

 Just one last thing....when we pass on I hope we go UP ^^^^^^^^

 Reasons why the English language is so hard to learn: 
1) The bandage was wound around the wound. 
2) The farm was used to produce produce. 
3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse. 
4) We must polish the Polish furniture. 
5) He could lead if he would get the lead out. 
6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. 
7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was time to
present the present. 
8) A bass was painted on the head of the bass drum. 
9) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes. 
10) I did not object to the object. 
11) The insurance was invalid for the invalid. 
12) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row. 
13) They were too close to the door to close it. 
14) The buck does funny things when the does are present. 
15) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer line. 
16) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow to sow. 
17) The wind was too strong to wind the sail. 
18) After a number of injections my jaw got number. 
19) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear. 
20) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests. 
21) How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend? Let&apos;s face it - English is a crazy language. 
 There is no egg in eggplant, nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine
in pineapple. English muffins weren&apos;t invented in England or French fries in France. 
Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren&apos;t sweet and are meat. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that
quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is
neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write but fingers don&apos;t fing, grocers don&apos;t 
groce and hammers don&apos;t ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn&apos;t the plural of booth, beeth? 
One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn&apos;t it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend. If you
have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do
you call it? If teachers taught, why didn&apos;t preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats 
vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? Sometimes I think all the English speakes should be committed to an 
asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship 
by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a
wise guy are opposites? You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your 
house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling
it out, in which an alarm goes off by going on. 
 English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the 
creativity of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all. 
That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the 
lights are out, they are invisible. Forwarded by Team Carper Do you have a 710 on your car?

 piece had always been there. The mechanic gave her a piece of paper and
 a pen and asked her to draw what the piece looked like. She drew a circle
 and in the middle of it wrote 710. He then took her over to another car
 which had its hood up and asked&quot;is there a 710 on this car?&quot; She pointed and said,&quot;Of course, its right there.&quot;

 Employment application blanks always
ask who is to be notified in case of emergency. I think you should write,&quot;A GOOD DOCTOR!&quot; 

 Why do they put pictures of criminals
up in the Post Office? What are we supposed to do...write to these men? Why
don&apos;t they just put their pictures on postage stamps so the mailmen could look
for them while they delivered the mail? 

 I was thinking about how people seem to
read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on me... they

 About Worms 

 Little Johnny watched the science
teacher start the experiment with the worms. 

 Four worms were placed into four
separate jars. 

 The first worm was put into a jar of
alcohol. 

 The second worm was put into a jar of
cigarette smoke. 

 The third worm was put into a jar of
sperm. 

 The fourth worm was put into a jar of
soil. 

 After one day, these were the results: 

 The first worm in alcohol - dead. 

 Second worm in cigarette smoke - dead. 

 Third worm in sperm - dead. 

 Fourth worm in soil - alive. 

 So the Science teacher asked the class
-&quot;What can you learn from this experiment.&quot; 

 Little Johnny quickly raised his hand
and said 

 &quot;As long as you drink, smoke and
have sex, you won&apos;t have worms.&quot;

Penguins 
Let me tell you a cute story about Southwest Airlines.   My neighbor&apos;s daughter flew from Dallas to San
Antonio recently on Southwest Airlines.   Buckled
in the front seats were two Emperor Penguins bound for Sea World.   The crazy flight attendants (they generally are lots of fun) on Southwest
announced that they would let the Penguins walk down and back up the main aisle
of the plane if the passengers promised not to touch.   And so the penguins waddled up and down while a flight attendant followed
with a pooper-scooper.   It seemed to
the passengers that the one-hour flight was over in about ten minutes. 
 
 Survivor Texas Style 

 Due to the popularity of the Survivor shows, NBC is planning to do a new
survivor show entitled Survivor-Texas Style&quot;. 

 The contestants will start in Dallas , travel to Waco , Austin ! , San Antonio , over to Houston , and down to Brownsville . They will then proceed up El Paso , then to Midland , Odessa , Lubbock , and Amarillo . From there they will proceed to Ft. Worth , and finally back to Dallas . 

 Each will be driving a pink Volvo with bumper stickers that read:&quot;I&apos;m
gay...I love the Dixie Chicks....I&apos;m a vegetarian....I voted for Al
Gore....George Strait Sucks....Hillary in 2004!... and I&apos;m here to confiscate
your guns!&quot;  

 This will be the first show on television with no survivors.

 eighth-graders to pass the AIMS (Arizona&apos;s Instrument to Measure Standards)
 math test they&apos;ll face in April.&quot;This is the correction of an
 error,&quot;Arizona schools chief Tom Horne said.&quot;The problem is the
 way the test is scored.&quot;In the past four years, no more than 21 percent
 of Arizona&apos;s eighth-graders have passed the AIMS math test, well below the
 passing rate of students who take the test in other grades. To pass,
 eighth-graders must get 78 percent of the 50 math questions correct. State
 officials want to change that passing score to about 72 percent, allowing
 students to miss three more questions. Had the change been in place in 2003,
 Horne said, 32 percent, instead of 21 percent, of Arizona&apos;s eighth-graders
 would have passed the test.&quot;

 &quot;WARNING&quot; by
Jenny Joseph --- http://www.jessiesweb.com/warning2.htm   

 When I am an old woman I shall
wear purple
With a red hat which doesn&apos;t go, and doesn&apos;t suit me.
And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves
And satin sandals, and say we&apos;ve no money for butter.
I shall sit down on the pavement when I&apos;m tired
And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells
And run my stick along the public railings
And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
I shall go out in the slippers in the rain
And pick the flowers in other people&apos;s gardens
And learn to spit. 

 You can wear terrible shirts
and grow more fat
And eat three pounds of sausages at a go
Or only bread and pickle for a week
And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes. 

 But now we must have clothes
that keep us dry
And pay our rent and not swear in the street
And set a good example for the children.
We must have friends to dinner and read the papers. 

 But maybe I ought to practice a
little now!
So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised
When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple. 

The above poem fits my high school literature teacher to a T,
although I&apos;m certain she never dressed shabbily or&quot;learned to spit.&quot;  Her name was Mrs. Kahlar. She wore large colorful hats and appeared
outdoors dressed at all times like she was going to a wedding --- generally in
purple and lavender and pink. She rattled about, occasionally a bit tipsie,
inside an enormous three-story mansion where she lived all alone beside our high
school. She took a personal interest in each and every student. Any
student was invited to stop by at any time day or night for a Coke and
conversation.   

 On the pillared front porch of that
mansion, she had an antique school desk that was always stacked with books that
friends and strangers could walk off with --- she hoped they did as long as they
intended to read them. There were also apples on the desk, because
teachers are always associated with apples since the early days of education on
the prairie when farmers with no money sent food to school for the
teacher. After she died, her big house was a treasure trove of
collectables and trash. Some time later, a seven-foot tall man named Randy
fixed up the old mansion. It&apos;s now known as The Heartland Bed and
Breakfast Inn --- http://www.nwiowabb.com/heart.htm   

 My wife and I stayed in The
Heartland after we sold my parents&apos; house. The fabulous inside of the
house and the front porch brought back many fond memories of a tiny literature
teacher in purple and lavender and pink.

&quot;Starting Salary Offers for Grads on the Rise, But Accounting Salaries
Remain Flat,&quot; SmartPros , March 1, 2004 --- http://www.smartpros.com/x42651.xml  
 
 BETHLEHEM, Penn., Feb. 26, 2004 (SmartPros) This
 year&apos;s crop of college graduates will be in a better position than their 2003
 counterparts. A new report shows upward movement in starting salary offers to
 new college graduates. 

 Released this month, the Winter 2004 Salary Survey
 report by the National Association of Collegse and Employers shows&quot;positive signs in the job market for new college graduates,&quot;said
 Marilyn Mackes, NACE executive director.&quot;It&apos;s important to recognize
 that the job market isn&apos;t booming, but we are seeing improvement.&quot; 

 Mackes said that last year at this time, nearly half
 the disciplines tracked in a salary survey were experiencing decreases in
 their average starting salaries. In contrast, in the Winter 2004 Salary
 Survey, just under a third saw average offers drop. 

 In general, there is a conservative movement among
 the business disciplines. Salary offers to accounting majors have remained
 flat, nudging up a mere 0.1 percent to $42,045. Offers to business
 administration/management majors rose two percent for an average of $37,368.
 And marketing/marketing management majors saw their average offer tick up one
 percent to $36,071. 

 NACE will release an updated salary report in April. 
 
 &quot;In summer, we fish and make love,&quot;one
Laplander deadpanned.&quot;In winter, we fish less.&quot; 

&quot;The White Stuff,&quot;By Alan Riding, The New York Times ,
February 29, 2004 --- http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/29/arts/design/29RIDI.html  
 
 ROVANIEMI, Finland 

 There is not much to do in Finland&apos;s Lapland in
 winter. Kemi, a port city at the northern end of the frozen Gulf of Bothnia,
 has a Snow Castle that includes a hotel where tourists can sleep on slabs of
 ice; 90 miles to the north on the frozen River Ounasjoki, Rovaniemi is gateway
 to Santa Claus Village, where letters can be mailed to the old benefactor in
 his hideaway on the North Pole. 

 &quot;In summer, we fish and make love,&quot;one
 Laplander deadpanned.&quot;In winter, we fish less.&quot; 

 But an unusual outdoor art exhibition called&quot;The Snow Show&quot;has briefly added Kemi and Rovaniemi to the circuit
 of destinations for adventurous art tourists eager to brave subzero
 temperatures. Earlier this month, mysterious multicolored sculptures of snow
 and ice began rising from the frozen landscape. Then, as natural and transient
 as their setting, the works of art will begin to melt and be gone by early
 April. 

 For the next four weeks or so, though, they should
 stand proud. They come in all shapes and sizes, some abstract, some
 figurative, but the key variable is their material. Those made of snow are
 interesting mainly for their geometric forms because, at least from afar,
 packed snow looks as ordinary as white concrete. Happily, most works have used
 ice, which exudes an effortless translucent beauty, at times radiating a soft
 pale green, at other times evoking a shattered window pane.

&quot;Microsoft Proposes Caller ID for E-Mail,&quot;by Michael Singer, I nternetNews.com ,
February 25, 2004 --- http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3317611  
 
 In his quest to kill spam, Microsoft Chief Software
 Architect Bill Gates Tuesday appealed to security leadership, asking them to
 adopt his fledgling&quot;Caller ID for E-mail&quot;program. 

 The multi-tiered project would act much like how
 caller identification for telephones shows the phone number of the person
 calling. The proposal is part of the Redmond, Wash.-based company&apos;s
 Coordinated Spam Reduction Initiative (CSRI). 

 &quot;Spam is both a nuisance and a security
 threat,&quot;Gates said to attendees at week&apos;s RSA Conference 2004 here
 emphasizing that using white lists or what Microsoft calls&quot;rich
 safe-listing&quot;e-mail is key.&quot;Having e-mail come in, and not really
 being able to identify where it comes from, this is a huge security hole. And
 like so many of the standards and protocols that grew up on the Internet in
 the early days, we need to strengthen these in this environment where there is
 malicious activity.&quot; 

 Despite heavy industry and government involvement,
 however, Microsoft is moving ahead with its own plans. The company is calling
 for system-wide changes to the e-mail infrastructure and asking for
 high-volume e-mail senders to demonstrate their compliance with reasonable
 policies and viable alternatives for smaller-scale senders to distinguish
 themselves from spammers. 

 &quot;We have some patents around this, we&apos;re saying
 are royalty free, available for everyone to use...&quot;Gates said. 

 The pilot implementation of Gate&apos;s Caller ID for
 E-Mail is debuting on Microsoft&apos;s popular Hotmail service, which began
 publishing outbound IP addresses this week. The testing will be extended to
 check inbound addresses on some 100 million free e-mail accounts early this
 summer. 

 Gates said the project would then be extended to
 Microsoft Exchange systems to run filtering.

&quot;Geeks do *so* have friends,&quot;b y Lucy Sherriff, The Register ,
February 25, 2004 --- http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/35840.html  
 
 Gaming fans are a deeply social and friendly people,
 not isolated geeks. This is the main finding of a survey of gamers, published
 by GameMore, a UK gaming event co-ordinator. 

 The survey of GameMore&apos;s users showed that most
 people prefer to play in multiplayer mode, rather than against the computer.
 Of those remaining, very few expressed a preference for flying solo. 

 Matt Bellringer, technical director of GameMore, said
 computers were a new way to interact with people, not a way to hide from them. 

 &quot;We found that the main reason people enjoy
 computer games so much is because they like to compete and co-operate with
 other gamers, and that playing against the computer just isnt so much
 fun.&quot; 

 He argued that games developers should put more
 emphasis on the social aspect of gaming. Games with the right modes,
 connectivity and server support will be more successful because they will
 capitalise on the social experience of playing games in groups. It will also
 interest a wider section of the population in the pastime. 

 To prove its point, GameMore is running a series of
 group gaming sessions around the UK. The plan is that gamers will have a
 chance to meet and talk in the flesh, as well as play each other online. More
 information on that on their website.

 Honey, They Shrunk the Cameras 

 In tests of the newest crop of mini
digital cameras, it turns out that the best pictures came from the camera with
both the lowest price and the lowest megapixel rating, writes Walt. Go figure. 

 &quot;Honey,
They Shrunk the Cameras,&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal ,
February 18, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107706028702331957,00.html?mod=gadgets%5Fprimary%5Fhs%5Flt   
 
 In
 technology, as in the rest of life, numbers don&apos;t tell the whole story. When
 comparing digital cameras, you might expect that the best pictures would come
 from the most expensive models in any given class, or from the models with the
 highest megapixel rating -- a measure of maximum picture resolution. But it
 ain&apos;t necessarily so. 

 In
 fact, after testing four similar, name-brand digital cameras for this column,
 it turned out that the best pictures came from the camera with both the lowest
 price and the lowest megapixel rating. Go figure. 

 My
 assistant Katie Boehret and I tested four slim, lightweight digital cameras
 from Casio, Sony, Konica Minolta and Pentax. These are point-and-shoot models
 that are designed to be tiny enough to carry around in a pocket, while still
 capturing high-quality photographs. Each camera measures slightly larger than
 the size of a credit card and has a 3x optical zoom lens. 

 Whenever
 high-tech products get really small, their price tags get bigger, and these
 cameras are no exception. The least expensive of the four cameras goes for
 $300, while the most expensive costs a whopping $550. 

 Each is
 under an inch thick, but all have plenty of features to keep an amateur
 photographer happy. All can take short videos as well as still photos, and all
 have multiple shooting modes and flash settings. Two of our test cameras even
 boasted the hot new trend in digital cameras -- larger liquid-crystal-display
 screens that take up most of the camera&apos;s back side. 

 In our
 tests, I took mostly indoor photos with each camera at a favorite hangout of
 mine, my local cigar store. Katie snapped outdoor pictures of landscapes,
 monuments and people while wandering around Washington, D.C. 

 All
 four cameras took good pictures, and deciding which did best is necessarily a
 subjective judgment. But, after comparing similar pictures from the four
 cameras side by side on a computer screen, Katie and I consistently found the
 images from the low-end $299 Konica Minolta Dimage Xg to be the best overall. 
 
The fast and easy way to print pictures, but the price at fifty to seventy
cents per picture is about double the price for online prints.  Newsweek recommended the Olymbus P-10 and the Sony PictureStation DPP-EX50 on Page 65,
February 23, 2004. Both models sell for under $200.

Question
How can you look up a listing of the current movies, read somewhat frank
reviews, and type in your zip code to look up the theatres conveniently close by
and your movie choice&apos;s start times? 

   

Answer
Internet Movie Database --- http://us.imdb.com/  
You should first find the links to listings of current movies, select any one,
and find out something about it. You then click on&quot;Showtimes&quot;and will be prompted to feed in a zip code. You can also click down to
reviews that are sometimes quite critical so that you don&apos;t waste your time. Sometimes the reviews tell you what to expect. For example, one review of
The Passion of Christ was a&quot;Ten Thumbs Up&quot;review (it&apos;s rare to get
more than six thumbs up) --- http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/usercomments-107   

 This movie was good to
watch. I am not really that much of a religious man but I was very impressed.
This movie was very well done and it was also very vivid. I cringed when Jesus
was getting scourged on the back with those spikes. He was so torn. Those Romans
were just laughing the entire time they were doing this. I guess there are those
who really do find joy in other people&apos;s pain. I think that at the end, they had
wondered what the heck they had done. I could see a few faces that had looks of
concern after Jesus died. 

 The movie was good and I
shall not yearn to see it again. It is just a little too hard to watch. It&apos;s
pure torture. Good movie though. 

I could not find a negative review about the above movie, although many of
them were quite frank about the level of violence.   One
example of a review that will save you some money is the review of the current
film&quot;Twisted&quot;at http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0315297/   
 
 However, `Twisted&apos; dies at almost the very moment it
begins. Logic is a big tripwire, and the script sidesteps a lot of problems by
having characters just disappear for no reason, or in Jessica&apos;s case, simply
blackout. The ending is also a jumble, containing a complete lack of sense, and
it feels like the product of a screenwriter who was already two weeks late on
delivering a draft and needed something quick. The entire film is poorly paced
and awkwardly constructed, leaving little interest in the thriller proceedings
that pop up occasionally to remind the audience what they came for.

Ashley Judd is another blunder of the film. I&apos;ve liked Judd in the past,
especially in her trademark thriller roles (`Double Jeopardy,&apos; `High Crimes&apos;),
but she falters massively trying to bring Jessica to life. The appeal of the
textured character is evident, but Judd can&apos;t quite get a grip on the
psychological complexity of the role, relying on a hard-ass approach that her
elfish features betray. As Jessica&apos;s world continues to dissolve and suspicions
arise, Judd just gets worse, peaking with one scene that asks this hardened cop
to open the floodgates of tears, unexpectedly eliciting big laughs in the
process.

 NEW PUBLICATION  
 Balancing Acts: The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Academic
 Careers , by Mary Talor Huber --- http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/publications/balancing_acts.htm  
 
 How can faculty integrate the scholarship of
 teaching and learning into their academic careers? Balancing Acts addresses
 this question through the experience of four scholars who have been
 innovators in their own classrooms, leaders of education initiatives in
 their institutions and disciplines, and pioneers in the scholarship of
 teaching and learning. 

 Drawing on interviews with Dan Bernstein
 (psychology, University of Nebraska), Brian Coppola (chemistry, University
 of Michigan), Sheri Sheppard (mechanical engineering, Stanford University),
 Randy Bass (American literature, Georgetown University), and colleagues
 within and outside their institutions and fields, the author looks at the
 routes these pathfinders have traveled through the scholarship of teaching
 and learning and at the consequences that this unusual work has had for the
 advancement of their careers, especially tenure and promotion. 

 Lessons from these case studies will be of interest
 to scholars of teaching and learning and their advocates at colleges and
 universities of all kinds. 
 
Mark Shapiro asserts the following in&quot;Irreverent Commentary on the
State of Education in America Today,&quot;---  http://irascibleprofessor.com/comments-02-27-04.htm  
 
 Over the years some inside and outside the academy
 have characterized teaching and learning as fundamentally different from
 research and scholarly activities. In the Irascible Professor&apos;s opinion, that
 view is flawed. In many disciplines, a significant lore exists outside the
 knowledge found in conventional textbooks. Often one cannot learn the real
 essence of a discipline from the classroom experience alone. Students who have
 the opportunity to work with faculty members on research or scholarly projects
 gain much greater insights into the quality of knowledge in a discipline than
 those who learn only in the classroom. At the research universities it is
 primarily the graduate students who are able to learn through research; but,
 in the PUI&apos;s (Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions) many undergraduate students get this opportunity.

 Hello Bob Jensen, 

 Readers interested in
 Kierkegaard resources who visit your site might be very interested in this
 full length ebook in PDF format (448 pages!), offered as a public resource. 

 Please consider
 linking to it at your links page at: www.trinity.edu/rjensen/openshare.htm 

 Here is the link
 information: 

 Bruderhof Ebooks -
 Provocations: Spiritual Writings of Sren Kierkegaard http://www.bruderhof.com/e-books/Provocations.htm 

 Here is a longer
 description: 

 There are few authors
 as repeatedly quoted and consistently unread as Sren Kierkegaard.
 Kierkegaard himself is partly to blame for this: his style is dense, his
 thoughts complex. And yet embedded within his writings and journals are
 metaphors and truths so deep and vivid, they can overwhelm you with an almost
 blinding clarity. 

 Editor Charles E.
 Moore (a former professor at Denver Theological Seminary) has done us an
 invaluable service by putting together arguably the most accessible and
 complete Kierkegaard volume to be published in decades. Here is a book for
 anyone who takes the search for authenticity seriously. 

 Thank you for your
 consideration. 

 Best Wishes,

Can you do email from a cruise ship?

Answer
The cruse ship itself may offer such a service. Most of us can do email
from our universities if we have access to the Internet.

 Reader
Q: Does the new IBM ThinkPad X40 have a PS/2 port for an external keyboard
 and/or mouse, and if not, must one purchase the expensive docking station?
 Also, do you know why International Business Machines omitted the parallel
 printer port? 

 Mossberg
A: No, the X40 doesn&apos;t have a dedicated keyboard or mouse port, but you don&apos;t
 have to buy a docking station to connect an external keyboard or mouse. Most
 modern keyboards and mice connect via the ubiquitous USB port, and the X40 has
 two of those. In fact, the PS/2 keyboard port is on the way out. The parallel
 printer port is also becoming obsolete, again in favor of the USB port, which
 is now used by nearly all popular printers. Some corporations still use the
 PS/2 and parallel ports, however, and they would have to buy the dock for the
 X40, which includes both of these ancient connectors. 

 Q: My family will be traveling for almost three weeks
 in Europe this summer, much of the time on a cruise ship. My husband would
 like to find a device that will allow him to access e-mail from abroad without
 going to an Internet caf. Would a BlackBerry be a good choice for e-mail
 access, or is there something better? 

 A: Yes, a BlackBerry would work, if it had certain
 characteristics. It would have to be one of the models with a built-in phone
 that runs on the GSM/GPRS network and works in the frequency bands used in
 Europe. You might get such a model from T-Mobile, Cingular or AT&amp;T
 Wireless. 

 However, I am partial to the Treo, by palmOne, which
 is available in a GSM/GPRS version that works in Europe. You can buy this
 version from palmOne itself or from Cingular. You may have to install extra
 software or subscribe to an e-mail service. 

 There are two caveats with either of these options:
 Just getting the right hardware isn&apos;t enough. You also have to get a calling
 plan that allows for international calls and data. And I doubt either type of
 device will work well on the ship, unless it is very close to shore. Either
 device probably would be useless while you&apos;re on the open ocean.

 Hi Bob, thanks for providing
 information about authoring tools on http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/290wp/290wp.htm .
 I have two new authoring tools that may be of interest to you and your
 readers.   e-Learning Course
 Development Kit URL: http://www.e-learningconsulting.com/products/authoringtool.html   Many people use HTML editors
 such as Dreamweaver and FrontPage to create e-learning courses. While these
 editors are great for creating information they lack essential e-learning
 features. The e-Learning Course Development Kit provides these features. The
 Kit provides templates to create questions, course-wide navigation, a table
 of contents and links for a glossary and other information. The Kit creates
 courses that work with SCORM, a standard way to communicate with a Learning
 Management System (LMS). The support for SCORM lets you run the course in
 multiple sessions, keep track of bookmarks and record the student&apos;s progress
 through the course. The Kit can be purchased online for $99.   Test Builder URL: http://www.e-learningconsulting.com/products/testbuilder.html   Test Builder lets you author
 tests quickly and easily with a text editor. Absolutely no programming is
 required. With Test Builder you can create tests and quizzes with
 true-false, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank and matching questions. It
 can randomize the sequence of questions and choices and it can randomly
 select questions from a question pool. You can limit the number of attempts
 and set the passing score. Test Builder supports SCORM. Test Builder
 can be purchased online for $149.   We wanted to create e-learning
 tools that would work in an academic setting. So we created tools with
 these capabilities: - The tools are affordable. - They work for the casual user.
 You can create a small course or test without much fuss. - They come with documented
 source code so you can modify or extend the tools to meet your specific
 needs. - They add value to your
 existing investments in technology. They will deliver courses/tests in a
 browser and work with an LMS that supports SCORM 1.2.   Please let me know if you need
 more information about these tools. Thanks, Leo   Leo Lucas

 Since I just found a great device, I thought I&apos;d
 share it with you too. 

 As more faculty become technology aware, classrooms
 with computers, projectors and internet access are becoming harder to get. 

 In order to serve as many technology needs as
 possible, our school is preparing technology ready rooms - rooms in which a
 laptop may be hooked up to a projector, internet access, etc. 

 Carrying the laptop around campus is not my favorite
 activity. I use the laptop to display PowerPoint, prepared spreadsheets, and
 internet access for news stories and financial statements. 

 Now for the solution. Margi products produces&quot;Presenter to Go&quot;. Now I prepare my spreadsheets, PowerPoint, and
 search out my news, save the files or webpages to my Sony Clie (works with
 Palm Pilots too) and display it with a tiny little device that hooks in to the
 technology ready system. All I need to carry is my Clie and the 2 oz.,
 2&quot;x2&quot;device and plug. 

 As I see the process, the Margi software sends the
 PowerPoint or excel or anything else to a print file (it comes with its own
 printer driver) that is saved to my Clie and displayed with the help of the
 tiny device.

&quot;Greenspan Says Congress Should Limit Fannie, Freddie,&quot;by Dawn

 Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could pose
 a threat to the financial system, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
 Greenspan. 

 Mr. Greenspan called on Congress Tuesday to impose
 stringent restrictions on the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to issue
 debt and purchase assets, saying the growth of the institutions poses a risk
 to the safety of the U.S. financial system. 

 &quot;The Federal Reserve is concerned about the
 growth and the scale of the [government-sponsored enterprises&apos;] mortgage
 portfolios, which concentrate interest and prepayment risks at these two
 institutions,&quot;Mr. Greenspan said in written testimony to the Senate
 Banking Committee. Although he said he didn&apos;t think a crisis was imminent,&quot;preventative actions are required sooner rather than later.&quot; 

 &quot;GSEs need to be limited in the issuance of GSE
 debt and in the purchase of assets, both mortgages and non-mortgages, that
 they hold,&quot;he added in the written testimony.

He discusses
the state of the world economy and what it takes to be a CEO following the
depressing scandals and corruption of the past decade. He is very
committed to improving public schools NYC, the nation, and the world. A
great deal of this video is devoted to how business leaders can help public
education. 

  

Dilemma: Following a five-way bypass the GE Board offered Jack a $100 million departing&quot;gift&quot;which he turned down, but agreed to the accompanying perks
including use of GE&apos;s corporate jets. He discusses his subsequent highly
publicized divorce and his decision to give back the perks. In spite of
the perks, Jack Welch is devoted to doing something good for society for the
rest of his life. He&apos;s got a lot to offer. 

  

His forthcoming
book is called Win . In discusses how people do not shoot straight
in communicating and how frustrating this is life.   It is difficult to separate reasons from rationalizations at times, but
the video is worth watching. 

 
 
&quot;Fannie Mae Scolded for Relying
On Obsolete Accounting System,&quot;by John D. McKinnon and James R. Hagerty,
The Wall Street Journal, February 26, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107774602918839236,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us  
 
 Federal financial regulators said that Fannie
 Mae relies on 70 outmoded manual accounting systems that could lead to
 more problems similar to October&apos;s $1.1 billion error. 

 In a letter to the company Tuesday, the
 Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said the mortgage giant&apos;s use
 of so many manual systems, as opposed to fully automated and integrated ones,
 raises concern. The agency told Fannie Mae officials to submit a remediation
 plan within 30 days. 

 The letter marks the latest rebuke by
 regulators against Fannie Mae and its mortgage-market sibling, Freddie Mac.
 Last year, Ofheo imposed a $125 million penalty on Freddie Mac after the
 federally sponsored company was forced to restate its accounting by almost $5
 billion. Chief among Freddie Mac&apos;s sins was deliberate manipulation of its
 books by executives, but investigators also found sloppy accounting methods,
 including overreliance on manual systems. 

 Manual accounting systems typically
 refer to computer programs that are separate from the main accounting program,
 and allow for manual overrides. They are a concern to regulators because they
 create more room for human error, and thus require more review and controls,
 sapping resources from other accounting duties. 

 In July, soon after Freddie&apos;s problems
 came to light, Fannie Chairman Franklin Raines held a news conference to
 distance his company from the mess at Freddie Mac, where employees were
 sifting through years of old transactions while also reviewing and sometimes
 reversing longstanding accounting policies. 

 At the time, Mr. Raines said that
 unlike Freddie, Fannie had strong internal accounting controls. Last October,
 though, Fannie Mae had to correct a $1.1 billion accounting mistake that it
 briefly made in its financial reports. The error stemmed from a manual system
 that was being used to account for part of the company&apos;s derivatives business.
 Now the Ofheo letter suggests that the company has many more such manual
 systems. Fannie also faces a full-scale review by Ofheo of its accounting
 policies. 

 In response, a Fannie Mae spokesman,
 Chuck Greener, said the company is&quot;a leader in the use of technology in
 financial services,&quot;and added that&quot;virtually every financial
 institution in America&quot;has similar manual systems, also known as
 end-user systems. Mr. Greener said the company is&quot;very comfortable we
 will be able to respond to Ofheo&apos;s request fully.&quot; 

 In written testimony prepared for a
 Senate Banking Committee hearing Wednesday, Mr. Raines said:&quot;We have
 effective controls in place to protect against mistakes, and we have effective
 protections in place in the rare chance that something dramatic does
 happen.&quot; 

 The committee is preparing legislation
 that would tighten regulation of Fannie, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan
 Bank System. 

 A day earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman
 Alan Greenspan told the same committee that Fannie and Freddie pose&quot;very
 serious&quot;risks to the U.S. financial system because of the large amounts
 of mortgage loans they hold on their books, and the large amounts of federally
 subsidized debt they use to buy them up. Mr. Greenspan suggested explicit
 curbs on their debt. But Mr. Raines asserted that Fannie does a better job of
 hedging against risk than do banks. Both he and Richard F. Syron, Freddie&apos;s
 chairman and chief executive, urged Congress to avoid putting undue
 constraints on their growth.

 I am doing a comparison of Robodemo v5.0 elearning
 edition and Camtasia v2.02. I use both - sometimes in the same project. Both
 are very easy to use. 

 Robodemo advantages over Camtasia: The Flash hotspot
 output allow for quizzing that can be sent to a LMS (Learning Management
 System). Robodemo allows for limited scriptability with Javascript. 

 Camtasia has more output options - avi - mov - real -
 wnv - Camtasia v2.02 has some minor crash issues for some people, 

 Camtasia has a&quot;Theater&quot;utility which
 allows you to chain swf files together. Ehelp did have a utility called

February 28, 2004 reply from Bob Jensen
 
Thank you for the update Richard.

The one feature that I would like to see added is a convenient way of
 choosing between microphone audio versus line-in audio versus audio that is
 already stored on the computer. Sometimes what I would really like is to use
 Camtasia to record audio and/or video clips that are playing on the computer
 so I can insert these segments.

For example, suppose that I was recording a Camtasia video on fraud. It
 would be nice to be able to insert a small video segment of an ex con while
 explaining fraud in some program like Excel, PowerPoint, or Internet Explorer.

I realize that the Camtasia video degrades captured video due to a lower
 sampling rate (usually 5 frames per second) versus normal video frame rates of
 30 per second. However, this may not be a huge problem in short video clips as
 long as the audio is good.

In Camtasia it is possible to run a hard wire from the audio out jack on
 the back of the computer to the microphone jack, but this is a pain in the
 tail and does not generally lead to good capturing of audio.

Is there any solution for this until Tech Smith finally upgrades for better
 audio and video recording of something other than microphone voice while
 capturing Camtasia video?

Is this also a problem in Robodemo?

  I have been looking into this type of Flash
 tutorial creation software myself and found that Camtasia was well featured
 but not as powerful as RoboDemo, which is probably why Macromedia acquired the
 company. RoboDemo is also the most expensive: $500 Yikes! although educational
 pricing may be available. At the other end, I like Wink, which is FREE! If it
 does what you want then you can&apos;t beat Wink: http://www.debugmode.com/wink/  If it doesn&apos;t, then you have to pay. If your school is picking up the tab,
 then I would say go for RoboDemo unless you find it too difficult to use. I
 believe there is a 15-day trial version on the Macromdia site.

&quot;Roman Catholic Church of England: &apos;Love Your Taxes&apos;,&quot; AccountingWeb , February 24, 2004 --- http://www.accountingweb.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=98767  
 
 Could an 11th commandmentlove your taxesbe far
 off in England? The Roman Catholic Church of England and Wales has launched a
 campaign to encourage its 4.6 million members in the U.K. and Northern Ireland
 to embrace their inner taxpayer. A 40-page booklet called&quot;Taxation for
 the Common Good,&quot;offers the premise that rather than seeing taxes as an
 unfair penalty, they should be seen as a way people can participate morally in
 society, Reuters reported. 

 &quot;Taxes are very much based on the principles of
 solidarity, which is based on the commandment to love your neighbor,&quot;former Bishop Howard Tripp, Chairman of the Church&apos;s Committee for Public
 Life, told Reuters. 

 On average, Britons pay a basic rate on income of 22
 percent and 40 percent on anything over 29,900 pounds ($55,550) but the Churchs
 book doesnt get into what tax rate it considers equitable. 

 &quot;This document is suggesting taxes are a way to
 play our part and it is something we should be pleased to do...It&apos;s all part
 of our duty to our neighbor, stemming from our duty as social animals,&quot;he said. 

 The Church claims the booklet is not a party
 political statement and does not mention the tax policy of British Chancellor
 (Finance Minister) Gordon Brown, who has hiked taxes to help fund the
 country&apos;s ailing health service, Reuters reported. 

 Tripp said the booklet is intended to jumpstart
 public debate on the issue and to give taxation a moral standing in society.
 He said tax dodgers cheat themselves and their country. 

 &quot;If a person felt bound not to pay some tax to a
 certain cause they disagree with then they must follow their conscience, but I
 would urge them to look at other ways to deal with that problem, such as
 lobbying members of parliament.&quot;

When I searched on the word&quot; accounting ,&quot;I got eleven hits. Not all of these were really accounting, but some were
about accounting and were very interesting. For example, see Ancient

&quot;Museum without walls&apos; displays Egypt&apos;s glories,&quot;by Stephen
Strauss, The Globe and Mail , February 24, 2004 --- http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20040224.gtegypt24/BNStory/Technology/  
 
 Website designed by Toronto team gives close-ups of
 ancient and modern wonders 

 Experiencing the glories of Egypt, both ancient and
 modern, will become a lot easier starting today thanks to a groundbreaking
 joint effort of the Egyptian government and a Toronto-based team of Web
 designers. 

 The result of their three-year collaboration is a new
 website known as&quot;Eternal Egypt,&quot;paid for by a $2.5-million (U.S.)
 donation from the IBM corporation. 

 &quot;This project will enable us to treat the entire
 country of Egypt as a single museum that can be toured by individual visitors
 or a global audience,&quot;is how Farouk Hosni, Egypt&apos;s Minister of Culture,
 describes the endeavour that is being officially launched from Cairo today. 

 By going to the website -- http://www.eternalegypt.org -- a person sitting at a computer will be able to do such things as visit the
 Temple of Luxor or watch how the seated statue of Ramses II has changed over
 historical periods (once it was sheltered at the front of a temple, now it
 sits naked to the elements). 

 Tutankhamen&apos;s death mask is seen in such fine detail
 that holes made by decay or by the creation of the mask itself are visible.
 Structures that have disappeared, like the Lighthouse of Alexandria, destroyed
 in a 14th-century earthquake, are not just digitally recreated but can be
 viewed at different angles from all around the city&apos;s ancient harbour. 

 One of the project&apos;s revolutionary aspects is that
 people can download information while viewing various icons of Egyptian
 culture. Described as a&quot;museum without walls,&quot;the website can send
 information to the cellphones or hand-held computers of tourists who find
 themselves mesmerized but confused by the history of the monuments they see. 

 The information is accessible in English, French or
 Arabic, and can be heard as well as read. 

 The website provides the same sort of detail to
 people touring the Egyptian Museum, where many ancient artifacts are stored.
 It is, acknowledge all who see it, not the easiest museum to walk through
 because material is not well identified. 

 &quot;Why go to a museum and look at an object when
 you are not sure what you are looking at . . . and there are thousands of
 items [in the museum] which have no or confusing labels?&quot;said Aiden
 Tierney, a software developer with IBM in Toronto. Voice interpretation
 devices are available, but the new software package holds out the possibility
 of a more detailed presentation. 

 &quot;It&apos;s like nine books all together with
 different things devoted to everyone&apos;s different taste,&quot;is how Valerie
 Fox, senior creative director for IBM, describes the complexity of the
 website. 

 Not only does the site show ancient Egypt, but there
 are panoramic representations taken by web cams of the Temple of Luxor and the
 streets of Old Cairo. 

 The Toronto group, which was in charge of mounting
 and presenting information on the website, said the project held a number of
 challenges.

 You could soon be able to spice up your e-mails with your favourite perfume.
 UK net provider Telewest Broadband is testing a system to let people to send
 aromatic e-mails over the internet. 

 It has developed a kind of hi-tech air freshener that
 plugs into a PC and sprays a smell linked to the message. 

 Telewest say it could be used by supermarkets to
 tempt people with the smell of fresh bread or by holiday companies seeking to
 stir up images of sun-kissed beaches. 

 &quot;This could bring an extra whiff of realism to

Your request is vague Douglas. 

To become an administrator at a college, you should earn a doctorate and
probably gain experience on the faculty before you decide to become demoted to
an administrator. God bless our administrators who serve so diligently day to
day so the rest of us can do whatever we feel like doing.

One thing you might want to do is track the same literature that college
Presidents track. These include the following:

 Hong Kong&apos;s Electronic-Money Card Is a
Hit 

 In Hong Kong, the payment method known
as the Octopus card has become a widely accepted electronic currency, used to
buy a newspaper at 7-Eleven, a meal at a fast-food restaurant and even coffee at
Starbucks. 

 &quot;Electronic-Money Card In Hong
Kong Is a Hit,&quot;by Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal , February
19, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107715002812233389,00.html?mod=gadgets%5Fprimary%5Fhs%5Flt   
 
 HONG KONG -- When
 this city of nearly seven million began offering a way to pay for subway,
 ferry and bus fares electronically six years ago, it hoped its residents would
 quickly catch on. 

 Instead, the payment
 method, known as the Octopus card, has done more than just replace pocket
 change on the bus. It has become a widely accepted electronic currency, used
 to buy a newspaper at 7-Eleven, a meal at a fast-food restaurant, even coffee
 at Starbucks. 

 In all, more than
 12,000 locations across Hong Kong accept the card, including parking meters,
 municipal swimming pools and the popular horse-racing tracks. 

 It also has made the
 chief developer, subway operator MTR Corp., an unlikely consultant on
 electronic money to cities around the world. And while banks and credit-card
 companies have for years hyped a coming cashless society, Hong Kong&apos;s
 mass-transit operators appear to have an early edge, though no one thinks cash
 will disappear soon. 

 About 1% to 2% of all
 cash transactions in the city are made with the card, says Octopus Card Ltd.,
 a joint venture of the transit agencies that operates the card.&quot;Our
 business assumption is we&apos;re going to compete with cash,&quot;says Eric Tai,
 the venture&apos;s chief executive. 

 Octopus is a
 stored-value card and behaves like a debit card. Money is subtracted when the
 card is held over a reading device, which is a low-range radio transmitter
 that can be incorporated into doors, turnstiles and countertops. Because
 reading devices can detect a card through leather and plastic, many people
 never remove their card but rather wave their purse or wallet over the reader.
 There is even a $35 Octopus wristwatch, with the card technology built in.
 Funds can be added to the cards at machines in subway stations, convenience
 stores and via an automatic draw from a bank account. 

 Sometimes called
 smart cards, these stored-value cards are common in Asian cities, though with
 varied capabilities. In Seoul, South Korea, subway riders can use stored-value
 cards or some credit cards. In 2002, Taipei in Taiwan launched Easy Card for
 use across transit systems. Singapore&apos;s CashCard, developed in 1996, has had
 the most success in moving beyond mass transit, and is accepted at 10,000
 locations. But none have become as widely accepted as Octopus, or been able to
 match it as a standard suitable for being rolled out elsewhere. 

 In Hong Kong, Octopus
 emerged when MTR in the mid-1990s determined it was spending too much on
 magnetic-strip tickets, similar to those used in New York City and Washington,
 D.C. As the company studied the cost of implementing an all-electronic fare
 system, some managers suggested lowering the burden by sharing it with the
 city&apos;s major bus and ferry companies. (In Hong Kong, mass-transit operators
 are private companies that compete for routes.) 

 &quot;Some people
 said all we were going to do is give away market share&quot;to other
 operators, says Phil Gaffney, MTR&apos;s chief operating officer.&quot;But the
 view that prevailed was that we as a public-transport operator would benefit
 if there were an increase in public-transport trips overall.&quot; 

 MTR took a 57% stake
 in the Octopus Cards joint venture while other mass-transit firms split the
 rest. Octopus takes a small percentage of each transaction, just like a
 credit-card company does. The closely held company had revenue last year of
 around $21 million. 

 Meanwhile, MTR began
 to receive requests from other cities that wanted to emulate Hong Kong&apos;s
 success in getting citizens to adopt Octopus. Last fall, top executives met
 with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on that agency&apos;s ideas for
 a system that would serve the transit systems around New York. 
 
 
 
 &quot;Mailblocks
Will Keep Your Mail Spam-Free, Without the Guesswork.&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal , February 19, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,personal_technology,00.html 
 
 Most
 antispam programs take the form of add-ons to your normal e-mail program or
 service. And most rely on filtering, the effort to guess, usually imperfectly,
 which e-mails you receive are spam and which are legitimate. 

 But
 I&apos;ve been testing an antispam system that takes a better approach. It&apos;s a
 complete e-mail service that has antispam intelligence built right in. Instead
 of filtering, it uses a far more effective method that stops 100% of
 mass-mailed spam. 

 The
 program is called Mailblocks, and despite a few downsides, I like it a lot.
 It&apos;s aimed at consumers and small businesses, and doesn&apos;t work with corporate
 e-mail. But it has lots of sophisticated features, and can consolidate all of
 your e-mail accounts -- even AOL accounts -- into a single in-box. 

 Mailblocks
 is a Web-based e-mail service, like Yahoo Mail or Hotmail, that works on both
 Windows and Macintosh computers. But it is slicker and cleaner than Yahoo or
 Hotmail, with a very good, uncluttered interface that responds to commands
 quickly. If you&apos;d rather use a traditional e-mail program, you can read
 Mailblocks e-mail using Outlook, Outlook Express or Eudora on Windows, or
 Apple Mail or Entourage on the Macintosh. 

 The
 service is inexpensive. A free version, which has ads, gives you five
 megabytes of message storage and a Mailblocks e-mail address. For $9.95 a year
 -- that&apos;s a year, not a month -- you get 15 megabytes of storage, an ad-free
 screen, a Mailblocks e-mail address and the power to consolidate other e-mail
 accounts. For $24.95 a year, you get all of that and 100 megabytes of storage.
 On Hotmail or Yahoo, 100 megabytes of storage costs more than twice as much,
 and you get less effective spam protection and have to look at ads. Yahoo and
 Hotmail, however, have more features. 

 Mailblocks
 also allows you to send e-mail attachments of up to six megabytes each, a
 generous limit that&apos;s enough for multiple high-resolution photos. And if you
 don&apos;t like having the clumsy word&quot;mailblocks.com&quot;in your e-mail
 address, you can choose from 19 alternatives, including&quot;mailster.com,&quot;and&quot;emailwhiz.com.&quot; 

 You can
 divert e-mail from up to 10 of your current e-mail accounts to Mailblocks, and
 Mailblocks will apply its antispam system to all, including popular services
 like EarthLink, AOL, MSN, Yahoo Mail and Hotmail. You can also import address
 books from Outlook or Outlook Express and other programs, though you may have
 to go through several steps to do so. 

 Mailblocks
 uses a spam-control system called challenge/response. It&apos;s designed to stop
 all e-mail from the automated mass-mailing programs spammers use, while
 letting in e-mail from humans. Mailblocks isn&apos;t the first program to use
 challenge/response, but it does a very nice job with it. Here&apos;s how the system
 works. 

 All
 e-mail you receive from people in your address book is passed directly to your
 Mailblocks in-box. If any are sent to you from addresses not in your address
 book, they are met by an automatically generated&quot;challenge&quot;e-mail
 that asks the sender to copy a randomly generated number into a box. These
 E-mails aren&apos;t placed in your in-box, but go into a special Pending folder
 while awaiting a response. 

 If the
 sender copies the number correctly, the e-mail is moved to your in-box, and
 the address is added to your address book. Mailblocks will also add the sender
 to a master list, so he or she will never be challenged again when sending
 e-mail to any other Mailblocks user. 

 If the
 sender doesn&apos;t respond correctly to the challenge within 14 days, the e-mail
 will be deleted from the Pending folder. 

 All
 automated spam systems will fail this test, either because they can&apos;t stop and
 copy the number, or because they use false return addresses. Only human
 senders with genuine return addresses can pass the challenge. 

 If you
 don&apos;t want to subject unknown senders to the challenge, you can turn this
 feature off, but then you will get spam. 

 To
 receive&quot;good&quot;automated e-mail, such as online newsletters or
 purchase confirmations, Mailblocks lets users create special&quot;tracker&quot;e-mail addresses that can be used to sign up for various
 Web stores or services. When an automated mailing system sends an e-mail to
 one of your tracker addresses, it goes right to your in-box. 

 In my
 tests, these features worked perfectly, eliminating spam from my Mailblocks
 account and from those accounts consolidated inside Mailblocks. 

 Mailblocks
 also offers advanced e-mail features like automatic signatures, multiple
 folders, rules for sorting e-mail and automated vacation messages. 

 But
 there are some downsides. It doesn&apos;t scan e-mail attachments for viruses. It
 lacks a&quot;preview pane,&quot;so you can see what&apos;s in a message without
 opening it. It can&apos;t auto-complete e-mail addresses you start to type in. And
 there&apos;s no easy way to designate an entire domain -- a whole company, for
 instance -- as immune from challenges. The company says it plans to remedy
 some of these shortcomings in a new release due this summer that will also
 include a calendar function. 

 Overall,
 Mailblocks is a very good system for eliminating spam. And it will only get
 better.

 Auditor Fees 

 An FEI member
 recently asked research as to whether a database exists of how much audit
 firms charge in audit fees relative to size of clients and billable rates per
 hour. 

 FERF
 researchers found information broken down by company size in the recent FEI
 Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 survey results issued earlier in February http://www.fei.org/news/404_survey.cfm .
 Although billable rates are not given, an excel table details incremental
 audit fees for the Section 404 attestation and the % increase this fee
 represents of their current audit fee. Various groupings of responses are
 given by size of company based on revenue. 

 In April 2003,
 FEI&apos;s Committee on Corporate Reporting (CCR) surveyed its members on 2002
 audit fees. Twenty-five companies with total US assets of between $0.4 billion
 and $1,097 billion responded. Findings and an excel table are available under
 Finance Tools at http://www.fei.org/financetools/audit_fee.cfm

 Meet an Ex Con Named Walter
Pavlo Who Did Time in Club Fed 

What you find below is a message (actually three messages
and a phone call) I received from a man involved in MCI&apos;s accounting
fraud who went to prison and is now trying to apologize (sometimes for a rather
high fee) to the world.   

You can read details about Walter Pavlo&apos;s fraud at http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0610/064.html 

I wrote the following last year at  http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm 
 
 I
 watched the AICPA&apos;s excellent FBI Webcast ( Nov. 6, 2003 ).
 One segment that I really enjoyed was a video of Walter Pavlo, a former MCI
 executive who served prison time for fraud. This was a person with all
 intentions of being highly professional on a fast track to being in charge of
 collecting reseller bad debts for MCI. In that position, he just stumbled upon
 too much temptation for what is tantamount to a kiting scheme. 
 
Message 1 from Walter Pavlo on February 24, 2004
 
 Bob, 

 I routinely do a search on my name over the Internet
 to see if there are comments on my speeches that I conduct around the country.
 I saw that you had a comment on a video in which I appeared but was unable to
 find the complete comment on your extensive web-site. Whether positive or
 negative I could not ascertain but am still interested in your thoughts and
 would appreciate them. 

 I did read some of your comments regarding the
 stashing of cash off-shore by executives who commit crimes and the easy life
 they have at&quot;club fed&quot;. Here I would agree that there are a few who
 have such an outcome, but this is not the norm. However, I would disagree that
 there is a&quot;club fed&quot;and on that you are misinformed. 

 I had off-shore accounts and received a great deal of
 money. However, the results of story are more tragic. All of the money is gone
 or turned over to authorities (no complaints here, this is justice), I lost my
 wife of 15 years and custody of my children, I lost all of my assets
 (retirement, etc.) and at 41 I am starting life over with little to show of my
 past accomplishments (which were many). Stories like mine are more common
 among rank and file middle managers who find themselves on the other side of
 the law. There are few top executives in prison but that appears to be
 changing. Time will tell if they fare as well. 

 Prison, while deserving for a crime of the magnitude
 that I and others committed, is a difficult experience and one that is
 difficult from which to recover. In the media and in comments such as the ones
 your offer, it appears that this part of the story is not revealed and that it
 is better to appeal to the fears and anger of the general population. I would
 encourage you to consider other view points for reasons of understanding the
 full story. I feel that this is important for people to know. 

 Thank you for your time and would appreciate
 receiving your feedback.

Message 2 from Walter Palvlo (after he phoned me)
 
 Bob, 

 Attached is an article that appeared in Forbes magazine in the June 10, 2002 issue. I was interviewed for this article while
 still in prison and some six months prior to WorldCom&apos;s revelations of the
 multi-billion dollar fraud that we know of today. 

 It was a pleasure to speak with you and I hope to
 correspond with you more in the future. 

 Walt Pavlo 

 125 Second Avenue, #24 New York, NY 10003 

 Phone: (201) 362-1208 
 
This is part of a resume that he sent to me (I
think he wants me to promote him as a speaker)
 
 Walter&quot;Walt&quot;Pavlo holds an engineering
 degree from West Virginia University and an MBA from the Stetson School of
 Business at Mercer University. He has worked for Goodyear Tire in its
 Aerospace division as a Financial Analyst, GEC Ltd. of England as a Contract
 Manager and as a Senior Manager in MCI Telecommunication&apos;s Division where he
 was responsible for billing and collections in its reseller division. 

 As a senior manager at MCI, and with a meritorious
 employment history, Mr. Pavlo was responsible for the billing and collection
 of nearly $1 billion in monthly revenue for MCI&apos;s carrier finance division.
 Beginning in March of 1996, Mr. Pavlo, one member of his staff and a business
 associate outside of MCI began to perpetrate a fraud involving a few of MCI&apos;s
 own customers. When the scheme was completed, there had been seven customers
 of MCI defrauded over a six-month period resulting in $6 million in payments
 to the Cayman Islands. 

 In January 2001, in cooperation with the Federal
 Government, Mr. Pavlo pled guilty to wire fraud and money laundering and
 entered federal prison shortly thereafter. His story highlights the corrupt
 dealings involving the manipulation of financial records within a large
 corporation. His case appeared as a cover story in the June 10, 2002 issue of
 Forbes Magazine, just weeks before WorldCom divulged that it had over $7
 billion in accounting irregularities. 

 Currently, Mr. Pavlo is the Director of Business
 Development at the Young Entrepreneurs Alliance (YEA), a non-profit
 organization in Maynard, Massachusetts. YEA&apos;s mission is to provide at-risk
 and adjudicated teens with the opportunity to attain long-term economic
 independence by teaching them about business ownership. Mr. Pavlo&apos;s primary
 responsibility is to develop the business programs, raising funds through
 speaking engagements and charitable donations to YEA. 

 Mr. Pavlo has been invited to speak on his
 experiences by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Attorney&apos;s Office,
 major university MBA programs, corporations and various professional
 societies. The purpose of these speeches is to convey to audiences an
 understanding of the inner-workings and motivations associated with complex
 white-collar crimes, with an emphasis on ethical decision-making. 
 
 Message 3 from Walter (following my
inquiry about his pro-bono presentations): 
 
 Walter Pavlo sent me
 the following information regarding my question whether he makes pro-bono
 presentations. He replied as follows: 

 Bob, On the note of
 pro-bono work, most of what I have done to date has been pro-bono. Whenever I
 am in an area with a paying gig, I try to reach out to universities in the
 area to offer my services at no charge. I could have done this for Trinity
 when I was in San Antonio last year for the Institute of Internal Auditors.
 I&apos;ll be sure to look you up if I&apos;m going to be in the area.

 Fraud Checklists

 An Appendix to
 Statement on Auditing Standards No. 99, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial

 appendix is available at the AICPA website at: http://www.aicpa.org/antifraud/business_industry_govt/assessing_organization_vulnerability/identify_assess_risk/38.htm 

 The Association of

 In January 2003, the
 Institute of Internal Auditors conducted a survey on red flags used to detect
 fraud. Though the survey is closed, the text can be used as a checklist. http://www.gain2.org/redflags.htm

February 25, 2004 message from Jim Borden
 I was wondering if anyone has had any experience
 (either in the classroom or personally), with using the Cashflow board
 game sold by Rich Dad (Robert Kiyosaki). It seems to have gotten a favorable
 review in the New York Times ( http://www.richdad.com/news/article_NYTimes.asp )
 and sounds intriguing.   Thanks,   Jim Borden Villanova University 
February 25, 2004 reply from 
 Cashflow is a great game! It effectively teaches you the philosophy of how to create passive
 income to create a positive cashflow. But what it does even
 better than that is teach you how to shift your paradigm of money and
 its role in your life.  It teaches you how to get out of the &quot;rat
 race&quot;(there is an actual rat race in the game) so you can accomplish
 the things in life that add real value to you and your
 family. The game requires the player to make about 50 -100 business-like
 decisions every game ranging from personal finance to stock market investing
 to entrepreneurial opportunities. The decisions are difficult at first
 but become second nature after playing several times--- and that is the
 key to this game--- repetition   The only criticism I have of the
 game is some of the scenarios introduced into the game are a little
 unrealistic.      I have played the games many
 times but never in the classroom environment. However, my
 brother used it in the classroom at his school. They played it one or
 two times per week for the whole semester (I think) with great success.   Its a great game, but comes with
 a hefty price.      Cameron Earl   Brigham Young

 Aside from the merits of the game, we used the book
 at Niagara for our introduction to business class for a few years. The
 students liked the brash style of the writer, and some of them took away good
 information about too much debt. But I wonder whether the game has some of the
 same problems as the book, from an accountant&apos;s point of view? The two that
 come to mind are the intentional re-definition of assets and liabilities and
 the discussions about home ownership. On the first topic, it caused some
 serious confusion among our introductory accounting students. On the second,
 as one with elderly in-laws now suffering the rent squeeze because they never
 bought a house, I question the wisdom of giving young adults the advice that
 they should not buy a home. I don&apos;t think they have the sophistication to
 understand the difference between not buying a home and not buying too much
 home. Just my opinion.

 It is written in Toolbook (yes Bob Jensen, Toolbook

 This is a useful tool to calm your students down as
 they file into your classroom in eager anticipation of the knowledge they are
 about to gain. I learned my lesson about making sure the trivia show was up
 and running after a couple of students nearly got into fisticuffs before
 class. They were having an argument over which method was better for the
 Statement of Cash Flows - the direct method or indirect method. It was only
 after I told them&quot;Ladies - you are BOTH right&quot;that they calmed
 down.

 identification tags from being read. 

 The technology, which RSA plans to demonstrate at its

 attempts to secure the anticipated oceans of consumer tracking data to be
 gathered by the tiny radio-powered tags. As Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Gillette

 increasing numbers, to all kinds of products, including manufactured goods,
 food and apparel.

At long last, the IASB decrees that employee stock
options must be booked!

Message from SmartPros on February 22, 2004
--- http://www.smartpros.com/x42573.xml  
 
 Feb. 20, 2004 (San Jose Mercury News) 
 International accounting rule-makers decreed Thursday that companies must
 begin to deduct the cost of stock options from corporate profits starting in
 2005, dealing a blow to the U.S. technology industry that had been hoping
 global political pressure would derail the rule. 

 The long-anticipated rule by the International
 Accounting Standards Board will affect an estimated 7,000 publicly traded
 companies in 90 counties, but not the United States. 

 But the IASB&apos;s counterpart in the United States, the
 Financial Accounting Standards Board, plans to issue a similar proposal in
 March. And the two accounting groups have been working closely together to
 make the two rules as symmetrical as possible. 

 &quot;It doesn&apos;t change much in terms of what&apos;s
 happening in the United States, but it certainly dashes any hope the IASB
 would back down,&quot;said Ellie B. Kehmeier, a deputy national tax leader
 for Deloitte&amp;Touche in San Jose.&quot;And it provides a decent preview
 of what to expect when FASB issues its draft standard sometime in March.&quot; 

 The London-based IASB developed the global standard
 because a mish-mash of national rules generally do not require companies to
 account for options on their financial statements. That has resulted in
 understated expenses and inflated profits, IASB Chairman David Tweedie said in
 a release. 

 The rule, Tweedie added,&quot;will improve the
 qualify of financial reporting by giving a clearer and more complete picture
 of an entity&apos;s activities, which will assist investors and other users of
 financial statements to make informed economic decisions.&quot; 

 The U.S. tech industry -- which doles out options
 more heavily than other industries -- has lobbied hard against such rules and
 sought political intervention in Washington. Though many still hold out hope,
 there is a growing sense that such rules are inevitable, said Roger Stern, a
 partner with Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich&amp;Rosati, a high-tech law firm in
 Palo Alto. 

 &quot;A lot can happen between crouch and leap,&quot;Stern said. But, he added,&quot;I think most people think mandatory option
 expensing is inevitable.&quot;

TOPICS: Financial Accounting, Financial Accounting Standards Board,
International Accounting Standards Board, Stock Options 

 SUMMARY: Firms following International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will be required to expense stock options
as of January 1, 2005. European companies&quot;have realized this is coming and
have changed their ways of remunerating employeses,&quot;said an analyst with
UBS in London. Questions focus on understanding the use of IASs in comparison to
USGAAP and on the implications of accounting standards for economic behavior. 

 QUESTIONS: 
1.) What factors determine which companies follow International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS)? What standards currently govern European companies&apos;
reporting practices? 

 2.) What are the major differences
between current USGAAP and the new IFRS on stock compensation? 

 3.) How much will the standard being
adopted by the IASB influence development of a new accounting standard on stock
compensation in the US? What other factors influence the potential change in US
reporting in this area? 

 4.) An analyst with UBS in London is
quoted:&quot;The big European companies have realized this is coming and have
changed their ways of remunerating employees.&quot;Should accounting standards
impact economic contracting and behavior? Support you answer.

How has the Internet changed porn? 

 Larry Flynt:  
It&apos;s had a dramatic effect. In the 1980s, publishing was 80 percent of my
 business. Now it&apos;s about 20 percent, and the rest is Internet or video. I
 don&apos;t think many people anticipated how the Internet was going to
 revolutionize the way we disseminate information. Now everybody does -- but
 some did in time, and some didn&apos;t. That&apos;s one of the reasons Penthouse filed for bankruptcy. They were relying totally on publishing. We knew in the
 early 1990s that we needed to diversify and branched out into a lot of
 different areas. 

 Technology still has many surprises for us down the
 road, particularly in the wireless area. It&apos;s going to be absolutely
 phenomenal. In the next two to five years, you&apos;ll see the computer and your
 home television set merging. You&apos;ll have one remote control, and they&apos;ll

 7th Annual Global CEO Survey (Managing Risk: An
 Assessment of CEO Preparedness) 

 This edition of the Annual Global CEO Survey focuses
 on the critical issue of risk, with particular emphasis on enterprise risk
 management (ERM). Nearly 1,400 CEOs in 40 countries shared their views with
 PwC on how they are managing enterprise risk. ERM provides a framework for
 CEOs and management teams to deal effectively with uncertainty, and the risks
 and opportunities associated with uncertainty, in order to enhance value. This
 year&apos;s edition features management strategies and performance forecasts from
 the CEOs as well as interviews with several chief executives. Nearly 40
 percent of the CEOs report that they already have effective and efficient ERM
 in place, while 46 percent view this as a one to three year project. 

 Here are a few additional highlights: 

 68% of US CEOs believe the current environment is
 making companies risk averse  9 out of 10 US CEOs are confident about their
 prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months  67% think the business environment is riskier now
 than it was a year ago  US CEOs see overregulation as a big threat, with
 almost half voicing that concern 

 It is obvious from the survey that US CEOs are
 concerned with risk, which is a reasonable and expected reaction to
 Sarbanes-Oxley. The full survey can provide you additional insights into what
 businesses are facing. 

 PwC&apos;s 7th Annual Global CEO Survey is available
 electronically through our website. We&apos;d like to make this available to you,
 so that you may explore the contents of the Survey in an interactive manner.
 Additionally, you may download a PDF copy of the Survey from the website. We
 felt that the Survey could useful for classroom discussions.

 Urban Legend Paradox 
What about claims that may be false? Is there any site devoted to setting
the record straight about urban legends that are not urban legends?

Urban legends have urban legends about urban legends that claim not to be
urban legends but really are urban legends that may in fact not be urban legends
and so on infinitum. Some are blatantly false from the beginning; others
are embellished over time. One definition is as follows from http://support.airmail.net/faq/glossary_mz.php  
 
 Urban legend - A story, which may have started with a
 grain of truth, that has been embroidered and retold until it has passed into
 the realm of myth. Some legends that periodically make their rounds include&quot;The Infamous Modem Tax,&quot;&quot;Craig Shergold/Brain Tumor/Get Well
 Cards,&quot;and&quot;The $250 Cookie Recipe.&quot; 
 
One thing not to be believed is the typical claim that&quot;This is not an
urban legend.&quot; That&apos;s generally a signal that what follows is all or
mostly bull.  

Urban legends are thus lies about what somebody said or wrote and are
circulated wildly across the Web. The best way that I found to check on
something before I forward it is to select an identifying phrase such as part of
the title of a story. Then I go to http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en  
I enter the selected phrase into the&quot;exact phrase&quot;box and then in
the&quot;all of the words&quot;box above I enter the word&quot;urban&quot;and the word&quot;legend&quot;without quote marks. Then I hit the Google
Search button.

There are hundreds of sites that explain and/or archive supposed urban
legends, some of which are as follows:

 A great article on how urban legends work ---  
http://science.howstuffworks.com/urban-legend.htm  
 http://www.snopes.com  
 http://www.urbanlegends.com/  
 http://www.urbanlegends.com/  
 http://www.ulrc.com.au/   

We should always check to see if something is an urban legend before we pass
it along. However, once something is claimed to be an urban legend, there
is a tendency to immediately conclude the claim that it is urban legend is a
true claim .   

What about claims that may be false? Is there any site devoted to
setting the record straight about urban legends that are not urban
legends?  

Proving a legend to be true is often a scholarship question, such as when a
writer claims that&quot;X did not say yyyy.&quot; A scholar may then
search among the archives of the world for proof that X really did say&quot;yyyy.&quot;  What is more difficult, however, is when claims cannot be researched in any
archives. For example, one might claim that President Lincoln had an
affair during his presidency. To my knowledge, there is no archived record
of such a claim. And people who might know first hand are no longer
living. All we can do is criticize all unsupported claims for not being
supported by any credible evidence.

After my Google search finds a site that boldly asserts that something is an
urban legend, like most people I immediately concluded that it is an urban
legend. Proving it to be otherwise may be impossible or impractical
relative to the time and money available to prove it otherwise.

One thing I do know! When one urban legend site claims something is an
urban legend, the other urban legend sites follow the leader blindly like
lemmings. Is there any site devoted to false claims about urban legends?

February 27, 2004 reply from David R. Fordham [fordhadr@JMU.EDU ] 
 
 Bob, one of the modules in my AIS class is devoted to
 what I call identification of trustworthy sources. 

 While not a foolproof methodology, it is better than
 the no methodology at all approach used by the general population. 

 In a nutshell: use your own experience (supplemented
 by the experience of actual acquaintances whom you trust based on your own
 experience with them) to accumulate a repertoire (or harem, or collection, or
 ) of websites run by organizations which you trust to tell you the truth.
 Examples from my own collection include snopes, Symantec, McAfee, DataFellows,
 etc. I then rely on these trustworthy sites to tell me what is the
 truth vs. what is fiction. 

 Google searches return everything, and it is very
 easy to Spoof a legitimate site, even to Google. My experience has been thus:
 when someone tells me of a strange story, I check it out with one of my trustworthy
 sites, and 999 times out of 1000, I am surprised to learn that the trustworthy
 site not only tells me the story is a hoax, but that the hoax has been around
 since 1998, where it originated, why it is still circulating (e.g., the grains
 of truth which tend to bring the story to present consciousness, etc.), and
 other information which I didnt know. Further, these sites often are up
 to the minute on new stuff, too. 

 There is no substitute for determining who ya
 gonna call? 

 I really like that quote, although I dont know who
 to attribute it to: The trouble with keeping an open mind is that people
 are always dropping their garbage in it. Perhaps this was Pogo, too?

The following article from Religion News Service was

 Physicist
 puts odds of God at 2-to-1 

 Using
 the Bayesian theorem, an Ohio consultant worked the
 numbers on God. 

 By
 KAREN R. LONG 

 Religion
 News Service 

   

 Stephen
 Unwin calculates the probability that God exists at 67 percent. 

   

 The
 idea of math favoring God by a 2-to-1 ratio is cheeky. So is the subtitle to
 Unwin&apos;s new book,&quot;A Simple Calculation That Proves the Ultimate
 Truth,&quot;a flourish from Crown Forum&apos;s marketing department that makes
 the author wince. 

   

 But
 Unwin, a witty physicist who has spent his career calculating
 probabilities, thinks there is real merit in his figuring. 

   

 There
 is something to annoy everyone in that number,&quot;Unwin told a Cleveland bookstore audience recently.&quot;I&apos;ve
 found a great number of people don&apos;t value uncertainty. Some tell me that
 they don&apos;t appreciate my number and they know my address.&quot; 

   

 Despite
 inflamed camps of atheists and theists who assign probabilities of zero or
 100 percent to the Creator, the book is coming out in paperback this fall.
 Unwin&apos;s travels have taught him that many people privately occupy a murky
 middle. A Harris poll last October found that 12 percent of Catholics, 8
 percent of Protestants and 25 percent of Jews don&apos;t buy the existence
 of God. 

   

 &quot;That
 alone tells us that belief systems are pretty strange things,&quot;Unwin
 said. 

   

 As
 a scientist who earned a doctorate in quantum gravity from the University of Manchester in England , Unwin likes numbers.&quot;If you have a
 hammer, you tend to see every problem in terms of a nail,&quot;he jokes
 in an interview.&quot;As a theoretical physicist, my bias is to want to
 work the numbers in some way. Answering a problem otherwise seems like
 working with a numberless bank statement - trivial and
 insubstantial.&quot; 

   

 In
 his day job, Unwin runs a consulting firm in Columbus , Ohio , figuring the odds of nuclear-power-plant
 disasters and the likelihood of complex equipment failures. A key tool is
 called the Bayesian theorem, a way to represent uncertainty in an equation. 

   

 Boldly,
 Unwin plugs evidence of God into this theorem. He points out, for instance,
 that giving money to the homeless with no thought of reciprocal reward is
 evidence of good, and good is more likely to occur if God is in the
 universe. At another point, Unwin weighs natural disasters such as
 earthquakes, tornadoes and cancer to swing the equation against the
 probability of God. After six sets of evidence consideration, ranging from
 the existence of evil to the case for miracles, the probability comes out at
 67. 

   

 For
 those who want to run their own version and set their own probabilities, his
 book includes a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for individual tabulation. 

   

 &quot;This
 book is very bad news for anyone planning a career in Evil,&quot;writes Rob
 Grant, co-creator of the&quot;Red Dwarf&quot;television series, in his
 book blurb. 

   

 One
 of the best things about the book is its humor. It seems the theoretical
 physicist can barely resist a joke. 

   

 &quot;Is
 it realistic that the awesome machinery of probabilistic mathematics be
 used to power a concept so fluffy and blond as degrees of belief?&quot;Unwin writes.&quot;In the Bayesian world, this is precisely what a
 probability represents: a degree of belief or level of confidence that a
 proposition is true. 

   

   &quot;You cannot, for example, vote for, say, a particular scientific or
 mathematical theory from a point of utter ignorance the way you can vote
 for, say, a presidential candidate. So rather than relying smugly on the
 fact of the broad applications of Bayesian methods as justification for
 our use of them, let&apos;s consider their pros and cons a little further and
 then proceed smugly.&quot; 

   

 The
 Rev. Richard Wing, pastor of First Community Church in Columbus , said Unwin&apos;s ideas have had an enthusiastic
 reception at home. 

 &quot;I&apos;ve
 got a highly educated congregation,&quot;Wing said.&quot;Ninety-five
 percent are college educated. We&apos;ve got guys here working on chaos theory.
 We aren&apos;t afraid of the questions.&quot; 

   

 Unwin,
 born 47 years ago in Manchester, England, was stunned by the religious
 expression, even aggression, he found in America when he moved here in
 1984, first as a minor diplomat, then as a worker for Batelle Corp. in Columbus . 

   

 Some
 of Unwin&apos;s most ferocious critics have been proponents of Intelligent
 Design, demanding to know why it is absent from Unwin&apos;s equations. The
 author looks at the arguments and concludes that religion and science
 best occupy separate planes. 

   

 &quot;To
 plagiarize and adapt from the best,&quot;Unwin writes,&quot;render unto
 the physical world those things that are physical and render unto God
 those things that are God&apos;s.&quot; 

   

 Working
 the Bayesian theorem into his own spiritual. life gives Unwin the pleasure
 that comes from clarity. It also helps when he calculates 40 years more of
 Sunday church attendance. It adds up to about 3,000 hours of one&apos;s life. 

   

 Unwin
 measures his personal sense of God at around 95 percent certainty. The 28
 percent improvement over the mathematical probability is what Unwin
 calls his faith.

 People over 35 should be dead. 

 Here&apos;s why ............ 

 According to today&apos;s regulators and
bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 40&apos;s, 50&apos;s, 60&apos;s, or even maybe
the early 70&apos;s probably shouldn&apos;t have survived. 

 Our baby cribs were covered with bright
colored lead-based paint. 

 We had no childproof lids on medicine
bottles, doors or cabinets, ... and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets.
(Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking.) 

 As children, we would ride in cars with
no seatbelts or air bags. 

 Riding in the back of a pickup truck on
a warm day was always a special treat. 

 We drank water from the garden hose and
not from a bottle. 

 Horrors! 

 We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and
drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were
always outside playing. 

 We shared one soft drink with four
friends, from one bottle, and no one actually died from this. 

 We would spend hours building our
go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot
the brakes. 

 After running into the bushes a few
times, we learned to solve the problem. 

 We would leave home in the morning and
play all day, as long as we were back when the street lights came on. 

 No one was able to reach us all day. 

 NO CELL PHONES!!!!! 

 Unthinkable! 

 We did not have Playstations, Nintendo
64, X-Boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, video tape movies,
surround sound, personal cell phones, personal computers, or Internet chat
rooms. 

 We had friends! 

 We went outside and found them. 

 We played dodge ball, and sometimes,
the ball would really hurt. 

 We fell out of trees, got cut and broke
bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. 

 They were accidents. 

 No one was to blame but us. 

 Remember accidents? 

 We had fights and punched each other
and got black and blue and learned to get over it. 

 We made up games with sticks and tennis
balls and ate worms, and although we were told it would happen, we did not put
out very many eyes, nor did the worms live inside us forever. 

 We rode bikes or walked to a friend&apos;s
home and knocked on the door, or rang the bell or just walked in and talked to
them. 

 Little League had tryouts and not
everyone made the team. 

 Those who didn&apos;t had to learn to deal
with disappointment. 

 Some students weren&apos;t as smart as
others, so they failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade. 

 Horrors! 

 Tests were not adjusted for any reason. 

 Our actions were our own. 

 Consequences were expected. 

 The idea of a parent bailing us out if
we broke a law was unheard of. 

 They actually sided with the law. 

 Imagine that! 

 And worst of allAs boys, some of us
licked tongues with our dogsand lived to tell about it! Yuk! 

 This generation has produced some of
the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. 

 The past 50 years have been an
explosion of innovation and new ideas. 

 We had freedom, failure, success and
responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. 

 And you&apos;re one of them! 

 Congratulations!

 If you are traveling soon, consider Lutheran Air, the no-frills airline.
You&apos;re all in the same boat on Lutheran Air. Where flying is an uplifting
experience. There is no First Class on any Lutheran Air flight. Meals are
potluck. Rows 1-6, bring rolls, 7-15 bring a salad, 16-21 a main dish, and 22-30
a dessert. 

 Basses and tenors please sit in the rear of the aircraft. Everyone is
responsible for his or her own luggage. All fares are by freewill offering and
the plane will not land until the budget is met. 

 And pay attention to your flight attendant who will acquaint you with the
safety system aboard this Lutheran Air 599:&quot;Okay then. Listen up; I&apos;m only
gonna say this once. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, I am
frankly going to be real surprised and so will Captain Olson because we fly
right at around 2000 feet, so loss of cabin pressure would probably indicate the
Second Coming or something of that nature, and I wouldn&apos;t bother with these
little masks on the rubber tubes, you&apos;re gonna have bigger things to worry about
than that. Just stuff those back up in their little holes. Probably the masks
fell out because of turbulence which, to be honest with you, we&apos;re going to have
quite a bit of it at 2000 feet, sort of like driving across a plowed field, but
after awhile you get used to it. 

 In the event of a water landing, I&apos;d say forget it. Start saying the Lord&apos;s
Prayer and just hope to gosh you get to the part about forgive us our sins as we
forgive those who sin against us, which some people say&quot;trespass&quot;against us, which isn&apos;t right, but what can you do? 

 The use of cell phones on the plane is strictly forbidden, not because they
may interfere with the plane&apos;s naviga-tional system, which is seat of the pants
all the way. No, it&apos;s because cell phones are a pain in the wazoo and if God
meant you to use a cell phone, He would&apos;ve put your mouth on the side of your
head. 

 We&apos;re going to start lunch right about noon and it&apos;s buffet style and the
coffee pot is up front and then we&apos;ll have the hymn sing. Hymnals are in the
seat pocket in front of you, and don&apos;t take yours with you when you go or I am
going to be real upset and I am not kidding, and right now I&apos;ll say grace: God
is great and God is good, and we thank Him for the Food, Father, Son and Holy
Ghost, May we land in Dallas or at least pretty close. Amen.

 A woman awakes during the night to find
that her husband was not in their bed. She puts on her robe and goes downstairs
to look for him. She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a hot cup of
coffee in front of him. He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the
wall. 

 She watches as he wiped a tear from his
eye and takes a sip of his coffee.&quot;What&apos;s the matter, dear?&quot;, she
whispers as she steps into the room,&quot;Why are you down here at this time of
night?&quot;. 

 The husband looks up from his coffee,&quot;Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only
16?&quot;he asks solemnly. 

 &quot;Yes I do,&quot;she replies. 

 The husband paused. The words were not
coming easily.&quot;Do you remember when your father caught us in the back seat
of my car making love? 

 &quot;Yes, I remember,&quot;said the
wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him. 

 The husband continued.&quot;Do you
remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said, &apos;Either you marry my
daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years?&quot; 

 I remember that, too,&quot;she replied
softly. 

 He wiped another tear from his cheek

Dietary Genesis

In the beginning God covered the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and
 spinach, green and yellow and red vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman
 would live long and healthy lives.

Then using God&apos;s bountiful gifts, Satan created ice cream and doughnuts.
 And Satan said,&quot;You want hot fudge with that?&quot;And Man said&quot;Yes!&quot;and Woman said,&quot;I&apos;ll have another with sprinkles.&quot;And lo they gained 10 pounds.

So God said,&quot;Try my fresh green salad.&quot;

And Satan presented crumbled Bleu Cheese dressing and garlic toast on the
 side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.

God then said,&quot;I have sent you heart healthy vegetable and olive oil
 in which to lightly saut the wholesome vegetables.&quot;

And Satan brought forth deep fried coconut shrimp, chicken-fried steak so
 big it needed its own platter and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. And Man&apos;s
 glucose levels spiked through the roof.

God then brought forth running shoes so that his Children might lose those
 extra pounds.

And Satan came forth with a cable TV with remote control so Man would not
 have to toil changing the channels. And man and woman laughed and cried before
 the flickering light and started wearing stretch jogging suits.

Then God brought forth lean meat so that Man might consume fewer calories
 and still satisfy his appetite.

And Satan created the 99-cent double cheeseburger, and said,&quot;You want
 fries with that?&quot;And Man replied,&quot;Yes! And super size &apos;em!&quot;And Man went into cardiac arrest.

God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

And Satan created HMOs.

Gifts for Mama!

Four brothers left home for college, and they became successful doctors and
 lawyers and prospered. Some years later, they chatted after having dinner
 together. They discussed the gifts that they were able to give their elderly
 Mother who lived far away in another city.

The first said,&quot;I had a big house built for Mama.&quot;

The second said, I had a hundred thousand dollar theater built in the
 house.&quot;

The third said, I had my Mercedes dealer deliver her a SL600.&quot;

The fourth said,&quot;Listen to this. You know how Mama loved reading the
 Bible and you know she can&apos;t read it anymore because she can&apos;t see very well.
 I met this priest who told me about a parrot that can recite the entire Bible.
 It took twenty priests 12 years to teach him. I had to pledge to contribute
 $100,000 a year for twenty years to the church, but it was worth it. Mama just
 has to name the chapter and verse and the parrot will recite it.&quot;

The other brothers were impressed.

After the holidays Mom sent out her Thank You notes.

She wrote:&quot;Milton, the house you built is so huge. I live in only one
 room, but I have to clean the whole house. Thanks, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home, I have my groceries
 delivered, so I never use the Mercedes. The thought was good. Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Michael, you give me an expensive theater with Dolby sound, it could
 hold 50 people, but all my friends are dead, I&apos;ve lost my hearing and I&apos;m
 nearly blind. I&apos;ll never use it. Thank you for the gesture just the
 same.&quot;

&quot;Dearest Melvin, you were the only son to have the good sense to give
 a little thought to your gift. The chicken was delicious. Thank you.&quot;
 
 These are the following reasons that Barbie decided to divorce Ken after 43
years of marriage --- http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4250262/   
 
 ******************************************
Associated Press (True Story)
February 12, 2004
Just like J.Lo and Ben, the romance is over for Barbie and Ken. 

 After 43 years as one of the worlds prettiest
 pairs, the perfect plastic couple is breaking up. The couples business
 manager, Russell Arons, vice president of marketing at Mattel, said that
 Barbie and Ken feel its time to spend some quality time apart. 

 Like other celebrity couples, their Hollywood
 romance has come to an end, said Arons, who quickly added that the duo will
 remain friends. 

 Arons denied that there was any truth to rumors that
 the breakup was linked to the Cali (as in California) Girl Barbie, arriving in
 stores now. To better reflect her single status, Cali Barbie will wear board
 shorts and a bikini top, metal hoop earrings, and have a deeper tan. 

 This new style already has attracted a new admirer,
 Blaine the Australian boogie boarder. 

 Barbie the most popular fashion doll in the
 world, according to toy maker Mattel met Ken on the set of a TV commercial
 in 1961, and they have been inseparable ever since. 

 Arons hinted Wednesday that the separation may be
 partially due to Kens reluctance to getting married. All those bridal
 Barbie dolls in toy chests around the globe are really just examples of Barbies
 wishful thinking, he explained. 

 Another possible factor is Barbies career. The
 doll who was born Barbie Millicent Roberts in 1959 has been everything
 from a rock star to military medic, and shes currently marketed in more
 than 150 countries. According to Mattel, every second, three Barbie dolls are
 sold somewhere in the world. 

 So where does that leave Ken? Said
 Arons: He will
 head for other waves.
****************************************** 
 
 This leads us to question what was going on behind the scenes. Well it
was a series of things including those mentioned below. 

 Typical macho Ken married typical good-looking lady and after the wedding, he
laid down the following rules:&quot;I&apos;ll be home when I want, if I want and at
what time I want-and I don&apos;t expect any hassle from you. I expect a great dinner
to be on the table unless I tell you that I won&apos;t be home for dinner. I&apos;ll go
hunting, fishing, boozing and card-playing when I want with my old buddies and
don&apos;t you give me a hard time about it. Those are my rules. Any comments?&quot; 

 His new bride, Barbie, said,&quot;No, that&apos;s fine with me. Just understand that there
will be sex here at seven o&apos;clock every night... whether you&apos;re here or
not.&quot; 

 ***************************** 

 Barbie and Ken had a bitter quarrel on the day of their 40th wedding
anniversary! 

 The Ken yells,&quot;When you die, I&apos;m getting you a headstone that
reads, &apos;Here Lies My Wife - Cold As Ever.&apos; 

 &quot;Yeah?&quot;Barbie replies.&quot;When you die, I&apos;m getting you a
headstone that reads,&quot;Here Lies My Husband Stiff At Last.&apos;&quot; 

 ***************************** 

 Ken and Barbie were having a fight at the breakfast table. Ken gets up in a rage and says,&quot;And you are no good in bed
either,&quot;and storms out of the house. 

 After sometime Ken realizes he was nasty and decides to make amends and rings
her up. Barbie comes to the phone after many rings, and the irritated Ken says,&quot;what took you so long to answer the phone?&quot; 

 Barbie says,&quot;I was in bed.&quot; 

 &quot;In bed this early, doing what?&quot; 

 &quot;Getting a second opinion!&quot; 

 ***************************** 

 Ken raised nine children and is very proud of his achievement. He is so proud
of himself, that he starts calling Barbie,&quot;Mother of Nine&quot;in spite
of her objections. 

 One night, they go to a party. Ken decides that it&apos;s time to go home and
wants to find out if Barbie is ready to leave as well. He shouts at the top of
his voice,&quot;Shall we go home &apos;Mother of Nine?&quot; 

 Barbie, irritated by her husband&apos;s lack of discretion shouts right back,&quot;Anytime you&apos;re ready, Father of None.&quot; 

 *****************************

before the masterpiece.

 Use of GPS tracking devices is a particularly
intrusive method of surveillance, making it possible to acquire an enormous
amount of personal information about the citizen under circumstances where the
individual is unaware that every single vehicle trip taken and the duration of
every single stop may be recorded by the government, Justice Barbara Madsen
wrote in the unanimous decision.  Henry
Jenkins says that last week&apos;s ruling by the Washington State Supreme Court
limiting police use of GPS tracking of a suspect&apos;s car is a&quot;fascinating
example of the negotiation process by which [society] adjusts to the potentials
of a new technology.&quot; http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/blog.asp?blogID=1278&amp;trk=nl

 Footprints in Your Heart by Eleanor
Roosevelt --- http://www.wowzone.com/eleanor.htm   
 
 Many
 people will walk in and out of your life,
But only true friends will leave footprints in your heart. 

 To handle yourself,
 use your head;
To handle others, use your heart.

Anger is only one letter short of danger. 

 If someone betrays you
 once, it is his fault;
If he betrays you twice, it is your fault.

Great minds discuss ideas,
Average minds discuss events,
Small minds discuss people.

He who loses money, loses much;
He who loses a friend, loses much more;
He who loses faith, loses all.

Beautiful young people are accidents of nature,
But beautiful old people are works of art.

Learn from the mistakes of others.
You can&apos;t live long enough to make them all yourself.

Friends, you and me.
You brought another friend,
And then there were three. 

 We started our group,
Our circle of friends,
And like that circle -
There is no beginning or end.

Yesterday is history.
Tomorrow is mystery.
Today is a gift.

 Message from Paula Ward on February 17,
2004 
 
 Here&apos;s a way to pick
 a candidate based entirely upon the issues. Interesting, thought provoking,
 and a lot of fun. It&apos;s also rather informative. Answer the various questions
 (grouped by topic), click the button and ... voila ... up pops the stats on
 which P2004 candidates you agree with the most. The listing of major

 &quot;Converting VHS Tapes to DVD.&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The Wall
 Street Journal , February 12, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,mossberg_mailbox,00.html     
 Q: I am interested in converting my extensive VHS
 library to DVD, and I am fairly tech-savvy. What is the best solution for
 the do-it-yourselfer? 

 A: The best device I have ever tested for
 converting videotapes to DVD, and the only one I recommend, is the $275
 DVD Movie Writer dc3000 from Hewlett-Packard. It combines an
 analog-to-digital converter for converting VHS video to the format a PC
 can use, with a DVD burner. It&apos;s easy to use, and in my tests last year,
 it produced good quality DVDs that played fine on set-top players. My only
 caveat about it is that H-P is likely to be replacing it with a new model
 soon.

prerequisite for sustained diplomatic influence and military muscle. Therefore,
I hope for a robust India economic performance in the years ahead, and for a
sharp increase in US-India trade and American investment in India. Promoting US
business has been one of my major preoccupations while Ambassador to India.

 think the MBAs whose names are surfacing in connection with corporate scandals
 learned their tricks in business school or at home. The business leaders they
 worked with in senior management and on Wall Street probably instilled in them
 the importance of relentless growth, well managed earnings, and creative
 accounting.

 Bob,  

 How very interesting that your post should appear on
 the very day that our local newspaper (The Daily News-Record) ran a front-page
 story on the fact that Virginia law allows convicted felons to enroll in
 Virginia colleges and universities. This was brought up by an incident where a
 convicted felon who was a current JMU student was caught again dealing drugs
 at his off-campus apartment. (Hey, with 15,000 students, we&apos;re bound to get a
 bad apple every now and then!) 

 I always wondered where all those law students at
 William and Mary came from!

 MAPPING MORAL PHILOSOPHIES: STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR MULTINATIONAL
 FIRMS
Christopher J. Robertson, General Management Group, College of Business
 Administration, Northeastern University  
http://web.cba.neu.edu/gsba/SMJfinal2.doc       In a year of unprecedented regulation, FEI&apos;s President and CEO offers a
 list of 11 financial reporting issues that require the attention of
 financial executives during 2004. http://www.accountingweb.com/item/98708   
 Internal Controls. Ensure that you have complied
 with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404, which requires management to assess its
 internal control environment and the external auditor to attest to the
 internal control environment. 
 
 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). Comply with FIN
 46, which requires that companies consolidate variable interest entities.
 The rule was issued in response to Enron&apos;s off-balance-sheet treatment of
 such entities. It was originally supposed to take effect in the third
 quarter, but on October 8, FASB extended the deadline due to the
 significant implementation issues companies and their auditors were
 dealing with. (See below for a Deloitte and Touche Link)

 
 Pension Disclosures. Comply with new pension
 disclosures. FASB is due to issue a final statement before year-end 2003
 as FASB Statement No. 132 (revised 2003, rather than FASB Statement No.
 51), but has tentatively decided to require additional disclosures for
 2003 calendar year end companies based on comments received from its
 recent exposure draft. 
 
 MD&amp;A Guidance. Comply with MD&amp;A guidance.
 As we go to print, the SEC is planning to issue some additional guidance
 before the 2003 reporting season, which will likely suggest an&quot;Executive Summary&quot;section intended to highlight the important
 items in the MD&amp;A. Also, ensure that your disclosures of Critical
 Accounting Policies are robust enough for a user to understand your
 business model. 
 
 Revenue Recognition. Comply with EITF 00-21,
 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Also, monitor FASB&apos;s
 Revenue Recognition project. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Disclosures. Comply
 with FR-67, Disclosures of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
 Obligations. The SEC issued this in January 2003 for compliance for 2003
 year-ends. This requires SEC registrants to provide an explanation of
 their off-balance sheet arrangements in a separately captioned subsection
 of the MD&amp;A, and to provide an overview of certain known contractual
 obligations in a tabular format. 
 
 Embrace Transparency. Use judgment in determining
 items that are important for investors to better understand your company&apos;s
 financial position and future trends. Don&apos;t wait for rules to come out
 specifically requiring good disclosure. 
 
 Audit Committee Governance. Disclose your audit
 committee financial expert in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley. Ensure that
 audit fees and
non-audit- related expenses with your auditor are within independence
 guidelines and are appropriately approved. 
 
 Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
 Liabilities and Equity. Comply with FAS 150, Accounting for Certain
 Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.
 This statement requires that many financial instruments that may have
 previously been classified as equity, be classified as debt. It is
 effective in 2003, but deferred indefinitely is the effective date for
 certain provisions relating to certain mandatorily redeemable financial
 instruments. 
 
 Stock Options. Monitor FASB&apos;s project on stock
 options, in particular the deliberations on valuation. 
 
 International Convergence. Monitor what&apos;s going on
 at the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Whatever projects
 are on the IASB agenda are likely to be on FASB&apos;s agenda in the near term
 (including pension accounting, insurance accounting, lease accounting). In
 mid-December, FASB issued several Exposure Drafts identifying short-term
 convergence issues. 
 
 Deloitte and Touche provides a nice summary of FIN 46. The new interpretation
was prompted in large measure by the fraudulent use of offshore special purpose
entities (now called variable interest entities).

 FEI
MEMBERS WEIGH IN ON KEY IT ISSUES 
 
 FEI
and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) released their sixth annual study on
Technology Issues for Financial Executives on January 26. The study was based on
a 2003 survey of 607 FEI members, a 17% increase from 2002 and a record number
for FEI&apos;s Technology Issues survey. The study&quot;provides a detailed assessment of the IT practices, priorities and
problems that confront today&apos;s senior-most financial leaders.&quot;The
objectives of the survey were&quot;to develop fresh insights that are helpful
to financial officers in carrying out technology related responsibilities&quot;and to contribute to the success of the programs of FEI&apos;s Committee on Finance and Information Technology (CFIT). 
 
 The
key findings are grouped under investments, management and evolving issues as
follows: 

 *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * 

 INVESTMENTS 

 *
Continued and critical concern about determining the appropriate level of IT
investment and making the right investment choices; 

 *
A need for better and more timely analytical
information to assist decision making; 

 *
Plans to upgrade capabilities during 2004; 

 *
Overall IT spending remains relatively depressed, with many planning for a
modest increase in 2004; 

 *
A small minority, 10%, believe that they are achieving a high return on
technology investments; and 

 *
Movement to enterprise resource planning systems and integration toward extended
processes are continuing at a fair pace, but are slowing somewhat. 

 MANAGEMENT 

 *
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a people and process issue, but can be assisted by
technology; 

 *
The ability to share relevant information versus pushing data is an on-going
concern; 

 *
Outsourcing continues to be a solution to address areas where management doesn&apos;t
believe in-house efforts can be cost effective and/or supported by staff with
the necessary skills; 

 *
Satisfaction levels with shared services are a high 90%; and 

 *
Average CIO tenure is longer than previously reported. 

 EVOLVING
ISSUES 

 *
With increased reliance on technology, information security has become a
pervasive concern. However, CFOs are reluctant to expand the scope of
traditional information security programs. 

 *
Requirements and/or developments with a distant date (e.g. Extensible Business
Reporting Language and wireless applications) remain a low priority; and 

 *
The depressed price levels for offshore outsourcing of application development
and maintenance bear close watching over the next few years. 

 Prioritization
of technology investments and identification of the appropriate level of
investment remain a concern to a significant majority of respondents, which was
also a finding in the 2002 survey.

 COMPUTER
SECURITY GUIDE 

 In
January 2004, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a division of
the U.S. Department of Commerce, published recommendations on responding to
computer security incidents. The publication includes guidelines for analyzing
data and responding to each incident and can be followed regardless of the
hardware platforms or operating systems an organization uses. The executive
summary emphasizes the importance of: 

 *
Continuous, preventive monitoring of threats through intrusion detection
systems, 

 *
Establishing clear procedures of assessment, 

 *
Implementing effective methods of collecting, analyzing and reporting data, and 

 *
Communicating incidents to relevant parties. 

 Specifically,
the document discusses: 

 *
Organizing a computer security incident response capability through policies and
procedures and creation of an incident response team, 

 *
Handling incidents from initial preparation through the post-incident lessons
learned phase, and 

 *
Handling specific types of incidents, such as denial of service, malicious code
and unauthorized access.

full guide can be accessed at: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-61/sp800- 61.pdf  .   
   Wireless Laptops: Don&apos;t Believe the
 Slogan&quot;Anytime Anywhere&quot;   When I entered my New Hampshire zip code, Verizon Wireless responded&quot;We currently do not have service for zip code 03585.&quot;   For a map of Earthlink&apos;s coverage go to http://snipurl.com/4j5v   It appears that the Earthlink&apos;s wireless laptop coverage goes up to central New Hampshire but

 I will be on sabbatical leave May 15, 2004 to January 15, 2005 and will

 laptop connection to the Internet.     Is anybody familiar with the pros and
 cons of wireless laptop connection?     How does it&apos;s download and upload speed compare with a
 cable modem?  Do you think it will work when surrounded by mountains?
 (where cell phones work badly)    Bob Jensen   February 15, 2004 reply from Robert Holmes Glendale College [rcholmes@GLENDALE.CC.CA.US ]  I used the Verizon wireless last fall as I drove
 across the country. In most places it worked as well or better than my
 Sprint cell phone. I loved being able to stop in a park or use my motel
 room or wherever to do my work. I did not do extensive timing tests but
 it was certainly several times faster than a regular modem
 connection.    I mostly download 20-40K Word and Excel files
 and they went almost as fast as my DSL at home. I spent a couple of days
 in southeastern Minnesota. The Verizon phone used a different carrier
 and the data connection was not available. My house is in a weak spot
 for cell coverage and the Verizon data was unreliable, sometimes fast
 sometimes very slow and so I discontinued the service. A block away from
 home it was fine. I also used T-Mobile wifi as a backup. That service is
 as fast as my DSL with the downside being you have to go to a hotspot.
 Not a big problem in major cities, but a trial in the country.   The home page for Verizon Wireless laptop coverage is http://www.verizonwireless.com/internet_data/      The home page for wireless Earthlink is at http://www.earthlink.net/wireless/

 You can try Adobe Photoshop Elements. It has approx. 90% of the
 functionality of the full version for a small fraction of the price.

 The main link is http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopel/main.html  
It&apos;s $100 from Adobe, but you can probably get it cheaper elsewhere. 

 You may be better off with Elements since the full-blown Adobe Photoshop
takes an immense amount of computing power and works better on a big Mac. 
 
 It&apos;s Coming Up Roses
for Distance Education 

 &quot;One of the
primary advantages&quot;of online classes, says Rene R. Champagne, chief
executive officer of ITT Technical Institute, is their capacity to consistently
attract the maximum number of students per class. 

 Big profits from
online operations are raising overall profit margins for the industry. 

 &quot;For-profit colleges
thrive, but fears of a slowdown lead them to try new strategies,&quot;by
Elizabeth F. Farrell, The Chronicle of Higher Education , February 13,
2004, Page A26 
 
 With
 total income for all accredited proprietary institutions reaching $15-billion
 in 2003, and profits growing, investors have come to expect that the good
 times will continue. 
 
 Distance
 Boom 

 For
 almost all of the major for-profit systems, online growth has been very good
 for business. &quot;One of the primary advantages&quot;of online
 classes, says Rene R. Champagne, chief executive officer of ITT Technical
 Institute, is their capacity to consistently attract the maximum number of
 students per class. 

 The
 growth of Phoenix&apos;s online division may have slowed, but newer entries in the
 field are just beginning to grow. 
 
 Blended
 Approach 

 In
 recognition of the growing popularity and profitability of online courses,
 most institutions are encouraging students enrolled on their bricks-and-mortar
 campuses to adopt a&quot;blended&quot;approach to learning, taking some of
 their classes online. 

 &quot;Blending
 online and on-ground programs expands the capacity of the space a company
 has,&quot;says Mr. Urdan. &quot;They can open new campuses more
 quickly, because they don&apos;t need as large facilities. We&apos;re seeing
 companies like Apollo during this much more, in response to competitive
 pressure.&quot; 

 At the
 Indianapolis-based ITT, such an approach, known as the&quot;2+1&quot;program, requires students to take at least two courses on campus and one
 course online in each semester. The program is mandatory for students
 enrolling on new campuses and will be phased in for all students by the end of
 this year, says Mr. Champagne.

 Bob,  

 Thanks for pointing this out, a lot of instructors
 arent even aware of this. 
 
 (Futile and worthless Rant: Talk about infringing
 on peoples rights. The ACLU is really remiss in not looking at what ADA,
 HIPAA, and a lot of other insanity is doing about stifling (via making so
 cumbersome) the very freedoms from dictatorship that the founding fathers
 were so mad at George II for repressing. As James Madison was so fond of
 pointing out, Governmental tyranny can come from a government of the
 people just as easily as it can from government by a single person. And
 the hullabaloo in Massachusetts points out the wisdom of Sam Adams who said,
 the Achilles heel of this constitution is the lack of a check on the
 judiciary. I fear greatly that (future generations) will be subjected to
 tyranny not from a monarch, but from an abuse of the power we have just
 given the court, lacking a sufficient mechanism for moderating that
 power.) 
 
 Pity we dont have the same intelligence and
 concern for the future in todays leadership circles 

 Also, returning to the subject of the streaming media
 litigation, am I the only one who noticed that the Acacia tree has some
 interesting characteristics? --: it is covered in thorns, it is quite bitter
 and few animals will touch it, it has little or no commercial value in any of
 the dozens of societies where it is natively grown, it is known in Australia
 as the wattle, (where, interestingly enough, the Wattleday
 Celebration website uses (get this!) streaming media (!) as its opening
 greeting check it out: http://www.wattleday.asn.au/  , -- and a wattle is also the word for a filthy swine, no
 kidding!! See: http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/swine/redwattle/  ), in his work Sylva in 1664 Evelyn writes that the acacia tree is
 brittle and its roots emaciate the soil in which it lives, making it unfit for
 gardens in spite of its hollow promises of shade, and the very name acacia
 is often mis-applied to many different thorny scrub trees (including some
 North American locusts) other than the real acacia which is an African
 and Australian relative of the mimosa but which when imported to areas other
 than its native range tend to become a fast-propagating nuisance species. 

 To which I just have to ask: --- do you think
 this is just coincidence?

 The owner of the Whitehouse.com Web site, one of the
 best examples that the Internet isn&apos;t always what it seems, is getting out of
 the pornography business. 

 Daniel Parisi, 44 years old, said he plans to sell
 the Web site he started in 1997. Its name is easily confused with the official
 government site, whitehouse.gov. 

 Mr. Parisi&apos;s decision to sell the Whitehouse.com name
 and more than 100 derivations comes amid signs pointing to a rebound in the
 market for reselling Web addresses. A Florida man sold men.com in December for
 $1.3 million. 

 Mr. Parisi said he doesn&apos;t know yet how much the
 names will fetch. He claimed the Whitehouse.com site earns more than $1
 million each year in revenue and said he&apos;s invested more than $7 million since
 1997. 

 The site currently features a picture of Democratic
 front-runner John Kerry with the message,&quot;Our candidates are better
 looking.&quot; 

 One company expressed early interest. Bob Roberts, a
 vice president at National Fruit Product Co. of Winchester, Va., which makes
 White House applesauce and apple juice, said he would contact Mr. Parisi to
 discuss a deal. The company previously fought Mr. Parisi in federal court over
 trademark claim

 &quot;Colleges That Transmit Sound and Video
Online Reluctantly Discuss Strategy for Answering Patent Claim, by Scott
Carlson, The Chronicle of Higher Education, February 6, 2004, Page A27. 
 
 Colleges, along with
 pornography distributors and mainstream businesses, are struggling for ways to
 refute claims by Acacia Research Corporation, which says it owns patents on
 the streaming technology that allows Web users to transmit and play sound and
 video. In letters to companies and to many colleges, Acacia is seeking
 licensing deals that would pay it 2 percent of the gross revenue the
 recipients derive from such online media. 

 Acacia has had some successes
 recently. It was just granted another patent for streaming technology in
 Europe. It signed up a hotel pay-per-view company and, in a coup, a
 pornography company that had been part of a small group of adult-entertainment
 sites fighting the patent claims in court. 

 Acacia has also started sending
 letters to major corporations. General Dynamics, the billion-dollar
 aerospace-and-defense contractor, signed a licensing deal in late December. 

 Meanwhile, colleges are
 reluctantly trying to decide whether to band together to challenge Acacia&apos;s
 claims. Among higher-education providers, only 24/7 University, a
 for-profit distance-learning company based in Dallas, is known to have agreed
 to a deal. 

 Robert A Berman, senior vice
 president for business development at Acacia, said colleges had&quot;panicked&quot;and&quot;assumed that we&apos;re asking for more than we&apos;re
 really asking for.&quot; 

 Acacia, he said, is seeking
 royalties from colleges only on revenues from their distance-learning courses. The company is willing to waive royalties on revenue from other classes that
 use streaming technology. &quot;We&apos;re talking about licenses in the
 $5,000-to-$10,000-a-year range--at least for now,&quot;he said. 

 Acacia officials won&apos;t say how
 many colleges, or which ones, they have written to. Institutions of all
 sizes have received the letters, but it is unclear what criteria the company
 used in choosing them. 

 &apos;BUSINESS DECISION&apos; 

 24/7 University struck an
 agreement with Acacia early this month. Delwin Hinkle, chief executive
 officer of the university, called the deal&quot;simply a business
 decision.&quot; 

 &quot;They tell you that they
 have $55-million in the bank and that they are willing to spend that to
 enforce their patents,&quot;he said. &quot;We looked at it and said
 it&apos;s just another tweak to our cost structure, and we don&apos;t have the money,
 the time, or the inclination to mess with them.&quot; 

 Mr. Hinkle said he had tried to
 contact major universities to discuss a collective defense but never got a
 response. He did not consider joining in the pornography companies&apos;
 litigation. &quot;You&apos;re known by the company you keep,&quot;he said. &quot;No disrespect to their business, but I&apos;m a Baptist deacon, and I can&apos;t
 hang with those boys.&quot; 

 E. Michael (Spike) Goldberg,
 chief executive of HomegrownVideo.com, is leading the pornographers&apos; fight
 against Acacia. He has been frustrated by higher education&apos;s
 unwillingness to work with him or join his case. 

  Continued in the article. 
 
 February 12, 2004 message from David R.
Fordham [fordhadr@JMU.EDU ]  
 
 Bob,  

 In the IT circles, my
 experience has been that Acacia has the same reputation as a shirtless,
 tattooed, multi-pierced skinhead who walks up to your car at a stoplight,
 splashes Coke on your windshield, wipes it off with a paper towel and demands
 $5 for cleaning your car. 

 According to what
 I&apos;ve heard at a lot of IT conferences, Acacia is a firm of sleazebag lawyers
 whose only claim to business legitimacy is the buying of semi-worthless
 patents which are vague enough to be stretched and convoluted and contorted to
 cover some activity that the general population is already engaged in (such as
 breathing, eating, etc.) and then doing a lot of research to find a hapless
 victim who is too clueless or too poor to afford a decent lawyer to find
 knowledgable expert witnesses so the Acacia team can snow-job a clueless jury
 into believing that the vague patent has been infringed. Then, Acacia uses
 their&quot;success&quot;to scare (e.g., legal extortion?) a lot of other
 clueless companies into settling for&quot;licensing fees&quot;, which they
 then hold up in other court cases as&quot;legitimizing&quot;their claim to
 the vague patent covering the activity. They only take an interest in
 activities which have become such an integral part of society as to cause
 great hardship if they cease, since Acacia&apos;s goal is not to stop patent
 infringement as much as it is to extort licensing fees from others who are
 doing all the work. 

 Acacia&apos;s streaming
 video claim is based on a patent issued to an individual in 1992 for
 transmitting music electronically. But MP3 (the Motion Picture Experts Group
 Audio Level 3) file format was invented in 1989 and released to the public in
 1991. The Acacia claim is that any file which can be used to reconstruct any
 music or video image is covered by their patent and cannot be transmitted
 electronically (e.g., like a CD player playing in your living room while you
 are talking to your grandma on the phone!) unless Acacia receives royalties.
 In other words, if you sing a jingle on your digital answering machine, you
 are violating the same Acacia patent which Acacia is using to sue college and
 universities. 

 From the scuttlebutt
 at IT conferences, Acacia&apos;s only business is filing lawsuits. They do not
 invent anything, they don&apos;t manufacture anything, they only file lawsuits and
 collect royalties and fees. 

 I don&apos;t have any
 first-hand knowledge of any of this, but I have heard many times of their
 questionable business practices at conferences, and several of my student
 groups over the last few years have done some research and reported on this
 phenomenon. One of them described Acacia&apos;s relationship to the IT industry as
 the&quot;Nigerian Treasure Scam&quot;is to the banking industry. 

 Although Acacia may
 have some institutions cowed, I&apos;m not sure based on what I&apos;ve read, that it is
 much more than a paper tiger that was able to snow-job some juries. (Having
 served on five juries, I have positively no confidence in a jury to make a
 good decision on something like this, and the judges of my experience are only
 marginally better!) I know our legal people here have turned up their nose at
 Acacia&apos;s&quot;success&quot;, and aren&apos;t the least bit worried. 

 Check out: http://www.streamingmedia.com/patent/   

 My reference to&quot;Acacia&apos;s Flying Circus&quot;was a reference to Monte Python&apos;s antics,
 shenanigans, and sheer ludicrousness, engaging in activities which are so
 bizarre as to be almost beyond belief. (The dead parrot sketch, for example --
 involving the Acacia pet store, and their customer, the very first gullible
 jury they snowed.)

 PricewaterhouseCoopers Revenue Breakdown 

 For the Year 2003, PwC reports more revenue from Europe ($6.655 billion) than
from all of North America and the Caribbean ($5.431 billion). Total
revenue from other parts of the world bring this up to $14.535 billion from
continuing operations. The growth over 2002 was 5.5%, with Europe growing
at an 11.2% clip while the growth in North America and the Caribbean was a
negative 0.9% decline. 

 Assurance and Business Advisory Services (including auditing) revenues
increased 12.3% to $8.983 billion. Tax and Legal Services lagged at 2.5%
growth to $4.293 billion. 

 Source: PwC 2003 Global Annual Review , Page 7. 

 On Page 9 there is a graph showing the number of audit clients versus
other clients broken down into industry groupings. In many instances, the
proportion of audit clients is much lower than the number of other
clients. Smaller clients are growing in number. 

 No breakdown is given for auditing revenue by itself, although on Page 11 it
is reported that&quot;advisory and tax revenues from top-tier audit clients
have fallen by 16%.&quot; PwC blames much of this on client efforts to cut
back, in the wake of newer regulations, on other services when PwC is the
external audit firm.

 EUROPEAN UNION WITHHOLDING SUPPORT OF IASB RULES ON
 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

 I had the opportunity to meet with Sir David Tweedie
 and Tom Jones of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) this
 week. Recently, there have been extensive discussions regarding the European
 Union&apos;s failure to endorse IASB rules on financial instruments (IAS 32&amp;39). If this occurs, it could seriously harm the board&apos;s credibility as an
 independent standard-setter. Some of the main discussion points include: 

 Central issue in the debate about derivatives:
 whether IASB should allow some form of&quot;macro-,&quot;or portfolio, hedge
 accounting, a technique used by banks to lessen the risk of big losses on
 their accounts with hedging derivatives. The IASB wants banks to reflect the
 fluctuation in the value of these instruments in accounts, but banks say this
 will create artificial volatility in results and won&apos;t reflect the real
 economic position of banks. European financial institutions feel that the
 standard setters are ignoring the way they manage their businesses. The SEC is
 not likely to accept filings from European companies if the EU doesn&apos;t require
 them to adhere to the IASB&apos;s derivative rules. Current problems could lead to
 European banks using different standards to produce their accounts --
 undermining the EU&apos;s aim to maintain consistent reporting by companies in
 Europe. All of the parties have agreed to try to resolve the dispute over IAS
 32 and 39 by setting up a high-level working group consisting of government,
 central bank, industry, and IASB officials. The group will work together to
 resolve the differences before March, when the IASB is planning on publishing
 its final derivative standards.

 PENSION FIX UPDATE 
On Jan. 28, the Senate overwhelmingly approved (86-9) legislation to replace
 the defunct 30-year Treasury rate for pension liability calculations with a
 high-quality corporate bond index for two years. The Senate passed the
 legislation on a temporary basis because they wanted to have a more in-depth
 discussion about additional long-term pension funding issues. The legislation
 still needs to be reconciled with the House bill that accomplishes nearly the
 same objective, but recent roadblocks to full reconciliation have cropped up
 from both sides of the aisle. We urge you to contact your members of Congress
 here and let them know how important this issue is to you. 

 PCAOB AUDITING STANDARD ON INTERNAL CONTROLS
Rumors abound as to when the PCAOB is going to send its long-awaited standard
 on auditing internal controls to the SEC. Comments were due in November, and
 the implementation date begins for companies with June 15, 2004 year-ends.
 Lacking a final standard to go by, companies and auditors are using the draft
 that was issued last fall. For companies with summer year-ends, it has been a
 very difficult issue to grapple with. I&apos;m told the PCAOB is trying to be
 responsive to the 189 comment letters that they received and are continuing to
 work with the SEC to ensure that the SEC supports the standard as provided to them.
 (The process requires that the standard go to the SEC and be subject to
 another public comment period prior to finalization.) When pressed for a time
 frame, the response is that they are doing their best to get it out as soon as
 possible. I&apos;ve spoken to several of the audit firms as well -- they are
 equally as anxious and concerned. We&apos;ll keep you posted. 
 
 &quot;KPMG Strategists Describe
Benefits of Effective Risk Management,&quot; SmartPros , February 9, 2004
--- http://www.smartpros.com/x42423.xml   
 
 Two senior executives
 of KPMG LLP have authored a new business guide to help corporate leaders and
 boards of directors develop and implement effective risk-management
 strategies. 

 Risk: From the CEO
 and Board Perspective, Mary Pat McCarthy and Tim Flynn, offers insights on how
 to confront and control risk. The book describes how to best shape an
 organization&apos;s structure to assess and manage risk in ways that will maximize
 shareholder value, and determine how closely risk management should be
 integrated into business, operational and financial planning. 

 According to
 McCarthy, risk management is no longer just a defensive measure.&quot;There
 are positive rewards to risk management,&quot;she said.&quot;Implemented
 properly, sound risk assessments and responses can have a significant impact
 on a company&apos;s reputation and bottom line, and enhance shareholder value and
 transparency.&quot; 

 The book advocates
 taking a holistic view on risk. According to Flynn, risk management must now
 extend well beyond traditional financial and insurable hazards to encompass a
 wide variety of strategic, operational, reputation, regulatory and information
 risks.&quot;Businesses who take a holistic view of risks and their
 interdependencies, can be more agile and adept at responding to them,&quot;Flynn said. 

 In addition to the
 thought leadership of McCarthy, Flynn and other KPMG professionals, the book
 draws on the experiences of top executives from Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard,
 Viacom, Sprint and Motorola. 

 Chief among the
 strategies suggested for developing sound risk management is the separate and
 independent management of the process of reporting, measuring and controlling
 risks from those who generate them.&quot;Just as an independent board, audit
 committee and auditor are critical to effective corporate governance, an
 independent risk-management function is essential to effective
 operations,&quot;said McCarthy. 

 Risk: From the CEO
 and Board Perspective is available in hardcover, priced at $27.95.

 New $20,000 Fellowships for Doctoral
Students in Business 

 Canada is only
producing about half of the PhD-qualified business professors it needs, he said.
And only half of those professors stay in Canada to teach. 

 &quot;Concordia gets cash for business
school National bank putting up $1 million. Trying to pave the way for more
students to pursue their studies to the PhD level,&quot;by Nicolas Van Praet, The
Gazette , February 9, 2004 --- http://snipurl.com/FinancePHD   
 
 Concordia
 University&apos;s John Molson School of Business is trying to counter what it says
 is a lack of university finance professors by putting in place a new
 fellowship program to train PhD candidates. 

 The school will
 announce today that the National Bank is donating $1 million toward the
 program. The money will support the work of doctoral candidates in the field
 of finance over the next 10 years. 

 &quot;There&apos;s a
 dearth that already exists for business professors in general,&quot;said
 Jerry Tomberlin, dean of the John Molson School. 

 Canada is only
 producing about half of the PhD-qualified business professors it needs, he
 said. And only half of those professors stay in Canada to teach. 

 &quot;Some of them go
 to the private sector, many of them go to academia in the U.S.&quot; 

 A professor can make
 more in the U.S. than he or she can in Canada. And private-sector work is
 often even more lucrative. 

 The U.S. and other
 countries also lack business professors, particularly finance professors,
 Tomberlin said. In part, that&apos;s because finance and accounting have become
 very popular subjects attracting growing numbers of students. 

 The John Molson
 School is trying to pave the way for more students to pursue their studies to
 the PhD level and then choose teaching by subsidizing their schooling,
 Tomberlin said. 

 He said if the
 university can&apos;t hire qualified faculty, it will be forced to cut down on the
 number of graduates it produces. In turn, that means fewer potential recruits
 for banks and other financial institutions. 

 Tony Meti, senior
 vice-president of commercial banking (International) at the National Bank,
 said the bank wants to help finance the development and retention of qualified
 finance professionals.&quot;We wanted to do our part to make sure that people
 get the right training and right opportunities here in Quebec and stay in
 Quebec.&quot; 

 The program will
 target a total of 50 students over the next decade, or five students per year.
 Each fellowship will be worth $20,000.

 Mathematics of Marriage: DIFFERENTial Equations 

 &quot;The mathematics (of predicting
marriage breakdown) we came up with is trivial, but the
model is astonishingly accurate,&quot;says Murray.&quot;What we did is extract
key elements into a model so that it is interpretive and predictive.&quot;
 The team presented their research on February 12, 2004 at the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Seattle,
Washington. 

 &apos;Mathematical formula &apos;predicts marriage breakdown&apos;,&quot; New Scientist ,
February 4, 2004 --- http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994676   
 
 The secret to finding lasting love might remain a
 mystery to most, but two US researchers claim to have come up with a
 mathematical model that can predict whether a relationship will fail. 

 The researchers also say their system provides a
 simplified way of counselling couples and can help them to overcome
 relationship problems. However, the method has yet to be verified
 independently and is based in part on a subjective analysis. 

 John Gottman, a clinical psychologist, and
 mathematicians James Murray and Kristin Swanson, all at the University of
 Washington, based their model on interviews with hundreds of newlywed couples
 carried out over the last 15 years. 

 The team says they can predict if a marriage was
 going to break up within four years with 94 per cent accuracy. The further
 claim that it has been successful at helping troubled couples to abandon the
 idea of divorce in 65 per cent of cases. 

 &quot;The mathematics we came up with is trivial, but
 the model is astonishingly accurate,&quot;says Murray.&quot;What we did is
 extract key elements into a model so that it is interpretive and
 predictive.&quot; 

 Sex and money 

 The first step in the process is analysing a
 conversation between the couple concerning a matter of contention or
 disagreement, such as sex or money. Observers score each partner during the
 conversation using a strict set of criteria. 

 Important factors include the extent to which someone
 is able to influence their partner&apos;s opinion and whether a positive statement
 from one person produces a positive or negative response from their spouse. 

 Using these scores, the researchers developed and
 tested various different equations to explain the way the couples responded to
 each other. They found that a particular differential equation enabled them to
 use one person&apos;s score to predict their partner&apos;s score with great accuracy. 

 The equation can then be used to generate a graph
 that provides a more general representation of the couple&apos;s relationship. The
 shape of this graph is used by the researchers to predict how likely the
 relationship is to survive. 

 The graphs can also be used to show couples seeking
 counselling how they could get on better. It could, for example, be used to
 recommend that one partner try to be more positive in response to certain
 statements. 

 But the researchers acknowledge that the model might
 not work well in cultural contexts outside the United States. 

 The team presented their research on February 12, 2004 at the annual
 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Seattle,
 Washington. 
 
 &quot;FASB Confirms Standard On Medicare Accounting,&quot;by Lingling Wei, The
Wall Street Journal , February 12, 2004 ---  
 
  It&apos;s getting less murky how companies should
 book the effects of a new Medicare bill in their financial statements. 

 In a closely watched decision Wednesday, the
 Financial Accounting Standards Board said companies should follow the existing
 rules governing post-retirement benefit costs to account for the effects. 

 In essence, it means that companies should book the
 amount of federal subsidy they expect to receive under the Medicare Act as a
 reduction of future benefit costs -- instead of as a stream of income from
 continuing operations. 

 The Medicare Act, having generated massive political
 arguments, has also created an accounting debate since it was signed into law
 last December. Some say the subsidy is provided to employers, and therefore
 companies should be allowed to book it as a component of income; others argue
 that the subsidy is just another form of Medicare reimbursement that should be
 used in calculating future medical benefits of retirees. 

 The bill entitles companies that provide prescription
 drug benefits for retirees to receive a federal subsidy beginning in 2006. In
 other words, Medicare will reimburse employers for 28% of the amount they
 spend on each retiree&apos;s drugs between $250 and $5,000. The bill also creates a
 new drug benefit for seniors who currently don&apos;t have prescription coverage. 

 Current accounting rules require companies to
 estimate, among other things, the portion of cost to be reimbursed by
 government programs -- such as Medicare -- in order to measure the future cost
 of providing post-retirement benefits. 

 &quot;Given the magnitude of the obligations for
 employers, it&apos;s likely to be preferable for the federal subsidy to be directly
 offset against the obligations,&quot;said Barbara Bald, a principal at
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP&apos;s human resource services. 

 Auto makers, telecommunications concerns,
 conglomerates and drug makers are companies that tend to have large
 post-retirement benefit obligations. The top 50 companies in the Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s 500 Index in terms of the retiree obligations, according to Bear
 Stearns, include General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., SBC Communications
 Inc., Verizon Communications, Lucent Technologies Inc., General Electric Co.
 and BellSouth Corp. 

 In light of many uncertainties surrounding the
 legislative changes, FASB decided early last month to let companies choose
 either to attempt to recognize the effects right now, or to defer doing so
 until the board comes up with its guidelines. 

 BellSouth is among the companies that have made the
 attempt. The company told investors and analysts in a conference call in late
 January that the Medicare Act would reduce its 2004 retiree medical
 obligations by $290 million and accordingly, its estimated 2004 earnings per
 share would be 10 cents higher than it had expected in November. 

 After Wednesday&apos;s meeting, what remains unclear is
 whether the reduced costs should be recognized immediately -- which would be
 translated to a one-time gain to profits -- or amortized over time. FASB, a
 seven-member body responsible for writing U.S. accounting rules, is expected
 to answer that question at a meeting next week. 

 &quot;If companies chose to account for the effects
 immediately, I think most analysts would exclude the gain from earnings
 because it&apos;s a noncash payment and it&apos;s not related to companies&apos; core
 operations,&quot;said Chris Senyek, an accounting analyst at Bear Stearns. 
 
 To My Graduate Students: 

 This is not an assignment for ACCT
5341. I thought you might have a mild interest in the message. 

 Arthur Levitt was a Chairman of the SEC
who fought hard to force auditors to become more independent, especially in
terms of conflicts of interest between consulting and auditing the same firms.
(Recall that Andersen&apos;s Houston office received $25 million per year in
consulting services from Enron and $25 million per year in audit fees from
Enron). I don&apos;t think Levitt is a CPA, but Lynn Turner is a CPA, former partner
at Coopers, and former CFO of a high-tech corporation.

Re: NHL Accounting 

 Bob,  

 By the way, there is
 a very interesting report that you might want to mention in Bookmarks. It is a
 review of the finances of the National Hockey League done by former SEC
 Chairman Arthur Levitt with the assistance of the Eisner accounting firm and
 former SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner. It&apos;s available at: http://nhl.speedera.net/images/levittreport.pdf    

 Beyond the question
 of whether Levitt is practicing auditing without a license, the report would
 make an interesting discussion case in an advanced auditing class. The NHL
 seems to be trying to make a case that players&apos; salaries are too high as a
 percentage of revenues for the league. But the financial information they use
 to make this case suffers from several problems including the fact that
 different teams have different arrangement for their facility (owned vs.
 leased), that teams have different local media contracts, and other matters.
 Levitt seems to have done a reasonable job of gathering reasonably reliable
 information but I suspect that some parties will challenge at least a few of
 his approaches. I&apos;m not a hockey fan, but I am a sports fan in general and I
 enjoyed reading about the financial tangles of one of the major sports.

The End of Poverty: An Interview with Muhammad Yunus http://www.globalenvision.org/library/4/527/6/ 

 In 1976, Dr. Muhammad
 Yunus lent a small amount of money (approximately $27) to a group of 42 women
 near his home in the port city of Chittagong in Bangladesh. Out of this rather
 inauspicious beginning, the roots were planted for the Grameen Bank (Grameen
 means village in Bengali), an organization that has made over $4 billion in
 small loans to poor Bangladeshis in an effort to provide credit, or more
 accurately microcredit, to persons unable to receive this type of assistance
 from traditional banks. The Grameen Bank is in the spotlight this week as a
 high-profile regional summit on micocredit (which will feature visits from
 Queen Sofia of Spain and talks by Dr. Yunus), is convened in Dhaka on February
 16. The summit on microcredit will involve serious discussion about how to
 bring 100-million poor persons around the world under the microfinance program
 by the year 2005. While Dr. Yunus has been criticized by some in the banking
 community as merely performing a type of glorified charity work, he remains
 confident about his rather successful efforts noting,&quot;I don&apos;t care if
 the rich get rich. It doesn&apos;t bother me. They should get richer. I&apos;m worried
 about the poor getting poorer and not getting richer.&quot;

 &quot;ERP: The Once and Future King of
Campus Computing,&quot;by Catherine Murphy, Syllabus , February 2004 --- http://www.syllabus.com/article.asp?id=8868   
 
 In higher education,
 ERPs are no longer optional. But many approaches exist to fit the individual
 campus. 

 ERP, or enterprise
 resource planning systems, are in place at many colleges and universities, and
 many more are considering going with ERP in the future. The promise of ERP is
 that it will integrate disconnected business operations such as student
 administration, human resources, and financial systems that have been
 previously handled by disparate legacy systems, while satisfying the need for
 real-time, on-demand information. 

 Using the Web, new
 ERP platforms can not only help streamline university business processes for
 school administrators, but also for students, faculty, and alumni. Using their
 own PCs, these constituents can access their own data, look up their own
 grades, register for classes, and apply for financial aid through the ERP
 system. Staff can apply for new positions and access their employee records
 without having to visit human resources. 

 Connecting the ERP
 system to a portal pushes the data and applications even closer to the user,
 eliminating many interim steps, shifting some of the work burden from the
 provider to the end user. 

 So far, ERP sounds
 like a great idea. Yet, converting to an ERP system is a bit like building a
 new house to replace an old bungalow. You know you need it, and you can
 imagine how much more functionality the new house will have, but the old house
 is paid for and hard to give up. Plus theres bound to be disruption during
 the building process and of course some surprises along the way. 

 So the first
 principle of ERP is: expect the unexpected. According to William Shepard,
 director of applications integration and development for Cleveland State
 University, what people expect from an ERP implementation does not always
 match reality. When you think of expectations and reality, remember these
 two words: reduction and increase, says Shepard. Everyone thinks theyll
 save somethingpeople, costs. The reality is that you usually dont. 

 Many schools dont
 anticipate the costs theyll incur in training and hiring staff. The
 transition to a new software platform may be a difficult adjustment for some
 employees. According to Dave Wasik, director, enterprise applications services
 for the University of Akron, Unless you spend extra money on staffing, you
 wont be able to take advantage of what ERP can do. Training is expensive,
 but its more expensive not to train. 

 Ultimately, ERP
 changes the universitys entire approach to both handling information and
 serving users. ERP forces you to change your fundamental approach to
 problem solving, says Shepard. He also recommends providing support during
 the transition. You have to transform your staff, he says. It may be
 helpful to provide some remedial training for them, so that theyre trained
 for the systems and software theyre going to have to handle. 

 Keep in mind, also,
 the cost of outside consultants or partners. While these can be expensive,
 they can also be invaluable, says Dave Swartz, CIO for George Washington
 University. Swartz recommends spending the money to get the expertise you
 need. Recognize that they [the vendors] are your partners. You have to
 choose a partner that will step up and knock out any problems that come up. 

 Still, its the CIO
 or system manager who has to decide what roles to give to in-house staff and
 what to hire out. Project management is critical to successful implementation.
 Some institutions may feel more confident hiring an outside consultant with
 previous experience in implementing ERP systems. Other institutions may want
 to lead the project from within. 

 And dont forget
 about the costs of hardware. The initial costs can be staggering, especially
 if new client hardware is involved. Its helpful to plan this upfront with a
 strategy for adding and upgrading units as needed. Says Shepard, You need
 to keep the PCs relatively current and maintain them, and that takes money and
 staff. We [at Cleveland State] implemented a PC buying plan and a four-year
 refresh program to replace the machines every four years. 

 Can an ERP
 installation be done affordably? Yes, depending on your definition of
 affordable. Says Swartz, There is an ERP system for every type of
 institution. For instance, there are some vanilla systems out there that are
 quite economical. 

 Realistically,
 however, an investment in ERP is one of the most expensive IT investments a
 university can make. Overall costs in the tens of millions are typical. Wasik
 says, The number of decisions are incredible. How much consulting do we
 need? How do we size processors correctly? These are all difficult decisions,
 but they have to be managed in order to manage costs. 

 Despite the costs
 involved, Shepard warns not to spend too much time watching the bottom line.
 This is a big project, he says. Dont try to be a hero, delivering
 something cheaper and faster. Go to the board and ask them for the time,
 money, and flexibility you think you will need. Dont expect to stay within
 a budget. 

 For Swartz, who has
 implemented a few of these systems, planning is critical, as is expecting the
 costs to continue over several years. Expect the maintenance costs and
 upgrade costs to be high. They are very expensive and often underestimated.

 &quot;New Claim Game,&quot;by Charles Babcock, Information Week , Feb.
9, 2004 --- http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=17602359   
 
 Insurance companies want doctors to bypass
 clearinghouses and submit claims directly. The move could cut costs and
 complexities from the system.  

 On March 1, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Inc. will
 take a drastic step to realize the savings
 intended by the federally mandated Health Insurance Portability and
 Accountability Act, which went into effect
 four months ago. The insurance company will no longer pay&quot;click
 charges&quot;of about 35 cents per transaction to WebMD Corp., the industry&apos;s
 largest medical-claims-processing clearinghouse, which handles a third of the
 10 million claims Harvard Pilgrim pays out every year. In addition to
 establishing rules to ensure patient privacy, HIPAA set standards for the
 electronic exchange of information that in theory should ease connection
 problems between health-care providers and insurance companies, while reducing
 costs associated with manually processing paperwork. Harvard Pilgrim
 eventually wants to eliminate clearinghouses from its payment-processing
 system and have doctors submit claims directly to it using EDI or Web
 services. 

 A first step is to stop paying transaction fees to
 WebMD; they&apos;re costing Harvard Pilgrim more than $3.5 million a year.&quot;With HIPAA, it&apos;s our belief that we no longer need to pay clearinghouse
 click charges,&quot;says Kimberly Grose, VP of network operations at the
 insurance provider. 

 Harvard Pilgrim&apos;s decision relates to a bigger
 question being asked in the health-care industry: Do clearinghouses provide a
 valuable service or merely add unnecessary costs? The industry has long
 depended on them to aggregate claims coming from physicians&apos; offices and send
 them in batches to the correct payers, at a cost of about $414 million a year
 to insurance companies, according to Forrester Research. But Harvard Pilgrim
 and others, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield, are hoping that
 will change with HIPAA and the acceptance of Web-services technologies. 

 As the largest claims processor, WebMD is stumbling
 in its efforts to convince the industry that its clearinghouse adds value. Its
 failure to provide HIPAA-compliant files in tests last August was the final
 straw in Harvard Pilgrim&apos;s decision, Grose says. WebMD&apos;s failure to file HIPAA-compliant
 claims since the law went into effect Oct. 16 reaffirms that decision.&quot;We haven&apos;t received a HIPAA-compliant transaction from WebMD,&quot;Grose says, while other clearinghouses have complied. 

 Harvard Pilgrim isn&apos;t the only group dissatisfied
 with WebMD. The American Medical Association wrote in a letter to WebMD CEO
 Roger Holstein on Jan. 8 that physicians within its member associations in
 Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, and Texas were experiencing lost claims
 and long delays in receiving payment for&quot;thousands, and in some cases,
 hundreds of thousands of dollars&quot;per practice.&quot;Physicians have
 identified WebMD most frequently as being noncompliant with HIPAA
 transaction&quot;and coding standards, the letter said. Tuft&apos;s Associated
 Health Plans Inc. in Massachusetts also has notified participating doctors
 that WebMD isn&apos;t forwarding HIPAA-compliant claims, according to the
 Massachusetts Medical Society. A Tufts Associated spokeswoman said an
 executive could not comment by press time.

 The Mystery of
Breast Cancer&quot;Practically Solved&quot; 

 &quot;Marin Won&apos;t Take No for an
Answer,&quot;by Kristen Philpkoski, Wired News , February 11, 2004 --- http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,62244,00.html?tw=newsletter_topstories_html   
 
 The mystery of high
 breast cancer rates in California&apos;s Marin County is practically solved, cancer
 experts say. 

 Studies have found
 that waiting until later in life to have children, taking hormone replacement
 therapy and drinking alcohol create a deadly lifestyle cocktail that leads to
 the majority of breast cancer cases in one of the most affluent and white
 communities in the United States. 

 Activists in Marin,
 who first noticed their county had higher rates of cancer compared to other
 U.S. counties about a decade ago, suspected from the beginning that the
 bucolic area&apos;s environment is to blame. But none of the studies performed in
 Marin has found anything in the soil, water or air to blame for the high
 breast cancer rates. 

 &quot;There have been
 several studies published that suggest that it&apos;s not anything unique about the
 point on the globe where Marin is located,&quot;said Tina Clarke, a research
 scientist at the Northern
 California Cancer Center .&quot;It&apos;s the character of the people that live
 in Marin County that explains their heightened breast cancer rates, as opposed
 to anything unique about the geography of the location.&quot; 

 In March 2003, a study (PDF) by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco showed
 that drinking two glasses of alcohol each day significantly increased breast
 cancer risk for women in Marin. Having no children or having them later in
 life compounded the risk. 

 That risk is higher
 still because women in Marin are more likely to have undergone hormone
 replacement therapy -- a practice many women assumed benefited their health
 until the Women&apos;s
 Health Initiative study in July 2002 revealed the treatment increased the
 risk of breast cancer. 

 Other
 studies over the past several years have come up with similar results. 

 &quot;The results of
 this study suggest that breast cancer occurrence is higher wherever there are
 more high-risk women, like in Marin County, and that there was no reason to
 believe that the environment in Marin was causing the higher rate of breast
 cancer,&quot;wrote researchers on the Northern California Cancer Center
 website. 

 But the people who
 live in Marin and have seen the disease in action say more studies are
 necessary. They cite possible contaminants from radioactive waste canisters
 off the Farallon
 Islands and the defunct Hamilton
 Air Force base in Novato, as well as a local rock quarry. No study proves
 that these can be ruled out as the source of breast cancer in Marin, they say. 

 &quot;It&apos;s so
 frustrating to hear people say it unequivocally is not this or not that,
 because you can&apos;t do it,&quot;said Judi Shils, director of the Marin
 Cancer Project . If environment is ruled out,&quot;every other white,
 wealthy community would have the same cancer rates.&quot; 

 The Marin Cancer
 Project has funded several research projects, including a comparison of Marin
 County to 33 other&quot;peer&quot;counties in the United States. Of them,
 eight were rich and white like Marin, but the county still came out No. 1 in
 both breast and prostate cancer.

 Bob, 

 While I usually do
 not like to start or enter theological debates in financial accounting, this
 one I could not resist. 

 In the early days of
 the SEC, there were fierce debates within the Commission if accounting
 principles should emphasize measurement or disclosures. This debate is
 well-documented in a bunch of places, the one that I like being in Chatov&apos;s
 book on Corporate Reporting. The accountants obviously advocated measurement
 (self-preservation and self-promotion probably being the motives) while the
 lawyers preferred disclosures. Ultimately the accountants won (perhaps because
 of the powerful personality of George May? -- I&apos;ll leave it to the accounting
 historians to decide). Also, the lawyers who dominated the SEC obviously
 weren&apos;t thrilled at the prospect of having to be subject to our own
 double-entry incantations. 

 In any case, SEC
 delegated accounting rule-making (which was much later challenged rightly in
 the courts by Arthur Andersen, who lost on account of lack of standing). SEC
 became, in effect, (except for rule-making via ASRs), a repository of
 financial reporting filings. Measurement became king, disclosure just a good
 thing to chant about, and all emphasis shifted to the&quot;bottom line&quot;,
 and out the window went common sense in the Briloffian sense. 

 To be frank, as a
 member of the public, I couldn&apos;t care less about the incantations of
 accountants so long as the disclosures are adequate. I personally couldn&apos;t
 care whether the companies expensed or capitalised stock options so long as
 ALL material information has been disclosed. We accountants have, since the
 1930s worked on the assumption that the public is dumb and so is the financial
 analyst community, and they need to be spoon-fed with just enough information
 to avoid their being constipated. The result has been the incredibly naive
 reliance by every one on the bottom-line, and our consequent role as the
 protectors of the corporate economy. 

 The impact of the
 above sequence of events on the education of the accountants, in my opinion,
 has been disastrous. One only needs to look at the typical intermediate
 accounting courses to note this disaster. The measurement aspect of
 transactions has been paramount at the expense of their business purpose, role
 in business processes, stakeholders&apos; interests and rights, the role of
 disclosures and of law in accounting,..... We really have become
 bean-counters. 

 I say the above with
 some trepidation, but with a lot of sadness.

 Jagdish, et al  

 I agree with you
 enthusiastically. The price we have paid by expunging history from our
 intellectual life -- remember the Five Mongraphs on Business Income and
 Edwards and Bells deconstruction of Sidney Alexander&apos;s presumption of the
 superiority of economists&apos; conceptualizations, i.e., accountants should tell
 us only what actually happened? There is a bandwagon about expensing stock
 options, but overlooked is the fact that we don&apos;t know how to do it. Black and
 Scholes aside, no mortal has the prescience to determine at the time an option
 is granted what it&apos;s value is -- it may indeed have no value at all. Expensing
 (which itself may be conceptually flawed since the option may simply be the
 capitalization of intellectual equity provided by managers and is the same as
 issuing stock to any other contributor of capital for whatever of value was
 invested) options creates another&quot;measurement&quot;technology that
 introduces enormous room for&quot;errors in estimate&quot;, another example
 of the hypothetical present value model of informing that so enthralls the
 rule-makers (as Clarence Darrow is once alleged to have said,&quot;Contempt
 for law is brought about by law making itself ridiculous&quot;) and Heaven
 knows, accounting has certainly made itself ridiculous over the past few
 years.  

 Perhaps we ought to
 trace this stock option problem to its source, i.e., the work of Jensen
 (Michael, not Robert) and Meckling who made this idea of linking executive
 rewards to the value of the company a fashionable idea -- another example of
 utopian thinking and belief in imaginary worlds (at least Jensen has recently
 admitted, to the degree those who know the truth can, that there have been
 some unintended consequences to the idea). Jagdish&apos;s preference for disclosure
 over&quot;measurement&quot;and accountability to multiple stakeholders is a
 theme that might be of great value to accounting&apos;s research agenda. For a
 profession to be so dominated by the notion that we exist to serve&quot;investors&quot;exclusively is myopic in the extreme. We somehow believe
 we perform some great public service oiling the machinery of Wall Street, but
 that may not be true. For example, the security market doesn&apos;t really provide
 much capital: it is mainly a mechanism for providing liquidity. According to
 the Federal Reserve when we look at net new equity provided by investors (new
 investment minus buybacks), investors may be a negative source of funding
 (e.g., in 1998 the figure was a negative 267 billion dollars (Federal Reserve
 Flow of Funds accounts for the U.S., www.federalreserve.gov  ).  

 Thomas Jefferson
 expressed an opinion of the place of corporations in American life,&quot;I
 hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations
 which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid
 defiance to the laws of our country.&quot;Obviously, we didn&apos;t. Accounting
 statements may be more valuable as&quot;narratives about power&quot;told to
 those to whom this power is allegedly accountable than as&quot;measurements
 useful for predicting the timing, amount and uncertainty of cash flows.&quot;For example, rather than expensing stock options, wouldn&apos;t it be instructive
 to simply disclose the average wage rate, the range of wages, and simply the
 number of employees granted options, how many granted, and the exercise
 prices?  

 Most of us would be
 clever enough to figure out the rest. Or, if we are going to disclose the
 present value of stock compensation, why not also disclose each year the
 present value of future wages eliminated by the firing of employees?
 Eliminating jobs is a value adding activity (for a while at least); at the
 moment it seems to be the primary strategy for doing so. Doesn&apos;t&quot;representational faithfulness&quot;encompass such a measurement as
 well?

 &quot;Colleges That
Transmit Sound and Video Online Reluctantly Discuss Strategy for Answering
Patent Claim, by Scott Carlson, The Chronicle of Higher Education, February 6, 2004, Page A27. 
 
 Colleges,
 along with pornography distributors and mainstream businesses, are struggling
 for ways to refute claims by Acacia Research Corporation, which says it owns
 patents on the streaming technology that allows Web users to transmit and play
 sound and video. In letters to companies and to many colleges, Acacia is
 seeking licensing deals that would pay it 2 percent of the gross revenue the
 recipients derive from such online media. 

 Acacia
 has had some successes recently. It was just granted another patent for
 streaming technology in Europe. It signed up a hotel pay-per-view
 company and, in a coup, a pornography company that had been part of a small
 group of adult-entertainment sites fighting the patent claims in court. 

 Acacia
 has also started sending letters to major corporations. General
 Dynamics, the billion-dollar aerospace-and-defense contractor, signed a
 licensing deal in late December. 

 Meanwhile,
 colleges are reluctantly trying to decide whether to band together to
 challenge Acacia&apos;s claims. Among higher-education providers, only 24/7
 University, a for-profit distance-learning company based in Dallas, is known
 to have agreed to a deal. 

 Robert A
 Berman, senior vice president for business development at Acacia, said
 colleges had&quot;panicked&quot;and&quot;assumed that we&apos;re asking for more
 than we&apos;re really asking for.&quot; 

 Acacia,
 he said, is seeking royalties from colleges only on revenues from their
 distance-learning courses. The company is willing to waive royalties on
 revenue from other classes that use streaming technology. &quot;We&apos;re
 talking about licenses in the $5,000-to-$10,000-a-year range--at least for
 now,&quot;he said. 

 Acacia
 officials won&apos;t say how many colleges, or which ones, they have written to. Institutions of all sizes have received the letters, but it is unclear what
 criteria the company used in choosing them. 

 &apos;BUSINESS
 DECISION&apos; 

 24/7
 University struck an agreement with Acacia early this month. Delwin
 Hinkle, chief executive officer of the university, called the deal&quot;simply a business decision.&quot; 

 &quot;They
 tell you that they have $55-million in the bank and that they are willing to
 spend that to enforce their patents,&quot;he said. &quot;We looked at
 it and said it&apos;s just another tweak to our cost structure, and we don&apos;t have
 the money, the time, or the inclination to mess with them.&quot; 

 Mr.
 Hinkle said he had tried to contact major universities to discuss a collective
 defense but never got a response. He did not consider joining in the
 pornography companies&apos; litigation. &quot;You&apos;re known by the company you
 keep,&quot;he said. &quot;No disrespect to their business, but I&apos;m a
 Baptist deacon, and I can&apos;t hang with those boys.&quot; 

 E.
 Michael (Spike) Goldberg, chief executive of HomegrownVideo.com, is leading
 the pornographers&apos; fight against Acacia. He has been frustrated by
 higher education&apos;s unwillingness to work with him or join his case.

 February 12, 2004 message from David R.
Fordham [fordhadr@JMU.EDU ] 
 
 Bob, 

 In the IT circles, my
 experience has been that Acacia has the same reputation as a shirtless,
 tattooed, multi-pierced skinhead who walks up to your car at a stoplight,
 splashes Coke on your windshield, wipes it off with a paper towel and demands
 $5 for cleaning your car. 

 According to what
 I&apos;ve heard at a lot of IT conferences, Acacia is a firm of sleazebag lawyers
 whose only claim to business legitimacy is the buying of semi-worthless
 patents which are vague enough to be stretched and convoluted and contorted to
 cover some activity that the general population is already engaged in (such as
 breathing, eating, etc.) and then doing a lot of research to find a hapless
 victim who is too clueless or too poor to afford a decent lawyer to find
 knowledgable expert witnesses so the Acacia team can snow-job a clueless jury
 into believing that the vague patent has been infringed. Then, Acacia uses
 their&quot;success&quot;to scare (e.g., legal extortion?) a lot of other
 clueless companies into settling for&quot;licensing fees&quot;, which they
 then hold up in other court cases as&quot;legitimizing&quot;their claim to
 the vague patent covering the activity. They only take an interest in
 activities which have become such an integral part of society as to cause
 great hardship if they cease, since Acacia&apos;s goal is not to stop patent
 infringement as much as it is to extort licensing fees from others who are
 doing all the work. 

 Acacia&apos;s streaming
 video claim is based on a patent issued to an individual in 1992 for
 transmitting music electronically. But MP3 (the Motion Picture Experts Group
 Audio Level 3) file format was invented in 1989 and released to the public in
 1991. The Acacia claim is that any file which can be used to reconstruct any
 music or video image is covered by their patent and cannot be transmitted
 electronically (e.g., like a CD player playing in your living room while you
 are talking to your grandma on the phone!) unless Acacia receives royalties.
 In other words, if you sing a jingle on your digital answering machine, you
 are violating the same Acacia patent which Acacia is using to sue college and
 universities. 

 From the scuttlebutt
 at IT conferences, Acacia&apos;s only business is filing lawsuits. They do not
 invent anything, they don&apos;t manufacture anything, they only file lawsuits and
 collect royalties and fees. 

 I don&apos;t have any
 first-hand knowledge of any of this, but I have heard many times of their
 questionable business practices at conferences, and several of my student
 groups over the last few years have done some research and reported on this
 phenomenon. One of them described Acacia&apos;s relationship to the IT industry as
 the&quot;Nigerian Treasure Scam&quot;is to the banking industry. 

 Although Acacia may
 have some institutions cowed, I&apos;m not sure based on what I&apos;ve read, that it is
 much more than a paper tiger that was able to snow-job some juries. (Having
 served on five juries, I have positively no confidence in a jury to make a
 good decision on something like this, and the judges of my experience are only
 marginally better!) I know our legal people here have turned up their nose at
 Acacia&apos;s&quot;success&quot;, and aren&apos;t the least bit worried. 

 Check out: http://www.streamingmedia.com/patent/ 

 My reference to&quot;Acacia&apos;s Flying Circus&quot;was a reference to Monte Python&apos;s antics,
 shenanigans, and sheer ludicrousness, engaging in activities which are so
 bizarre as to be almost beyond belief. (The dead parrot sketch, for example --
 involving the Acacia pet store, and their customer, the very first gullible
 jury they snowed.)

 2. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my child as I was being

a list of names of men that I think were at the party if this helps. 

 3. I do not know the name of the father of my little girl. She was
conceived at a party [address and date given] where I had unprotected sex with a
man I met that night. I do remember that the sex was so good that I fainted. If
you do manage to track down the father can you send me his phone number? Thanks. 

 4. I don&apos;t know the identity of the father of my daughter. He drives a
BMW that now has a hole made by my stiletto in one of the door panels. Perhaps
you can contact BMW service stations in this area and see if he&apos;s had it
replaced. 

 5. I have never had sex with a man. I am awaiting a letter from the Pope
confirming that my son&apos;s conception was immaculate and that he is Christ risen
again. 

 6. I cannot tell you the name of child A&apos;s dad as he informs me that to do so
would blow his cover and that would have cataclysmic implications for the
British economy. I am torn between doing right by you and right by the country.
Please advise. 

 7. I do not know who the father of my child was. I can confirm that he
was a Royal Green Jacket. 

 8. [name given] is the father of child A. If you do catch up with him can you
ask him what he did with my AC/DC CDs? 

 9. From the dates it seems that my daughter was conceived at Euro Disney
maybe it really is the Magic Kingdom. 

 10. So much about that night is a blur. The only thing that I remember for
sure is Delia Smith did a program about eggs earlier in the evening. If I&apos;d have
stayed in and watched more TV rather than going to the party at [address given],
mine might have remained unfertilized. 

 11. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my baby, after all when
you eat a tin of beans you can&apos;t be sure which one made you fart. 
 
 North Dakota as Remembered by Paula 

 North Dakota State Bird: Mosquito State Tree: Telephone Pole 

 At Minot Air Force Base, the airmen were told North Dakota was a terrific
place to go because there was a woman behind every tree. (Fact: ND has fewer
trees than any state in the U.S.) 

 When we left Minot the last week in May, 1979, there was still a foot of snow
in our yard. We arrived in SA five days later and it was 98 degrees! 

 We felt silly with the electrical cord from the oilpan heater hanging out of
the car radiator...and miserable because our car had no a/c. In ND, businesses
had conveniently placed outdoor electrical sockets so you could plug your car in
while you shopped. Everyone had either an oil pan heater or an engine block
heater. Had to put a blanket over the engine every night, even though we had a
garage. We were lucky, had a 1966 Corvair with an air-cooled engine. Never had
trouble starting it, no matter how cold the weather was. Had to put a 100-pound
bag of rock salt in the trunk (which was in the front of the car) to keep the
Corvair from airplaning when I drove over 60 mph. Ralph Nader sent one of his
Raiders to visit us around 1974. I was an environmental activist, ran for the
State Legislature, sat on many boards and committees in a 7-state area. Nader&apos;s
Raider patiently explained the campaign against nuclear power plants. He said,&quot;You need to set up your table at the top of the escalators in the malls.
That way, people won&apos;t see you until they get off the escalator and you can get
them to sign the petitions.&quot;I said,&quot;Well, I think there&apos;s an
escalator in Fargo.&quot;I told him I wouldn&apos;t tell Ralph he was driving a VW
if he wouldn&apos;t tell Ralph I was driving a Corvair. 

 We had a culture shock when we moved from Minot to San Antonio: crime (too
cold for criminals up there, maybe one murder ever 5 years), population (only
600,000 people in the whole state), traffic (drive across town in three minutes,
better yet, walk), food (from Lefse and Lutefisk to tacos and menudo) and ethnic
groups (from Ole Olson to Juan Garcia), weather (!!!!!), jokes (from Norwegian&quot;Sven and Ole&quot;jokes to Aggie jokes--actually they&apos;re the same
jokes)...you name it. 

 I think your NH home is gorgeous. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll enjoy it.

 For Sven, Ole, and Lena stories, try the following:

 Ole was
 talking with his brother Sven, who lived next door, when Sven said,&quot;Ya
 know Ole, you and Lena should really get some new curtains.&quot; 

 
&quot;Vhy&apos;s dat?&quot;Ole asked. 

 
&quot;Vel last night I saw you and Lena, vel you know...&quot; 

 
Ole thought for awhile, then said,&quot;Ha-ha Sven, da jokes on you! I vasn&apos;t
 even home last night!&quot; 
 
 Ole, Lena ,
 and Sven were trapped by deep snow in New
 Hampshire and were becoming desperate, having run out of food several days ago. It was
 winter, the snow was deep, their situation was looking very bleak. When Ole
 dug down into the snow to look for something to eat, he found an old lamp and
 upon rubbing it to get the snow off, a genie came out. 

 
The genie says,&quot;I am the great genie of the North and I can grant each
 of you one wish.&quot;
Ole says,&quot;I vish I vas back in Texas .&quot;Poof, Ole was gone. 

 
 Lena quickly says,&quot;I vish I vas back in Texas wit Ole.&quot;Poof, Lena was gone. 

 
Sven was sitting there looking sad and the genie finally says,&quot;What is
 your wish?&quot;and Sven says,&quot;Gee, I&apos;m really lonely. I vish Ole and Lena vas back here with me&quot;.

 Professor
Planck, of Berlin, the most famous originator of the quantum theory, once
remarked to me that in early life he had thought of studying economics, but had
found it too difficult! Professor Planck could easily master the whole corpus of
mathematical knowledge in a few days. He did not mean that! But the amalgam of
logic and intuition and the wide knowledge of facts, most of which are not
precise, which is required for economic interpretation in its highest form is,
quite truly, overwhelmingly difficult for those whose gifts mainly consist in
the power to imagine and pursue to their furthest points the implications and
prior conditions of comparitively simple facts which are known to a high degree
of precision. 
John Maynard Keynes, Essays in Biography  (Macmillan; London, 1933)
As quoted in a recent message from Roger Collins 

 From Joel S. Demski et al,&quot;Some
Thoughts on the Intellectual Foundations of Accounting,&quot; Accounting
Horizons , June 2002, pp. 162-163. It is confusing that the passage is
written in first person when there are four authors. I suspect that the
passage was written by Professor Demski. 
 
 The information
 school, though, lacks this clarity. To understand what to convey about
 this transaction requires we know the&quot;finer details&quot;that gave rise
 to the transaction in the first place. The beginning point is not the
 transaction, but the circumstances that led the firm to engage in the
 transaction. Thus, the very things we measure are exogenous in the value
 school, but endogenous in the information school. For example, with
 hedge accounting, the value school asks what is and how to measure the fair
 value to the entity; while the information school asks first why the entity
 engages in hedging activities and, second, how public or private information
 about such activities affects market or nonmarket interactions. This is
 far removed from the way we teach accounting. For that matter, simply
 having the infrastructure of uncertainty and information at center stage is
 far removed from the way we teach accounting. 

 In terms of
 fundamentals, then, it seems to me the issues are what are we trying to
 measure and how are we to manage that measurement activity? My fear is
 we are in the information business, intellectually and professionally, but
 have become addicted to thinking, teaching, learning, examining, regulating,
 and communicating as if we were in the valuation business. This,
 unfortunately, is an isomorphism that does not exist, and pretending otherwise
 is a roadblock to our progress. 
 
 Of course, the problem is, while the high priests
study high theory, the real world burns. 
Roger Collins (see below) 

 In the early 1950s, the Betty Crocker Company
introduced a cake mix so that people could readily make excellent tasting cakes
at home. No muss, no fuss: just add water, mix, and bake. The
product failed, even though taste tests confirmed that people like the
result. Why? An after-the-fact effort was made to find the
reasons. As the market researchers Bonnie Goebert and Herma Rosenthal put
it: &quot;The cake mix was too simple; the consumer felt no sense of
accomplishment, no involvement with the product. It made her feel useless,
especially if somewhere her aproned mom was still whipping up cakes from
scratch.&quot;

 I can think of
places, other than classrooms where the word&quot;interesting&quot;is bandied
about (art museums, for example, or recitals for cutting-edge music), but I
always suspect that people are hiding behind the word until they get a sense of
what the majority thinks. After all, you can&apos;t get into too much trouble when
hiding behind&quot;interesting.&quot;&quot;Lousy&quot;would have made it
clear that you hate the damn thing, and&quot;wonderful&quot;would have painted
you into a corner. 
An&quot;Interesting&quot;Commentary from a retiring professor, Sanford Pinsker
--- See below  

 Consider the European Union, collectively the
world&apos;s second-largest economy, after that of the United States. With aging
populations, high social welfare costs, rigid labor policies and lagging
productivity gains, European countries appear condemned to slow growth for years
to come. The demographics of Europe are especially worrisome; an older
population is likely to be more focused on preserving the status quo than on
taking risks, and fewer young workers will be supporting ever more retirees.

 In Canada, the private sector spends 2.8 percent of
gross domestic product on health care; in the United States, the private-sector
figure is 7.7 percent. And American private-sector spending falls
disproportionately on big employers like manufacturers. Some 97 percent of
members of the National Association of Manufacturers provide health care
coverage for employees. In 2002 alone, General Motors, which covers 1.2 million
Americans, spent $4.5 billion on health care. Uwe Reinhardt, an economist
at Princeton, has referred to General Motors, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler as&quot;a social insurance system that sells cars to finance itself.&apos;&apos;

 Then there is China. Its torrid growth may not be
all that it seems, as Alwyn Young, an economist at the University of Chicago,
has shown. China reported average annual growth of 9.2 percent from 1986 to
1998, but systematic underreporting of inflation accounts for perhaps three of
those percentage points, Dr. Young says. Another big chunk is attributable to
rising participation in the labor force and a shift of workers out of
agriculture.

 The world&apos;s great hope is that materialistic

On Saturday I received a message from Rosie Wyman announcing that her
longtime husband passed away on Friday, January 31. Services were scheduled for
February 7.

Hal Wyman was a special friend since we passed through the doctoral program
side-by-side in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. Hal
entered the doctoral program after being a Standard Oil Corporation executive
for many years in Peru. Although his doctorate was in finance, he crossed over
to teach and conduct research in accounting at the University of North Carolina,
the University of Connecticut, and Florida International University. I may have
missed a few stops along the way since I cannot find his resume online.
Throughout most of his professional career he was either a department chair or a
dean. He was involved in many international programs and lectured
extensively around the world. He was also sought after as a consultant.

Shortly after Hal stepped down as Dean of the College of Business
Administration at Florida International, Hal commenced to write plays. When he became seriously ill he was working on a play that he hoped to land on
Broadway.

Hal Wyman was a Renaissance man in every sense of the word. He devoured
books and was active in book reading clubs. He loved to travel. At
each stop, he actively toured about and searched out the history and culture of
cities and towns. He truly enjoyed museums, art galleries, theatres,
concerts, unusual restaurants, and five-star hotels. Unlike me, he would
rent automobiles and tour about the country in nations where he did not speak
the language (although he was very fluent in Spanish).

Whenever we crossed paths at conferences, the Jensens and
the Wymans generally went out on the town together. My heartfelt sympathy
goes out to Rosie and her surviving daughter (Angela). Rosie is a cancer
survivor herself who lost one of her two daughters to cancer when the young
woman was entering the prime of her life. Now Rosie lost her soul mate.

God Be With Hal&quot;Till We Meet Again!&quot;

New research says we can stay fat and live longer --- Now
we&apos;re talking my language!

&quot;Stay Fat and Live Long,&quot;by Kristen Philipkoski, Wired News ,
February 5, 2004 --- http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62169,00.html 
 
 Humanity&apos;s best bet for extreme lifespan extension is
 likely to be extreme calorie restriction. That means an average-size man
 living on about 1,800 calories a day. 

 While most people probably would like to live a
 longer, healthier life, a walk through any Wal-Mart is evidence that few
 Americans are inclined to severely restrict their diet. Luckily, researchers
 are coming closer to finding a way to mimic the effects of calorie
 restriction. 

 Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of
 Technology have identified key genes that regulate aging in humans. The work,
 published in the online version of the journal Cell , should prove
 exciting to researchers who study aging as well as to anyone who wants to live
 to 150, because manipulating these genes has doubled the lives of worms. It
 was unclear until now that the genes also regulate aging in humans -- and they
 happen to be the same genes researchers believe slow down the aging process as
 a result of calorie restriction. 

 &quot;That&apos;s why these (genes) are so
 important,&quot;said Leonard
 Guarente , the lead author of the study and a biology professor at MIT.
 Aside from severe dietary restrictions,&quot;the other way to skin the cat is
 to develop drugs that will interact with these regulators that will have the
 benefit of calorie restriction -- the gain without the pain.&quot; 

 Some researchers have argued that while genes might
 regulate aging in yeast and worms, aging doesn&apos;t work that way in humans. But
 Guarente, who is also a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and author of Ageless
 Quest, studied human and mouse cells in a dish and found that the same
 two genes that interact in lower forms of life do the same in humans. That
 proves, he said, that aging in humans is regulated, which presents the
 opportunity to manipulate the genes that do the regulating. 

 &quot;The importance of this is it&apos;s another step
 closer to understanding what happens to our body chemistry when caloric intake
 is dramatically restricted, which we know from 50 years of research is the
 only known way to slow and retard aging and its deleterious effects,&quot;said Daniel Perry, executive director of the Alliance
 for Aging Research . 

 The two genes in question engender what scientists
 believe are two key components of lifespan: the SIRT1 protein, and&quot;forkhead
 transcription factors.&quot;Basically, the SIRT1 gene represses the activity
 of the forkhead gene (so named because the gene also affects the development
 of fruit flies&apos; heads) when the organism is taking in fewer calories. Under
 normal circumstances, forkhead transcription factors can lead to damage in
 cells. The interaction basically helps human cells withstand physical stress. 

 &quot;That makes SIRT1 a putative regulator of
 lifespan in mammals and therefore a potential target for future therapy in
 humans as well,&quot;said Malene Hansen, a postdoctoral fellow in Cynthia
 Kenyon&apos;s lab at the University of California at San Francisco. Kenyon and
 her colleagues have extended six-fold the lifespan of C. elegans , a
 type of worm, by making them sterile and altering a gene that regulates the
 forkhead transcription factors, writes Brian Alexander in his book Rapture . 

 Scientists believe the evolutionary purpose of the
 phenomenon is to preserve life in the face of famine. If food is scarce, the
 mechanism slows down all bodily functions, thereby keeping the organism
 youthful. When food appears again, the organism hopefully will still be young
 enough to reproduce and pass along its genes. 

 People who practice calorie
 restriction are betting that&apos;s the case, although it&apos;s never been proven
 in a study to be true for humans. But worms, mice and primates all have been
 shown to appear to be younger on severe diets. Even after calorie-restricted
 animals die, they appear young physically. 

 &quot;They blow right past maximum number of months
 or years they&apos;re supposed to live,&quot;Perry said.&quot;When they finally
 die, researchers can barely find out reasons why they died. Their systems and
 all of their physical aspects appear to be that of a much, much younger
 animal.&quot; 

 The effects of calorie restriction are remarkable,
 researchers say, because the process protects all of the cells in the body. 

 &quot;A major point about calorie restriction is that
 it should simply be viewed as something that makes you live longer but also an
 antidote of many diseases associated with aging,&quot;including Alzheimer&apos;s,
 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, Guarente said. 

 The whole-body, or systemic, effect of calorie
 restriction led the MIT researchers directly to their next project. Guarente&apos;s
 lab will study the relationship between diet, fat and aging. A key outcome of
 calorie restriction, the researchers figure, is the disappearance of fat. And
 fat cells make hormones, which act systemically. 

 &quot;Fat is a direct route connecting diet to the
 rate of aging of all cells,&quot;Guarente said. He expects to publish those
 results in the next few months. 
 
And here&apos;s how to stay fat!

 Ethical Issues of an Academic Perk 

The bottom line is that colleges sometimes pay well over a thousand dollars
for a professor&apos;s trip to some vacation spot where he/she speaks to an audience
of less than five people, none of whom particularly want to listen but are
forced to politely listen since they will speak for twenty minutes to the same
five people before the 90-minute session is over and they can all escape to the
tourist sights for the rest of the trip.

Conference announcements are once again flying out like spam promoting&quot;academic&quot;conferences in exciting resorts in Europe, Bermuda, Mexico,
South America, Australia, etc. Some have registration fees of hundreds of
dollars but offer no plenary sessions, banquets, or even hosted receptions since
the conference attendees have little interest in either the papers to be
presented or interacting with the other registrants.

These conferences are what I call the Paid Vacation Academic Fraud that digs
deeply into college travel budgets and serves little purpose other than to
provide air fare, hotels, and daily expense allowances for what is tantamount to
a vacation. There are variations of this fraud. Examples are cited
below:

 I attended a legitimate academic conference in Berlin three years ago
 where most attendees participated in the all sessions and attended the
 luncheons and banquets. One professor from a leading university,
 however, showed up, paid the registration fee, had a casual lunch with me,
 and then flew off to Israel admitting that he just showed up to get his
 expenses paid to cross the ocean.

 I naively attended a conference in Europe two years ago where there were
 no plenary sessions, no receptions, no banquets, and not even free water
 between sessions. The sessions had an average of five people that
 included a moderator and four speakers. The speakers each spoke for 20
 minutes, politely listened to the other three speakers, and then never
 appeared in any other session. They mostly joined their spouses and
 children after their session was over and dispersed into other parts of
 Europe. Their home colleges, however, paid the tab, including the
 outrageous registration fee that provided virtually nothing but small
 meeting rooms that actually were provided free by the hotel.

 I met someone at the above conference who admitted that he gave the same
 paper repeatedly at conferences such as the one mentioned above. The
 paper had resoundingly been rejected for publication, and he was neither
 actively updating the paper or revising it for submission. When a
 conference was announced for a nice vacation spot, he merely dusted it off,
 changed its title, and tried to get on the program. 

I don&apos;t see any way to prevent this fraud other than to appeal to faculty
that it is a matter of ethics. Please don&apos;t support conferences that are a
sham to line the pockets of entrepreneurial types who organize conferences for
the sole purpose of raking in the registration fees. Don&apos;t attend
conferences where the true spirit is not one of disseminating new knowledge.

 I saw the enemy and its us.

 Part of the increase in Conferences is related to the

with the quality of the experience. 
 
 New $20,000 Fellowships for Doctoral Students in Business 

 Canada is only producing about half of the
PhD-qualified business professors it needs, he said. And only half of those
professors stay in Canada to teach. 

&quot;Concordia gets cash for business school National bank putting up $1
million. Trying to pave the way for more students to pursue their studies to the
PhD level,&quot;by Nicolas Van Praet, The Gazette , February 9, 2004 --- http://snipurl.com/FinancePHD  
 
 Concordia University&apos;s John Molson School of Business
 is trying to counter what it says is a lack of university finance professors
 by putting in place a new fellowship program to train PhD candidates. 

 The school will announce today that the National Bank
 is donating $1 million toward the program. The money will support the work of
 doctoral candidates in the field of finance over the next 10 years. 

 &quot;There&apos;s a dearth that already exists for
 business professors in general,&quot;said Jerry Tomberlin, dean of the John
 Molson School. 

 Canada is only producing about half of the
 PhD-qualified business professors it needs, he said. And only half of those
 professors stay in Canada to teach. 

 &quot;Some of them go to the private sector, many of
 them go to academia in the U.S.&quot; 

 A professor can make more in the U.S. than he or she
 can in Canada. And private-sector work is often even more lucrative. 

 The U.S. and other countries also lack business
 professors, particularly finance professors, Tomberlin said. In part, that&apos;s
 because finance and accounting have become very popular subjects attracting
 growing numbers of students. 

 The John Molson School is trying to pave the way for
 more students to pursue their studies to the PhD level and then choose
 teaching by subsidizing their schooling, Tomberlin said. 

 He said if the university can&apos;t hire qualified
 faculty, it will be forced to cut down on the number of graduates it produces.
 In turn, that means fewer potential recruits for banks and other financial
 institutions. 

 Tony Meti, senior vice-president of commercial
 banking (International) at the National Bank, said the bank wants to help
 finance the development and retention of qualified finance professionals.&quot;We wanted to do our part to make sure that people get the right training
 and right opportunities here in Quebec and stay in Quebec.&quot; 

 The program will target a total of 50 students over
 the next decade, or five students per year. Each fellowship will be worth
 $20,000. 
 
&quot;There&apos;s science behind the sixth sense!&quot; The Times of India ,
February 5, 2004
 
 The next time you experience an unexplained eerie
 feeling at an awkward moment, you may be going through a phenomenon identified
 by researchers as&quot;Mindsight&quot;. 

 Mindsight is a newly discovered mode of conscious
 visual perception. 

 &quot;Our visual system can produce a strong gut
 feeling that something has changed, even if we cannot visualise that change in
 our minds and can&apos;t say what was altered or where the alteration
 occurred,&quot;claims Ronald Rensink, a researcher with the University of
 British Columbia in Canada 

 In the study that involved the participation of 40
 people, a series of photographic images flickered on a computer screen. Each
 of the participants was shown the image for about 15 seconds that was followed
 by a brief blank grey screen. At times, the image was kept on for the whole
 trial or it was alternated with a slightly different one. 

 In trials where the image was changed, around a third
 of the people said the image had changed before they could identify what the
 change was. In control trials, however, the same people were confident that no
 change had occurred. Therefore, Rensick surmised that the response to a change
 in image and control trials was reliably different. 

 &quot;I think this effect explains a lot of the
 belief in a sixth sense,&quot;he said, adding that he believed that it was
 possible to confirm that physical processes generate mindsight using brain
 scanners. 

 Corroborating Rensink&apos;s study yet offering a
 different point of view was Dan Simons, a vision researcher at the University
 of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. 

 He said that Rensink&apos;s finding&quot;suggests the
 existence of an interesting and previously unknown attentional
 mechanism.&quot; 

 He, however, cautioned that people could sometimes
 believe they have perceived something when they clearly have not, pointing out
 that Rensink&apos;s volunteers sometimes reported seeing a change in the image when
 in fact it remained consistent.

February 6, 2004 message from David R. Fordham [fordhadr@JMU.EDU ] 
 
 In my personal opinion, the teaching of&quot;well-evidenced conjecture&quot;as&quot;fact&quot;is one of the major
 obstacles to the progress of mankind. 

 Including accounting. 

 According to Discover magazine, the biggest
 unanswered question in science is&quot;what is gravity?&quot;. However, the
 science community is teaching many conjectures as fact, and thus the young
 scientists don&apos;t waste their time attempting to verify what they feel is
 already a fact. The classic illustration is the acceptance of such conjectures
 as the&quot;big bang&quot;, the existence of quarks, leptons, muons, let
 alone neutrinos, the&quot;fact&quot;that the universe is expanding, and that
 nothing can surpass the speed of light. 

 Around 1929, Edwin Hubble published a paper (being a
 professor, that was expected of him) in which he proposed an expanding
 universe, to explain some very anomalous spectrographic observations. My
 father, who was an astronomy student at Berkeley in the late 1940&apos;s, listened
 to several lectures by Hubble, who at that time was already quite famous for
 his&quot;expanding university&quot;theory. Hubble himself admitted that he
 didn&apos;t believe in an expanding universe, that it required too simple an
 explanation (a big bang, as it was later called by others) which itself had no
 plausible reason for occurring, and worse, there was no realistic way of
 testing the theory of origin. Hubble felt that effort should be exerted to
 come up with an alternative explanation of the observed spectrographic result
 (such as a violation of Einstein&apos;s constant re: the speed of light, which
 Einstein himself had admitted required the insertion of a&quot;dummy
 variable&quot;in order to match observed results. That dummy variable to this
 day remains unexplained and untested!) 

 Yet, in spite of the tenuous assumptions required by
 both Einstein&apos;s and Hubble&apos;s conjectures (really, they were just mathematical
 calisthenics), and in spite of the uncertainty and doubt possessed by the very
 creators of those conjectures, today&apos;s science community is teaching those
 conjectures as though they were proven facts. Except perhaps for a few
 graduate-level researchers, the public is being told that there WAS a big
 bang, the speed of light IS an unbreakable limit, and a whole host of other&quot;facts&quot;which aren&apos;t really facts. Thus, we are depriving the next
 generation of scientists with the curiosity to seek new explanations. 

 And what&apos;s worse, there is a whole host of&quot;downstream&quot;effort being wasted trying to come up with additional
 theories, all of which require that the original&quot;conjecture&quot;be
 fact before the downstream theory has any merit. 

 Most of the real breakthroughs in mankind&apos;s
 advancements (--fits and starts, like the Stephen Jay Gould adaptation of
 Darwin&apos;s evolution conjecture) have come suddenly, by someone who didn&apos;t buy
 into a&quot;fact&quot;that was really conjecture. From Copernicus through
 Galileo, Kepler, Newton, etc., the advancers of mankind have been those who
 actually&quot;rejected&quot;, -- if but for a moment --, what others were
 teaching as&quot;fact&quot;. 

 It is my opinion that a breakthrough in understanding
 (and perhaps even one day controlling and using) gravity will come from
 someone who doesn&apos;t buy into the big bang, or the speed of light limit, or
 perhaps the idea that matter and energy are interchangeable, or that atoms are
 made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons, or perhaps some other&quot;fact&quot;being taught in our elementary schools, high schools, or even
 college courses. 

 And how does this relate to accounting education?
 Unlike the natural world, accounting is a man-made construct, but it still
 depends on some major assumptions about the environment in which accounting
 operates. Paton and Littleton and others assumed an environment driven by
 classical economics in a free-enterprise society, a society which may have
 held very different values, different motivations, different goals, different
 perspectives, than the one in which today&apos;s business leaders operate. There
 are differences in legal, cultural, social, political, and structural
 parameters (communications, transportation, global and environmental issues,
 etc.). While these may be peripheral to accounting in the direct sense, and
 while some may point out that business is still in business to make profit, I
 can&apos;t help but wonder how much of today&apos;s&quot;accounting truth&apos;s&quot;(such
 as profit, costs, assets, liabilities, etc.) which are causing dilemmas,
 issues, and problems, are holding us back from discovering a new way of doing
 things that might allow us to better&quot;control&quot;the greed and zeal of
 today&apos;s corporate criminals, -- if that is what the SEC and public expect of
 accountants, as appears to be the case. 

 If rejecting the idea of a geo-centric universe led
 to a breakthrough in discovering orbital mechanics, might not rejecting the
 idea of&quot;cost&quot;and&quot;revenue&quot;and&quot;equity&quot;and&quot;liability&quot;as&quot;natural objects for measurement&quot;result in
 a breakthrough in accounting thought? 

 And put aside the pie-in-the-sky revolution for a
 moment (I don&apos;t pretend to be the next Kepler or Tycho Brahe). Might it be
 possible for a smaller, less-significant improvement to occur by rejecting or
 challenging a smaller, less-significant&quot;fact&quot;. For example, let&apos;s
 say we expand the definition of&quot;fraud&quot;to include accounting tricks
 which maximize profit. Let&apos;s say that even if you *legally* make an accounting
 change to maximize your profit, you have engaged in fraud since doing so
 creates&quot;profit&quot;where none existed before and you did not actually
 do any business activity to generate that profit. I.e, reject the&quot;truth&quot;that you can&apos;t engage in fraud by doing something perfectly
 legal. Would this possibly result in improvement somewhere? 

 I didn&apos;t illustrate my point very well at all here.
 But I hope to start some people thinking about accepting conjectures as fact,
 within a wider scope or perspective. 

 And yes, I do occasionally enjoy reading Tony
 Tinker&apos;s, Paul Williams&apos;, and other&apos;s proposals in this arena. In fact, I&apos;ll
 even admit to having an article appear in (shudder) Critical Perspectives with
 my name on it! How&apos;s that for rejecting&quot;truth&quot;!?

 January 28, 2004 reply from Roger Collins on the issue of
whether the top academic researchers and journal editors favor elegance over
relevance to the profession. 
 
 I think that&quot;Some Thoughts on the Intellectual
 Foundations of Accounting&quot;(Demski, Fellingham, Ijiri aqnd Sunder - A ccounting
 Horizons , June 2002) is a fair statement of the&quot;high academic&quot;view of the accounting landscape.Why? 

 For one possible answer, try John Maynard Keynes. In
 his&quot;Essays in Biography&quot;(Macmillan; London, 1933) he comments... 

 Professor Planck, of Berlin, the most famous
 originator of the quantum theory, once remarked to me that in early life he
 had thought of studying economics, but had found it too difficult! Professor
 Planck could easily master the whole corpus of mathematical knowledge in a few
 days. He did not mean that! But the amalgam of logic and intuition and the
 wide knowledge of facts, most of which are not precise, which is required for
 economic interpretation in its highest form is, quite truly, overwhelmingly
 difficult for those whose gifts mainly consist in the power to imagine and
 pursue to their furthest points the implications and prior conditions of
 comparitively simple facts which are known to a high degree of precision. 

 I suspect that there are quite a few researchers in
 the accounting domain pursuing the objective of&quot;accounting as
 physics&quot;.... 

 I also suspect that we have reached a point in a
 number of areas of accounting research where the pursuit of an elegant (but
 probably immaterial) theory trumps the messy practical reality, because the
 rewards within the academic system favour elegance rather than practicality.
 That&apos;s not to say that we don&apos;t have some excellent practical accountants
 (Denny Beresford for example) who can bridge the divide and operate within
 both academia and in business - but it does explain why the issues that
 confront accountants on a day-to-day basis don&apos;t make it into the academics&apos;&quot;Ten most read&quot;(or at least,&quot;Ten most that we claim to
 read&quot;) journals. This has been going on for decades - I remember
 that an experiential article by Cyril Tomkins in the early &apos;80&apos;s generated a
 lot of heat when it was published in AOS because, the comments went,&quot;this is not the sort of thing worthy of study&quot;. Of
 course, the problem is, while the high priests study high theory, the real
 world burns.

 instructive - substitute the words&quot;business&quot;or&quot;accounting&quot;for&quot;politician&quot;and the arguments made are
 equally applicable.

 I would contrast the thoughts of Max Planck with
 those of Bertrand Russell who thought economics too simple, or Richard Feynman
 who thought economics hardly to be science at all. 

 The German philosopher Droysen observed that there
 are three scientific methods: speculative (as in Philosophy and Theology),
 mathematical/physical, and historical. He went on to say that their essences
 are to know, explain, and understand. Most of the establishment accounting
 researchers over the past three decades or so seem to have swallowed the whole
 bit of&quot;unified science&quot;or scientismic worldview of Comte, Mill,
 Hempel, Nagel,... We need to contrast this with what German philosophers are
 fond of calling&quot;verstehende social sciences&quot;in the tradition of
 Dilthey, Gadamer, and Charles Taylor. In accounting, this view has
 unfortunately been regarded the fringe. 

 In accounting we seem to have gone too far in
 theologising scientific methods. Even in the natural sciences people tend to
 be more reasonable. A few years ago (actualy about a dozen years) while
 visiting a theoretical physicist colleague at his office I was shocked to find
 him pouring over a stack of computer printouts with a coworker. I asked him
 what he, a theoretical physicist, was doing with empirical data. His
 explanation reminded me of a methodologically oriented doctoral course I had
 taken as a student back in Calcutta, where Kuhn&apos;s book was one of the texts.
 He said that he was looking for any anomalies in his theories that the data
 might have revealed. 

 In accounting there seem to be two kinds of us: those
 who are fascinated by facts and those who are fascinated by theories. Unless
 the two reconcile in a way such that those who are fascinated by facts reveal
 anomalies in the theories, and those fascinated by theories pay heed to them,
 we will continue to be a schizophrenic discipline. However, I have a great
 respect for the words of Arthur Eddington, who said, never trust data unless
 it is confirmed by theory. Tons of t statistics do not a theory make. Neither
 does a ton of algebra, despite JBS Haldane&apos;s statement that in science an
 ounce of algebra is worth more than a ton of verbal argument.

 From Joel S. Demski et al,&quot;Some
Thoughts on the Intellectual Foundations of Accounting,&quot; Accounting
Horizons , June 2002, pp. 162-163. It is confusing that the passage is
written in first person when there are four authors. I suspect that the
passage was written by Professor Demski. 
 
 The information
 school, though, lacks this clarity. To understand what to convey about
 this transaction requires we know the&quot;finer details&quot;that gave rise
 to the transaction in the first place. The beginning point is not the
 transaction, but the circumstances that led the firm to engage in the
 transaction. Thus, the very things we measure are exogenous in the value
 school, but endogenous in the information school. For example, with
 hedge accounting, the value school asks what is and how to measure the fair
 value to the entity; while the information school asks first why the entity
 engages in hedging activities and, second, how public or private information
 about such activities affects market or nonmarket interactions. This is
 far removed from the way we teach accounting. For that matter, simply
 having the infrastructure of uncertainty and information at center stage is
 far removed from the way we teach accounting. 

 In terms of
 fundamentals, then, it seems to me the issues are what are we trying to
 measure and how are we to manage that measurement activity? My fear is
 we are in the information business, intellectually and professionally, but
 have become addicted to thinking, teaching, learning, examining, regulating,
 and communicating as if we were in the valuation business. This,
 unfortunately, is an isomorphism that does not exist, and pretending otherwise
 is a roadblock to our progress.

February 2, 2004 reply from Jagdish Gangolly [JGangolly@UAMAIL.ALBANY.EDU ] 
 
 Bob, 

 Was fascinated enough with the list of technologies
 to do some background research to find out if we could find some bridges to
 accounting. Over the past thiry odd years, accounting (at least establishment
 accounting) has become, in my humble opinion, far too narcissistic for our own
 good; opening our eyes to areas seemingly entirely unrelated to our perceived
 vision of what accounting researchers ought to be doing (besides churning
 regressions) is perhaps a good idea. 

 I went through the details in the Technology Review,
 asking the question how we might be able to leverage those developments for
 the advancement of our own field. I could visualise at least four areas where
 we can find metaphors, establishment willing (after all we need acceptance in
 establishment journals to survive the tenure/ promotion hassles, let alone the
 need for our own self-aggrandizement). I will briefly state below what I
 think, and hopefully we can get some discussion (and hopefully research)
 going, establishmentarians willing. 

 1. Universal translation: There is a real need for
 research in the area of building multi-lingual lexical resources (and I
 consider English and American accounting two different languages in terms of
 lexical semantics) to make the dream of translation of financial statements a
 reality. I was at a computational linguistics conference in Brno (Czech Rep) a
 week ago, and it was fascinating to see the kind of research being done in the
 European and Asian languages (domain independent). Lexical resources in
 accounting are extremely scarce, unless you include resources of convenience
 developed individually by companies without regard for sound principles of
 lexicography and, in general, linguistics. I have been playing this broken
 record on AECM for years, but found few interested in research in the area.
 This area also relates to at least one other area on the list, bayesian
 machine learning. 

 2. Bayesian machine learning: While we have had a
 stream of papers in auditing relating to bayesian networks and belief
 networks, the aspect of learning has been all but ignored. One of the reasons
 for the lack of interest is probably the fact that the applications have been
 a rather mechanical application of beyesian updating (or aggregation of
 beliefs/evidence) in the context of account balances. True progress in this
 area requires modeling of dynamic business processes as well as their impact
 on account balances. Not much has been written in this area. 

 3. Distributed storage: As organisations grow, the
 accounting systems become too unwieldy when it comes to evaluation of
 controls, substantive testing, and opinion formulation. In the absence of a
 formal over-arching coherent model of controls and audit in such systems,audit
 decisionmaking becomes akin to shooting in the dark. It is as though we
 auditors are just whistling past the graveyard, and occasionally get spooked.
 If we had formal models, we could study distributed storage and processing in
 accounting systems as a way of breaking down the complexity of auditing. I
 have come across no work in this area. 

 4. RNAi therapy: Auditing is basically a forensic
 enterprise. We should, in my opinion, look for rich biological metaphors for
 auditing. Just as pathologists study the pathogens wreaking havoc in our
 bodies in order to discover countermeasures, in auditing we need models to aid
 signatures for fraud so that&quot;errant genes&quot;(insiders) can be&quot;turned off&quot;. I have found no trace of such metaphors in the
 auditing literature. 

 I am sure other accounting researchers will find
 other similar metaphors we can thrive by, in accounting and auditing.

 Portal to Asian Internet Resources --- http://webcat.library.wisc.edu:3200/PAIR/index.html   
 
 A Title VI-funded
 project, the Portal to Asian Internet Resources (PAIR) offers scholars,
 students and the interested public more than six thousand professionally
 selected, cataloged and annotated online resources. 

 Committed to
 directing users to Asian area content in the humanities and social sciences,
 the PAIR Project is supported by an impressive complement of area studies
 scholars, bibliographers and subject selectors based at the libraries of the
 University of Wisconsin, the University of Minnesota and the Ohio State
 University. 

 With a primary
 mission of providing direct access to online Asian information in native
 languages and scripts, the PAIR Project team also hopes to broaden access by
 offering users a suite of instructional resources on the use of Asian
 character sets and search engines. 
 
 The
Dean of Students at Trinity University reveals his own personal 20
year struggle to be alcohol-free on Page 10 of the January 30 edition of the Trinitonian . 
 
 Former
 drinker offers advice, reflects on past experience 
 Last month Peter Holt, the owner of the San
 Antonio Spurs as well as a Trinity trustee went back into an alcohol
 treatment program after 16 years of recovery.
Mr. Holt has been lauded for his openness about his disease and for being an
 important spokesperson and role model for others who fight their own demons
 with alcohol. His story inspires me. So following his lead and given the year
 the campus has been having, I think its my turn to come clean.

 Why Kids
Obsessed With the Popular Online Culture Can Write 
We often act as if schools had a monopoly on teaching, yet smart kids have long
known not to let schooling get in the way of their education. Teachers sometimes
complain that popular culture competes for the attention of their student. But
it is now becoming abundantly clear, writes columnist Henry Jenkins, that for
some kids, at least, participating in popular culture online turns them into
better writers.

From Over 900 College and University Presidents
National Campus Compact---  http://www.compact.org  
 
 Campus Compact is a national coalition of more than
 900 college and university presidents committed to the civic purposes of
 higher education. To support this civic mission, Campus Compact promotes
 community service that develops students&apos; citizenship skills and values,
 encourages partnerships between campuses and communities, and assists faculty
 who seek to integrate public and community engagement into their teaching and
 research. 

 Our presidents believe that by creating a supportive
 campus environment for the engagement in community service, colleges and
 universities can best prepare their students to be active, committed, and
 informed citizens and leaders of their communities. 

 Member campuses bond together as a coalition to
 actively engage presidents, faculty, staff, and students to promote a renewed
 vision for higher education one that supports not only the civic
 development of students, but the campus as an active and engaged member of its
 community. 
 
 Carbon
and Silicon Share a Chip 
Researchers have fabricated a circuit that combines carbon nanotube transistors
and traditional silicon transistors on one computer chip. Such integrated
nanotube-silicon circuits could enable super-sensitive sensors that distinguish
among thousands of chemical or biological agents, as well as memory chips that
store 100 times the information of today&apos;s state-of-the-art devices.

 The
Next Big Thing  

 Question
In 2002, Bob Jensen raised the following questions:
What are the most significant changes expected in higher education by the Year
2025? 
What major universities are now experimenting on the leading edge of such
changes? 

 Answer
The 2002 answers are given under Question 1 at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/updateee.htm#Future   

 Now you can read the
following update article. 

 &quot;The future of computing: The next big thing?&quot; The Economist , January 15, 2004 --- http://www.economist.co.uk/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2352183   
 
 IT is increasingly
 painful to watch Carly Fiorina, the boss of Hewlett-Packard (HP), as she tries
 to explain to yet another conference audience what her new grand vision of adaptive
 information technology is about. It has something to do with Darwinian
 reference architectures, she suggests, and also with modularising and
 integrating, as well as with lots of enabling and processes.
 IBM, HP&apos;s arch rival, is trying even harder, with a marketing splurge for what
 it calls on-demand computing. Microsoft&apos;s Bill Gates talks of seamless
 computing. Other vendors prefer ubiquitous, autonomous or utility
 computing. Forrester Research, a consultancy, likes organic. Gartner, a
 rival, opts for real-time. 

 Clearly, something
 monumental must be going on in the world of computing for these technology
 titans simultaneously to discover something that is so profound and yet so
 hard to name. What is certainly monumental, reckons Pip Coburn, an analyst at
 UBS, is the hype, which concerns, he says, stuff that doesn&apos;t work yet.
 Frank Gens at IDC, another tech consultancy, quips that, in 2004 at least, utility
 computing is actually futility computing. 

 Yet as a long-term
 vision for computing, what the likes of IBM, Microsoft and HP (and Oracle,
 Sun, etc) are peddling is plausible. The question is, how long will it take?
 Some day, firms will indeed stop maintaining huge, complex and expensive
 computer systems that often sit idle and cannot communicate with the computers
 of suppliers and customers. Instead, they will outsource their computing to
 specialists (IBM, HP, etc) and pay for it as they use it, just as they now pay
 for their electricity, gas and water. As with such traditional utilities, the
 complexity of the supply-systems will be entirely hidden from users. 

 ER meets the Matrix
 The potential for a computing infrastructure such as this to boost efficiencyand
 even to save livesis impressive. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, an in-house guru
 at IBM, pictures an ambulance delivering an unconscious patient to a random
 hospital. The doctors go online and get the patient&apos;s data (medical history,
 drug allergies, etc), which happens to be stored on the computer of a clinic
 on the other side of the world. They upload their scans of the patient on to
 the network and crunch the data with the processing power of thousands of
 remote computersnot just the little machine which is all that the hospital
 itself can nowadays afford. 

 For its nuts and
 bolts, this vision relies on two unglamorous technologies. The first is web
 servicessoftware that resides in a big shared server computer and
 can be found and used by applications on other servers, even ones far away and
 belonging to different organisations. Mr Wladawsky-Berger&apos;s hospital would be
 getting the patient&apos;s info from his home clinic through such a web service. 

 The second technology
 is grid computing. This involves the sharing of processing power. The
 best-known example is a search for extra-terrestrial intelligence
 project called SETI@home, overseen by the University of California at
 Berkeley. Nearly 5m people in 226 countries have downloaded a screensaver that
 makes their computer available, whenever it is sitting idle, to process radio
 signals gathered from outer space. The aim is to find a pattern that may be
 from aliens. Mr Wladawsky-Berger&apos;s hospital would similarly crunch
 patient-data using the internet, or grid, as if it were a single, giant
 virtual microprocessor, but for a more earth-bound purpose. 

 Both technologies
 have made great strides recently. Web services, for instance, need common
 standards and protocols. Some basic standards already existawkward acronyms
 such as XML, SOAP and WSDL provide a rudimentary grammar to let computers talk
 to each other. But the sticking point, says Phillip Merrick, boss of
 webMethods, one of the pioneers in the field, has been the many other fiddly
 but necessary protocols for security, transaction certification, and so on. A
 breakthrough occurred in October, when the two superpowers, IBM and Microsoft,
 simply got up on a stage together and declared what protocols they will use.
 Dubbed WS splat by the geeks, this ought to speed up the adoption of web
 services. 

 Web services are
 currently most visible in the business model of so-called application service
 providers. These are firms that offer to host software applications and
 databases for customers for a monthly feean analogy would be for firms to
 do their e-mailing via Yahoo! or their buying via eBay. The most successful is
 Salesforce.com, a San Francisco firm that, as the name says, specialises in
 software for managing customer information and marketing leads. It says that
 it was poaching so much business from a more traditional seller of
 customer-relations software, Siebel Systems, that Siebel had to adopt the
 model itself. In October, Siebel teamed up with IBM and now also offers its
 software as a service over the internet. 

 Nonetheless, this
 particular form of web services is overhyped, says Rahul Sood of Tech Strategy
 Partners, a consultancy in Silicon Valley. Such services appeal mostly to
 small businesses and firms that do not need to customise their applications
 very much. For the grander visionthe on-demand, adaptive, seamless,
 ubiquitous, organic sorta lot more needs to happen. 

 At the core of the
 vision is flexibilitya firm must be able to make its operating costs, and
 therefore its computing and information costs, totally variable so that they
 go up and down with business volumes. Firms can improve cost flexibility
 today, says Mr Sood, but only if they stick with one vendor, such as IBM, or
 if they make only one of their many computing functions (data storage, say)
 flexible. But for computing to be bought and sold as a utility, firms must be
 able to switch vendors, to do it for all their computing functions, and with
 meter-based pricing. All of this will take a few more years to get right.

 Restoring Fiscal Sanity: How to Balance
the Budget ---  http://www.brookings.edu/es/research/projects/budget/fiscalsanity/full.pdf   
 
&quot;The Trend of Vanishing Tech Jobs,&quot;by Virginia Postrel, The New
York Times , January 29, 2004 ---  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/29/business/29scene.html  
 
 Many American computer programmers complain that
 they&apos;re losing their jobs to lower-paid workers in India. The trend toward
 foreign&quot;outsourcing&quot;has become a political flashpoint. 

 But the trend is less frightening and more promising
 than you&apos;d think from either the angry talk from unemployed programmers or the
 scary estimates from consulting firms, argues Catherine L. Mann, an economist
 at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. 

 First, the end of the technology boom, the general
 economic slump, and the downturn in manufacturing - not foreign programming
 competition - account for most job losses. Most estimates, Dr. Mann notes,
 compare the peak of the business cycle and technology boom with today&apos;s
 sluggish economy. That&apos;s not a valid comparison. 

 Compared with the end of 1999, which was still a good
 time for programmers, December 2003 data show a 14 percent increase in
 business and financial occupations, a 6 percent increase in computer and
 mathematical jobs, and a 2 percent drop in architecture and engineering jobs.
 New programming jobs may be springing up in India, but they aren&apos;t canceling
 out job growth in the United States. 

 The problem for white-collar professionals, as for
 line workers, is that manufacturing is still in a slump.&quot;When the
 production floor doesn&apos;t produce any more, the people in the window offices
 around the building also start to lose their jobs,&quot;Dr. Mann says. 

 Over the long run, she argues, the globalization of
 software and computer services will enhance American productivity growth and
 create new higher-value, higher-paid technical jobs. 

 What&apos;s happening now to software and services has
 already happened to hardware, with great economic results. 

 In the late 1980&apos;s, Asian manufacturers began turning
 out basic memory chips, undercutting American chip makers&apos; prices and inciting
 a fierce policy debate. Many industry leaders argued that the United States
 would lose its technological edge unless the government intervened to protect
 chip makers. 

 In a famous 1988 Harvard Business Review article,
 Charles Ferguson, then a postdoctoral associate at the Center for Technology
 Policy and Industrial Development at M.I.T., summed up the conventional
 wisdom:&quot;Most experts believe that without deep changes in both industry
 behavior and government policy, U.S. microelectronics will be reduced to
 permanent, decisive inferiority within 10 years.&quot; 

 He denounced the&quot;fragmented, chronically
 entrepreneurial industry&quot;of Silicon Valley, which was losing market
 share to government-aided Asian businesses.&quot;Only economists moved by the
 invisible hand,&quot;he wrote,&quot;have failed to apprehend the
 problem.&quot; 

 Those optimistic economists were right. The dire
 predictions were wrong. American semiconductor makers shifted to higher-value
 microprocessors. Computer companies bought commodity memory chips and other
 components, from keyboards to disk drives, abroad. Businesses and consumers
 enjoyed cheaper and cheaper prices. 

 Far from an economic disaster, the result was a
 productivity boom. As global manufacturing helped to reduce the price of
 information technology sharply, all sorts of businesses, from banks to
 retailers, found new, more productive ways to use the technology. 

 &quot;Globalized production and international trade
 made I.T. hardware some 10 to 30 percent less expensive than it otherwise
 would have been,&quot;Dr. Mann estimates in an institute policy brief. (Her
 paper,&quot;Globalization of I.T. Services and White-Collar Jobs: The Next
 Wave of Productivity Growth,&quot;can be downloaded at iie.com.) 

 As a result, she estimates, gross domestic product
 grew about 0.3 percentage point a year faster than it would have otherwise,
 adding up to $230 billion over the seven years from 1995 to 2002.&quot;That&apos;s
 real money,&quot;she said in an interview.

 Dumbest Moments in Business History 

Business 2.0 Magazine &apos;101 Dumbest Moments in Business&apos; of 2003 --- http://www.theautochannel.com/F/news/2004/01/28/178321.html  
 
 The latest issue of Business 2.0 ( www.business2.com ), on newsstands Feb. 2, features the magazine&apos;s fourth annual list of the&quot;101 Dumbest Moments in Business,&quot;highlighting the most comical
 corporate blunders and biggest business mistakes of 2003. 

 This edition includes the first-ever tie for the top
 spot--a tale of&quot;Two Greedy Richards,&quot;as the magazine puts
 it--between the firestorm surrounding New York Stock Exchange CEO Dick
 Grasso&apos;s exorbitant salary and pension and Strong Financial founder and
 chairman Dick Strong&apos;s unethical&quot;market-timing&quot;trades to line his
 own pockets. Both executives subsequently resigned. 

 The Business 2.0 list also reveals some lesser-known
 but just as appalling lapses in corporate judgment. Making the list are
 technology firms, media organizations, airlines, retail businesses, automobile manufacturers, e-businesses, fast-food chains, and many others. 

 The following are the top 10&quot;dumbest
 moments&quot;of 2003 according to this year&apos;s&quot;101 Dumbest Moments in
 Business&quot;: 

 1. The New York Stock Exchange board decides to pay
 CEO Dick Grasso his $139.5 million pension up front. When public outrage
 ensues, Grasso agrees not to take another $48 million he has coming to him and
 then promptly resigns, claiming he was fired--which entitles him to another
 $58 million. 

 1. (TIE) Investigations into the mutual-fund industry
 reveal that Dick Strong, the founder and chairman of Strong Financial, made
 $600,000 through market-timing trades contrary to his own company&apos;s rules. He
 is immediately forced to resign. 

 3. Urban Outfitters sells a Monopoly knockoff called
 Ghettopoly, in which the classic game pieces such as the top hat, shoe, and
 car are replaced with machine guns, marijuana leaves, and rocks of crack
 cocaine. In reaction to protests, the retailer discontinues the game. 

 4. A Dairy Queen franchisee is successfully sued by a
 female customer after an employee allegedly slides into her booth, pulls down
 her sweater, bites her on the breast, and declares,&quot;I am like
 Dracula.&quot; 

 5. The CEO of Clear Channel Radio tries to&quot;backpedal&quot;after disc jockeys at three of the company&apos;s radio
 stations urge listeners to violently attack bicyclists. 

 6. Nielsen/NetRatings issues a report mistakenly
 describing an online game site called Blunt Truth as&quot;an educational
 resource for marijuana.&quot; 

 7. Evite sends out apologies to its users for having
 cited Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, as a&quot;reason to
 party.&quot; 

 8. General Motors is forced to come up with a new
 name for its Buick LaCrosse sedan in Canada when executives
 discover that crosse is a slang term for masturbation in Quebec. 

 9. Ikea pulls a new children&apos;s bunk bed called Gutvik
 from its catalogs in Germany after customers point out that the word sounds
 like a German phrase meaning&quot;good f**k.&quot; 

 10. Chrysler announces its sponsorship of the
 Lingerie Bowl, a pay-per-view televised football game to be played by scantily
 clad female models during halftime of the Super Bowl. After coming under fire
 for the event&apos;s sexist nature, the company first reportedly pressures the
 event&apos;s producers to change the uniforms to sports bras and volleyball shorts,
 and then drops its sponsorship altogether.

 XBRL (eXtensible
 Business Reporting Language), an electronic&quot;tagging&quot;format,
 helps consumers of business information efficiently and accurately analyze
 information coming from different sources. It simplifies the transfer of
 financial statements, performance reports, accounting records, and other
 financial information between different software programs. XBRL reduces the
 time and costs of producing, communicating and accessing business
 information. 

 Kevin J. Dancey,
 PwC CEO and Canadian Senior Partner said:&quot;Greater transparency in
 business reporting will lead to increased trust in the world&apos;s capital
 markets. Simply, XBRL is about making data more useful and connecting
 businesses with their stakeholders. As an information format standard, XBRL
 gives companies a reliable, consistent tool for improved business
 reporting.&quot; 

 &quot;TSX Group is
 pleased that we are able to work with PwC to become the first in Canada to
 provide our financial results in XBRL format,&quot;said Michael Ptasznik,
 TSX Group Chief Financial Officer.&quot;Acceptance for XBRL is building and
 TSX Group will continue to be a leading adopter of this technology.&quot; 

 &quot;We now have a
 working tool that will allow companies to streamline how they prepare and
 disseminate financial data,&quot;said David W. Smith FCA, President and CEO
 of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA).&quot;XBRL will
 also enable the users of financial reports, such as analysts, regulators,
 creditors and investors to more quickly and accurately review, analyze and
 interpret the information.&quot; 

 XBRL is based on
 XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and is independent of any hardware
 platform, software operating system, programming language or accounting
 standard. The standard is being supported by more than 200 organizations
 worldwide including major accounting firms, software vendors, regulators and
 corporations.

 &quot;Commentary: A Gut Course In Post-Grad Scheming Lessons B-schoolers can
learn from The Apprentice,&quot; Business Week , January 28, 2004 --- http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/mbajournal/index.htm?c=bwmbajan28&amp;n=link2&amp;t=email   
 
 Back in the 1990s, B-school grads roamed the globe
 like Masters of the Universe. Armed with power-point presentations and
 gold-plated diplomas, there was no problem they seemingly couldn&apos;t solve. Now,
 fast forward to the latest iteration of reality-TV. In The Apprentice, a
 shlocky new reality series on NBC, young business women are pitted against
 young business men in a cut-throat competition for success. Think Survivor,
 only in Armani suits. And this time, the last person left standing wins --
 gasp -- a six-figure salary and a year working for real estate developer
 Donald Trump. 

 In this version of reality, the women more or less
 look like sex goddesses and the men are, for the most part, buff as can be.
 Now, that&apos;s realistic. Still, in a crude sort of way, The Apprentice offers a
 look at life in the often cold hallways of Corporate America. Just listen to
 some of what viewers are saying on message boards devoted to the show. Says
 one:&quot;It hits close to home.&quot;Adds another:&quot;This is a reality
 we all can understand.&quot;...

 Stuck in a snowstorm and only reachable
 by BlackBerry? Don&apos;t count on it. 

 This winter some users of the popular
 wireless e-mail device have found the gizmo suddenly shuts off in cold
 weather, causing delayed e-mails and requiring a cumbersome restart.
 BlackBerry&apos;s maker, which pushes the reliability of the&quot;always on&quot;device, says the problem is apparently caused by static problems created by
 dry winter weather. 

 The problem affects BlackBerry models
 857 and 957. While those are popular BlackBerry models, they aren&apos;t the
 company&apos;s latest gadgets, with color screens and phones. 

 The maker of the BlackBerry devices,
 Canada&apos;s Research

 &quot;Investors
 Take Defensive Positions,&quot;by Kpin Tan, The Wall Street Journal ,
 February 5, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107593625111321027,00.html?mod=mkts%5Fmain%5Fnews%5Fhs%5Fh   
 
 Option
 trading stayed defensive ahead of Friday&apos;s release of January payrolls data,
 with some investors bracing for stocks to start trading in a range. 

 Cautious
 investors bought index puts to protect their portfolios from a further
 correction, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, or VIX,
 edged up 0.53 to 17.87. It was this fear gauge&apos;s ninth increase in 12 days,
 and mirrored investors&apos; increasing caution as stocks&apos; surge slowed. 

 With
 many companies having reported earnings, some traders see fewer catalysts
 that can drive stocks higher in the short term. But most companies had
 reported improved profits, and many traders don&apos;t expect the market
 correction to be too severe. 

 So
 option investors sought to take advantage of the recent rise in volatility
 and option premiums by selling put spreads when the market pulls back, and
 selling call spreads when it rallies. These option sellers expect stocks to
 be range-bound over the next month or two, and are looking to earn option
 premiums to boost their returns. 

 Jay
 Shartsis, director of option trading at R.F. Lafferty&amp;Co., thinks the
 market still appears too optimistic. For instance, option investors are
 spending 25 cents on stock puts for every dollar spent on calls, he
 estimated. While this has increased from a record low late last month --
 when investors spent just 10 cents on puts for every dollar on calls -- it
 still indicates the market&apos;s strong bullish bent, Mr. Shartsis said. 

 Calls
 on pharmaceutical stocks traded actively as these stocks rose, perhaps as
 some investors anticipate a rotation of capital into more defensive sectors. 

 Johnson&amp;Johnson closed up 64 cents to $54.48. Its March 55 calls traded
 4,547 contracts, compared with 10,460 contracts outstanding, and gained 35
 cents to $1.05 at the International Securities Exchange.

 January
29, 2004 message form Charles Bailey [CBailey2@memphis.edu ]  
 
 Dear Bob:  

 Have you witnessed
 an example of exemplary ethical behavior by Accounting researchers in the
 face of temptation? Have you, at some point in your career, resisted a
 temptation to take inappropriate shortcuts (or worse) in a research project?
 If so, I am soliciting your story. If not, I&apos;d still value your thoughts.
 Please read on. 

 As one of the most
 prolific researchers publishing in the accounting literature, you received a
 survey questionnaire from me in 1997 or 1998. It asked sensitive questions
 about research misconduct, using the&quot;randomized response&quot;method
 to ensure anonymity. The resulting article, coauthored by J. R. Hasselback
 and J. Karcher, appeared in Abacus 37:1 (2001): 2654. The questions
 concerned only serious fraud, not the more mundane forms of academic
 dishonesty. Based on respondents&apos; self-reporting, we were able to estimate
 that the actual percentage of seriously tainted articles in the top 30
 accounting journals is about 4 percent, while the respondents on average
 believe that about 21 percent of the literature is tainted. 

 One of the policy
 recommendations in the article was that doctoral programs should devote
 explicit attention to questions of research ethics. Many faculty members
 have personal anecdotes that they might bring to bear in doctoral seminar
 discussions. Furthermore, it has occurred to me that a collection of
 inspirational anecdotes from accounting researchers would be a valuable
 teaching aid. Here is one such example that surfaced during the 1997-98
 survey: 

 &quot;On one
 project, we had to survey bank loan officers, and I accepted the help of
 some people in three banks. The data were collected and analyzed, the
 results were &apos;excellent&apos; (i.e., the null hypothesis was rejected at the
 god-given 0.05 level) and the paper was about ready to go. Then, as a final
 check, I went through the completed surveys, from which my research
 assistant had entered the data. I found that the handwritings on the
 responses at one bank were quite similar. Even though they were numeric and
 y/n responses, and in different color pens or pencils, I was suspicious. Was
 my friend&apos;s friend trying to please my friend by filling out these
 questionnaires?! When I dropped the entire data from the questionable bank,
 we no longer had an interesting paper. I was in my third year as Assistant
 Professor, and a practically sure-fire paper was gone. But to this day I
 don&apos;t regret my decision (though I do wonder when I see the unfair/unethical
 behavior of some reviewers!).&quot;[This person went on to become a
 successful publisher, as demonstrated by their inclusion in our sample.] 

 If you have such a
 story to share, I would appreciate receiving it in one of these forms: as a
 response to this e-mail; via conventional mail; or posted to my web site at www.profbailey.com/ethics . The last two methods allow completely anonymous responses. In any event,
 any published material would be anonymous, although I hope to mention
 contributors, with their permission, in the acknowledgement footnote. 

 If you have no
 anecdote to tell, your comments on this idea still would be valued. 

 Thank you for your
 help in this project. The best of success to you in the days to come!
 Sincerely,

 &quot;Google Slaps Booble,&quot;by
Janis Mara, InternetNews , January 30, 2004 --- http://www.internetnews.com/IAR/article.php/3306121   
 
 Search engine giant Google has demanded that newly
 launched adult search site Booble take down its Web site, a Booble spokesman
 said Thursday. 

 Booble officials claim its site is a parody, while
 Google disputes this assertion. 

 Twenty-four hours after Booble launched on Jan. 20,
 the Google Trademark Enforcement Team e-mailed the company asking it to take
 down its site, a Booble spokesman said. 

 Trademark issues seem to be occupying a lot of
 Google&apos;s time these days. The company is also involved in a trademark
 dispute with American Blind and Wallpaper, which filed suit against Google
 in New York Tuesday alleging infringement. 

 The Booble imbroglio has become a cause celebre
 online, with forums such as Slashdot debating the legal issues. 
 The adult search site says Google sent it an e-mail
 that says in part,&quot;This Domain Name is confusingly similar to the
 famous GOOGLE trademark. Your Web site is a pornographic Web site. Your Web
 site improperly duplicates the distinctive and proprietary overall look and
 feel of Google&apos;s Web site....&quot;The message also disputes that
 Booble.com is a parody because it does not create a composition that
 comments on the original. 
 The message concludes by asking Booble to disable
 the site, discontinue use of the domain name, transfer the domain name to
 Google, permanently refrain from any confusing or diluting use of the term&quot;Google,&quot;and&quot;cease and desist from using the Google trade
 dress.&quot; 
 &quot;The Google demand letter as reproduced on the
 Booble site states a plausible argument as to why it is not a permissible
 parody,&quot;said Martin Schwimmer, a Mount Pleasant, N.Y. attorney
 specializing in trademark and domain name law. 
 A parody comments on the entity it is satirizing,
 Schwimmer said, but Booble in general does not do so. The one parody element
 Schwimmer noted is the bar beneath the search box, seemingly a takeoff on
 Google&apos;s&quot;I&apos;m feeling lucky&quot;bar. The Booble version has various
 messages including&quot;I&apos;m feeling confused.&quot; 
 &quot;This is a competitor. It&apos;s another search
 engine. It takes Google&apos;s logo and uses their layout, their white screen and
 colored letters, for the business of being a search engine,&quot;Schwimmer
 noted. 
 Booble does not use paid search as a revenue model,
 according to its founder,&quot;Bob,&quot;a New York-based former Internet
 executive who refused to be identified further. 
 &quot;That&apos;s fake,&quot;he said, referring to
 Booble listings that mimic the paid sponsorships on Google.&quot;We get
 affiliate revenue from the adult sites we list,&quot;and that is the site&apos;s
 revenue model. Booble has a database of 6,000 adult-oriented sites. 
 &quot;Do you really think anyone would confuse the
 two sites?&quot;&quot;Bob&quot;countered in response to Schwimmer&apos;s
 comments, pointing out that Booble&apos;s top level page has a warning to those
 under 18 to leave immediately. Google has no such warning.&quot;If I
 thought it was confusing, I would change it.&quot;

&quot;The Pornography Industry vs. Digital Pirates.&quot;by John Schwartz, The New York Times , February 4, 2004 ---  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/business/yourmoney/08porn.html  
 
 THOUSANDS of Web sites are putting Playboy
 magazine&apos;s pictures on the Internet - free. And Randy Nicolau, the president
 of Playboy.com, is loving it.&quot;It&apos;s direct marketing at its
 finest,&quot;he said. 

 Let the music industry sue those who share files,
 and let Hollywood push for tough laws and regulations to curb movie copying.
 Playboy, like many companies that provide access to virtual flesh and
 naughtiness, is turning online freeloaders into subscribers by giving away
 pictures to other sites that, in turn, drive visitors right back to
 Playboy.com. 

 When Mr. Nicolau is asked whether he thinks that
 the entertainment industry is making a mistake by taking a different
 approach, he replies:&quot;I haven&apos;t spent much time thinking about it.
 It&apos;s like asking Henry Ford, &apos;What were the buggy-whip guys doing wrong?&apos; &apos;&apos; 

 The copyright rumble is playing out a little
 differently in the red-light districts of cyberspace. That neighborhood is
 increasingly difficult to confine, what with a fetishwear-clad Janet Jackson
 flashing a Super Bowl audience of millions, and Paris Hilton making her own
 version of a&quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot;video. Professional peddlers say
 they are hard pressed to compete. 

 Still, the business of being bad is very good,
 especially for the biggest players. Though the industry has felt a financial
 squeeze during the economic slowdown, it nonetheless has sales of as much as
 $2 billion each year, said Tom Hymes, the editor of AVNOnline, a business
 magazine for the industry. 

 And the pornography industry, which has always been
 among the first to exploit new technologies, including the VCR, the World
 Wide Web and online payment systems, is finding novel ways to deal with the
 threat of online piracy as well. The mainstream entertainment industry, some
 experts say, would do well to pay attention. 

 Music executives say their campaign of lawsuits has
 been successful. They say they have spread the word that downloading free
 music infringes on copyrights and that there could be consequences for
 large-scale file sharers. 

 But the pornography industry has been dealing with
 Internet copyright issues since the 1980&apos;s. By comparison, the movie and
 music businesses are relative newcomers. Mr. Hymes said companies in his
 industry had come to realize that suing consumers and promoting&quot;draconian laws&quot;were not the answer.&quot;No law written can
 stem the tide,&quot;he said. And so, he said, companies are seeking ways to
 live with the technologies that threaten them and are trying to turn them to
 their advantage. 

 That is not to say that the companies have not been
 harmed by free copying and distribution of copyrighted material online. Mr.
 Hymes&apos;s magazine warned recently that such companies were&quot;losing
 incalculable amounts of cash&quot;to peer-to-peer file-sharing networks
 like Kazaa, LimeWire, Grokster and Bit Torrent. 

 &quot;As the networks continue to grow and even
 more sophisticated programs are created, the P2P networks might prove a
 bigger threat to the revenue stream of the porn world than all the
 censorious right-wingers in the country put together,&quot;the article
 stated. 

 Maybe. But many companies that distribute X-rated
 material say they do not worry too much about consumers sharing among
 themselves; they often unleash their lawyers only when someone is trying to
 profit by copying their goods and trying to sell them. 

 When people in the industry talk of copyright,
 there is none of the grand speechifying about revering artists and rewarding
 creativity, and the near-tearful paeans to the yeoman key grips and stunt
 men, as is favored by movie and record executives. Instead, there is just
 this: We spent a lot of money to get this stuff out to the market. Somebody
 else is making money off of it. We want the money. 

 &quot;We haven&apos;t gone after Joe Citizen who&apos;s
 sharing something he printed off something from the Hustler Web site with
 another guy,&quot;said Paul Cambria, a lawyer who represents Hustler, Vivid
 Video and other companies on copyright issues. He does send out some 20
 letters a week, he said, warning for-pay Web sites to remove material owned
 by his clients.

 &quot;Representative
Stearn Calls for GAAP Overhaul,&quot; AccountingWeb , February 3, 2004 --- http://www.accountingweb.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=98662   

 
 In the course of
 holding hearings into the accounting issues at Freddie Mac, Rep. Cliff
 Stearns (R-FL) said there are fundamental flaws in generally accepted
 accounting principles (GAAP) that need to be addressed to prevent future
 abuses. 
 &quot;Specifically,
 GAAP should not allow companies to change the characterization of an asset
 and thereby change its accounting,&quot;said Stearns.&quot;I applaud the
 Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for its efforts to change and
 reform the system over the last two years. Nevertheless, I intend to offer
 legislation in the next few weeks concerning FASB that will reform
 accounting standards.&quot; 
 As part of the
 hearings, Stearns asked Armando Falcon, director of the Office of Federal
 Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which oversees Freddie Mac and the
 larger Frannie Mae, to look into whether compensation of the two agencys
 20 top officials contributed to accounting problems. 
 &quot;Through our
 past hearings we learned that Freddie Mac disregarded accounting rules,
 internal controls, and disclosure standards to maintain a reputation for
 steady earnings,&quot;stated Stearns, chairman of the Commerce, Trade&amp;Consumer Protection Subcommittee.&quot;I appreciate hearing from Freddie
 Mac about the new controls it is instituting to guard against improper
 accounting. Given that Freddie Mac hid billions of dollars in income in a
 way that complied with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), this
 Subcommittee has a responsibility to look at improving these accounting
 standards.&quot; 
 Stearns pointed to
 an anomaly that allows Freddie Mac and some other financial companies to
 engage in earnings arbitrage:&quot;So Called &apos;mixed-attribute accounting&apos;
 allows companies to decide whether financial assets are carried at current
 market price or at historic cost.&quot;Freddie Mac shifted assets between
 categories to manipulate earnings, without any change in the underlying
 economics of its performance. Said Stearns,&quot;Taxpayers do not have the
 option of changing the characterization of assets to change the tax
 treatment; I think GAAP should not allow this either.&quot; 
 Martin Bauman,
 chief financial officer, Freddie Mac, testified,&quot;While the restatement
 represented an important milestone, now that it has been completed, Freddie
 Mac is focused on bringing our financials up-to-date.&quot;In reacting to
 Stearns&apos; concerns over the adequacy of current standards, Bauman stated,&quot;Freddie Mac recognizes the importance of transparent accounting and
 reporting standards and we are committed to providing investors with the
 information they need to understand how we view and manage our business. We
 fully support the Subcommittee&apos;s efforts to move toward a principles-based
 accounting framework.&quot; 
 
February 7, 2004 reply from Patricia A. Doherty [pdoherty@BU.EDU ] 
 
 &quot;...applaud the Federal Accounting Standards
 Board (FASB) ...&quot; 

 Might be nice if Mr. Stearns actually knew the name
 of the agency he is trying to change.

 &quot;Caller ID to Begin Revealing
Identity Of Telemarketers,&quot; The Wall Street Journal , January 28,
2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107533808916314711,00.html?mod=technology%5Fmain%5Fwhats%5Fnews   
 
 Starting Thursday (January 29) ,
 if you have Caller ID you will know when a telemarketer is trying to reach
 you. 

 That is when Federal Trade Commission
 regulations kick in requiring telemarketers to identify themselves. 

 Such calls had shown up on Caller ID as&quot;out of area.&quot;Now the name displayed by Caller ID must either be
 the company trying to make a sale or the firm making the call. The display
 must also include a phone number that consumers can call during regular
 business hours and ask that the company no longer call them. 

 The change is part of the rules that
 set up the do-not-call registry, which consumers can use to block certain
 telemarketers from calling. Telemarketing companies were given additional time
 to install the technology needed to display their names and numbers. Some
 places still don&apos;t have Caller ID technology, and firms in those areas don&apos;t
 have to comply. 

 The do-not-call registry, which took
 effect in October, now contains 56.3 million phone numbers. Because
 telemarketers must update their lists of who doesn&apos;t want to be called every
 three months, consumers who sign up now can expect to see the volume of calls
 decline in April. 

 While the telemarketing industry has
 fought the do-not-call registry, it supported the Caller ID requirement. 

 &quot;We felt it would go a long way
 toward helping improve trust and use of telemarketing among consumers,&quot;said Louis Mastria, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, a trade
 group.&quot;It gives consumers the trump card: If you don&apos;t want to do
 business with this guy, you don&apos;t have to.&quot; 
 
&quot;Study Reveals Financial Performance Higher for Companies with Women at
the Top,&quot; AccountingWeb , January 30, 2004 --- http://www.accountingweb.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=98624  
 A new study released today by Catalyst demonstrates
 that companies with a higher representation of women in senior management
 positions financially outperform companies with proportionally fewer women
 at the top. These findings support the business case for diversity, which
 asserts companies that recruit, retain, and advance women will have a
 competitive advantage in the global marketplace. 
 In the study The Bottom Line: Connecting Corporate
 Performance and Gender Diversity, sponsored by BMO Financial Group, Catalyst
 used two measures to examine financial performance: Return on Equity (ROE)
 and Total Return to Shareholders (TRS). After examining the 353 companies
 that remained on the F500 list for four out of five years between 1996 and
 2000, Catalyst found: 
 
 The group of companies with the highest
 representation of women on their senior management teams had a
 35-percent higher ROE and a 34- percent higher TRS than companies with
 the lowest women&apos;s representation. 
 
 Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, and
 Financial Services companies with the highest representation of women in
 senior management experienced a considerably higher ROE and TRS than
 companies with the lowest representation of women. 

 &quot;Business leaders increasingly request hard
 data to support the link between gender diversity and corporate performance.
 This study gives business leaders unquestionable evidence that a link does
 exist,&quot;said Catalyst President Ilene H. Lang.&quot;We controlled for
 industry and company differences and the conclusion was still the same.
 Top-performing companies have a higher representation of women on their
 leadership teams.&quot; 
 &quot;The Catalyst study confirms my own long-held
 conviction that it makes the best of business sense to have a diverse
 workforce and an equitable, supportive workplace,&quot;said Tony Comper,
 Chairman and CEO of BMO Financial Group, sole sponsor of the research. 
 A Note on Methodology 
 Catalyst divided the 353 companies into four
 roughly equal quartiles based on the representation of women in senior
 management. The top quartile is the 88 companies with the highest gender
 diversity on leadership teams. The bottom quartile is the 89 companies with
 the lowest gender diversity. Catalyst then compared the two groups based on
 overall ROE and TRS. 
 &quot;It is important to realize that our findings
 demonstrate a link between women&apos;s leadership and financial performance, but
 not causation,&quot;said Susan Black, Catalyst Vice President of Canada and
 Research and Information Services.&quot;There are many variables that can
 contribute to outstanding financial performance, but clearly, companies that
 understand the competitive advantage of gender diversity are smart enough to
 leverage that diversity.&quot;

&quot; How Journalists Report Errors on the Web,&quot;by
Cynthia Cotts, The Village Voice , January 28/February 3, 2004 --- http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0404/cotts.php   
 
 In the January
 19 New York Observer , Ron Rosenbaum posed a slew of questions about how
 print and online media should approach the difficult job of correcting errors
 that are discovered post-publication, then beseeched media critics to come up
 with some rough standards. Ron and I are friends, so I&apos;d be remiss to ignore
 the call. 

 Rosenbaum&apos;s proposal
 for increased disclosure goes against traditional newsroom wisdom, which looks
 askance at self-flagellation and the airing of dirty laundry. But let&apos;s face
 it, these are the days of dirty laundry, when even The New York Times has become less uptight about its own infallibility and is striving for a more
 responsive corrections policy. 

 For example, on
 January 18, the Times ran an Editors&apos; Note regarding Ian Buruma&apos;s
 January 11 review of a book by Shashi Tharoor. Because Tharoor had reviewed
 Buruma&apos;s novel in The Washington Post in 1991, the recent review
 violated a policy under which&quot;the Times does not normally assign
 authors to review each other&apos;s books.&quot;Both reviews were barbedthere
 is surely more to this storybut the Times deserves credit for the
 speed with which it&apos;s now admitting its errors. Last Sunday, the Times &apos;
 public editor, Daniel Okrent, even went so far as to correct himself! 

 The more
 corrections, the better? Without lowering evidentiary standards, Rosenbaum
 suggests, journalists can alleviate the shame of error by approaching our work
 more as a search for truth and less as a crusade to prove we&apos;re always right.
 In this view, all assertions are provisional and necessarily subject to
 reshaping as new facts, theories, and agendas emerge. In other words, it&apos;s
 inevitable that mistakes will be made when we&apos;re gathering all the news that&apos;s
 fit to print. Rosenbaum suggests that errors are more easily correctable now
 that most stories, even those published in print editions, also appear
 onlineand more visible, now that bloggers are keeping watch. Ironically,
 increased self-consciousness about the potential for error increases a
 publication&apos;s credibility. 

 To arrive at rough
 standards, I studied websites maintained by Slate , The Washington
 Post , and The New York Times . My suggestions: Every publication
 should have an online corrections page that is easy to findand easy to
 navigate. Each correction should be clearly stated and dated, and should carry
 a link to the online text of the original article. The corrections should be
 arranged by the date of the articles, in reverse chronological order. In
 addition to newly published corrections, the page should carry links to the
 archives. Success means the average reader can find out quickly whether any
 recent story has been amended and how. 

 Slate gets
 the Best Display of Mistakes award. The link to&quot;Corrections&quot;from
 the home page is a little hard to find, as it rises and falls in the table of
 contents. But once you get there, corrections are clearly dated and stated,
 and each one provides a link to the live online text, where erroneous passages
 are asterisked and corrected at the bottom of the page. There&apos;s a link to each
 prior batch of errors, as well as an e-mail address where readers can report
 new ones. ( Salon &apos;s model is also simple and transparent.) 

 Washingtonpost.com
 scores high in every category, including comprehensiveness and
 cross-referencing. In the left column of the home page is a news box in which
 the heading&quot;Corrections&quot;connects to a page of&quot;Recently
 Corrected Articles,&quot;with links in reverse chronological order. Each link
 on that page contains the original headline and date of the corrected article.
 Click on one of those and you find the live online text with errors left
 intact. In the right column of the live page, the word&quot;Correction&quot;appears in red in a box, followed by an explanation. One can also find a link
 to&quot;Corrections From the Post ,&quot;which offers an aerial view
 of links to both corrections and clarifications, those more elaborate
 rethinkings. The design is intuitive and utilitarian. 

 By contrast, the
 corrections page on nytimes.com feels like a Soho boutiquea few boldly
 displayed items with lots of empty space around them. It&apos;s easy to find the
 corrections page from the home page, but once you get there, all you find are
 the fixes published in that day&apos;s paper. The items that appear on the daily
 corrections page are inconsistently styled, sometimes identifying the exact
 date and section in which the article appeared and sometimes referring
 obliquely to an article&quot;yesterday&quot;or&quot;last Sunday.&quot;The
 text of each correction offers no link to the original live text. 

 It took me three or
 four visits to nytimes.com to figure out that they do keep corrections
 pages from previous days on the site; it&apos;s just that the links are not
 presented in one place. Finding yesterday&apos;s fixes takes too long to be of much
 practical use. Likewise, it takes too much diligence to match a Times correction
 to its corresponding live text. When you do find the live text, corrections
 have been inserted invisibly, while Editors&apos; Notes appear at the bottom of the
 page, even when a story is old enough that one must pay for the full text.
 That&apos;s good, as is the prominent display of an e-mail address and phone number
 for the public editor. Now if only the Times would give Daniel Okrent a
 blog. 

 Trying to achieve an
 industry standard of disclosure sounds good in theory, but it conflicts with
 the goal of charging for online news content. Thus, it&apos;s likely that the Times doesn&apos;t offer a corrections archive because that would require the company to
 free up online content now available only for a fee. Besides, anyone with a
 Nexis password can find every correction and Editors&apos; Note the Times has ever publishedbut subscriptions are expensive, which is why Rosenbaum
 calls Nexis a&quot;gated community.&quot;Shouldn&apos;t the library of errors be
 open to the public, and not just to insiders? 

 Here&apos;s another
 thorny issue. It is impossible to establish the truth or falsehood of certain
 propositions, such as whether the pope said,&quot;It is as it was,&quot;or
 whether the Dean scream means he is unstable. Perhaps online news sites could
 address this sort of thing by devoting separate pages to Second- and
 Third-Hand Assertions, Spin We Fell For, and Hidden Agendas. 

 Carried to its
 absurd conclusion, this trend could lead to an All-Corrections website, a
 universal library of errors. Think of it as one-stop shopping for researchers,
 a complete inventory of all corrections, all the time. The home page would
 link daily to every media outlet&apos;s internally generated corrections, with
 separate pages for Editors&apos; Notes, ombud blogs, and independent criticism.
 All-Corrections.com would depend on elegant design and a crack search engine
 and would work best as a nonprofit, with a paid webmaster and voluntary media
 participation. Of course, to maintain credibility, the site would itself have
 to have an ombudsman, a readers&apos; forum, and a corrections page . . . 

 Remember, cyberspace
 means never having to say you&apos;re sorry.

 Trinity
 University&apos;s Web site ( www.trinity.edu )
 will have a new look and structure beginning this weekend. This major
 redesign is an outgrowth of the University&apos;s integrated marketing plan and
 will provide for a dynamic and consistent look throughout the Web site.
 Like the new University logo and other similar initiatives, Trinity&apos;s Web
 site is designed to reinforce communication about the University&apos;s
 quality, distinctiveness, and innovation. 
   

 Some
 of the new features you will notice: 

   

 Audience
 gateways will offer a set of links of interest to Future
 Students, Alumni, and Friends and Visitors. Audience gateways for
 Current Students and Faculty and Staff link directly to Tiger&apos;s
 Lair, the University portal. Global
 navigation will allow users to access content and features, such
 as the home page or the search function, from any page on the site.
 The global navigation bar will be added to every Web page as the
 renovation progresses through the site. Primary
 navigation to an established set of primary content sections,
 such as Academics, Campus Life, Admissions&amp;Financial Aid and
 others, will become a standard feature on all Web pages to allow
 users access to key content sections from anywhere on the site. A&quot;quick links&quot;button on each page will allow access to
 frequently visited sections of the Trinity Web site. The search feature for the Trinity site has also been improved. 

 I
 would like to thank the faculty and staff who served on the Web site
 advisory task group, which provided guidance, advice, and feedback to
 this project: 
 
 An&quot;Interesting&quot;Commentary from a retiring professor (Sanford Pinsker)
 --- http://irascibleprofessor.com/comments-02-01-04.htm   
 
 After 40+ years in
 the classroom there are certain rituals that accompany retirement. One is
 emptying your office so that the person who&apos;s had an eye on the campus view
 outside your window can, at long last, move in; another is the sudden
 realization that your carefully labeled course syllabi and class notes no
 longer matter a fig. The list goes on and on, with every item making it
 clear that you are yesterday&apos;s news. It&apos;s enough to give a person the
 willies. 

 That&apos;s why I figure
 it&apos;s high time to give other side of the retirement coin a lighthearted
 look. In my case, there&apos;s nothing quite so uplifting as a preview of the&quot;coming attractions&quot;for next year&apos;s faculty meetings: a proposal
 to bring our Greek system into full college recognition (and oversight); a
 plan to replace dormitories with a smaller, more regulated&quot;house&quot;system; and yet another effort to encourage faculty members to live within a
 mile&apos;s radius of the campus. None of these issues&quot;grabs me&quot;-- as
 our students like to put it when asked about any literary work written
 before last Wednesday -- and I&apos;m jolly glad I won&apos;t have to sit through the
 tedious debates that will divide the faculty squarely down the middle, with
 one half swearing an allegiance to&quot;long overdo restraint&quot;while
 the other half is equally insistent that a good college governance is the
 one that governs least -- and the best one of all leaves plenty of time and
 space for&quot;dancing around the campus wine cask.&quot; 

 I used to think
 that the phrases surrounded by quotation marks were indigenous to my campus
 alone but the advent of e-mail has made it abundantly clear that they
 flourish at nearly every college that has faculty members and faculty
 meetings. Sometimes the rabbit ears are meant to be sneer quotes -- as in
 the case when words such as&quot;truth&quot;or&quot;beauty&quot;are
 being hooted out of the hall as indicators of the patriarchal hegemony --
 but there are also occasions when quotation marks direct our attention to
 the latest news from the heavy-water theorist Jacques Derrida. Either way,
 faculty members are more than able to turn any debate into a clash of
 quotation marks which operate as shields, as weapons, and sometimes as both. 

 I am well rid of
 the foolishness I used to hear every two weeks, or more often when the
 faculty met in extra sessions to consider what a change in the college&apos;s
 final exam schedule might mean, especially to those who regularly handed out&quot;take home: exams&quot;a week or two before the final exam period
 officially began. For faculty members deeply suspicious and opposed to more
 regulation from the dean&apos;s office, the issue boiled down to a clash between
 freedom and constraint. 

 Curiously enough,
 certain students echoed the all-purpose sentiment when they used teaching
 evaluation forms to hammer a teacher for being&quot;too rigorous&quot;because he or she handed out a syllabus at the beginning of the semester and
 then kept to it. Far better (according to some) were teachers who were
 deemed&quot;flexible,&quot;which meant that they would often ask the class
 what they wanted to do. Most of the time this meant&quot;meeting
 outside&quot;or better yet, taking the day off altogether. 

 All this is easy
 enough to kiss farewell. But what is even more attractive is the prospect of
 living a long, happy life without ever uttering the word&quot;interesting.&quot;Why so? Because&quot;interesting&quot;is nearly
 always an empty word, and when a teacher lets it slip out in a classroom it
 is nearly always meant to be a weasel word. The fact is that most of the
 things that students say are not interesting. But that said, who wants to
 turn off discussion altogether, which is what too much bald truth will do if
 directed to the person half nodding in the back row and wearing a baseball
 cap backwards. For such a student, publicly declaring that his response to
 Hawthorn&apos;s story is&quot;interesting&quot;may be a lie, but if so, it is a
 white lie meant to encourage not only that student but others within
 earshot. Once again, the tension in Hawthorn&apos;s The Maypole of Merrymount are
 well worth exploring, even from those more prone to identify with the
 partygoers than with their more sober, morally serious cousins. It&apos;s&quot;interesting&quot;that this should be the case, but it does not bring
 us very far in terms of understanding what the story is finally about.&quot;Interesting&quot;is the anthem of those who believe that every person
 is entitled to his or her opinion, and moreover, that all opinions are
 right. I will fight to the death to defend the first part of the equation,
 but not the second. Still, I will concede that there are time in the
 classroom when the case for widening the circle makes a certain amount of
 sense. 

 That&apos;s why I used
 the word&quot;interesting&quot;far more than I probably should have. In
 this crime I am hardly alone. But now that I&apos;m retired, one of the great
 liberating joys is that I have no need to use&quot;interesting&quot;ever
 again -- unless, of course, when the need really does fit this deliberately
 vague word. 

 I can think of
 places, other than classrooms where the word&quot;interesting&quot;is
 bandied about (art museums, for example, or recitals for cutting-edge
 music), but I always suspect that people are hiding behind the word until
 they get a sense of what the majority thinks. After all, you can&apos;t get into
 too much trouble when hiding behind&quot;interesting.&quot;&quot;Lousy&quot;would have made it clear that you hate the damn thing, and&quot;wonderful&quot;would have painted you into a corner. 

 Now that I&apos;m
 retired I will, no doubt, have lots of occasions to test out whether I&apos;m
 using&quot;interesting&quot;in a legitimate (interesting?) way or whether
 I&apos;m simply being much the same coward as most people who hide behind
 intentionally vague words. Perhaps it&apos;s best that I retire the word&quot;interesting&quot;altogether; and perhaps that wouldn&apos;t be a bad idea
 for those who still labor in the teaching vineyard. 
 
If you want to see any of the Super Bowl commercials
 played back, you can go the site shown below by Glen.   Actually, I think the commercials this year were not up to the quality
 seen in former Super Bowls even though the going price was $4 million per
 minute.   I did, however, love the
 donkey in the Bud commercial.

 Three Southerners and three Yankees are traveling by train to Houston to
watch the Super Bowl. At the station, the three Yankees each buy a ticket and
watch as the three Southern gentlemen buy just one ticket. 

 &quot;How are the three of you going to travel on only one ticket?&quot;asks
one of the Yankees. 

 &quot;Watch and learn,&quot;answers one of the gentlemen from the South. 

 They all board the train. The three Yankees take their respective seats, but
all three Southern gentlemen cram into a toilet together and close the door.
Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting
tickets. 

 He knocks on the toilet door and says,&quot;Ticket, please.&quot; 

 The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand.
The conductor takes it and moves on. The Yankees see this happen and agree it
was quite a clever idea; so after the game, they decide to do the same thing on
the return trip and save some money. When they get to the station they buy a
single ticket for the return trip, but see, to their astonishment, that the
three Southern gentlemen don&apos;t buy any ticket at all. 

 &quot;How are you going to travel without a ticket?&quot;says one perplexed
Yankee. 

 &quot;Watch and learn,&quot;answers the gentlemen from the South. 

 When they board the train the three Yankees cram themselves into a toilet and
the three Southern gentlemen cram into another toilet just down the way. 

 Shortly after the train is on its way, one of the Southern gentlemen leaves
their toilet and walks over to the toilet in which the Yankees are hiding. 

 The Southern gentleman knocks on their door and says,&quot;Ticket,
please.&quot;

 The first domed stadium in the U.S. was the Astrodome in Houston . 

 The State animal is the Armadillo. * *An interesting bit of trivia about the
armadillo is they always have four babies! They have one egg which splits into
four and they either have four males or four females. Well... I thought it was
interesting anyway! 

 Added Note by Bob Jensen 

 Armadillos were constantly digging deep
and often in my back yard when I still owned a home in San Antonio. I
tried trapping them until somebody said they would not step into a trap. I
thought of poisoning them until I learned that their anatomy with two stomachs
makes them almost impossible to poison. So as a last resort when one was
swimming in my swimming pool, I took my Saturday Night Special (a cheap 22 cal.
revolver) and shot five times.  The bullets deflected harmlessly off
the armor of the armadillo but not harmlessly into the bottom of my swimming
pool. Who says professors are smart? 
 
 You&apos;ve almost got to feel sorry for

 2. Don&apos;t order a bottle of pop or a

 whether it&apos;s Pepsi, RC, Dr. Pepper, 7-Up, or whatever.....it&apos;s still a Coke!!
 Accept it.  

 3. Don&apos;t laugh at our Southern names
 (Merleen, Bodie, Ovine, Luther Ray, Tammy Lynn, Darla Beth, Inez, Billie Joe,
 Sissie, Clovis, Linda Pearl, etc.). 

 4. We know our heritage. Most of us
 are more literate than you (e.g. Welty, Williams, Faulkner) We are also better
 educated and generally a lot nicer. Don&apos;t refer to it as a bunch of
 Hillbillieism. 

 5. We have plenty of business sense
 (e.g., Fred Smith of Fed EX, Turner Broadcasting, MTV, Netscape). Naturally,
 we do, sometimes, have small lapses in judgment (e.g., Edwards, Duke, Barnes,
 Clinton). We don&apos;t care if you think we&apos;re dumb. We are not dumb enough to let
 someone move to our state in order to run for Senate. 

 6. Don&apos;t laugh at our Civil War
 Monuments. If Lee had listened to Longstreet and flanked Meade at Gettysburg
 instead of sending Pickett up the middle, you&apos;d be paying taxes to Richmond
 instead of Washington. Don&apos;t visit Stone Mountain and complain about the
 carving. 

 7. We are fully aware of how high the
 humidity is so shut the hell up! Just spend your money and get the hell out of
 here. 

 8. Don&apos;t order Wheat Toast at Cracker
 Barrel. Everyone will instantly know that you&apos;re a Yankee. Eat your biscuits
 like God intended, with gravy. And don&apos;t put sugar on your grits. 

 9. Don&apos;t fake a Southern Accent. This
 will get you thrown out the front door. 

 10. Don&apos;t talk about how much better
 things are at home because we know better. Many of us have visited Northern
 Hellholes like Detroit, Chicago and DC, and we have the scars to prove it. If
 you don&apos;t like it here, Delta is ready when you are. 

 11. Yes, we know how to speak proper
 English. We talk this way because we don&apos;t want to sound like you. We don&apos;t
 care if you don&apos;t understand what we&apos;re saying. All other Southerners
 understand, and that&apos;s all that matters. 

 12. Don&apos;t complain that the South is
 dirty and polluted. None of OUR lakes or rivers have caught fire recently. If
 you whine about OUR scenic beauty, we&apos;ll kick your ass all the way back to
 Boston Harbor! 

 13. Don&apos;t ridicule our Southern
 manners. We say sir and Ma&apos;am. We hold doors open for others. We offer our
 seats to old folks because such things are expected of civilized people.
 Behave yourselves around our sweet little gray haired grandmothers or they&apos;ll
 kick some manners into your ass just like they did ours! 

 14. So you think we&apos;re quaint or
 losers because most of us live in the countryside? That&apos;s because we have
 enough sense to not live in filthy, smelly, crime infested cesspools like New
 York or Baltimore. 

 Last, but not least, DO NOT DARE to
 come down here and tell us how to cook Barbeque.

A West Texas Cowboy staggers into a&quot;female only&quot;bar. He finds
 his way to a bar stool and orders a drink. After sitting there for a while, he
 yells to the bartender,&quot;Hey, you wanna hear a blonde joke?&quot;

The bar immediately falls absolutely quiet.

In a very deep, husky voice, the woman next to him says,&quot;Before you
 tell that joke, sir, I think it is just fair given that you are blind drunk
 that you should know five things:
 
1 - The bartender is a blonde girl. 
2 - The bouncer is a blonde girl. 
3 - I&apos;m a 6 foot tall, 175 lb. blonde woman with a black belt in
 karate. 
4 - The woman sitting next to me is blonde and is a professional
 weightlifter. 
5 - The lady to your right is a blonde and is a professional wrestler.
 
Now think about it seriously, Mister. Do you still wanna tell that
 joke?&quot;

The Cowboy thinks for a second, shakes his head, and mutters,&quot;Nah...not if I&apos;m gonna have to explain it five times.&quot;

Subject: hillbillies

Two hillbillies walk into a bar. While having a shot of whiskey, they talk
 about their own moonshine operations. Suddenly, a woman at a nearby table, who
 is eating a sandwich, begins to cough. After a minute or so, it becomes
 apparent that she is in real distress.

One of the hillbillies goes over to her and says,&quot;Kin ya swaller?&quot;The woman shakes her head no.&quot;Kin ya breathe?&quot;The woman begins to
 turn blue and shakes her head no.

The hillbilly quickly lifts up the back of her dress, yanks down her
 drawers and quickly gives her butt cheek a lap with his tongue. The woman is
 so shocked that she has a violent spasm and the obstruction flies out of her
 mouth. As she begins to breathe again, the hillbilly walks slowly back to the
 bar.

His partner says&quot;Ya know, I&apos;d heard of that there&quot;Hind Lick
 Maneuver&quot;, but I ain&apos;t never seed nobody do it!&quot;

 Ordering Pizza in the Future May Surprise You! 

Operator:&quot;Thank you for calling Pizza Hut. May I have your order?

Customer:&quot;Hi, I&apos;d like to order.&quot;

Operator:&quot;May I have your NIDN first, sir?&quot;

Customer:&quot;My National ID Number, yeah, hold on, eh, it&apos;s
 6102049998-45-54610.&quot;

Operator:&quot;Thank you, Mr. Sheehan. I see you live at 1742 Meadowland
 Drive, and the phone number&apos;s 494-2366. Your office number over at Lincoln
 Insurance is 745-2302 and your cell number&apos;s 266-2566. Which number are you
 calling from, sir?&quot;

Customer:&quot;Huh? I&apos;m at home. Where d&apos;ya get all this
 information?&quot;

Operator:&quot;We&apos;re wired into the system, sir.&quot;

Customer: (Sighs)&quot;Oh, well, I&apos;d like to order a couple of your
 All-Meat Special pizzas...&quot;

Operator:&quot;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a good idea, sir.&quot;

Customer:&quot;Whaddya mean?&quot;

Operator:&quot;Sir, your medical records indicate that you&apos;ve got very
 high blood pressure and extremely high cholesterol. Your National Health Care
 provider won&apos;t allow such an unhealthy choice.&quot;

Customer:&quot;Geez. What do you recommend, then?&quot;

Operator:&quot;You might try our low-fat Soybean Yogurt Pizza. I&apos;m sure
 you&apos;ll like it&quot;

Customer:&quot;What makes you think I&apos;d like something like that?&quot;

Operator:&quot;Well, you checked out &apos;Gourmet Soybean Recipes&apos; from your
 local library last week, sir. That&apos;s why I made the suggestion.&quot;

Customer:&quot;All right, all right. Give me two family-sized ones, then.
 What&apos;s the damage?&quot;

Operator:&quot;That should be plenty for you, your wife and your four
 kids, sir. The &apos;damage,&apos; as you put it, heh, heh, comes $49.99.&quot;

Customer:&quot;Lemme give you my credit card number.&quot;

Operator:&quot;I&apos;m sorry sir, but I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll have to pay in cash.
 Your credit card balance is over its limit.&quot;

Customer:&quot;I&apos;ll run over to the ATM and get some cash before your
 driver gets here.&quot;

Operator:&quot;That won&apos;t work either, sir. Your checking account&apos;s
 overdrawn.&quot;

Customer:&quot;Never mind. Just send the pizzas. I&apos;ll have the cash ready.
 How long will it take?&quot;

Operator:&quot;We&apos;re running a little behind, sir. It&apos;ll be about 45
 minutes, sir. If you&apos;re in a hurry you might want to pick &apos;em up while you&apos;re
 out getting the cash, but carrying pizzas on a motorcycle can be a little
 awkward.&quot;

Customer:&quot;How do you know I&apos;m riding a bike?&quot;

Operator:&quot;It says here you&apos;re in arrears on your car payments, so
 your car got repo&apos;ed. But your Harley&apos;s paid up, so I just assumed that you&apos;d
 be using it.&quot;

Customer:&quot;@#%/$@&amp;?#!&quot;

Operator:&quot;I&apos;d advise watching your language, sir. You&apos;ve already got
 a July 2006 conviction for cussing out a cop.&quot;

Customer: (Speechless)

Operator:&quot;Will there be anything else, sir?&quot;

Customer:&quot;No, nothing. oh, yeah, don&apos;t forget the two free liters of
 Coke your ad says I get with the pizzas.&quot;

Operator:&quot;I&apos;m sorry sir, but our ad&apos;s exclusionary clause prevents us
 from offering free soda to diabetics.&quot;

 PC Poem 
   If a packet hits a pocket on a
 socket on a port, and the bus is interrupted at a very
 last resort, and the access of the memory makes
 your floppy disk abort, then the socket packet pocket has an
 error to report.   If your cursor finds a menu item
 followed by a dash, and the double-clicking icon
 puts your window in the trash, and your data is corrupted cause the
 index doesn&apos;t hash, then your situation&apos;s hopeless and
 your system&apos;s gonna crash!   If the label on the cable on the
 table at your house, says the network is connected to the
 button on your mouse, but your packets want to tunnel to
 another protocol, that&apos;s repeatedly rejected by the
 printer down the hall.   And your screen is all distorted by
 the side effects of gauss, so your icons in the window are as
 wavy as a souse; then you may as well reboot and go
 out with a bang, &apos;cuz sure as I&apos;m a poet, the
 sucker&apos;s gonna hang. 
 When the copy on your floppy&apos;s
 getting sloppy in the disk, and the macro code instructions is
 causing unnecessary risk, then you&apos;ll have to flash the memory
 and you&apos;ll want to RAM your ROM, and then quickly turn off the
 computer and be sure to tell your Mom!   Well, that certainly clears things
 up for me. How about you?

 The OCW (Open
Courseware) announcement, almost three years ago, was open
for easy inference. MIT officials insisted that the university was not offering
online courses to students; rather, MIT faculty were putting their course
materialssyllabi and supporting resourceson the Web for others to use. In
other words, one could see the syllabus and review some of the course materials,
but not take the class. And not just a few classes. OCWs announced goal
is to make the complete MIT curriculumeverything in the undergraduate and
graduate curriculum, across all fields, totalling some 2000 coursesavailable
over the next few years. Speaking at the November 2003 EDUCAUSE Conference, Anne
Margulies, executive director of the OCW project, announced that MIT has made
significant progress towards this goal: as of fall 2003, the resources for some 500
MIT courses had been posted on the Web.

a maiden lady named Miss Cornell (the granddaughter of the founder of Cornell

how Mrs. Cornell&apos;s teeth were occasionally frozen in the glass beside her bed. I suspect that is one of the reasons she remained a maiden lady until she died.

 While
derivatives can help banks to weather financial crises by transferring away
risks, they can also lead to unpredictable and dangerous concentrations of risk
elsewhere, Andrew Large, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said in a
speech this week at the London School of Economics. Large said one of the
biggest changes in managing financial stability was the dramatic increase in the
degree of complexity and interconnectedness in financial markets. He said this
was due to market liberalisation, technological advance and the development of
new instruments for transferring risk, all of which brought new benefits and
threats.&quot;The complex and diverse operations of hedge funds can help to
arbitrage away pricing mistakes, and to integrate financial markets,&quot;he
said.&quot;But they also raise new questions for financial stability
oversight.&quot;He also warned of the potential&quot;hazards&quot;of banks&apos;
reliance on computer modelling for their risk management. He said these models
are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based, and can give&quot;false reassurance&quot;that there will be enough liquidity in times of
crisis.

Bob Jensen&apos;s main fraud document is at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/fraud.htm  

Hi Denny,

I got your fax and then found the online version of your article (full
content) at http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/104/perspectives/nv1.htm  

I think your comments are right on target. I hope you don&apos;t mind that I will
feature this in the next edition of New Bookmarks.

I wanted to pick out some selected quotations and found that I wanted to
quote every line. I guess the best of the best reads as follows:
 
 ********************* 
My second observation about faculty is their relative lack of interest in
 professional issues. While at FASB, I noted that we received very few comment
 letters on proposed standards from academics. A relative handful participated
 in our process in other ways, such as being part of project advisory task
 forces. I attributed that low involvement primarily to the fact that the
 academic reward system doesn&apos;t give this activity much, if any, recognition. 

 While that&apos;s undoubtedly true, I&apos;ve since been
 surprised to see that so many faculty members don&apos;t keep up on professional
 issues. Unless it&apos;s something that directly affects an instructional matter in
 an accounting course or one of their personal research issues, they are
 relatively uninterested in current accounting events. For example, when I
 offered my colleagues the Special Investigative Committee&apos;s report on the
 WorldCom board of directors, there was virtually no interest expressed in what
 was the largest accounting fraud in history. 

 Now, I know this is an unfair generalization; there
 are many faculty members who do keep fully informed. But I&apos;ve always felt that
 the duty of any professional is to be reasonably aware of new developments in
 his or her field, even when not directly affected. Perhaps this is another
 consequence of the silo effect I mentioned earlier. 

 ********************* 
 
I don&apos;t recall who said it, but it is true that the&quot;physicists stole
all of the easy problems.&quot; Whenever people become objects of
research, the most relevant topics have research hurdles that appear to be
insurmountable. Most of our gifted researchers filter out the confounding
variables and then make much adieu about nothing. Or they conclude that a
serious problem exists without coming out from behind ivory towers to help the
profession deal with that problem. This is why our top academic research
journals mostly gather dust starting on the day they arrive in the library. It&apos;s not because they&apos;re too esoteric. It&apos;s because they&apos;re so irrelevant!

Thanks,

Bob Jensen

 Question
Who was Jesse H. Jones? 

 Answer 

 Thanks
Jim.   Trinity University got my
endowment from the Jesse H. Jones Foundation.   For that I am
eternally grateful. 

 Rice University got even more
money from this foundation and even named the School of Business at Rice as the
Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management.   

 I
was not aware of the PBS link and greatly thank you for sending it.

 Hi
Bob, 

 I
was just reading through the text I am using this semester for an e-business
technologies class, and there was a short bio of Jesse H. Jones. I was then
reading one of your AECM emails, and I saw that you are the Jesse Jones
Professor, and I thought, that must be quite an honor, so congratulations (long
overdue I am sure). I then also found a web site all about him at http://www.pbs.org/jessejones/ 

 Sounds
like he was an important guy! 

 Best

Do the rich in the U.S. really get richer while the poor get poorer? Is
this campaign slogan a misleading myth?

&quot;Time to Slay the Inequality Myth? Not So Fast,&quot;by David Leonhardt, The New York Times , January 25, 2004 --- http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/business/yourmoney/25view.html  
 
 If there is one thing that most people think they
 know about incomes in the United States over the last few decades, it is
 probably that salaries have grown more unequal. The rich have gotten richer
 faster than everyone else has. 

 In recent weeks, a new book has challenged this
 conventional wisdom, calling it a statistical mirage, and its striking claim
 has begun to receive national attention. Among native-born Americans, lower-
 and middle-income families have actually received proportionately bigger
 raises than the wealthy, according to&quot;The Progress Paradox&quot;(Random
 House), written by Gregg Easterbrook, a Washington journalist. Only a great
 influx of immigrants - many of them poor, but richer than they were in their
 home countries - has made inequality appear to widen in the statistics, Mr.
 Easterbrook says.

 This space voyage link from Barb Hessel is
FANTASTIC! 

This Space Wanderer voyage is terrific and very educational. You don&apos;t have
to do anything but choose your language and watch for about 12 minutes (maybe a
little longer on slow modems). A resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher is
recommended for viewing SpaceWander.com, although I enjoyed it at a lower
resolution.

Be patient because your voyage begins slowly and gets better and better after
a very slow liftoff. You will be taken to various planets and then on to
other galaxies. Views from your space ship are actual NASA photographs,
many from the Hubble Telescope. There&apos;s no audio narration, but you find
very interesting facts in a text box that changes while you travel through
space. I would have enjoyed it more with audio narration, but the audio
would have slowed the downloading of this voyage.

 &quot;Memory: Beyond Flash and DRAM
Even as today&apos;s two main types of storage get new capabilities, next-generation
technologies promise far more, at less cost,&quot;by Olga Khariff, Business
Week, January 21, 2004 --- http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2004/tc20040121_9640_tc139.htm   
 
 If any type of
 semiconductor gets no respect, it may be the lowly memory chip. It&apos;s true that
 DRAMs and flash memory -- the two chips that store most information in
 computers and electronic products -- have been at the top of the chip
 best-seller list for years. But from a performance standpoint, they&apos;ve been
 unable to keep pace with the turbocharged microprocessors that they&apos;re
 supposed to work in concert with. The resulting imbalance has prevented PCs
 from performing as well as they should, that is, as fast as they could run if
 only memory chips were up to the task. 

 Even so, the recent
 emergence of more chip-hungry consumer products means that for memory, a new
 day has begun. Take the cell phone. The memory capacity in an average handset
 that stores photos as well as contacts and the like should double this year
 vs. 2003, according to tech consultancy IDC. With their fancy features and
 flat screens, new digital TVs already contain nearly as much memory as low-end
 notebook PCs, figures Tai Nguyen, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group
 in San Francisco -- and sales of these brainy boob tubes are rising about 50%
 a year.

Consequently, worldwide sales of DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and flash
 memory combined should grow about 40% this year, to $40 billion, according to
 chip researcher IC Insights in Scottsdale, Ariz.

 BETTER ALTERNATIVES.  Problem is, if
 electronics are to keeping wowing consumers, they&apos;ll need faster, cheaper
 memory that will fit in smaller packages -- and nothing on the market quite
 fills that bill. DRAM is cheap and quickly reads and writes data. But it&quot;forgets&quot;data whenever its host&apos;s power is turned off, and it has
 to be replenished with electric current -- a major drawback for mobile
 devices.

Flash memory, which is prevalent in cell phones, retains data even when the
 power is turned off. But it&apos;s two to six times as expensive as DRAM, estimates
 Nguyen. And it&apos;s slow, which makes a pain of such tasks as saving photos on a
 cell phone.

So both the PC industry and consumer-electronics giants such as Sony ( SNE ) are pressing chipmakers for better alternatives.&quot;The holy grail is to
 combine the benefits of DRAM and flash&quot;for one low price, says Ivan
 Greenberg, director of strategic marketing for No. 1 memory maker Samsung
 Semiconductor.

 &quot;MORE VARIETY.&quot;  The surprising
 news is that such chips might arrive sooner than later. Leading memory makers
 such as Samsung, Micron ( MU ), Infineon ( IFX ) and
 Hynix in DRAM, and flash heavyweights Samsung, Toshiba, Intel ( INTC ), and an AMD ( AMD )-Fujitsu joint venture, have been ramping up spending on research and
 development. In fact, experts think memory is likely to get a heftier chunk
 than usual of the $20 billion Merrill Lynch expects chipmakers to spend on
 R&amp;D this year.

Already, there&apos;s&quot;a lot more variety [in memory chips] than there has
 ever been,&quot;says Brian Matas, an analyst with semiconductor consultancy
 IC Insights. In 2003, Toshiba introduced its XDR (extreme data rate) DRAM,
 which it claims to be the fastest memory chip in the world. And late last
 year, Toshiba and many other memory companies sent their customers samples of
 new chips.

 Online Sharing Gets

 &quot;Opening Up Online Education New
standards will make sharing online education software easy and
inexpensive,&quot;by Sally Atwood, MIT&apos;s Technology Review , December
2003/January 2004 --- http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/atwood1203.asp   
 
 Say online
 education and most people imagine taking an occasional professional
 development course via the Web or studying at a dedicated nonresidential
 school such as the University of Phoenix or the Open University in England.
 But on the campuses of traditional universities such as MIT, more and more
 educators and administrators are using the term to describe something more
 comprehensive: the advent of Web-based learning-management systems. These
 software-based systems, also known as course management or virtual-learning
 systems, debuted about five years ago and are designed to leverage the
 Internet to reinforce what happens in brick-and-mortar classrooms. Professors
 can post lecture notes and other course materials online, provide links to
 important resources, create class calendars, hold online discussions with
 students after class hours, and assign, distribute, collect, and grade
 homework, all on protected university sites. In the last two years, advances
 in computing technology have led to more user-friendly interfaces and
 higher-speed processing that have made the systems even more attractive. As a
 result, faculty are flocking to the systems in droves. At MIT, for example,
 the number of professors registered to use the Institutes
 learning-management system, Stellar, has skyrocketed from 50 in 2001 to 260
 this year. Another jump is expected next year, here and at other universities
 not just around the country but around the world.

 far corner of an orchard behind a white brick farmhouse. You will also observe
 a little girl hiking through the fields and along the creek looking for
 treasures. She was so active, her father dubbed her&quot;Busy Bee,&quot;and
 that is how her name appeared on the family letterhead. Fastforward to the
 1990s and observe this same person, needing a cartoon character to guide

Free Financial Planning for the Poor and Disadvantaged

&quot;AICPA, Others Sponsor New Project for Financial Independence,&quot; SmartPros ,
September 26, 2004 --- http://www.smartpros.com/x42241.xml  
 
 Six of the country&apos;s leading financial planning
 groups have joined forces to sponsor the Project for Financial Independence,
 the nation&apos;s first multi-organizational, pro bono financial planning effort. 

 The project, which offers free financial guidance to
 individuals who cannot afford a financial advisor, or who are facing an
 immediate or unusual financial need, is being launched this month. 

 The organizations collaborating on the project are
 the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Certified
 Financial Planner Board of Standards (CFP Board), Financial Planning
 Association (FPATM), National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA),
 National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) and Society of Financial
 Service Professionals (SFSP). 

 &quot;Together, these organizations represent the
 core of the financial counseling community,&quot;says Nan Mead, director of
 Communications at NEFE and chair of the Project for Financial Independence
 task force.&quot;By collaborating, we are able to institute a national
 network of financial advisors eager to introduce financial planning to
 individuals who may not have access to it otherwise.&quot; 

 Consumers who may be eligible to receive pro bono
 assistance under the Project for Financial Independence must meet one of the
 following criteria: 

 Low-income individuals (as defined by the U.S.
 Census Bureau)  Enlisted military personnel  Those who are facing an immediate financial crisis
 (for example, a natural disaster, long-term illness, death of a family
 member, job loss, etc.)  Those who are struggling with significant
 indebtedness or recovering from bankruptcy  

 In order to reach these individuals, the Project for
 Financial Independence will begin by working directly with three national
 charitable organizations: Habitat for Humanity, Mothers Against Drunk Driving
 (MADD) and Volunteers of America. As the project grows, more charitable
 organizations will be invited to participate. Each will identify clients who
 could benefit from no-cost financial advice and help link them to a local
 volunteer financial advisor belonging to one of the four membership
 organizations participating in the project. These include the AICPA, FPA,
 NAPFA and SFSP. 

 Although the Project for Financial Independence
 initially will provide services only through nonprofit organizations, its
 sponsors eventually plan to work directly with individuals, linking them to
 volunteer financial advisors by way of  http://www.consultaplanner.org/ . Currently, the site is available as a resource for financial advisors who
 have volunteered their services for the Project for Financial Independence and
 charitable organizations. Members of the public seeking self-help personal
 finance information also can benefit from the site. 

 Financial advisors seeking to offer pro bono services
 through the Project for Financial Independence must be members in good
 standing of the AICPA, FPA, NAPFA or SFSP, abide by the codes of ethics and
 policies of their membership organizations, and sign an agreement that they
 will volunteer their time and services at no cost to the client. For more

 From a Department
of Education 1995 forum, some panelists contended that rather than debating
the connections between technology-based instruction and test scores, schools
should focus on the most obvious and compelling reason form implementing
technology-namely, that students need strong technology skills to succeed in the
world of work. This section will provide you with the impact technology has on
learning.

 &quot;Through the use of
 advanced computing and telecommunications technology, learning can also
 be qualitatively different. The process of learning in the classroom can
 become significantly richer as students have access to new and different
 types of information, can manipulate it on the computer through graphic
 displays or controlled experiments in ways never before possible, and
 can communicate their results and conclusions in a variety of media to
 their teacher, students in the next classroom, or students around the
 world. For example, using technology, students can collect and graph
 real-time weather, environmental, and populations data from their
 community, use that data to create color maps and graphs, and then
 compare these maps to others created by students in other communities.
 Similarly, instead of reading about the human circulatory system and
 seeing textbook pictures depicting bloodflow, students can use
 technology to see blood moving through veins and arteries, watch the
 process of oxygen entering the bloodstream, and experiment to understand
 the effects of increased pulse or cholesterol-filled arteries on blood
 flow.&quot;(page 16) 

 &quot;We know now - based on
 decades of use in schools, on findings of hundreds of research studies,
 and on the everyday experiences of educators, students, and their
 families - that, properly used, technology can enhance the achievement
 of all students, increase families involvement in their childrens
 schooling, improve teachers skills and knowledge, and improve school
 administration and management.&quot;

 &quot;Technology&apos;s Impact on Academic
Achievement,&quot;by Samuel Besalel, T.H.E. Journal , January 22, 2004
---  http://www.thejournal.com/thefocus/33.cfm   
 
 This issue is the
 first of two articles that focus on the impact of technology on academic
 achievement. When examining technology&apos;s contributions to education, age is
 not a factor. Throughout every age group, students benefit from technology in
 the classroom. 

 There is a wide range
 of technology used in schools today, from desktop computers in classrooms and
 labs to digital whiteboards, digital projectors, laptop computers, wireless
 network technologies, devices for special needs populations, and more. 

 In this issue, we
 will focus on how technology increases classroom efficiency and facilitates
 learning in educational settings from kindergarten through grade six. 

 We will also examine
 the kind of changes in student learning that occur as a direct result of
 technology. 

 The Link Between
 Technology and Achievement Technology in the classroom directly contributes to
 student achievement, both by making students more effective in their learning
 and teachers more efficient in their teaching. 

 Students are
 attracted to the use of computers, even for such mundane applications as
 playing math games and reading online books. But when used in this manner,
 don&apos;t they simply replace other possible teaching methods or learning tools?
 Are there really advantages to such uses? 

 Actually, yes.
 Particularly in primary grades, computers help to reinforce many basic skills.
 While a teacher might find it hard to sustain a child&apos;s attention to teach and
 re-teach math facts, or the spelling of the days of the week, students are
 much more tolerant of repetition from a computer program; in fact, they come
 to expect it. This is good news, because repetition is essential in areas such
 as beginner reading and the learning of almost any fact. 

 For example, students
 playing a math game can feel challenged by&quot;beating the high score,&quot;making the learning of math both competitive and fun, while encouraging
 additional practice and drilling of facts. 

 Advantages are also
 to be had with online books. Efficient reading goes beyond being able to
 recognize letters and words. Phrasing is a key aspect of what good readers do.
 Many online book programs not only display the words of a book, with pictures
 or animations, but also include both an audio component and highlighting of
 phrases as the narrator works through the text. This provides an accurate
 model of what good readers do, helping to build fluent reading skills. 

 Teacher innovation
 has never been in short supply. The innovative approaches educators use to
 leverage technology to the benefit of their students is often more impressive
 than the technology itself. 

 With the appropriate
 targeting and application of technology, substantial gains can be made for
 student achievement. Various applications of technology can be effective when
 targeting primary school students to introduce logical concepts, mathematical
 equations, and cause and effect. 

 For example, I&apos;ve
 witnessed effective lessons presented in a computer lab to 20 or more students
 using only a single PC and a digital projector. 

 Because people need
 to learn how to learn, computer interfaces often pose problems to older
 learners. This is often not the case with young students with fiercely
 inquisitive minds. Presented as play, I observed how kindergarteners were
 cannily introduced to methods to approach software programs. Using The
 Learning Company&apos;s Kid Pix (  http://www.kidpix.com/ ), the instructor quizzed students on their knowledge of seasons, nature and
 animals. Together (with the instructor&quot;driving&quot;), they composed a
 thematic painting for the fall harvesting season. The children observed how
 various menus of related objects were stored. Using the objects to simulate
 rubber stamps, together they designed a picture that used their current
 knowledge and eased them into more information. In the process, they learned
 to group relationships of animals and plants in higher and lower order (i.e.,
 animals, animals with four legs, mammals) and were introduced to computer
 terminology such as select, delete, edit, click, and so forth.

 &quot;Business ethics institute planned
A group of corporate leaders and universities said the new school would be in
Virginia,&quot;by Liz Willen, Philadelphia Inquirer , January 15, 2004
--- http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/business/7712959.htm   
 
 The Business
 Roundtable and a group of business schools, including the Wharton School, said
 yesterday that they would create an institute for corporate ethics at the
 University of Virginia. 

 Their announcement in
 Washington comes as U.S. business schools are trying to strengthen ethics
 requirements and restore public confidence in their programs and graduates
 after scandals at companies such as WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp. The Business
 Roundtable represents chief executive officers of U.S. corporations with a
 combined workforce of 10 million and revenue of $3.7 trillion. 

 &quot;As the chief
 ethics officers at our companies, we know setting and maintaining the highest
 ethical standards starts at the top,&quot;said Hank McKinnell, chairman and
 chief executive officer at Pfizer Inc., the world&apos;s biggest drugmaker.&quot;This effort will support business leaders to maintain a cutting-edge
 culture of ethical business practices within our organizations.&quot; 

 The Business
 Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics will be housed at the Darden
 Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia in
 Charlottesville, Va. It will offer two sessions for CEOs and senior executives
 this year and more in 2005 and 2006, a news release said. 

 Besides Wharton, the
 participating business schools include those at Harvard University,
 Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, the University of Notre
 Dame, the University of Minnesota, Pennsylvania State University, and the
 University of Texas. 

 The institute will be
 headed by an executive director. It also will have a nine-member advisory
 council that will include McKinnell; Anne Mulcahy, chairwoman and CEO of Xerox
 Corp.; Steve Odland, chairman and CEO of AutoZone Inc.; and John J. Castellani,
 the Business Roundtable&apos;s president. 

 Fannie Mae&apos;s chairman
 and CEO, Franklin Raines, and a Darden School professor, R. Edward Freeman,
 will serve as the cochairmen. 

 &quot;We are trying
 to figure out how we can meld business and ethics together, once and for
 all,&quot;said Freeman, who heads the Darden School&apos;s Olsson Center for
 Applied Ethics.&quot;We want to deal with issues not just why someone did
 something wrong, but where do incentives and incentive compensation bump up
 against ethical principles? How do you deal with conflicts of interest that
 are real?&quot; 

 Raines said:&quot;Our overall goal is to restore public trust. If we cannot make our
 corporations function effectively, the entire nation will be affected.&quot;

 &quot;Gadget Can Send Music On PC
Around a House Without Lots of Wires,&quot;by Walter Mossberg, The Wall
Street Journal , January 15, 2003 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107411729558053000,00.html?mod=gadgets%5Fprimary%5Fhs%5Flt   
 
 You know all those
 digital song files you have stored on your home computer? What if you could
 hear all that music, at the touch of a button, on the audio system in your
 family room -- even if it&apos;s downstairs and on the other side of the house? And
 what if you could do this without stringing wires all over the place? 

 That&apos;s the vision of
 numerous electronics companies, which have dozens of products in the works to
 wirelessly&quot;stream&quot;music around your house. And it&apos;s not just music
 that&apos;s involved. Many of these home media-streaming systems are also designed
 to wirelessly transmit your digital home movies and digital photos, stored on
 a PC, to various TV sets around the house. 

 For the past week or
 so, I&apos;ve been testing one of the simpler examples of a home media-streaming
 product. It&apos;s the $249 Sound Blaster Wireless Music system from Creative
 Technology, the company behind the famous Sound Blaster audio cards for PCs
 and the Nomad line of portable music players. 

 The system consists
 of three parts: software you install on your PC; a small, slim wireless
 receiver you connect to an audio system or speakers; and a big, sophisticated
 remote-control unit that lets you navigate through thousands of songs without
 sitting at the PC. The system works on Windows PCs and requires a Wi-Fi
 wireless network. It allows up to four remote wireless receivers to be in use
 simultaneously, all playing music stored on a single PC. 

 Creative claims this
 new product overcomes the two biggest problems plaguing the new home
 media-streaming systems. 

 The first problem is
 that the Wi-Fi wireless networks used to stream music and videos can be
 complicated to set up, and to configure for new devices. Creative claims to
 have solved the setup and configuration problem by allowing users to plug the
 remote receiver directly into the PC briefly during the setup process,
 permitting the computer to configure it before you start using it. 

 The second common
 problem is the user interface for the remote receiver. Some products use a TV
 screen to present the list of songs and playlists that can be selected for
 remote playback, but that limits your remote music listening to rooms with TVs
 in them. Others place small screens on their remote music receivers, but these
 can be hard to read across a room. 

 Creative&apos;s system
 attacks this problem by placing a screen right in the remote-control unit
 itself. Using that screen, you can select songs, artists, albums, genres and
 playlists pretty easily. 

 In my tests, setup
 went nearly as smoothly as Creative predicted. I installed the software on my
 Windows XP computer. You must use Creative&apos;s own music jukebox program to
 manage the music library on the PC. The wireless system doesn&apos;t communicate
 directly with more popular jukebox software like Musicmatch or iTunes, though
 you can still use these in tandem with the Creative software. 

 Next, I plugged the
 receiver into the PC, using an included USB cable, and entered information
 about my wireless network. 

 The only confusing
 element in the setup was entering the security password for my Wi-Fi network.
 The software initially asks for this&quot;Network Key&quot;to be entered in
 an arcane and obscure kind of techie code called&quot;Hexadecimal.&quot;You
 can also enter the password in plain English, but you have to choose an option
 to do so. No normal consumer knows what&quot;Hex&quot;is, and companies
 should stop expecting them to use it. 

 After setup was over,
 I unplugged the receiver and tried it in two different rooms in my house. My
 first test location was a room on the same upper floor as the PC, where I
 plugged the receiver into some old computer speakers, using an included audio
 cable. 

 That worked fine. The
 screen on the remote let me choose any of my 2,500 songs or various playlists
 I had made on the PC. 

 Next, I moved the
 receiver downstairs, to a small, book-filled room we use as a library. There&apos;s
 no TV there, just a small stereo system. I connected the Creative receiver to
 the stereo&apos;s&quot;AUX&quot;jacks using a standard audio cable I had to buy
 separately. I then placed the wireless receiver on a bookshelf. Again, it
 worked fine, even though the library is nowhere near the PC. 

 I ran into only two
 problems with the Creative wireless music system. At one point, with the unit
 playing away in the library, I went back upstairs to the PC to tweak the
 configuration. But the PC couldn&apos;t detect the receiver downstairs, even though
 the receiver was detecting the PC. Creative blames this on the underlying
 network technology, which it says can cause such fluke situations. 

 Also, the Creative
 system doesn&apos;t let you just select&quot;All Tracks&quot;and then play them
 randomly, as you can on an iPod portable player. Creative says it didn&apos;t
 enable this feature because it would take too long to cue up thousands of
 songs for playback over a wireless network. But the All Tracks mode is very
 commonly used by digital music lovers, and its omission is a real loss.

 Question
Is accounting standard&quot;neutrality&quot;a myth? 

 Answer
Whenever a standard draws a bright line, the answer is generally yes. For
example, in March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
its Interpretation 44 that made option employee stock option repricings less
desirable from the standpoint of impact on earnings. An incentive to&quot;reprice&quot;arises when prior stock options issued to employees have a&quot;strike&quot;price far above current market price of the company&apos;s stock. In order to keep experienced employees and satisfy labor unrest, many companies
want to set a lower strike price or to replace (cancel) underwater options held
by employees with replacement options having a lower strike price.   

 To illustrate a cancellation and new
grant repricing, the initial Interpretation 44 Exposure Draft featured an
example indicating that a cancellation and new grant within six months were
treated as a repricing. This created some confusion, because it was not clear
whether six months was only an example or a bright-line test. The subsequent
Interpretation 44 established that the six-month example was indeed a
bright-line test so that variable accounting could be avoided if the
cancellation and new grant are more than six months apart. 

 The Resulting
6&amp;1 Strategy Indicates the Futility of the FASB&apos;s Neutrality Goal 
In the wake of the market declines in Year 2001 and 2002, corporations widely
adopted the so-called 6&amp;1 strategy of canceling underwater options and then
issuing replacement options six months plus one day later . The
impact of this strategy is shown below. 

 &quot;Stock Options: Weighing the
Impact of Bailouts,&quot;by Jennifer Muller and Lucia Blatnicky, Financial
Executive , Jan/Feb 2004, Page 39: 
 
 In the vast majority
 of bailouts, companies used the 6&amp;1 Method --- 72% in 2001 and 87% in
 2003. Traditional repricings, with the negative variable accounting
 effect, declined from 12% of total in 2001 to 5% in 2002. 
 
 So much for accounting standard
neutrality!

&quot;Using Software to Sniff Out Fraud,&quot;Amey Stone, Business Week ,
September 30, 2004 --- http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2003/tc20030930_2727_tc131.htm  

&quot;Forensic accounting&quot;sleuths are taking advantage of sophisticated
programs to catch the crooks in action
 
 In the 1920s, Frank Benford, a physicist at General
 Electric (GE ), discovered an astonishing mathematical law: In just about any
 given set of numerical data, numbers occur as the first or second digit at a
 predictable rate. For example,&quot;1&quot;will appear as the first digit
 31% of the time, but&quot;9&quot;will appear first only 5%. While that
 sounds unlikely, Benford tested lists of numbers from many different sources
 -- accounting ledgers, geographic data, even magazine articles -- and found
 that the same probability persisted. 

 Applied to accounting, Benford&apos;s Law makes for a
 great way to check to see if numbers are fabricated (since when liars make up
 figures, they usually don&apos;t follow the same statistical pattern Benford
 identified). The law is now enjoying booming popularity as the basis for a
 fairly easy, routine test that&apos;s used to uncover accounting fraud. Easy, that
 is, if you have a sophisticated software package and enough high-powered
 computers to crunch numbers from reams of documents.

In 2002, Darrell Dorrell, a principal at accounting firm Financial Forensics
 in Lake Oswego, Ore., used a computer program to apply Benford&apos;s Law to more
 than 21,000 payroll records of a health-care company accused of defrauding
 investors. He found that the number&quot;0&quot;turned up as the second
 digit in the payroll records twice as often as it should have, and&quot;5&quot;showed up 60% more often than would be expected. With that
 information, plus lots more evidence from other tests, he reported to the
 company&apos;s receiver that the records&quot;appear to be contrived.&quot;

 FUELED BY FEAR.    

 Benford&apos;s Law provides just one small example of the
 way in which technology used to uncover accounting fraud has been growing in
 both sophistication and popularity. The growth hasn&apos;t really been stimulated
 by technological innovation, which has mostly amounted to fine-tuning
 sleuthing programs so that they issue fewer false alarms, customizing such
 programs for use with new industries, and upping raw computing power so the
 programs can crunch more data. Instead, the boom is being fueled by accounting
 scandals, terrorism threats, and new regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley
 financial-disclosure law and the Patriot Act, which both require companies to
 be more vigilant about avoiding financial fraud and about keeping employees
 honest.

All of those threats&quot;have made businesses more aware of the potential
 catastrophic damage to organizations that fraud presents,&quot;says Toby
 Bishop, president of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.&quot;In
 the past, companies were unwilling to spend money on solutions until they had
 a bad experience,&quot;he adds. But over the past couple of years,&quot;financial-statement fraud has risen to the top of the agenda.&quot;

Partly, that&apos;s because of the weak economy, says Carolyn Newman, president and
 co-founder of Houston-based Audimation Services, which sells software that&apos;s
 used by forensic accountants.&quot;When individuals have a financial need, or
 a need to protect their jobs, they&apos;re more likely to commit or participate in
 fraud,&quot;she says.

 EYE-GRABBING RESULTS.    

 However, despite the high-profile instances of
 malfeasance that have plagued Corporate America lately, the companies leading
 the charge to find fraud are trying to root out dishonest customers more than
 crooked executives. In the last 10 years, credit-card companies have cut their
 losses due to card theft in half using programs like Fair Isaac&apos;s ( FIC ) Falcon Fraud Manager, which flags potentially bogus transactions at checkout
 based on analysis of past spending patterns by cardholders. And software
 that&apos;s used to spot insurance fraud typically delivers a return on investment
 of more than 300%, says Bishop.&quot;Those are figures that will grab the eye
 of any chief financial officer,&quot;he adds. 

 Returns are so high because fraud-finding software,
 including programs used by auditors to check a company&apos;s financial records, is
 better than ever. While auditors typically sample small portions of data to
 check that accounting policies are being followed, now they can easily check
 every transaction, a capability identified by the oxymoron&quot;100%
 sampling.&quot;

&quot;We&apos;re in a complex business environment where the number of transactions
 companies have to monitor has increased in conjunction with more
 regulation,&quot;says Harald Will, chief executive of Vancouver (B.C)-based
 ACL Services, a leading provider of software for internal audits. ACL will
 debut its&quot;Continuous Monitor&quot;suite of software tools in
 mid-October.&quot;Companies need to manage the risks, ensure that controls
 are working properly, monitor the integrity of transactions -- and they need
 to do it continuously,&quot;Will says.&quot;The only way they can do that is
 with technology.&quot;

 CONFLICT CHECKERS.  Increasingly, companies
 are also using outside databases to look for relationships between potential
 new hires and business units, with an eye to uncovering conflicts of interest
 or illegal activity. The latest systems will scroll through payment
 information looking for suppliers that aren&apos;t listed in any online commercial
 database -- a possible sign that they aren&apos;t legit -- or that operate from
 addresses that have been associated with fraud in the past.

From its Springfield (Va.) home base, a company called I2 sells the&quot;Analyst&apos;s Notebook,&quot;a program developed for law-enforcement
 agencies but becoming more widely used in corporate settings. One of its
 corporate tasks is to check for conflicts of interest on a company&apos;s board of
 directors. The software will troll through open databases, like D&amp;B ( DNB ) or LexisNexis, to look for connections between individuals and companies.
 Then it will illustrate the connections graphically, with lines connecting
 people and organizations.

&quot;We can take three feet of written documents and turn them into a picture
 that shows relationships,&quot;claims Jack Reis, I2&apos;s president. He has noted
 increasing demand from forensic accountants -- those who look for fraud.&quot;I expect we&apos;re going to see more,&quot;he says.

 Google Eyed Social Networking
Google tip-toed into the hot market of online social networks with the quiet
launch of Orkut.com  

 &quot;Google spawns social networking
service,&quot;byy Stefanie Olsen, CNET News.com, January 22, 2004 --- http://news.com.com/2100-1026-5146006.html   
 
 The search company,
 which is expected to go public this year, is flexing its power with its
 Internet fans by constantly offering new services, including comparison
 shopping and news search. Orkut could be the clearest signal that Google&apos;s
 aspirations don&apos;t end with search. 

 &quot;Orkut is an
 online trusted community Web site designed for friends. The main goal of our
 service is to make the social life of yourself and your friends more active
 and stimulating,&quot;according to the Web site, which states that the
 service is&quot;in affiliation with Google.&quot; 

 A Google
 representative said that the site is the independent project of one of its
 engineers, Orkut Buyukkokten, who works on user interface design for Google.
 Buyukkokten, a computer science doctoral candidate at Stanford University
 before joining Google, created Orkut.com in the past several months by working
 on it about one day a week--an amount that Google asks all of its engineers to
 devote to personal projects. Buyukkokten, with the help of a few other
 engineers, developed Orkut out of his passion for social networking services. 

 Google spokeswoman
 Eileen Rodriquez said that despite Orkut&apos;s affiliation, the service is not
 part of Google&apos;s product portfolio at this time.&quot;We&apos;re always looking at
 opportunities to expand our search products, but we currently have no plans in
 the social networking market.&quot; 

 Still, Google owns
 the technology developed by its employees, Rodriquez said. 

 Orkut is a&quot;trusted&quot;social network, meaning that you must be invited to join.
 The service sent out thousands of invitations Thursday to welcome individuals,
 according to Google. 

 Google regularly
 throws out new products and services to see if they stick. Google News, for
 example, began as the personal project of Google engineer Krishna Bharat in
 2002. While Google still runs news search in&quot;beta&quot;form, it is
 gaining a wide audience on the Internet and is prominently promoted on
 Google&apos;s home page.

 Question
If your child asks you how money is created, will you incorrectly answer that it
is created by government printing presses? 

 Answer
The correct answer is that money is created by borrowing, usually borrowing from
commercial banks. The U.S. Government controls the money supply by
controlling how much the Federal Reserve allows commercial banks to loan. Creation of money has nothing to do with printing presses or how much cash is in
circulation except in nations where government directly and irresponsibly spends
the money that it prints. Responsible governments can only obtain money by
borrowing, by taxation, by lotteries, or by selling goods and services.  Money is printed only to satisfy the preferences of consumers to hold a portion
of their money in cash.

children should examine the following site.

 Hi Richard, 

 I lost interest in
ToolBook when Asymetrix stopped developing OpenScript (that allowed authors to
be very creative) in favor of pre-scripted templates that destroy most of the
creativity alternatives in courseware design.   The new ToolBook is easy to use but offers too few benefits relative to
high cost as evidenced by declining market share in academe.   It &apos; s also risky to develop materials in software made by a company continually on
the verge of bankruptcy and/or sudden dropping of expensive support products
like Librarian.   

 It was sad to
abandon knowledge capital I acquired developing ToolBooks, but now I realize
that too much of my life was spent getting hung up on bugs in ToolBook software
that arose from upgrades that were never sufficiently tested before being
released.   I suspect that you wasted
even more of your life and money on the phone with TookBook Tech Support.

 I might be interested
 in developing and sharing questions. But first does anyome know if either
 Blackboard or Webct are AICC and SCORM compliant? This is important if a
 course designer develops courseware using a third party product like Tookbook
 (yes Bob Jensen - it still lives in a new release - Toolbook 2004!!!!!) or
 Flash. 

 Our campus has WebCT
 and in doing a knowledgebase search, it did not look like it was compliant.
 The standards allow for the score output to be stored and recorded in the
 WebCT or Blackboard LMS (Learning Management Systems).

&quot;Apple Makes Sweet Music,&quot; CBS News , January 15, 2004 --- http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/15/tech/digitaldan/main593343.shtml  
 
 Each year, we have come to expect the big noise Apple
 CEO Steve Jobs makes at Macworld Expo. This January, the hype was more modest:
 Apples new slogan could now be Think Small. Even though there was no
 big rollout of, say, a 40-inch Cinema Display or an even more powerful series
 of Powerbooks, Apple has returned to expand its highly popular iPod music
 player brand. 

 Once, my 40-gigabyte iPod seemed to be a musical
 dream in miniature. Now, it seems humongous compared to the brand new iPod
 Minis. For those of us still happy with our old iPods, we can now enjoy
 a medley of musical accessories: microphones, adapters, transmitters, and even
 jackets. One of the coolest new releases from Apple comes in a neat software
 application: Garage Band, a way to make and mix music on your Mac. 

 Ive never been shy about my love for the iPod. It
 began with the groundbreaking, yet modest 5 gigabyte model, then grew into a
 10 gig, followed by a 20 gig, and now to the 40 gig version. Thats
 thousands and thousands of songs, folks. And I keep needing more room, because
 I keep buying songs from Apples iTunes Music Store. I can so easily
 download whatever music I think of legally using iTunes, I&apos;m adding to my
 burgeoning library (while siphoning off the kids college fund.) Sadly, I was
 hoping for an iPod with twice the capacity but Apple went the other way
 offering less for less. 

 Heres the deal on the new iPod Minis: five colors,
 1,000 songs, about 3 measly ounces. Theyre heavy for their size, made of
 anodized aluminum and sport eight hours of battery life. They are indisputably
 more elegant than any other tiny music player around, of course. Most Apple
 fanatics were surprised with the initial and relatively high price of $249
 especially as it seems geared to expand the market to even younger music fans.
 But its fair to expect that price will go down dramatically as Apple
 launches even newer versions with greater capacity. Can you hear us in
 Cupertino, Apple? Cool. 

 The nice folks at Apple tell us that there are two
 million iPods in the hands of folks just like me. And its safe to say some
 of those customers picked up new Macs as well, to organize their music among
 other things. That strategy worked on me: I bought my first Mac after falling
 in love with the elegance of the iPod, then the simplicity of iTunes. Finally,
 I developed an appreciation of the ease in which all the software worked
 together: music with my home movies or my photo collection, etc. Apple has
 tweaked the software even more and well get to that in a moment but
 first, the silly stuff I love the most: little things that make my iPod even
 more bodacious.

According to Chris Taylor (&quot;TheVirtual Virtuoso,&quot; Time Magazine ,
January 26, 2004) most digital iTunes designed for iPods cannot really be
downloaded into GarageBand, but this is only a minor hitch in an otherwise great
innovation.
 
&quot;Apple&apos;s New GarageBand Makes
Making Music Easy,&quot;by Riva Richmond, The Wall Street Journal ,
January 27, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107525822477513807,00.html?mod=technology%5Ffeatured%5Fstories%5Fhs  
 
 The shaggy-haired 24-year-old musician,
 until October a drummer for indie-rock band Detachment Kit and now a
 percussionist for hire, started by firing up an Apple
 Computer Inc. Macintosh Powerbook and opening its new GarageBand recording
 and mixing software. Inside, he grabbed, dragged and dropped beats and riffs
 and manipulated them with his mouse. Then he plugged in a microphone, took on
 the persona&quot;P-Shy&quot;and recorded some truly rude lyrics. 

 When he was done, Mr. Bilicki put the
 finished product in iTunes, Apple&apos;s program for organizing digital-music
 collections, and sent it to a few friends via iChat. One wrote back awed Mr.
 Bilicki was self-producing music. Another said she was putting the song, which
 has a name that isn&apos;t fit for print, on her iPod portable digital-music
 player. 

 The process was so quick and the
 results so slick,&quot;it makes me feel kind of dirty,&quot;he said.&quot;Did I do this, or was it the program?&quot; 

 GarageBand is a new addition to Apple&apos;s
 iLife suite of digital-media software for the Mac. As of Friday, new Macs were
 loaded with the latest version of iLife, including GarageBand and enhanced
 versions of its iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie and iDVD programs. Current Mac users
 can upgrade their iLife software for $49. 

 GarageBand is also the third
 interactive part of Apple&apos;s digital-music plan for the masses. It adds
 creating music to Apple&apos;s highly successful efforts to give consumers a
 tightly tied way to manage their music libraries and buy more songs through
 iTunes and play them on a pocket-sized device, the iPod. 

 The right innovations at the right
 time, the iTunes store and the iPod are booming, in part because Apple has
 aggressively taken them to the vast Windows PC market. With more than 500,000
 tracks available for download, the store is the largest on the Internet. It
 has sold more than 30 million songs, which cost 99 cents apiece or can be
 bought in full albums, and claims a 70% share of the nascent legal download
 market. 

 The success of iTunes is also goosing
 the iPod. In two years, Apple has sold two million of them, but a full third
 were sold this Christmas. The iPod is now the No. 1 digital-music playback
 device with a 30% market share in units and 55% in revenue, the company has
 said. 

 Apple hopes GarageBand will give music
 lovers -- a key constituency as people increasingly put computers and the
 Internet at the center of their consumption of music, media and entertainment
 -- one more reason to buy Apple gear. 

 &quot;It&apos;s not just selling iLife
 upgrades,&quot;says Peter Lowe, senior director of marketing for Apple
 consumer software. Having GarageBand&quot;is another unique advantage to
 owning a Mac.&quot; 

 If you take it from Phil Leigh, senior
 analyst at research firm Inside Digital Media, of Tampa, Fla., Apple&apos;s inroads
 into the digital-music arena mark the emergence of a serious threat to Microsoft Corp.&apos;s hegemony. The clearest sign is Hewlett-Packard Co.&apos;s decision to make an Hewlett-Packard-brand iPod and load iTunes software,
 and to add an icon for easy access to the iTunes store onto all new H-P PCs. 

 &quot;Apple has won some important
 early victories here,&quot;Mr. Leigh says.&quot;If Apple can bring Gateway
 and Dell and IBM on board, it is a major victory and a significant
 transformation of the computer business, because the computer business is
 becoming digital-media and entertainment-centric.&quot; 

 &quot;You&apos;ve got to be the most
 gullible gatekeeper in Troy not to believe that Microsoft has some
 problems.&quot; 

 Apple sees a big market among amateur
 musicians, citing a 2000 Gallup poll showing that more than half of U.S.
 households have at least one active musician. Then there are all those
 would-be DJs and people who would like to create soundtracks for home movies
 they edited in iMovie. 

 Digital-music creation&quot;is a niche
 market, but it&apos;s a market that hasn&apos;t been very available to the
 amateur,&quot;Mr. Leigh says.&quot;Prior to Apple doing this, the market
 size was in the tens of millions. With Apple getting into it, I think it&apos;s in
 the hundreds of millions&quot;in a few years. 

 &quot;We&apos;ve really tried to build
 GarageBand for both the musician and non-musician alike,&quot;Mr. Lowe says. 

 The program provides all the basic
 elements for recording, fixing, slicing and dicing a musician&apos;s original
 performance. It converts tunes recorded using a keyboard into any of 65
 instruments. Guitar players can use built-in amplifier models -- preset
 combinations of effects like reverb and distortion created by recording
 engineers -- to generate sound styles like vintage British Invasion or arena
 rock. 

 Using 1,000 pre-recorded sounds, or
 loops, musicians can create back-up tracks and nonmusicians can construct
 whole songs. Some loops are as short as a single bar, while others are longer
 riffs. To make it easy to find the right one for a particular song, they&apos;re
 organized by instrument, style and genre. 

 &quot;The big thing that Apple&apos;s done
 is put a bunch of different elements together in a way we can use them,&quot;says Eliot Van Buskirk, author of&quot;Burning Down the House: Ripping,
 Recording, Remixing, and More!&quot;and a senior editor at CNET.&quot;Apple&apos;s great on cutting down complexity, and that&apos;s what needed to
 happen in this area.&quot; 

 Mr. Van Buskirk says GarageBand
 combines key features -- digital recording, looping, instruments and effects
 -- that, up to now, have been available separately, while making them easy for
 average people to use.&quot;It would be a very high level that someone would
 outgrow this software,&quot;he says. 

 Of course, GarageBand&apos;s limits will irk
 some musicians. Percussionist Bilicki said he ran out of drum tracks he liked
 after creating two songs and was disappointed that the elements he recorded
 didn&apos;t have the clean, professional sound the loops had. 

 Apple says people can get
 better-sounding recordings and more flexibility in how they connect guitars by
 using add-on digital-audio-interface devices. Such devices start at $30 and
 climb into the thousands of dollars. And people who do outgrow GarageBand&apos;s
 capabilities can buy its music-creation software for students, Logic Express,
 which costs $299, or for professionals, Logic Pro, at $999. 

 Mr. Bilicki and other musicians are
 quick to say that all the software bells and whistles won&apos;t guarantee that
 people who use them will create music worth listening to. 

 &quot;When it&apos;s all said and done, to
 make music takes an obsessive passion, hard work and concentration and if you
 have all that you can make music on a tin can,&quot;said Rob Hudak, lead
 singer for the Newborn Naturals, a New York rock band, in an e-mail interview.

 &quot;Calls for Labeling Grow After
Meats Are Found in &apos;Veggie&apos; Foods,&quot;by Lisa Tsering, January 5, 2004 --- http://news.ncmonline.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=f9ac0bdba978a3c9ec591eba49a294ad    
 
 While preparing
 dinner one night last February, Supriya Kelkar didnt think twice before
 tearing open a package of Lipton SideKicks Broccoli and White Cheddar Pasta
 mix.

Kelkar, a vegetarian, had read the packages label in the supermarket
 earlier. Among the ingredients listed on the package were pasta, salt,
 cornstarch, cheddar and blue cheese, whey, broccoli, MSG, spices, autolyzed
 yeast extract, maltodextrin, and natural flavors.

What came next shocked Kelkar.

I had a taste of the pasta, and I immediately sensed something
 meaty, she told India-West.

So she called the 800 number of Liptons customer service to ask if the
 product contained meat as one of its natural flavors. She was told by a
 representative that it was safe to assume that it did. Kelkar, 23, a
 vegetarian since her teens, decided to write a letter to complain.

[The customer service rep] explained that Lipton does not need to disclose
 that information to the public because meat is not a common allergen,
 Kelkar wrote in her letter. I find this completely and utterly
 offensive.

Two months later, she received a reply from Warren Blume, a spokesperson for
 Liptons parent company, Unilever Bestfoods: We cannot always guarantee
 that the ingredients are dairy, meat and egg free, he wrote. In speaking
 to our consumers, a majority of people found this to be an acceptable
 solution.

His email was infuriating, Kelkar told India-West by phone last week
 from her home in Detroit. To say, We tested it, and most consumers
 thought it was okay, was very patronizing.

Kelkar began to suspect that meat was hiding in many packaged foods on her
 shelf, such as Knorr soup and sauce mixes, Prego spaghetti sauces and Campbell
 soups, so she started writing letters to food companies, and even to the Food
 and Drug Administration, expressing her concern. She learned that not only was
 there no law requiring the disclosure of meat as an ingredient on food labels,
 but that few companies seemed to care. With a lot of companies, such as
 Kraft, their indifference was almost insulting, she said. Many companies
 cite proprietary reasons for their refusal to disclose whether their
 natural flavors contain meat.

On the surface, the solution to her problem would seem quite simple stop
 buying MSG-laden processed foods and cook everything from scratch; seek out
 frozen or packaged foods from natural foods companies such as Amys Kitchen
 or Cascadian Farm, which offer a wide range of vegetarian entrees; or shop
 only in Indian grocery stores, where vegetarian foods are more likely to be
 clearly labeled and easy to find.

But thats not always convenient or practical. Kelkar, a member of the
 screenwriting team on Vidhu Vinod Chopras Move 5 film project, often finds
 herself too busy to drive across town to search out a health food store. Busy
 working parents have even less time. And for vegetarians who live outside a
 major American city, their choices are fewer still.

In this country, it seems like that sort of information should be
 disclosed, Kelkar said. It seems like it should be a natural
 consideration.

 HIDDEN MEAT IN RESTAURANTS 

Tejas Mehta, a CPA living in Anaheim, Calif., was a regular customer at a
 Marie Callenders restaurant there. I used to go there regularly for
 Lions Club meetings, he recalled, and I used to eat the same Fettucini
 Alfredo due to the lack of vegetarian choices.

He asked a waitress to check that the dish was vegetarian, and she
 specifically confirmed that it was, he said. Mehta, an adherent to the
 strictly vegetarian Jain religion, had heard from an acquaintance that some
 restaurants added chicken stock to their Alfredo sauce to keep it moist, so he
 asked the waitress to doublecheck. His fears were confirmed when she returned
 from the kitchen. It had been non-vegetarian all along, he told
 India-West.

Mehta shared his concerns with others in the Jain community, and found that
 the practice was widespread. In an article he wrote and circulated on the
 Internet, he quoted other Jains with similar experiences: We were shocked
 to find out that the beans and rice at El Torito Grill in Irvine, Calif., are
 made with chicken and/or beef stock, said Hansni Kamdar. I have found
 out that soups, mashed potatoes, hash browns and rice are mostly made with
 beef/chicken broth, said Aarti Mehta. I tell every Jain not to eat in
 any Mexican restaurant, said Geeta Khona.

Some popular items that look vegetarian are really not what they appear to
 be, said Mehta. Tortilla chips, rice and beans generally appear
 vegetarian on the face of it, but many restaurants use lard, chicken or beef
 stocks to make these items. I used to eat Caesar salad for a long time before
 I realized it is not vegetarian. (Many Caesar dressings contain anchovy and
 raw egg.)

Isnt this an eye opener? Its about time issues like this are taken up
 with government agencies and consumer interest groups, said Mehta.

 Question
What were the two leading causes of financial report restatements in 2003? 

 Answer:  

 Rank 1: Errors in accounting
 for reserves and contingencies Rank 2: Revenue recognition 

 
&quot;Upward Trend in Financial Restatements Ends After Five Record Setting
Years; Reserve Accounting Leading Cause of Restatements,&quot;The Huron
Consulting Group, January 13, 2004 --- http://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/general01.asp?id=539&amp;relatedResourceID=515   
 
 Related Information Resource Library
 Restatement Study 2003 

 Huron Consulting
 Group today released a summary of its 2003 Annual Review of Financial
 Reporting Matters, a report analyzing the leading causes and trends in
 financial restatements filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC) for the year ending December 31, 2003. The analysis is broken down by
 company size, industry, and accounting issue and also notes whether the
 accounting error was initially reported in either a quarterly or an annual
 financial statement. 

 Public companies that
 changed their previously released financial statements due to accounting
 errors totaled 323 in 2003, a slight decline compared to the 330 restatement
 filings identified in 2002, and up from 270 in 2001 and 233 in 2000. These
 restatements have been filed in both amended quarterly (10Q/A) and annual
 (10K/A) financial statements filed with the SEC. (Graph 1) 

 The number of
 accounting errors identified in 2003, though certainly not a cause for
 celebration, may indicate that we have put the worst restatement period behind
 us and can expect to see further improvements in the years ahead, said
 Joseph J. Floyd, chief operating officer for Hurons Financial and Economic
 Consulting practice. 

 As we have
 observed in prior years, problems applying accounting rules, human and system
 errors, and fraudulent behavior are the three primary causes for accounting
 errors, added Floyd. 

 In 2003, the number
 of restated audited annual financial statements rose to a record high of 206,
 representing 63 percent of total restatements filed during the year. While
 investors rely on both quarterly and annual financial statements of public
 companies, there is a different level of procedures and responsibility assumed
 by the auditors for each. Annual financials have a higher level of effort and
 association required since an audit opinion is rendered. (Graph 2) 

 Errors in accounting
 for reserves and contingencies was the leading cause of restatements in 2003.
 This category includes accounting errors related to accounts receivable and
 inventory reserves, restructuring reserves, accruals, and other loss
 contingencies. Restatements attributable to this category experienced a
 greater increase in 2003 than any other accounting issue. (Graph 3) 

 Reserves and
 contingencies may be among the most judgmental accounts in a companys
 financial statements as they are subject to an estimation process. These
 restatements, however, do not simply reflect changes in estimates, but rather
 reflect flawed judgments due to the oversight or misuse of facts, fraud, or a
 misapplication of Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP). 

 Revenue recognition
 was the second leading cause of restatements in 2003. However, the 63 revenue
 recognition related restatements identified in 2003 represent a 26 percent
 decrease from 2002 when revenue recognition restatements reached an all time
 high. (Graph 4) 

 The number of 2003
 restatements by companies with annual revenues under $100 million rose to 158,
 or 49 percent of all restatements filed during the year. The percentage of
 restatements filed by companies with annual revenues greater than $1 billion
 decreased slightly in 2003, from 22 percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2003.
 (Graph 5) 

 Sarbanes-Oxley and
 recent catastrophic restatements have resulted in major changes in our
 financial reporting world, Floyd said. Increased internal and external
 scrutiny plus shareholder demands are working to improve the financial
 reporting process. 

 In addition, this
 year Huron Consulting Groups full report will summarize the major events
 impacting the financial reporting world in 2003 including actions taken by the
 SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), Financial Accounting
 Standards Board (FASB) and major observations regarding the public accounting
 industry. The full report will be available in early February.

 New Wine in Old IASB
Bottles 

 I highly recommend
that readers watch a replay of the January 21 E&amp;Y Webcast (&quot;Keeping in
Tune with Financial Instruments&quot;) highlighting revisions of IAS 32 and IAS
39 --- http://snipurl.com/EYwebcasts   

 Unlike the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) which issues a new standard number even when it revises a
previous standard, The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) changes
the content of a standard without changing a standard&apos;s number. For
example, previous IAS 32 (Financial Instruments) and IAS 39 (Derivative
Financial Instruments) recently underwent significant revisions. The main
change involves moving ever closer to Fair Value/Mark-to-Market carrying values
of financial instruments in the face of biting opposition from the banking
industry and business firms in general. IAS 32 does not go all the way due
to safe harboring of financial instruments designated as Held-To-Maturity that
can still be carried at historical cost and amortized at effective yields as in
days past, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to retain that designation for
instruments in that group if any one instrument in the group is not held to
maturity. There is a new designation group called&quot;Held-for-Trading&quot;for non-dealers that is essentially accounted for
like securities dealers previously had to account for trading portfolios. 

 Changes in IAS 39 also increase some
differences that diverge from the infamous FAS 133 in the United States. Unlike FAS 133, IAS 39 requires that proceeds from debt issued with an equity
conversion option be bifurcated into the portion of the proceeds applicable to
the value of the debt without the option and the value of the option assuming
the two values are independent and additive to the total proceeds amount. The value assigned to debt must be carried at all times at current value (except
when designated as hold-to maturity) whereas the value assigned to the
conversion option must be carried at historical cost in the equity section of
the balance sheet. Only that value apportioned to debt is subject to fair
value or cash flow hedge accounting when hedged with a derivative financial
instrument. The value apportioned to the conversion option is not subject
to hedge accounting treatment even though it can be economically hedged. Other differences also arise, particularly in the areas of impairment and
derecognition of hedges receiving hedge accounting privileges. Implementation of IAS 39 gets really complicated. 

 A summary of key debt versus equity
classification issues can be found at http://www.pwc.com/ch/eng/about/svcs/abas/ifrs-ias/download/pwc_IFRS_News_Switzerland_0203.pdf   

 A IASB summary of IAS 32 and IAS 39
changes is provided at http://www.iasc.org.uk/cmt/0001.asp?s=449624&amp;sc={F9A603BD-24E1-49B7-A56C-697225A29793}&amp;n=4236   
 In March 2003 the IASB
 began its deliberations, in open Board meetings, of the issues raised on the
 Exposure Draft, keeping in view the insights obtained from the consultation
 process. It discussed the issues raised by constituents at every meeting
 between March and October 2003. In total, the Board considered 61 agenda
 papers dealing with issues raised on the exposure draft, amounting to over
 1200 pages.

The Board has agreed many changes to the proposals set out in the Exposure
 Draft. In particular:
 
 For IAS 39,
 the Exposure Draft proposed 15 main changes. The Board confirmed only six
 of these as proposed, it has added extra guidance or clarified a further
 six and it has changed three of its proposals (on derecognition, basis
 adjustment and reversals of impairment on available for sale assets). It
 has also made a further seven changes in response to comments received.

 For IAS 32,
 the ED proposed 21 main changes (many on disclosure). The Board has
 confirmed 17 of these proposals, rejected one (on using past practice to
 classify certain derivatives on own shares as either equity or
 liabilities), and added more guidance on three others. It also made six
 new changes, primarily adding guidance or disclosure requirements. 
 There was one issue that
 emerged from the consultation process for which the Board decided a further
 exposure draft was required. The issue was using fair value hedge accounting
 for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk (sometimes referred to as macro
 hedging). The Board issued a further exposure draft on this one aspect of
 IAS 39 in August 2003, with a comment deadline of 14 November. However,
 in order to help those companies preparing to adopt the revised IAS 32
 and IAS 39 in 2005, the Board decided not to delay the finalisation of
 the rest of the Standards for this one issue. Accordingly, the Board is
 issuing now the revised Standards, except for any changes that it might make
 for macro hedging. Any further amendments to IAS 39 for macro hedging
 will be issued early next year.

 brief introduction summarises and comments on the requirements of IAS 32
 and IAS 39, and the background to them. It is not intended to be
 as comprehensive or precise as the standards themselves, and is not a
 substitute for them. 
 

 What are IAS 32 and 39 all about? 

IAS 32 deals with the disclosure of financial instruments, and
 with some aspects of their presentation in financial statements (ie
 when instruments are presented as liability or equity and the information to
 be given in the notes).

IAS 39 deals with the measurement of financial instruments and
 with their recognition (ie when they should be included in financial
 statements and how they should be valued).

 Why do we need standards on financial instruments? 

Financial instruments are a large part of the assets and liabilities of
 virtually every company, especially financial institutions. They also play a
 central role in the efficient operation of financial markets.

Financial instruments, including derivatives, can be useful tools for managing
 risk, but they can also be very risky themselves. In recent years there have
 been many disasters associated with derivatives and other financial
 instruments.

The standards require companies to disclose their exposure to financial
 instruments and to account for their effects in most cases as they happen,
 rather than allowing problems to be hidden away.

 What companies do the standards apply to? 

The standards apply to all companies reporting under international reporting
 standards (IFRSs).

 What financial instruments do the standards apply to? 

Broadly, the standards apply to all financial instruments except:
 
 those covered by
 another more specific standard such as interests in subsidiaries,
 associates and joint ventures, and post-employment benefits (eg pensions);
 insurance
 contracts, and certain contracts that are similar in nature to insurance
 contracts; and
 most loan
 commitments.
 
 The standards also apply
 to contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (such as commodity contracts)
 where these are not for the entitys own purchase, sale or usage
 requirements, but for dealing purposes.

 What are the main requirements of IAS 32? 

 Disclosure 

IAS 32 requires disclosure of information to increase users
 understanding of why financial instruments are used by businesses and the
 associated risks. This includes information on: 
 the risks
 associated with the entitys financial instruments
 managements
 policies for controlling those risks
 the accounting
 policies applied to the instruments
 the nature and
 extent of an entitys use of financial instruments
 the business
 purposes they serve
 
 Presentation by
 the issuer debt or equity 

IAS 32 adopts definitions of liabilities and equity based on the Framework
 for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements , which
 contains the governing principles that guide the IASB in its work. It is
 similar to the frameworks used by many national standard-setters. 
 A financial
 instrument is a liability if it is a contractual obligation to deliver
 cash or other financial assets. The finance cost of liabilities is
 accounted for as an expense.
 A financial
 instrument is equity if it evidences a residual interest in the assets of
 an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Payments on equity are
 treated as distributions, not as expenses.
 Convertible
 debt (that gives the holder a choice of repayment in cash or in shares) is
 separated into its debt and equity components. More specifically, it is
 analysed into an issue of ordinary debt at a discount, and a credit to
 equity for the conversion right. 
 
 As well as ordinary
 debt, liabilities include mandatorily redeemable shares, such as units of a
 mutual fund and some preferred shares, because they contain an obligation to
 pay cash. The Board has worked with the mutual fund industry to develop an
 acceptable presentation for them that highlights the net assets available for
 unitholders.

 Offsetting 

A financial asset and a financial liability shall be offset and the net amount
 reported in the balance sheet when, and only when, an entity both:
 
 has a current
 right to set off the recognised amounts; and
 intends either to
 settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability
 simultaneously. 
 Situations that
 generally do not qualify for offsetting include master netting agreements,
 where there is no intention to settle net, and so-called in-substance
 defeasance arrangements where assets are set aside to meet a liability but
 the entity remains primarily liable.

 What are the main requirements of IAS 39? 

 Measurement 

IAS 39 divides financial assets and financial liabilities into five
 classes with three different accounting treatments, as follows: 
 Trading assets and
 liabilities, including all derivatives that are not hedges, are measured
 at fair value through profit or loss all gains and losses are
 recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
 Loans and
 receivables are ordinarily accounted for at amortised cost, as are most
 liabilities.
 Held-to-maturity
 investments are also accounted for at amortised cost.
 All other
 financial assets are ordinarily classified as available-for-sale and
 measured at fair value, with all gains and losses taken to equity. On
 disposal, gains and losses previously taken to equity are recycled to
 profit or loss.
 There is an option
 to account for any financial asset or liability at fair value through
 profit or loss.
 
 There are special rules
 for hedge accounting, described later.

Another aspect of measurement is impairment - ie, when and how losses
 should be recognised in profit or loss on those assets that are not accounted
 for at fair value through profit or loss. Whenever there is objective evidence
 of impairment as a result of a past event, impairment should be recognised.
 Among other things, the standard clarifies that:
 
 impairment should
 take into account only losses that have already been incurred, and not
 those that might happen in future;
 impairment losses
 on available-for-sale assets are taken from equity and recognised in
 profit or loss. For equity investments, objective evidence of impairment
 may include significant adverse changes in the issuers market position,
 or a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment.
 
 The mixed measurement
 model used in IAS 39 has been criticised for its complexity, and for the
 volatility that it can introduce. However, most countries already have a mixed
 measurement basis notably for trading assets, which are widely measured at
 fair value through profit or loss. Thus, IAS 39 has not created a mixed
 measurement model. It has only refined it.

The alternative would have been to measure all financial assets and
 liabilities on the same basis either cost or fair value. Cost was rejected
 because: 
 Most agree that
 trading assets and liabilities should be measured at fair value.
 Fair value is the
 only measurement basis that can capture the risky nature of derivatives.
 This information is essential to communicate to investors the nature of
 the rights and obligations inherent in them. Fair value makes the
 derivatives visible, so that problems are not hidden away. 
 Many users support requiring all financial assets and
 liabilities to be measured at fair value, but this was judged to be too big a
 change to make at the present time.

To the extent that volatility is due to assets and liabilities being measured
 on different bases, it can largely be mitigated either by using the option to
 account for any financial asset or liability at fair value, or by hedge
 accounting.

Loxsom 
 
 Dear Members of the
 Trinity Community, 

 I would like to
 invite you, your students, your family, and your friends to join me in Laurie
 Auditorium at 7:30 PM on Monday, January 26, for Memory And Reality , a public lecture by Dr. Marcia Johnson, a Yale University Psychologist . Johnson&apos;s lab at Yale University has pioneered the systematic study of the
 mechanisms of memory distortion. Recently, her lab has used neuroimaging to
 identify brain regions associated with monitoring the origin of information,
 and to identify areas showing dysfunction in memory processes. Her lecture
 will describe theoretical ideas and empirical findings that help us understand
 both accurate and distorted memory. Professor Johnson will be introduced by an
 undergraduate student, Brett Munjas. The lecture will be followed by a Q&amp;A
 session. 

 In addition to this
 public lecture, Marcia Johnson will participate in two other events worthy of
 your attention: 
 
 An informal
 reception for Trinity Faculty and Students, Marrs McLean Lobby, 3:30 - 4:00
 pm. 

 Psychology
 Colloquium, Identifying Neural Correlates of Component Process of
 Cognition. SLH, 4:00 pm. 
 
 Professor Johnson is
 visiting Trinity as part of Trinitys Distinguished Scientists Lecture
 Series for 2003-04. All events are free and open to the public. I hope to you
 are able to join us and to welcome Dr. Johnson to Trinity University. 
 
 Note from Bob
Jensen
 Dr. Johnson shares much of her research online at http://memlab1.eng.yale.edu/mkj.html   

 I was especially intrigued by the
following paper:
Mather, M.,&amp;Johnson, M.K. (2003). Affective review and schema reliance in
memory in older and younger adults. American Journal of Psychology , 116,

 Psychologists
offer proof of brain&apos;s ability to suppress memories 
For the first time, researchers at Stanford and the University of Oregon have
shown that a biological mechanism exists in the human brain to block unwanted
memories. The findings, published January 9 in the journal Science ,
reinforce Sigmund Freud&apos;s controversial century-old thesis about the existence
of voluntary memory suppression. 
 
 And what about the
long-term impact of messing with the brain&apos;s natural sleep processes? 

 &quot;&quot;I Can&apos;t Sleep&quot;Insomnia and other sleep disorders are wreaking havoc on our health and taxing
the economy. Drug companies see an opportunity,&quot;Arlene Weintraub, Business
Week Cover Story, January 26, 2004 --- http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_04/b3867001_mz001.htm   
 
 Many Mysteries  

 To forge better
 remedies for sleep disorders, scientists have had to struggle with some
 fundamental mysteries. We spend a third of our lives in bed, yet no one has
 been able to explain the necessity, and bona fide scientific studies are
 barely a few decades old. We have learned, for example, that the need for
 sleep varies greatly by species and is related to physical size: Opossums
 snooze for 18 hours a day, while elephants need just three hours. Even where
 sleep is inconvenient or dangerous, evolution provides work-arounds. Dolphins,
 for example, shutter only half of their brains at a time, remaining half-awake
 when they sleep. 

 By dragging humans
 into sleep labs and hooking them up to monitors, scientists have made a
 handful of discoveries about what the body does when it&apos;s asleep. During the
 deepest phases of slumber, growth hormone is released, facilitating cell
 repair and energy restoration. And much has been observed about REM (rapid eye
 movement) sleep, when our eyes dart frantically beneath our eyelids and we
 dream vividly of talking petunias and killer clams. Many scientists believe
 REM and non-REM sleep work together to consolidate memories and experiences
 and burn them permanently into our brain&apos;s hard drive. That could explain why
 some people wake up and suddenly have a solution to a problem that seemed
 insurmountable the day before. But the connection to sleep is still unclear. 

 The consequences of
 sleeplessness are much better understood. Deprivation messes up the body&apos;s
 metabolism, putting insomniacs at risk for a host of diseases. In a 1999 study
 at the University of Chicago, healthy men who slept just four hours a night
 for six nights suffered a 30% shortfall in their ability to secrete and
 respond to insulin -- the hormone that regulates blood sugar. That large a
 drop can be an early warning of diabetes. 

 Blithering Idiots  

 More recent studies
 at the University of Chicago demonstrate a possible link between sleeplessness
 and obesity. Preliminary results show that study participants who were allowed
 just four hours of sleep a night for two nights suffered a 20% drop in leptin,
 a hormone that controls body weight. At the same time, their stomachs produced
 20% more ghrelin, a hormone that makes people feel hungry. Sleep-deprived
 subjects craved high-fat, very sweet foods, and&quot;their appetites
 increased beyond the extra calories they needed to stay awake,&quot;says Eve
 Van Cauter, a professor at the University of Chica- go&apos;s medical school and
 the director of many sleep studies. 

 Taken to extremes,
 sleep loss can reduce us, at least temporarily, to blithering idiots. In two
 studies at the University of Pennsylvania, 48 healthy adults were split into
 several groups that slept four, six, or eight hours a night for two weeks. All
 the participants performed tasks that tested their motor skills and memory. By
 day 14, the four-hour group made an average of 14 times as many errors as they
 did when they took the tests fully rested. The eight-hour sleepers performed
 the tasks consistently well -- and actually got better at them each day. And
 the six-hour sleepers, corresponding to the corporate everyman, may as well
 have been thoroughly sleep-starved. They scored 11 times as many errors as
 they normally would make -- about as bad as a test group that stayed awake for
 two straight days. 

 But what about the
 superhumans we all seem to know -- the co-worker who intentionally gets five
 hours of sleep a night yet outperforms everyone else? Sleep experts say basic
 biology eventually catches up with these deliberate sleep cheaters.&quot;We
 have no evidence that CEOs, astronauts, or doctors are exempt from the
 dangers,&quot;says David F. Dinges, chief of the division of sleep and
 chronobiology at Penn&apos;s school of medicine. 

 Whether people are
 cheating on sleep or succumbing to insomnia, the perils are the same. Studies
 show that someone who has been awake for 24 hours has the same mental acuity
 as a person with a blood-alcohol level of 0.1, which is above the legal limit
 for driving in most states. That means an executive who is up all night
 worrying about the quarterly earnings report -- or worse, a hospital resident
 who takes over in a late-night emergency -- is about as sharp as a light
 drinker who suddenly downs four margaritas. No wonder drowsy drivers cause
 70,000 injury crashes per year, of which 1,550 are fatal. 

 Continued in the article 
 
 The controversial conclusion is as
follows: 
 
 The scenario of
 whole societies popping insomnia and wake-up pills as if they were aspirin
 raises disturbing questions. Are drugmakers so intent on seeding an insomnia
 market that they have grown insensitive to the hype their marketing campaigns
 may fuel? And what about the long-term impact
 of messing with the brain&apos;s natural sleep processes? Unknown. Until drugmakers can point to long-term safety data, physicians,
 patients, and regulators can be forgiven for harboring reservations.&quot;Hormone replacement therapy stopped hot flashes, but look what
 happened,&quot;says UCLA&apos;s Siegel, referring to reports that surfaced last
 year showing the popular menopause treatment increases women&apos;s risk of breast
 cancer.&quot;We have to prove it&apos;s healthy to take sleeping pills.&quot; 

 For millions of
 sleepless sufferers, effective remedies can&apos;t come soon enough. Insomniac
 Richard Evans, who runs a business in Raleigh, N.C., that creates indexes of
 technical books, has endured stretches when he sleeps no more than an hour a
 night. He picks fights with his wife, and once lost a longtime client after a
 petty argument he&apos;s sure would never have happened if he had rested. One
 evening, after five sleepless nights in a row, he stared at the .44 revolver
 in his nightstand drawer and contemplated suicide.&quot;I looked forward and
 saw a black abyss,&quot;he says. Evans, 57, has found some relief in
 testosterone injections -- a relatively new form of therapy. It&apos;s not a
 lifelong solution, but for the first time in a decade, he says,&quot;I&apos;m now
 sleeping.&quot;Those insomniacs still left behind may someday also discover
 that a good night&apos;s rest is much more than a dream. 
 
 

 &quot;Insomnia&apos;s
Wake-Up Call :  Alert investors have their eyes on
Sepracor and Neurocrine as they bring out new drugs that battle sleeplessness --
and Sanofi&apos;s Ambien,&quot;by Amy Tsao, Business Week , January 22, 2004
---  http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2004/tc20040122_2452_tc055.htm 
 
 
 One of the most
 successful and fastest-growing drugs of these sleep-deprived times is Ambien.
 The prescription sleeping pill, made by French drug maker Sanofi-Sythelabo ( SNY ), generated $1.65 billion in worldwide sales in 2003, analysts estimate, and
 dominates the insomnia market. Soon, however, Ambien will be competitors. Two
 companies - Sepracor ( SEPR ) and Neurocrine Biosciences ( NBIX ) - have set on introducing products that could oust Ambien from its top
 spot (see BW Cover Story, 1/26/04, &quot;I
 Can&apos;t Sleep&quot; ). 

 Backed by expensive
 marketing campaigns, new drugs with fewer side effects are set to fire up
 growth in the insomnia drug market - to as much as $5 billion in sales in
 2010, by some estimates.&quot;The market is growing 25% a year,&quot;says
 Neurocrine CEO Gary Lyons.&quot;We believe sleep is today where depression
 was 20 years ago,&quot;he adds, referring to another area where treatment and
 awareness soared as drugs like Prozac emerged. 

 &quot;The prevalence
 of insomnia is massively large,&quot;says Sepracor CFO David Southwell. Sleep
 experts figure some 82 million Americans over the age of 15 have insomnia, and
 the prospect of effective prescription drugs that don&apos;t lead to the
 nightmarish dependencies associated with sleeping pills of the past is
 appealing. 
 
 Year 2004 Top 10
Scams, Schemes&amp;Scandals 

 Organized in 1919, the North American
Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) is the oldest international
organization devoted to investor protection. We are a voluntary association
whose membership consists of 66 state, provincial, and territorial securities
administrators in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada,
and Mexico. In the United States, NASAA is the voice of the 50 state securities
agencies responsible for efficient capital formation and grass-roots investor
protection. 
 
 State Securities Regulators
 Release Top 10 Scams, Schemes&amp;Scandals:
 Mutual Fund Practices, Senior Investment Fraud, Variable Annuities Join
 2004 List

WASHINGTON (January 14, 2004) State securities regulators today forecast
 that investors will be challenged with increasingly complex and confusing
 investment frauds and identified the Top 10 schemes investors are likely to
 see in 2004. New to the North American Securities Administrators
 Associations (NASAA) annual survey of state securities enforcement
 officials are mutual fund practices, senior investment fraud, and variable
 annuities.

Investors face a complex maze of scams, schemes and scandals, said Ralph
 A. Lambiase, NASAAs president and director of the Connecticut Division of
 Securities. Our fight against fraud never stops because each year con
 artists discover new ways to fleece the public. Sadly, many of the age-old
 scams still work to cheat victims of their hard-earned savings as well. It
 pays to remember that if an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true,
 it usually is.

Investors lose billions of dollars annually to investment fraud, Lambiase
 said. He cautioned that investors must remain vigilant in the fight against
 investment fraud. All securities regulators, whether local, state, or
 federal, share the common goal of protecting investors, he said. I urge
 legislators to help us continue to do our jobs by ensuring that regulators
 have sufficient resources to protect our citizens.

The following ranking of NASAAs Top 10 scams, schemes and scandals for 2004
 is based on the order of prevalence and seriousness as identified by state
 securities regulators: 1) Ponzi Schemes, 2) Senior Investment Fraud, 3)
 Promissory Notes, 4) Unscrupulous Broker/Dealer Representatives, 5) Affinity
 Fraud, 6) Insurance Agent Securities Fraud, 7) Prime Bank/High-Yield
 Investment Schemes, 8) Internet Fraud, 9) Mutual Fund Business Practices, 10)
 Variable Annuities.

Lambiase also announced that NASAA has created an interactive Fraud Center on
 its website .
 The center features details of NASAAs Top 10 scams, schemes and scandals;
 tips on how to detect con artists and avoid becoming a victim; an Investor
 Bill of Rights; instructions on how to file an investment-related
 complaint; and contact information for each state securities regulator.
 Education and awareness are an investors best defense against fraud,
 Lambiase said.


 NASAAs 2004 Top 10 List of Scams, Schemes and Scandals 
(based on a survey of state securities enforcement officers and regulators)

1. PONZI SCHEMES . Named for swindler Charles Ponzi, who in the early
 1900s took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns, these
 schemes are a perennial favorite among con artists. The premise is simple:
 promise high returns to investors and use money from new investors to pay
 previous investors. Inevitably, the schemes collapse and the only people who
 consistently make money are the promoters who set the Ponzi in motion. Con
 artists typically attribute government intervention as the reason why new
 investors didnt get their promised returns. In Mississippi last year, a
 Tennessee attorney and a Mississippi securities dealer pled guilty to 58
 counts of investment fraud for their role in a Ponzi scheme that bilked 41
 investors from four states out of $10.2 million. Authorities said the victims
 were told they were investing in a money-trading program that, in fact, did
 not exist.

2. SENIOR INVESTMENT FRAUD . Volatile stock markets, low interest rates,
 rising health care costs, and increasing life expectancy, combined to create a
 perfect storm for investment fraud against senior investors. State securities
 regulators said older investors are being targeted with increasingly complex
 investment scams involving unregistered securities, promissory notes,
 charitable gift annuities, viatical settlements, and Ponzi schemes all
 promising inflated returns. Pennsylvania securities regulators last year shut
 down a Ponzi scheme that targeted seniors, but not before 13
 Philadelphia-area investors had lost nearly $2 million from their pensions and
 IRAs. In Arizona, the Arizona Corporation Commission ordered a Scottsdale
 company and four individuals to return more than $15 million to mostly senior
 investors and pay penalties of $45,000 to the state in a case involving CD
 alternatives earning up to 8.5 percent. These schemes offer products and
 pitches that may sound tempting to many seniors whove seen their retirement
 accounts and income dwindle in recent years, Lambiase said. To learn more,
 visit NASAAs Senior
 Investor Resource Center .

3. PROMISSORY NOTES . A long-time member of the Top 10 list, these
 short-term debt instruments often are sold by independent insurance agents and
 issued by little known or non-existent companies promising high returns 
 upwards of 15 percent monthly with little or no risk. When interest rates
 are low, investors often are lured by the higher, fixed returns that
 promissory notes offer. These notes, however, can become vehicles for fraud
 when the issuer of the note has no intention or capability of ever delivering
 the returns promised by the sales person. In November 2003, for example,
 Grammy-nominated polka star Jan Lewan pled guilty to charges that he defrauded
 investors in 21 states through the sale of promissory notes. State authorities
 said Lewan, who defected from Poland in 1979 and launched a successful career
 that included performances before President Reagan and Pope John Paul II,
 illegally persuaded investors to invest in a series of failing business
 ventures. Lewan offered promissory notes that were supposed to pay an interest
 rate of 12 to 20 percent. Authorities said investors lost between $2 million
 and $2.5 million. Lewan sold the promissory notes during a period of time when
 he was under a five-year ban by the Pennsylvania Securities Commission barring
 him from selling securities in the state. New Jersey authorities also acted
 against Lewan in 2003, fining him $950,000 and prohibiting him from selling
 securities in the state. Connecticut securities regulators are also
 investigating Lewan.

4. UNSCRUPULOUS BROKERS . Despite the stock markets rebound in 2003,
 state securities regulators say they are still receiving a high level of
 complaints from investors of brokers cutting corners or resorting to outright
 fraud to fatten their wallets. I give credit to the increasing numbers of
 investors who are giving their brokerage statements a closer look and asking
 the right questions about unexplained fees, unauthorized trades or other
 irregularities, Lambiase said. In October 2003, US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
 agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle a complaint by the state of Montana
 alleging unethical business practices and fraudulent securities dealing by the
 investment firm and one of its brokers. State regulators accused Thomas J.
 O`Neill, who was a broker in the firms Butte office, of making more than
 6,000 unauthorized trades for mostly elderly customers between 1997 and early
 2001. They said some trades were made for a customer who was in a coma and
 again after he died. Authorities said O`Neill generated commissions for
 himself and the firm through the illegal trades that transformed mostly
 conservative retirement investments into risky portfolios.

5. AFFINITY FRAUD . Con artists know that its only human nature to trust
 people who are like yourself. Thats why scammers often use their victims
 religious or ethnic identity to gain their trust and then steal their life
 savings. No group seems to be immune from fraud. In November 2003, authorities
 arrested five people accused of defrauding evangelical Christians of $160
 million in three years and using the money to live extravagantly. Federal and
 state investigators charged that a California family promoted an affinity
 fraud scheme through evangelical leaders and groups, targeting people who
 shared religious beliefs and common ethnicities. A joint effort involving the
 FBI, the SEC, the IRS and the Texas State Securities Board, brought criminal
 and civil charges to halt the scheme, which promised returns of 25 percent
 within three months.

6. INSURANCE AGENTS AND OTHER UNLICENSED SECURITIES SELLERS . While most
 independent insurance agents are honest professionals, too many are lured by
 high commissions into selling fraudulent or high-risk investments, such as
 promissory notes, ATM and payphone investment contracts and viatical
 settlements. Scam artists continue to entice independent insurance agents
 into selling investments they may know little about, Lambiase said. The
 person running the scam instructs the independent sales force usually
 insurance agents but sometimes investment advisers and accountants to
 promise high returns with little or no risk. For example: Arizona securities
 regulators in 2003 obtained a $4.3 million final judgment against a Scottsdale
 company and two insurance agents who fraudulently sold charitable gift
 annuities to mostly senior investors who were told their money would be
 invested in secure accounts. Instead it was placed in high-risk, speculative
 investments while the insurance agents helped themselves to $1.3 million in
 commissions. California authorities in 2003 ordered several insurance agents
 to stop selling viatical investments interests in the death benefits of
 terminally ill patients that are always high risk and sometimes fraudulent.
 The agents promised returns as high as 150 percent in three years, and
 guaranteed the investment through a fidelity bond, but failed to tell
 investors that the bond was issued by a company incorporated in Vanuatu, South
 Pacific that is not licensed by to issue bonds in California.

7. PRIME BANK SCHEMES . A perennial favorite of con artists who promise
 investors triple-digit returns through access to the investment portfolios of
 the worlds elite banks. The negative publicity attached to these schemes
 has caused promoters in recent cases to avoid explicitly referring to Prime
 Banks. Now it is common to avoid the term altogether and underplay the role of
 banks by referring to these schemes as risk free guaranteed high yield
 instruments or something equally deceptive. In 2003, five Oklahoma men were
 convicted on fraud charges stemming from a prime bank scheme in which 5,000
 investors lost $14.6 million.

8. INTERNET FRAUD . With the Internet becoming a common part of daily
 life for increasing numbers of people, it should be no surprise that con
 artists have made cyberspace a prime hunting ground for victims. Internet
 fraud has become a booming business. The most recent figures show
 cyberfraudsters took in $122 million in 2002, according to the Federal Trade
 Commission. The Internet has turned from an information superhighway to a
 road of ruin for victims of cyber fraud, Lambiase said. The Internet has
 made it simple for a con artist to reach millions of potential victims at
 minimal cost. Many of the online scams regulators see today are merely new
 versions of schemes that have been fleecing offline investors for years. In
 November 2003 various federal, state, local, and foreign law-enforcement
 agencies targeted cyberfraudsters and netted 125 arrests and more than 70
 indictments. Operation Cyber Sweep identified more than 125,000 victims with
 losses estimated to exceed $100 million. Lambiase also warned investors to
 ignore e-mail offers from individuals representing themselves as Nigerian or
 West African government or business officials in need of help to deposit large
 sums of money in overseas bank accounts. Dont be dot.conned. If you get
 an e-mail pitching a deal that cant be beat, hit delete, Lambiase
 cautioned.

9. MUTUAL FUND BUSINESS PRACTICES . Although mutual funds play a
 tremendous role in the wealth and savings of our nation, ongoing scandals
 throughout the industry clearly demonstrate that some in the mutual fund
 industry are putting their own interests ahead of Americas 95 million
 mutual fund shareholders. State securities regulators, the SEC, NASD, and
 mutual-fund firms themselves have launched a series of inquiries into mutual
 fund trading practices. To date, more than a dozen mutual funds are under
 investigation and several mutual funds and mutual fund employees have either
 pleaded guilty, been charged or settled with state regulators. State and
 federal investigations have uncovered sales contests where investors have been
 steered to funds paying higher commissions to brokers; abusive trading
 practices, such as market timing, that may cost tradition buy-and-hold
 investors more than $5 billion each year; and illegal trading practices, such
 as late trading, that may cost investors $400 million each year.
 These investigations demonstrate a fundamental unfairness and a betrayal of
 trust that hurts Main Street investors while creating special opportunities
 for certain privileged mutual fund shareholders and insiders, Lambiase
 said. We will continue to actively pursue inquiries into mutual fund
 improprieties and are committed to aggressively addressing mutual fund
 complaints raised by investors in our jurisdictions.

10. VARIABLE ANNUITIES . Sales of variable annuities have increased
 dramatically over the past decade. As sales have risen, so too have complaints
 from investors. Regulators are concerned that investors arent being told
 about high surrender charges and the steep sales commissions agents often earn
 when they move investors into variable annuities. Some investors also are
 misled with claims of guaranteed returns when variable annuity returns
 actually are vulnerable to the volatility of the stock market. The benefits of
 variable annuities tax-deferral, death benefits among others come with
 strings attached and additional costs. High commissions often are the driving
 force for sales of variable annuities. Mississippi securities regulators moved
 last year against a licensed securities broker in the state who rang up
 commissions of approximately $1 million within a 15-month period largely
 through sales of variable annuities. Often pitched to seniors through
 investment seminars, regulators say these products are unsuitable for many
 retirees. Variable annuities make sense only for consumers willing to
 invest for 10 years or longer, but they are not suitable for many retirees who
 cannot afford to lock up their money for a long time, Lambiase said.
 Variable annuities are considered to be securities under federal law and the
 laws of 17 jurisdictions. Most states consider variable annuities to be
 insurance products. NASAA is encouraging changes in state laws that would
 allow state insurance regulators to continue to oversee the insurance
 companies that sell variable annuities while authorizing state securities
 regulators to investigate complaints about variable annuities and to take
 action against the companies and individuals who sell them. Those who buy
 variable annuities should not be denied the protections enjoyed by every other
 class of investor, Lambiase said.

 Question
What were the two leading causes of financial report restatements in 2003? 

 Answer:  

 Rank 1: Errors in accounting
 for reserves and contingencies Rank 2: Revenue recognition 

 
&quot;Upward Trend in Financial Restatements Ends After Five Record Setting
Years; Reserve Accounting Leading Cause of Restatements,&quot;The Huron
Consulting Group, January 13, 2004 --- http://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/general01.asp?id=539&amp;relatedResourceID=515   
 
 Related Information Resource Library
 Restatement Study 2003 

 Huron Consulting
 Group today released a summary of its 2003 Annual Review of Financial
 Reporting Matters, a report analyzing the leading causes and trends in
 financial restatements filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC) for the year ending December 31, 2003. The analysis is broken down by
 company size, industry, and accounting issue and also notes whether the
 accounting error was initially reported in either a quarterly or an annual
 financial statement. 

 Public companies that
 changed their previously released financial statements due to accounting
 errors totaled 323 in 2003, a slight decline compared to the 330 restatement
 filings identified in 2002, and up from 270 in 2001 and 233 in 2000. These
 restatements have been filed in both amended quarterly (10Q/A) and annual
 (10K/A) financial statements filed with the SEC. (Graph 1) 

 The number of
 accounting errors identified in 2003, though certainly not a cause for
 celebration, may indicate that we have put the worst restatement period behind
 us and can expect to see further improvements in the years ahead, said
 Joseph J. Floyd, chief operating officer for Hurons Financial and Economic
 Consulting practice. 

 As we have
 observed in prior years, problems applying accounting rules, human and system
 errors, and fraudulent behavior are the three primary causes for accounting
 errors, added Floyd. 

 In 2003, the number
 of restated audited annual financial statements rose to a record high of 206,
 representing 63 percent of total restatements filed during the year. While
 investors rely on both quarterly and annual financial statements of public
 companies, there is a different level of procedures and responsibility assumed
 by the auditors for each. Annual financials have a higher level of effort and
 association required since an audit opinion is rendered. (Graph 2) 

 Errors in accounting
 for reserves and contingencies was the leading cause of restatements in 2003.
 This category includes accounting errors related to accounts receivable and
 inventory reserves, restructuring reserves, accruals, and other loss
 contingencies. Restatements attributable to this category experienced a
 greater increase in 2003 than any other accounting issue. (Graph 3) 

 Reserves and
 contingencies may be among the most judgmental accounts in a companys
 financial statements as they are subject to an estimation process. These
 restatements, however, do not simply reflect changes in estimates, but rather
 reflect flawed judgments due to the oversight or misuse of facts, fraud, or a
 misapplication of Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP). 

 Revenue recognition
 was the second leading cause of restatements in 2003. However, the 63 revenue
 recognition related restatements identified in 2003 represent a 26 percent
 decrease from 2002 when revenue recognition restatements reached an all time
 high. (Graph 4) 

 The number of 2003
 restatements by companies with annual revenues under $100 million rose to 158,
 or 49 percent of all restatements filed during the year. The percentage of
 restatements filed by companies with annual revenues greater than $1 billion
 decreased slightly in 2003, from 22 percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2003.
 (Graph 5) 

 Sarbanes-Oxley and
 recent catastrophic restatements have resulted in major changes in our
 financial reporting world, Floyd said. Increased internal and external
 scrutiny plus shareholder demands are working to improve the financial
 reporting process. 

 In addition, this
 year Huron Consulting Groups full report will summarize the major events
 impacting the financial reporting world in 2003 including actions taken by the
 SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), Financial Accounting
 Standards Board (FASB) and major observations regarding the public accounting
 industry. The full report will be available in early February.

 ******************* 
Stock dividends are paid in common shares, and can be used to pay shareholders
 instead of a cash dividend. For example, if you own 100 shares of a company
 that declared a 1% stock dividend, you will receive one more share of stock
 from the company&apos;s reserve of shares. 

 If a company needs to
 tighten its fiscal belt, it may decide to declare a stock dividend rather than
 a cash dividend. A stock dividend will conserve cash while still allowing
 shareholders to benefit from the firm&apos;s earnings. 
******************* 
 
 My opinion of a stock dividend has
nearly always been negative. I can&apos;t conceive of any situation where
shareholders in a privately-held company would benefit from a stock dividend in
any way and most certainly shareholders are not benefiting&quot;from the firm&apos;s
earnings.&quot; What is happening in fact is that shareholders are legally
being screwed by a stock dividend in a privately-held company. 

 For a corporation having shares traded
by the public, the only possible benefit arises in the unlikely event of market
pricing inefficiency. If current earnings are posted to retained earnings
then the company has the legal right (not necessarily the cash) to declare
dividends up to the current balance in retained earnings. By declaring a
stock dividend, all that really happens is that retained earnings get
reclassified as permanent capital which is no longer legally available for cash
dividend distribution. Stockholders may or may not benefit from a market
price shift, but in a sense the company has legally screwed the shareholders by
reducing the amount that can be legally declared as a cash dividend. Hence, I do not agree with Prudential that&quot;shareholders will benefit from
the firm&apos;s earnings.&quot; The only benefit to shareholders is the remote
(I contend highly remote) possibility that the stock market is inefficient in
factoring the stock dividend into lowered share prices. If that unlikely
event arises, the shareholder still has not&quot;benefited from the firm&apos;s
earnings.&quot; The shareholder at best will only benefit from market
pricing inefficiency in the highly remote possibility that the market is
inefficient for a given stock dividend. 

 If investors could consistently rely
upon market inefficiency from stock dividends, we would all be rich. But
where would we find buyers dumb enough to overvalue our shares after a stock
dividend? Give me the cash or give me nothing at all. Don&apos;t try to
tell me I&apos;m getting something when you hand me nothing, which is what a stock
dividend is rather than a cash dividend.

 &quot;The Porn Factor,&quot;by Pamela

 A
 WHOLE LOT OF PORN GOING ON 

 
 As
 of July 2003, there were 260 million pages of pornography online, an
 increase of 1800% since 1998. Porn amounts to about 7% of the 3.3
 billion Web pages indexed by Google
 
 
 Internet
 users who access adult websites spend an average of 73 min. per month
 there, but that doesn&apos;t include time spent on amateur porn sites
 
 
 Americans
 rent upwards of 800 million pornographic videos and DVDs a year, compared
 with 3.6 billion nonpornographic videos. Nearly 1 in 5 rentals is a
 porn flick

 Because
 children learn sexual cues early, boys may train themselves to respond only to
 images shaped by porn stars, while girls may learn that submission and
 Brazilian bikini waxes are the keys to pleasing men. Recent studies show
 a correlation between increased aggressiveness in boys and exposure to
 pornography, and a link between childhood use of porn and sexually abusive
 behavior in adulthood. &quot;It&apos;s not easy to shock me,&quot;says
 Judith Coch, a therapist in Philadelphia who has been in practice for 25
 years. &quot;But one 11-year-old girl&apos;s parents discovered their
 daughter creating her own pornographic website because it&apos;s &apos;cool&apos; among her
 friends.&quot; As such incidents multiply, more Americans--parents
 especially--may come to Chandler&apos;s conclusion: We have to turn off the porn.

 The house at 1212 1/2 West Front Street in
 Plainfield, N.J., is a conventional midcentury home with slate-gray siding,
 white trim and Victorian lines. When I stood in front of it on a breezy day in
 October, I could hear the cries of children from the playground of an
 elementary school around the corner. American flags fluttered from porches and
 windows. The neighborhood is a leafy, middle-class Anytown. The house is set
 back off the street, near two convenience stores and a gift shop. On the door
 of Superior Supermarket was pasted a sign issued by the Plainfield police:
 &apos;&apos;Safe neighborhoods save lives.&apos;&apos; The store&apos;s manager, who refused to tell me
 his name, said he never noticed anything unusual about the house, and never
 heard anything. But David Miranda, the young man behind the counter of
 Westside Convenience, told me he saw girls from the house roughly once a week.
 &apos;&apos;They came in to buy candy and soda, then went back to the house,&apos;&apos; he said.
 The same girls rarely came twice, and they were all very young, Miranda said.
 They never asked for anything beyond what they were purchasing; they certainly
 never asked for help. Cars drove up to the house all day; nice cars, all kinds
 of cars. Dozens of men came and went. &apos;&apos;But no one here knew what was really
 going on,&apos;&apos; Miranda said. And no one ever asked.

&quot;The Tyranny of Copyright?&quot;by Robert S. Boynton, New York Times

 Unfortunately for the students, their actions ran
 afoul of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (D.M.C.A.), one of several
 recent laws that regulate intellectual property and are quietly reshaping the
 culture. Designed to protect copyrighted material on the Web, the act makes it
 possible for an Internet service provider to be liable for the material posted
 by its users -- an extraordinary burden that providers of phone service, by
 contrast, do not share. Under the law, if an aggrieved party (Diebold, say)
 threatens to sue an Internet service provider over the content of a
 subscriber&apos;s Web site, the provider can avoid liability simply by removing the
 offending material. Since the mere threat of a lawsuit is usually enough to
 scare most providers into submission, the law effectively gives private
 parties veto power over much of the information published online -- as the
 Swarthmore students would soon learn.

 &quot;FASB Starts Formal Review Of
Cash-Balance Pension Rules,&quot;by Arden Dale, The Wall Street Journal ,
January 22, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107471694800107892,00.html?mod=mkts%5Fmain%5Fnews%5Fhs%5Fh   
 
 Companies with
 controversial retirement plans known as cash-balance pensions are likely to
 see changes down the road in the amount of benefits they owe because of a new
 effort by accounting rule makers. 

 The Financial
 Accounting Standards Board, a private rule maker in Norwalk, Conn., Wednesday
 began a formal review of rules governing the way companies measure
 cash-balance benefits. 

 &quot;The goal is to
 put out final accounting guidance by the end of the 2004 addressing the
 measurement of liabilities for cash-balance pension plans,&quot;said Gerard
 O&apos;Callaghan, a FASB practice fellow.&quot;But before we can get to the issue
 of measuring benefits, we need to refine the definition of cash-balance
 plans.&quot; 

 The effort follows an
 abortive move by the rule maker last spring to require companies with
 cash-balance plans to value benefits using government bonds, rather than the
 high-grade corporate bonds other pensions use.

large car - both could barely see over the dashboard. As they were cruising
along, they came to an intersection. The stoplight was red, but they just went
on through. The woman in the passenger seat thought to herself&quot;I must be
losing it. I could have sworn we just went through a red light.&quot;After a
few more minutes, they came to another intersection and the light was red again.
Again, they went right through. The woman in the passenger seat was almost sure
that the light had been red but was really concerned that she was losing it. She
was getting nervous. At the next intersection, sure enough, the light was red
and they went on through. So, she turned to the other woman and said,&quot;Mildred, did you know that we just ran through three red lights in a row?
You could have killed us both!&quot; 

 Mildred turned to her and said,&quot;Yipes,
am I the designated driver?&quot; 
 
 WASHINGTON,D.C. -- The U.S. Treasury
announced today that it is recalling all of the Texas quarters that are part of
its program featuring quarters from each state. 

 &quot;We are recalling all the new
Texas quarters that were recently issued,&quot;Treasury Undersecretary Jack
Shackleford said Monday.&quot;This action is being taken after numerous reports
that these new quarters will not work in parking meters, toll booths, vending
machines, pay phones, or other coin-operated devices.&quot; 

 &quot;The problem lies in the unique
design of the Texas quarter, which was created by a Texas A&amp;M
graduate,&quot;Shackleford said. 

 &quot;Apparently, the duct tape holding
the two dimes and the nickel together keeps jamming the coin-operated
devices.&quot; 
 
 The Way We Were 

 Forwarded by Auntie Bev 

 A little house with two bedrooms and
one car on the street, A mower that you had to push, to make the grass look
neat. In the kitchen on the wall, we only had one phone, And no need for
recording things - someone was always home. 

 We only had a living room, where we
would congregate, Unless it was at meal time, in the kitchen where we ate. We
had no need for family rooms or extra rooms to dine, When meeting as a family,
those two rooms would work out fine. 

 We only had one TV set and channels -
maybe two, But always there was one of them, with something worth the view. For
snacks we had potato chips, that tasted like a chip, And if you wanted flavor,
you made Lipton&apos;s onion dip. 

 Store bought snacks were rare, because
my mother liked to cook, And nothing can compare to snacks in Betty Crocker&apos;s
book. The snacks were even healthy - with the best ingredients, There was no
label, with a hundred things that made no sense. 

 Weekends were for family trips, or
staying home to play, We all did things together, even go to church to pray.
When we did our weekend trips, depending on the weather, No one stayed at home
because, we liked to be together. 

 Sometimes we would separate, to do
things on our own, But we knew where the others were, without our own cell
phone. Then there were the movies, with your favorite movie star, And nothing
can compare to watching, movies in your car. 

 Then there were the picnics, at the
peak of summer season, 

 Pack a lunch and find some trees - and
never need a reason. Get a baseball game together, with the friends you know,
Have real action playing ball - and no game video. 

 Remember when the doctor used to be the
family friend, And didn&apos;t need insurance - or a lawyer to defend The way that he
took care of you, or what he had to do, Because he took an oath, and strived to
do the best for you. 

 Remember when the country, was united
under God, And prayer in schools and public places, was not deemed as odd
Remember when the church was used for, worshipping The Lord, And not used for
commercial use, or for some business board. 

 Remember going to the store - and
shopping casually, And when you went to pay for it, you used your own money?
Nothing that you had to swipe or - punch in some amount, Remember when the
cashier person, had to really count? 

 Remember when we breathed the air, it
smelled so fresh and clean, And chemicals were not used on the grass, to keep it
green. The milkman and the bread man used to go from door to door, And it was
just a few cents more, than going to the store. 

 There was a time when mailed letters,
came right to your door, Without a lot of junk mail ads, sent out by every
store. The mailman knew each house, by name and knew where it was sent, There
were not loads of mail addressed to:&quot;Present Occupant&quot;. 

 Remember when the words&quot;I
do&quot;meant, that you really did? And not just temporally, till someone blows
their lid. There was nothing as&quot;no one&apos;s fault;&quot;we just made a
mistake, There was a time when married life, was built on give and take. 

 There was a time when just one glance,
was all that it would take, And you would know the kind of car, the model and
the make. They didn&apos;t look like turtles, trying to squeeze every mile, They were
streamlined, white walls and fins - and really had some style. 

 One time the music that you played,
whenever you would jive, Was from a vinyl, big holed record called a forty-five.
The record player had a post, to keep them all in line, And then the records
would drop down, and play one at a time. 

 Oh sure we had our problems then - just
like we do today, And always we were striving - trying for a better way. And
every year that passed us by, brought new and greater things, We now can even
program phones, with music or with rings. 

 Oh the simple life we lived, still
seems like so much fun, How can you explain a game - just kick the can and run.
And why would boys put baseball cards, between bicycle spokes? And for a nickel,
red machines had little bottled cokes. 

 This life seemed so much easier - and
slower in some ways, I love the new technology but I sure miss those days. So
time moves on and so do we - and nothing stays the same, But I sure love to
reminisce, and walk down memory lane. 
 
 A fellow named
MacTavish was visiting the old country, and out on the moor he was waiting at a
train station, and he noticed the clock at one end of the waiting room said it
was a quarter to ten, and the clock at the other end of the waiting room said it
was ten minutes to ten. He walked up to the bearded stationmaster and said,&quot;why don&apos;t your clocks read the same time?&quot;and the old stationmaster
removed the pipe from his teeth and replied,&quot;Well faith and begorrah, mon,
if both clocks read the same time, what in the name of heaven would be the
purpose of havin&apos; two of &apos;em, eh?&quot;

IF A DOG WERE YOUR TEACHER, YOU WOULD LEARN STUFF LIKE:

When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.

Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.

Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure
ecstasy.

When it&apos;s in your best interest, practice obedience.

Let others know when they&apos;ve invaded your territory.

Take naps.

Stretch before rising.

Run, romp and play daily.

Thrive on attention and let people touch you.

Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.

On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass.

On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree.

When you&apos;re happy, dance around and wag your entire body.

No matter how often you&apos;re scolded, don&apos;t buy into the guilt thing and pout,
run right back and make friends.

Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.

Eat with gusto and enthusiasm.

Stop when you have had enough.

Be loyal.

Never pretend to be something you&apos;re not.

When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle them
gently.

And finally, ................

Never trust strangers unless they let you sniff their butt.

tribute   T o
our fallen comrades. So since we are part of the only Marine Infantry
Battalion left in Iraq
the one way that we could think of doing that is
By taking a picture of Baker Company saying the way we feel. It would
be awesome if you could find a way to share this with our fellow

 The
weather outside is unreal. Working in temperatures 73 degrees below freezing is
one thing, but couple that with the wind, and it has the potential to be a
dangerous experience. The wind chill value is approaching 100 degrees below
zero. Please don&apos;t pay us a visit over the next few days. Conditions do not get
much more extreme up here, or anywhere in the world then they are right now --- http://www.mountwashington.org/weather/index.php

 About
45% of all books and periodicals sold in Japan are manga. They often contain
sexual material. 
BBC News,&quot;Japanese manga ruled obscene,&quot;January 13, 2004 --- http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3391951.stm  
Manga (according to Google) - Sometimes confused with anime, manga is the
Japanese word for comic book (or Graphic Novel, if you prefer) and is used in
English to mean Japanese comic books. Manga and anime are very closely related,
as artists frequently crossover, as do the characters they create. Usually the
manga is created first, and if it becomes really popular then the market it
deemed capable of supporting a much more costly animation based on it.

 Will your
bonus for last year come anywhere close to $9 million?  The name of the
game is derivatives! 
Global commercial banks are expected to award bumper bonuses in the next three
months, following a pattern set by the US investment banks in December. Forex
dealers anticipate year-on-year increases of up to 50% in their annual packages,
on the back of a highly lucrative year in foreign exchange as major and emerging
markets currencies went haywire. An unusually active fourth quarter in
particular boosted many traders&apos; profit and loss accounts as they wound down for
year-end, sending up bonus expectations accordingly. Goldman Sachs, Merrill
Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers were among the banks that announced
their bonus payouts in December. Peers at rival banks reported that forex
dealers at Morgan Stanley saw average year-on-year rises of 20%, while the very
top staff in foreign exchange and derivatives may have seen as much as $9
million each.&quot;This type of figure is not inconceivable at the top three or
four banks,&quot;said one head of foreign exchange at a US bank in New York.

 The society which scorns
excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in
philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor
good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water. 
 John W. Gardner as quoted by Mark Shapiro at http://irascibleprofessor.com/comments-12-16-03.htm   

 For more years than I care
to say I&apos;ve been telling students in my literature classes that an A
demonstrates excellence; a B&quot;suggests&quot;excellence; a C demonstrates
competence; a D&quot;suggests&quot;incompetence; and that an F demonstrates
incompetence. And during the years when course syllabi increasingly had the look
of legal contracts - which meant that deans reminded professors to make sure
that they spelled out, in precise terms, what their attendance policies were,
and what the penalty for missing classes was -- I was sure that my grading
policy was crystal clear. Unfortunately, it wasn&apos;t, largely because&quot;excellence&quot;is one of those fighting words - for students as well as
many on the faculty. Who&apos;s to say, the new mantra holds, what&quot;excellence&quot;is? Isn&apos;t it rather like beauty -- that is, in the eye of
the beholder. Moreover, if the&quot;beholder&quot;in the case of grading, is a
professor, isn&apos;t there something subjective -- indeed entirely arbitrary -- in
the process.

 &quot;Laughter
on a sinking ship&quot;
by Velma Cook, The Islamic Garden --- http://www.islamicgarden.com/poetry.html    
 
 The reality of life with
 all its irony, sadness, triumph, striving and obstacles, is so thwart with
 dynamism and the need for our thinking and action that to spend one&apos;s life
 laugh at trivial things and ignore the higher truths, seems somewhat obscene. 

 People tell me
Try to laugh at life

I smile
and find joy in children&apos;s laughter
the swaying of trees and singing of birds

I close my eyes and sigh
as I hear
trickling water
feeding the earth
growing the food to maintain our existence

Everywhere I look
I find glimpses of beauty-
the root of joy
In all things green and pure

But to laugh at the foolishness of man
the biased hate of black and white
the stomping pride of arrogance
Shameless boasting and obscenity
the whirling laughter of intoxicating power -

In these, there is no joy

The hardness of the human heart!
How many are buried
whose hearts died long ago?

Like hardened earth that leaves no trace of footsteps
unlike soft green grass that
bears the imprint of those who pass

Hardened hearts
blossom into beauty
when truth and softness
cover their darkness with light

We eat, we drink, we sleep, we work,
we love, we hate
our birth is followed by our death
its time unknown

All that&apos;s really ours
is what our hands have sent forth
In a world where virtue is scorned

Time passes like sands through an hour glass
like the steady motion of a sinking ship
and we, on board
oblivious to its downward turn

To the very end
are we bent on laughter?

While others weep,
can we smile -
When cries of injustice
echo in our ears?

Laughter!
like so many bubbles of joy
on waves of inhumanity.

 The dotcom bubble may
 have finally burst but there can be no doubt that the Internet has forever
 changed the way we communicate, do business and find information of all kinds.
 Scientific American has regularly covered the advances making this
 transformation possible. And during the past five years alone, many leading
 researchers and computer scientists have aired their views on the Web in our
 pages. Now you can access the majority of those contributions in a single
 place--our second special online issue entitled The Future of the Web. 

 In this collection,
 expert authors discuss a range of topics--from XML and hypersearching the web
 to filtering information and preserving the Internet in one vast archive.
 Other articles cover more recent ideas, including ways to make Web content
 more meaningful to machines and plans to create an operating system that would
 span the Internet as a whole. 
 
 Question
Is the medium really the message? 

 Answer given by Donald A. Norman in
Things That Make Us Smart: Human Attributes in the Age of the Machine (Perseus
Books, 1993, pp. 243-244) 
 
 
 TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NEUTRAL 

 TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NEUTRAL. EACH TECHNOLOGY HAS
PROPERTIES--affordances--that make it easier to do some activities, harder to do
others: The easier ones get done, the harder ones neglected. Each has
constraints, preconditions, and side effects that impose requirements and
changes on the things with which it interacts, be they other technology, people,
or human society at large. Finally, each technology poses a mind-set, a
way of thinking about it and the activities to which it is relevant, a mind-set
that soon pervades those touched by it, often unwittingly, often
unwillingly. The more successful and widespread the technology, the
greater its impact upon the thought patterns of those who use it, and
consequently, the greater its impact upon all of society. Technology is
not neutral; it dominates. 

 IS THE MEDIUM THE MESSAGE? 

 Marshall McLuhan proclaimed that the way in which we interacted with the
events of the world was as important as, or perhaps even more important than,
the events themselves. &quot;The medium is the message,&quot;he
proclaimed in a famous, often-repeated sentence. 

    I don&apos;t agree. In fact, I was tempted to title this
chapter&quot;The Medium Is Not the Message.&quot; I prefer to believe
that the message is what you make of it: The medium is the carrier, not the
contents. Nonetheless, the medium is not a neutral carrier; it has
numerous properties that affect both how it is used and its impact upon
society. There is much to be said for McLuhan&apos;s argument that the medium
changes how we interpret the message. In fact, many of the arguments in
this book support just this point. Media can deceive and seduce even the
discerning mind. 

    Each technological medium has
affordances, properties that
make it easier to do some things than others. McLuhan&apos;s famous remark to a
large extent was a comment on affordances. Let me illustrate the role of
media affordances by contrasting reading the printed page with viewing a
television show. Each medium, the printed page and television, has both a
positive side and a negative side.

 to do some background research to find out if we could find some bridges to
 accounting. Over the past thiry odd years, accounting (at least establishment
 accounting) has become, in my humble opinion, far too narcissistic for our own
 good; opening our eyes to areas seemingly entirely unrelated to our perceived
 vision of what accounting researchers ought to be doing (besides churning
 regressions) is perhaps a good idea. 

 I went through the details in the Technology Review,
 asking the question how we might be able to leverage those developments for
 the advancement of our own field. I could visualise at least four areas where
 we can find metaphors, establishment willing (after all we need acceptance in
 establishment journals to survive the tenure/ promotion hassles, let alone the
 need for our own self-aggrandizement). I will briefly state below what I
 think, and hopefully we can get some discussion (and hopefully research)
 going, establishmentarians willing. 

 1. Universal translation: There is a real need for
 research in the area of building multi-lingual lexical resources (and I
 consider English and American accounting two different languages in terms of
 lexical semantics) to make the dream of translation of financial statements a
 reality. I was at a computational linguistics conference in Brno (Czech Rep) a
 week ago, and it was fascinating to see the kind of research being done in the
 European and Asian languages (domain independent). Lexical resources in
 accounting are extremely scarce, unless you include resources of convenience
 developed individually by companies without regard for sound principles of
 lexicography and, in general, linguistics. I have been playing this broken
 record on AECM for years, but found few interested in research in the area.
 This area also relates to at least one other area on the list, bayesian
 machine learning. 

 2. Bayesian machine learning: While we have had a
 stream of papers in auditing relating to bayesian networks and belief
 networks, the aspect of learning has been all but ignored. One of the reasons
 for the lack of interest is probably the fact that the applications have been
 a rather mechanical application of beyesian updating (or aggregation of
 beliefs/evidence) in the context of account balances. True progress in this
 area requires modeling of dynamic business processes as well as their impact
 on account balances. Not much has been written in this area. 

 3. Distributed storage: As organisations grow, the
 accounting systems become too unwieldy when it comes to evaluation of
 controls, substantive testing, and opinion formulation. In the absence of a
 formal over-arching coherent model of controls and audit in such systems,audit
 decisionmaking becomes akin to shooting in the dark. It is as though we
 auditors are just whistling past the graveyard, and occasionally get spooked.
 If we had formal models, we could study distributed storage and processing in
 accounting systems as a way of breaking down the complexity of auditing. I
 have come across no work in this area. 

 4. RNAi therapy: Auditing is basically a forensic
 enterprise. We should, in my opinion, look for rich biological metaphors for
 auditing. Just as pathologists study the pathogens wreaking havoc in our
 bodies in order to discover countermeasures, in auditing we need models to aid
 signatures for fraud so that&quot;errant genes&quot;(insiders) can be&quot;turned off&quot;. I have found no trace of such metaphors in the
 auditing literature. 

 I am sure other AECMers will find other similar
 metaphors we can thrive by, in accounting and auditing.

 GOOGLE expands services for the
following:   

 area codes, product codes, flight information, vehicle identification numbers U.S. Postal Service tracking
 numbers. 

 &quot;Google
Expands Search Features,&quot;by Mylene Mangalindan, The Wall Street Journal ,
January 13, 2004 ---  
 
 Google
 Inc. expanded the types of information that Internet users can search for on
 its Web site to include such things as area codes, product codes, flight
 information, vehicle identification numbers and U.S. Postal Service tracking
 numbers. 

 The
 closely held Web-search technology company introduced the new features to its
 Web site Monday. Google ( www.google.com )
 sees its mission as connecting Internet users to the world&apos;s information,
 which it hopes to organize and make more accessible. 

 The
 Mountain View, Calif., company, which is the leading destination for Internet
 users on the Web for search, has been in the news lately because it is
 expected to sell shares to the public this year, according to people familiar
 with the situation. Many bigger public companies such as Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have also made it clear that they intend to challenge the start-up in
 search technology. 

 Google&apos;s
 announcement Monday introduces several new innovations. Computer users, for
 example, can type in an area code in the search query bar and the top result
 will show a map of that geographic area. Users can also plug in a vehicle
 identification number into the search query box to get a link for a Web page
 with more information about the year, make and model of a specific type of
 car.

 Since we
have now entered tax season, some of you may be looking for tax helpers.   Software
like TurboTax is cheap and really simple to use if you want to take the time to
do your own taxes. 

 Before
doing your own taxes or having someone else prepare your tax forms, I recommend
that you take a careful look at http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=118506,00.html 

 If you are
seeking tax helpers, software comparisons, and other links, you might take a
look at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/bookbob1.htm#010304Taxation 

 I mention
this with the warning that I am the last person on earth to look for tax help
other than providing the above link.   I
might mention that the IRS has one of the best Websites in the world.   However,
IRS employees have a poor record of correctly answering tax questions on the
phone, and any bad advice you get from an IRS employee is no defense in tax
court.   The IRS is making a concerted
effort to train IRS employees to provide more accurate answers to tax questions
from the public.    My advice is
to conduct a Web search for answers before calling the IRS on the phone.   In general, start with the IRS site at http://www.irs.gov/index.html   

National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson this week released
a report to Congress that identifies the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and sole
proprietor tax noncompliance as the top two problems faced by taxpayers. http://www.accountingweb.com/item/98566

fall for such tax scams as those listed at http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=98269,00.html

 &quot;Future Home Full of Web
Wonders,&quot;by Steve Friess, Wired News , January 9. 2003 --- http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,61844,00.html?tw=newsletter_topstories_html   
 
 You would expect to
 walk into the&quot;home of the future&quot;and find flat-screen plasma
 TVs, programmable climate control, touch-sensitive lighting and a bevy of
 Web-based features. 

 It&apos;s all impressive
 stuff, to be sure, but you&apos;d stop cold in your tracks if you heard someone
 say,&quot;Don&apos;t forget to show him the Internet toilet.&quot;Truth be
 told, there is actually no Internet toilet in the 2,200-square-foot
 Demonstration Home, built in the parking lot of the 2004
 Consumer Electronics Show , that Wired News exclusively previewed on
 Wednesday. 

 No, it&apos;s better
 than an Internet toilet. It&apos;s a john that, so they say, would make toilet
 paper itself obsolete. TotoUSA&apos;s Washlet washes and dries you, offers four
 temperatures for heated seats and has a built-in air purifier -- all for
 $1,100 and up. 

 &quot;This is CES,&quot;said Deanna Baker of iShow.com, the company that is overseeing the Next Gen
 2004 Demonstration Home, which opened to the rest of the convention crowds
 on Thursday.&quot;We have a little bit of everything here.&quot; 

 Still, even if the
 toilet&apos;s not on the Web -- yet -- it&apos;s forgivable to assume in this house
 that even the bowl would be somehow related to the Internet. Almost all the
 house&apos;s technical wonders have some Internet feature, from the oven you can
 turn on to the security camera you can view to the solar electric generator
 you can monitor -- all from afar. 

 And, of course, as
 Bill Gates announced in his traditional CES keynote
 address on Wednesday night, there&apos;s Microsoft&apos;s determined effort to tie
 every room in the house together using its new Windows XP Media Center PC
 software. The idea is to have all the entertainment screens working off the
 same central computer powered by the new operating system, so if you&apos;re
 watching a DVD in one room and want to continue watching in another, for
 instance, you can do so without stopping or moving the DVD itself. 

 The demo house
 displays more than 100&quot;innovative&quot;features and is loaded with
 more than $400,000 in technology, said iShow.com President Paul Barnett.
 Most of those, though, are actually such mundane features as Cosentino USA&apos;s
 new brand of scratch-resistant quartz used for kitchen countertops or the
 tankless water heater by Seisco that promises to eliminate the suddenly cold
 shower. 

 The concept for the
 demo house actually originated as part of the International Builders Show in
 Las Vegas, which starts later this month, so many of its innovations are
 thrills to the home-building crowd, not CES&apos; tech-geek audience.

 The price of an audit went up, and this is reflected in revenue growth
along with the redistribution of Andersen clients. 

&quot;KPMG International Saw Revenue Rise 13% in Year,&quot;by Cassell bryan-Low, The Wall Street Journal , January 20, 2004 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107455199609805684,00.html?mod=mkts_main_news_hs_h  
 
 KPMG International reported a 13% increase in global
 revenue in dollar terms for fiscal year 2003, helped by growth in the
 Asian-Pacific region. 

 Gross revenue totaled $12.16 billion for the year
 ended Sept. 30, up from $10.72 billion a year earlier. In local-currency
 terms, KPMG said revenue grew 5.4%. KPMG, the smallest of the Big Four global
 auditing firms, is a Swiss-based global network with about 6,900 partners
 world-wide. 

 Audit services saw the strongest growth in revenue,
 up 20% to $5.86 billion -- or up 12% excluding currency-exchange impact.
 Revenue from tax services essentially was flat, while revenue from advisory
 services, which include merger and other financial-related advisory work, was
 down slightly in local-currency terms. 

 On a regional basis, operations in the Asian-Pacific
 region saw the strongest revenue growth, up 25% to $1.24 billion in dollar
 terms as a result of internal growth and acquisitions. Revenue in the
 Americas, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America, rose 8.4% to $4.63
 billion. 

 Mike Rake, chairman of KPMG, said growth in the
 Americas was driven by the audit business, which acquired some former clients
 of Arthur Andersen LLP, the former Big Five audit firm that was convicted of
 obstruction of justice in connection with its audit work for Enron Corp. In
 addition, the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which overhauled corporate-governance
 rules, created new requirements for auditors that has led to additional work.&quot;What we&apos;re seeing is stronger demand for audit [services] and much
 weaker demand for tax and advisory [services],&quot;Mr. Rake said.

 Congratulations Andy and Our Deepest Sympathies 
 
 SEC Announces Selection of Andrew D. Bailey, Jr.
As Deputy Chief Accountant 

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --- http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2004-7.htm    
2004-7 

 Washington, D.C., Jan. 16, 2004 Securities and Exchange
 Commission Chairman William H. Donaldson today announced the selection of
 Andrew D. Bailey, Jr. to serve as Deputy Chief Accountant for the Commission.
 In this capacity, Bailey will share with Scott A. Taub, current Deputy Chief
 Accountant, responsibilities for the day-to-day operations of the Office of

 Salary
compression remains an enormous problem for business school deans. 

 03-04 U.S. AACSB Salary Survey Report
Available:  
The 36th annual report includes data from more than 25,000 faculty salaries
across all ranks in 28 business fields and 4,400 administrators in 25 positions.
The Executive
Summary  is provided at no charge. Purchase the full
report online --- http://www.aacsb.edu/   

 From
the just recently released AACSB 2003-2004 Salary Survey results for U.S.
accounting faculty members: 

 
 Salary
 for&quot;New Hire,&quot;&quot;New Doctorate&quot;at all accredited
 schools: Median $95,000   Mean -
 $102,800 
 Salary
 for&quot;New Hire,&quot;&quot;New Doctorate&quot;at all AACSB member
 schools: Median $94,000   Mean -
 $100,700 

 The above salaries are nine-month
salaries and include neither fringe benefits nor summer research/teaching
supplements. Major research universities often provide additional research
budgets to faculty members, some ranging as high as $20,000. These are not
included in the above survey outcomes. 

 Means and medians are distorted by
lower paying colleges in communities where faculty are willing to take lower pay
for the scenery, climate, spouse employment, and life style. Some faculty
are also willing to take less in order to live in cities like New York,
Chicago, and Los Angeles where consulting opportunities are relatively
great. 

 Faculty
wanting to locate in a given part of the world should consult the public
documents that are available about regional salaries.   For
example, if you wanted to move to Wisconsin as an accounting faculty
member, you might take a look at http://www.uwsa.edu/budplan/redbook/book2/pages/pg112.html 

 According
to the Hasselback Directory , the number of new accounting doctoral
recipients has been declining significantly since 200 degrees were awarded in
1993.   There was a steady decline to
103 awarded in Year 1999 and 74 awarded in Year 2000.    

 Starting
salaries are impacted by the law of supply and demand, and the demand for
finance and other business faculty appears to be growing faster than demand for
accounting faculty.  Finance faculty salaries are now a shade higher
than accounting faculty salaries in most categories of faculty rank. Accounting typically had the most majors in previous decades, but other
concentrations are gaining on accounting. The gap is narrowing as
accounting has become less popular than other business concentrations since the
initiation of the five-year requirement to sit for the CPA examination in most
states. 

 The following table
is somewhat revealing in showing the slippage of the number of new faculty hires
in accounting relative to increases in other business school concentrations.

 Bob 

 I have seen this report in full and the biggest
 distortion is the inclusion of research oriented and non-research oriented
 schools. The difference is reasonably large in the average long term effect of
 salary and certainly the recent hire data exacerbates the difference. Our dean
 tried to use this overall number to set the standards (or is at least trying)
 and I collected the data to point out where UIC was included and what schools
 are considered the rest.

Despite Gain in Degrees, Women Lag in Tenure in 2 Main Fields
Tamar Lewin, The New York Times , January 15, 2003 --- http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/15/education/15WOME.html  
 
 Although more women are earning doctorates in science
 and engineering, a new survey of science and engineering faculties at the
 nation&apos;s top 50 research universities found that women remain scarce in
 tenured, or tenure-track, positions. 

 In many fields, including biology, chemistry, math,
 economics and computer sciences, the survey found, there are far fewer women
 even in entry-level assistant professorships than would be predicted from the
 doctorates now awarded to women. 

 In computer science, for example, women earn 20.5
 percent of the doctorates, but make up only 10.8 percent of the assistant
 professors. 

 The survey, conducted by Donna J. Nelson, a chemistry
 professor at the University of Oklahoma, includes data on every discipline for
 which the National Science Foundation ranks the 50 universities that spend the
 most research money. 

 Over all, it found, only 3 percent to 15 percent of
 full professors in the top engineering and science departments are women.

 Women Accounting Professors 
Approximately 25% of accounting faculty in U.S. colleges and universities are
women according to Jim Hasselback (who keeps more accurate records on accounting
faculty in various nations than any other source in the world). This
number drops to 20% in terms of the proportion of female versus male accounting
professors with doctoral degrees. However, among assistant professors with
doctorates, women comprise nearly 34% of accounting faculty in the U.S. This indicates that the proportion of women is on the rise --- http://www.jrhasselback.com/GENDER.pdf  

 WOMEN IN ACCOUNTING 

 The overall distribution of accounting faculty
members at U.S. schools, broken down by rank and gender, is shown in Exhibit 1. This tabulation excludes faculty with titles such as emeritus, visiting and
adjunct, and faculty for whom no academic title is reported. It only
includes deans whose academic area is accounting. Exhibit 1 shows data for
6,459 accounting faculty members, and reveals that women comprise 24.9 percent
of this group. The proportion of women at senior ranks is much smaller
than the proportion of women at junior ranks. Women are most prevalent at
the Instructor/Lecturer rank, which is generally not a tenure track position at
most institutions.

 Exhibit 2 shows the same information for the

2,375 individuals from Exhibit 1. Almost 200 of these individuals are ABD,
over 1,700 hold masters degrees, over 300 hold law degrees, and for only 30
individuals no degree information was available. Women comprise 20.2
percent of the faculty holding a doctorate, and there is again a
disproportionate concentration of women at junior ranks. Almost one half
of the women faculty members with doctorates (398/825) currently hold the rank
of Assistant Professor.

&quot;A Pocketful Of Video Miracles Two new ultrasleek camcorders offer
brilliant picture quality,&quot;Larry Armstrong, Business Week , January
19, 2004 --- http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_03/b3866031.htm  
 
 I was never a fan of camcorders. Maybe it&apos;s because I
 didn&apos;t appreciate other people&apos;s home movies (and don&apos;t have kids of my own).
 But mostly it&apos;s because I never wanted to carry around one of these big, bulky
 machines. They&apos;re unwieldy, with flip-out screens and pop-up viewfinders;
 they&apos;re heavy, at a pound or more; and they require their own bag to stow all
 the accompanying paraphernalia -- from spare batteries to adapters and cords.
 A simple point-and-shoot camera that I can slip in a pocket is good enough for
 me. 

 Or at least it used to be. In the past two months,
 two companies have come out with digital camcorders roughly the size of a deck
 of cards -- about a third the size of today&apos;s typical camcorder. Both,
 Panasonic&apos;s SV-AV100 and the Fisher FVD-C1, are small enough to slide easily
 into a trouser pocket. I&apos;ve been playing around with the pair for a few weeks
 now, and I&apos;m convinced that someday all camcorders will be like this.

The secret to their diminutive size? No moving parts. They record on
 solid-state memory cards instead of tapes. And they do a much better job than
 digital still cameras, which shoot video but only in short, grainy clips. They
 also outshine card-based&quot;multimedia&quot;minicams from Gateway ( GTW ) and others, which at best, produce herky-jerky movies viewable only in a
 tiny window on your computer monitor.

Instead, with the two new camcorders, your home movies will fill your TV
 screen. And the picture quality is almost as good as that of a
 state-of-the-art digital video (DV) camcorder that uses MiniDV tapes. In fact,
 the Panasonic camcorder uses the same recording technique, called MPEG-2,
 that&apos;s used to record commercial DVDs. The Fisher model uses a
 high-resolution, full-screen version of MPEG-4, the format used by the cheaper
 minicams. Because the MPEG-4 scheme compresses the video signal more than
 MPEG-2, the picture isn&apos;t as good as the Panasonic&apos;s, but it&apos;s more than
 acceptable.

The downside is that the companies&apos; emphasis on video quality means those
 postage-stamp-size SD memory cards fill up fast. Each camera comes with a
 512-megabyte card that, at the highest-quality setting, lets you record 30
 minutes of video on the Fisher or 10 minutes (20 minutes if you lower the
 quality a bit) on the Panasonic. At the lowest, you can get many hours of
 video -- 10 hours on the Panasonic, 3 on the Fisher -- but it&apos;s probably not
 worth watching. Extra cards will cost you: The high-speed SD cards used by the
 Panasonic are about $220 at Ritz Camera stores or Amazon.com ( AMZN ).

As with anything this techno-chic, the new camcorders aren&apos;t cheap, either.
 Fisher&apos;s, made by Sanyo Electric, is $899 and is sold only at Sears -- at
 least for now. Panasonic&apos;s lists for $1,000, but Internet retailers sell it in
 the $750-to-$900 range. Each comes with a docking station, which makes it easy
 to watch movies on TV or transfer them to your PC.

 From Publishers
 Weekly 
This book may mark the beginning of a new front in the science wars. Nisbett,
 an eminent psychologist and co-author of a seminal Psychological Review paper
 on how people talk about their decision making, reports on some of his latest
 work in cultural psychology. He contends that&quot;[h]uman cognition is not
 everywhere the same&quot;-that those brought up in Western and East Asian
 cultures think differently from one another in scientifically measurable ways.
 Such a contention pits his work squarely against evolutionary psychology (as
 articulated by Steven Pinker and others) and cognitive science, which assume
 all appreciable human characteristics are&quot;hard wired.&quot;Initial
 chapters lay out the traditional differences between Aristotle and Confucius,
 and the social practices that produced (and have grown out of) these differing&quot;homeostatic approaches&quot;to the world: Westerners tend to inculcate
 individualism and choice (40 breakfast cereals at the supermarket), while East
 Asians are oriented toward group relations and obligations (&quot;the tall
 poppy is cut down&quot;remains a popular Chinese aphorism). Next, Nisbett
 presents his actual experiments and data, many of which measure reaction times
 in recalling previously shown objects. They seem to show East Asians (a term
 Nisbett uses as a catch-all for Chinese, Koreans, Japanese and others)
 measurably more holistic in their perceptions (taking in whole scenes rather
 than a few stand-out objects). Westerners, or those brought up in Northern
 European and Anglo-Saxon-descended cultures, have a&quot;tunnel-vision
 perceptual style&quot;that focuses much more on identifying what&apos;s prominent
 in certain scenes and remembering it. Writing dispassionately yet with
 engagement, Nisbett explains the differences as&quot;an inevitable
 consequence of using different tools to understand the world.&quot;If his
 explanation turns out to be generally accepted, it means a big victory for
 memes in their struggle with genes. 

 From Scientific American 
 Nisbett, a psychologist and Distinguished University
 Professor at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, used to believe that&quot;all human groups perceive and reason in the same way.&quot;A series of
 events and studies led him gradually to quite another view, that Asians and
 Westerners&quot;have maintained very different systems of thought for
 thousands of years.&quot;Different how?&quot;The collective or
 interdependent nature of Asian society is consistent with Asians&apos; broad,
 contextual view of the world and...

 &quot;Tranquility, Turmoil and Chaos
for International Business,&quot;by Rodger Doyle --- http://snipurl.com/Doyle   
 
 The PRS Group in East
Syracuse, N.Y., which specializes in political and economic intelligence,
measures and forecasts domestic turmoil based on reports from more than 200 area
specialists. The PRS classifies countries into four categories that measure the
risk for international business and do not necessarily coincide with impressions
from daily news reports. A rating of&quot;moderate&quot;turmoil indicates that
international business is sometimes affected by expressions of discontent. 

 The
 term&quot;turmoil&quot;as used by PRS includes large-scale protests, general
 strikes, riots, terrorist acts, guerrilla warfare, wars between states and
 disorder caused by government reaction to unrest. It excludes crimes that do
 not directly affect business, such as spousal abuse. The PRS classifies
 countries into four categories that measure the risk for international
 business and do not necessarily coincide with impressions from daily news
 reports. 
 &quot;Low&quot;turmoil indicates that violent discontent is unusual. In Western-style
 democracies, that means opposition is expressed peacefully; however, in
 authoritarian regimes, such as those of Saudi Arabia, Cuba and Vietnam, force
 or the threat of force principally keeps order. Repressive regimes also try to
 mollify opponents: for instance, Saudi Arabia gives economic rewards to its
 Shiite minority to discourage antiregime violence. 
 A rating of&quot;moderate&quot;turmoil indicates that international business is
 sometimes affected by expressions of discontent. The U.S. is given a moderate
 rating for many reasons, including the threat of racial riots (such as those
 in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1996), terrorist acts (such as the bombing of the
 federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995), continuing drug-related violence,
 and attacks on abortion providers. China, also classified as moderate, uses
 the threat of force to keep order but also prevents unrest by trying to keep
 living standards from plummeting. Russia is plagued by crime, which rose
 fivefold from 1989 to 1997. 
 Countries labeled&quot;high&quot;suffer from violence that could seriously affect
 international business. Included in this group is Indonesia, which has been
 plagued by food riots, violent student protests, the lynching of ethnic
 Chinese, and separatist movements. Pakistan is destabilized by conflicts
 between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, ethnic violence, continuing tensions with
 India over Kashmir and threats against U.S. businesspeople. Nigeria suffers
 from severe deterioration of its infrastructure and from violent conflicts
 between Muslims and Christians and between ethnic groups. Guerrilla groups in
 Peru still pose a substantial risk to stability.&quot;Very high&quot;risk of
 turmoil indicates near-warlike conditions. Of the four countries in this
 group, three--Colombia, Sudan and Congo (Kinshasa)--were at press time
 contending with armed insurrection. The fourth, Haiti, has a government
 seemingly powerless to stop the high level of violence there. (The PRS group
 lacks data for the former Yugoslav republic, but the province of Kosovo would
 probably also be in this group.) 
 Because turmoil
 springs largely from economic, ethnic, racial and religious discrimination, it
 is not surprising that democracies typically enjoy greater tranquility than
 dictatorships. Among the few with high ratings are South Africa, which is
 dealing with millions of unemployed illegal immigrants, and Costa Rica, where
 disturbances have grown because social services have deteriorated as a result
 of inflation and inadequate resources. Although a few repressive governments
 are likely to maintain a low level of turmoil, most such regimes will have
 moderate or high levels.

 N.Y.s Schumer Proposes Remedies for Textbook Costs 

 U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a
 study showing that undergraduates at New York colleges and universities are
 confronting skyrocketing costs for textbooks, paying an average of $922 this
 year. The study supported legislation proposed by Schumer that would make up
 to $1,000 of textbook costs tax deductible to help lower the cost of higher
 education for working families. 

 Schumer&apos;s office surveyed 150 courses that a typical
 full-time freshman or sophomore will take this year at over 30 colleges and
 universities across New York State. In addition to a tax break, Schumer
 proposed other remedies including: -- Guarantee textbooks are available for
 free in libraries. -- Ensure students can buy only the texts they need for
 classes without being forced to purchase unneeded extras as part of a&quot;bundle.&quot;-- Guard against professors who take advantage of students
 by assigning books they wrote. 
 
 

 From The Wall Street Journal Accounting Educators&apos; Reviews on January 14, 2004 

 TITLE: Large Software Customers Refuse
to Get With the Program 
REPORTERS: Kevin J. Delaney and David Bank 
DATE: Jan 02, 2004 
PAGE: A1,6 
LINK: http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB107300003323708100,00.html   
TOPICS: Accounting Information Systems 

 SUMMARY: Delaney and Bank report that
business software giant SAP blinked in its confrontation when one of its
customers refused to upgrade to a newer version of their software. During the
economic downturn, SAP, as well as other application software providers, had
increased their revenues not so much through new sales, rather they insisted
their current customers upgrade their previously purchased software packages.
The related article from one year ago reflects that trend. 

 QUESTIONS: 
1.) How does an ERP impact the relationships in the financing, manufacturing,
and other business processes? 

 2.) Briefly outline how a customer
relationship module (CRM) is expected to influence performance for a purchasing
firm. Do the same for a supply chain management (SCM) module. 

 3.) Given the conclusion from Delaney&apos;s
related article about SAP&apos;s return to dominance one year ago, what do you think
this bodes for the future of SAP?

 Stem
Cell Research Presentations at the Vatican   

 

 What
surprised me a bit were invitations to make presentations of stem cell research
and therapies at the Vatican. Pope John Paul II openly condemns stem cell
research and at the same time invited research presentations on this topic --- http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-11-10-pope-stem-cell_x.htm   

 The theme of a recent workshop at the
Vatican was as follows:
WORKING GROUP ON &apos;MIND, BRAIN, AND EDUCATION&apos;
THE SESSION COMMEMORATING THE 400TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE
PONTIFICAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (1603-2003)
WORKING GROUP ON &apos;STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INNOVATIVE THERAPIES&apos;
Working Group on: Mind, Brain, and Education (7-8 November 2003)
URL --- http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdscien/400_ann/program.htm  
Note the listing of distinguished scientists at the leading edge of this field. 

 Following
that workshop on November 10, 2003, the Pope issued a statement.
&quot;Pope Reiterates Warning Against Use of Embryonic Stem Cells&quot;---  http://www.georgiabulletin.org/world/2003/11/10/WORLD-4/   

 
 
 Stem-cell
 research opens new hope for curing diseases, but such cells must never come
 from human embryonic tissue, Pope John Paul II told scientists at the Vatican.&quot;Any treatment which claims to save human lives, yet is based upon the
 destruction of human life in its embryonic state, is logically and morally
 contradictory, as is any production of human embryos for the direct or
 indirect purpose of experimentation or eventual destruction,&quot;the pope
 said Nov. 10. He made the remarks to members of the Pontifical Academy of
 Sciences, which was meeting to discuss&quot;stem-cell technology and other
 innovative therapies.&quot;The pope pronounced a small part of his text and
 let his aide say the rest. The church&apos;s teaching that all human life -- even
 embryonic -- must be respected and protected has
 placed it in opposition to researchers who use stem cells from human embryos ,
 which are then destroyed. 
 
 

 You
can read the following about Dartmouth&apos;s Larua Ann Petitto&apos;s presentation at the
Vatican --- http://www.dartmouth.edu/~vox/0304/1201/petitto.html   

 
 
 In
early November, Dartmouth Professor Laura Ann Petitto met Pope John Paul II as
part of the 400th anniversary of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences of Vatican
City. Petitto, one of the world&apos;s leading scientists in the emerging field of
educational neuroscience, was invited to the celebration both to present her
research on language development and brain processes and to discuss Dartmouth&apos;s
initiatives regarding this new discipline. Credit: Rodolfo Felici. 

 For this occasion,
 members of the academy, which consists of scientists worldwide, chose two
 scientific fields of research to highlight during the celebration. Academy
 members told Petitto and the other invited scientists that they judged the two
 disciplines as likely to make contributions to the improvement of human life
 in the next 100 years. The first, the emerging field of&quot;Mind, Brain and
 Education,&quot;also called educational neuroscience, delves into the
 complexities of the environmental and biological processes that contribute to
 the growth of the human brain throughout child development. The second,&quot;Stem Cell Technology and other Innovative Therapies,&quot;involves
 genetic research to address a variety of diseases and related bioethical
 issues. 

 As one of the
 leading scientists working in educational neuroscience, Petitto, Professor in
 the departments (at Dartmouth) of Psychological
 and Brain Sciences and Education, and Chair of Education, was invited both to
 present her research on language development and brain processes and to
 discuss Dartmouth&apos;s initiatives regarding this new discipline as part of a
 series of panel discussions Nov. 7-11. 
 
 Laura
Ann Petitto&apos;s home page is at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~lpetitto/   
 
 My basic research is
 concerned with uncovering the biological mechanisms and environmental factors
 that together determine how our species acquires language, as well as how
 language is organized in the brain. Moving beyond the fact that language is
 lateralized largely in the Left Hemisphere of the human brain, I am deeply
 interested in uncovering what is the precise neural basis of this Left
 Hemisphere language specialization: Is this tissue dedicated to the production
 and processing of sound and speech, per se, or to aspects of the grammatical
 patterning that underlies all human language? What happens to specific neural
 tissue for language both (i) when it develops normally and (ii) when it
 develops in a-typical ways (as in Dyslexia)? I am further fascinated by the
 question of how bilingual language exposure impacts the brain&apos;s neural
 circuitry for language, both in the developing bilingual children and in adult
 bilinguals, including when is the optimal age for bilingual language exposure.
 To answer these research questions, I have used a number of innovative
 approaches, including (i) Cognitive Neuroscience investigations using modern
 brain-scanning techniques (fMRI, PET) of the neurological substrates in the
 brain underlying monolingual and bilingual language representation and use,
 (ii) studies of language acquisition in young monolingual and bilingual
 children, as well as basic studies of how signed languages are acquired in
 early life, specifically, American Sign Language (ASL) and Langue des Signes
 Qubcoise (LSQ), and (iii) cross-species analyses of the extent to which
 chimpanzees can (and cannot) master aspects of human language. Based on these
 findings I have proposed an account of how language is acquired that specifies
 the ways that genetic and environmental factors interact to produce language
 in children, and I have also articulated an hypothesis specifying the neural
 basis of the human language capacity in the adult brain. 

 Educational
 Implications and&quot;Bridging the Gap&quot;: As a Professor in both The
 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and The Department of Education
 at Dartmouth College - as well as being the Chairman of Dartmouth&apos;s newly
 revitalized Department of Education - I am fundamentally committed to bridging
 the gap between the discovery of basic research findings about young
 children&apos;s development and their direct (yet principled) application to
 contemporary educational policy and practice in the United States. See

 &quot;FASB Moves to Converge
Rules,&quot;by Lingling Wei, The Wall Street Journal , December 15, 2003
--- http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB107152045373513700,00.html?mod=mkts%5Fmain%5Fnews%5Fhs%5Fh   
 
 U.S. accounting-rule makers took a
 small, but important, step toward reconciling bookkeeping standards world-wide
 by proposing an initial batch of changes to narrow differences between
 American and international approaches. 

 The proposals mark one of the first
 attempts by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to make U.S. standards
 consistent with those set by its London-based counterpart, the International
 Accounting Standards Board. In October 2002, the two boards began identifying
 areas in which hundreds of divergent U.S. and international standards could be
 reconciled. The boards also are aligning their agendas in a longer-term
 initiative targeting major, and thornier, accounting issues, such as those
 involving merger accounting and revenue recognition. 

 The new rules FASB proposed Monday,
 which are subject to public comment until April, include requiring U.S.
 companies to apply accounting changes retroactively. In general, U.S.
 companies currently make a one-time cumulative adjustment in the year of the
 switch while international rules call for companies to adjust prior years&apos;
 financial statements as if the accounting policy change had occurred back
 then. The proposal also covers standards related to calculations of per-share
 earnings, valuation of certain exchanged assets, and accounting for
 inventories. 

 U.S. rule makers have acknowledged that
 creating a uniform set of financial-reporting standards could be a long and
 controversial process. Anticipating some resistance from U.S. companies to the
 proposed changes, FASB Chairman Robert Herz said,&quot;My hope is that they
 will understand that although it means some changes in the way we do reporting
 here, it&apos;s for a greater good of international convergence.&quot;The board
 intends to release next month another proposal on classification of
 liabilities.

 Christmas Cookie Recipe 

 Cookie Ingredients: 1 cup of water 1 tsp baking soda 1 cup of sugar 1 tsp
salt 1 cup of brown sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 4 large eggs 1 cup nuts 2
cups of dried fruit 1 bottle Jose Cuervo Tequila 

 Sample the Cuervo to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the Cuervo
again, to be sure it is of the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink 

 Turn on the electric mixer...Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.
Add one teaspoon of sugar...Beat again. At this point it&apos;s best to make sure the
Cuervo is still OK, try another cup ... just in case. 

 Turn off the mixerer thingy. Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in
the cup of dried fruit, Pick the frigging fruit off floor... Mix on the turner.
If the fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers just pry it loose with a
drewscriver. Sample the Cuervo to check for tonsisticity. 

 Next, sift two cups of salt, or something. Who giveshz a sheet. Check the
Jose Cuervo. Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts. Add one table. Add
a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can find. Greash the oven. 

 Turn the cake tin 360 degrees and try not to fall over. Don&apos;t forget to beat
off the turner. Finally, throw the bowl through the window, finish the Cose
Juervo and make sure to put the stove in the dishwasher. 

 CHERRY MISTMAS 
 
 A blonde driving a car became lost in a
snowstorm. She didn&apos;t panic however, because she remembered what her dad had
once told her.&quot;If you ever get stuck in a snowstorm, just wait for a snow
plow to come by and follow it.&quot; 

 Sure enough, pretty soon a snow plow
came by, and she started to follow it. She followed the plow for about
forty-five minutes. 

 Finally the driver of the truck got out
and asked her what she was doing. And she explained that her dad had told her if
she ever got stuck in a snow storm, to follow a plow. 

 The driver nodded and said,&quot;Well,
I&apos;m done with the Wal-Mart parking lot, do you want to follow me over to K-Mart
now?&quot;

 An older Jewish gentleman was on the
operating table awaiting surgery and he insisted that his son, a renowned
surgeon, perform the operation. As he was about to get the anesthesia he asked
to speak to his son. 

 &quot;Yes Dad! , what is it?&quot; 

 &quot;Don&apos;t be nervous, son; do your
best and just remember, if it doesn&apos;t go well, if something happens to me ...
your mother is going to come and live with you and your wife.&quot; 
 
 There
were two Roman Catholic boys, Timothy Murphy and An-
tonio Secola whose lives paralleled each other in amazing
ways. In the same year Timothy was born in Ireland, Antonio
was born in Italy. Faithfully, they attended parochial school
from kindergarten through their senior year in High School.

They took their vows to enter the priesthood early in college,
and upon graduation became priests. Their priestly careers
have come to amaze the world, but it was generally acknowled-
ged that Antonio was just a cut above Timothy in all respects.
Their rise through the ranks of Bishop, Archbishop, and finally
Cardinal was meteoric to say the least, and the Catholic world
knew that when the present Pope died, it would be either Timothy 
or Antonio who would become the next Pope.

In time the Pope did die, and the College of Cardinals went
to work. In less time than anyone expected smoke rose from
the chimney and the world waited to see who they had chosen.

The world, Catholic, Protestant and secular, was surprised to
learn that Timothy Murphy had been elected Pope. Antonio was
beyond surprise, he was devastated because, even with all
Timothy&apos;s giftedness, Antonio knew he was the better qualified.

With a gall that shocked the Cardinals, Antonio asked for a
private session with them in which he candidly asked,&quot;Why
Timothy?&apos;

After long silence one old Cardinal took pity on the bewil-
dered Antonio and rose to reply,&quot;We knew you were the better
of the two, but we just could not bear the thought of the
leader of the Roman Catholic Church being called Pope Secola.&quot; 
 
 A very successful lawyer parked his
brand new Lexus in front of the office, ready to show it off to his colleagues.
As he got out, a truck came along, too close to the curb, and completely tore
off the driver&apos;s door of the Lexus. 

 The counselor immediately grabbed his
cell phone, dialed 911, and it wasn&apos;t more than 5 minutes before a policeman
pulled up. 

 Before the cop had a chance to ask any
questions, the lawyer started screaming hysterically. His Lexus, which he had
just picked up the day before, was now completely ruined and would never be the
same, no matter how the body shop tried to make it new again. 

 After the lawyer finally wound down
from his rant, the cop shook his head in disgust and disbelief.&quot;I can&apos;t
believe how materialistic you lawyers are,&quot;he said.&quot;You are so
focused on your possessions that you neglect the most important things in
life.&quot; 

 &quot;How can you say such a
thing?&quot;asked the lawyer. 

 The cop replied,&quot;My God, don&apos;t
you even realize that your left arm is missing? It got ripped off when the truck
hit you!!!&quot; 

 &quot;My God!&quot;screamed the
lawyer.

 The day finally arrived.   Forest Gump dies and goes to Heaven. He is at the Pearly Gates, met by
St. Peter himself. However, the gates are closed and Forest approaches
 the Gatekeeper.    St. Peter says,&quot;Well, Forest, it&apos;s
 certainly good to see you. We have
heard a lot about you. I must tell you, though, that the place is
 filling
up fast, and we&apos;ve been administering an entrance examination for
everyone. The test is short, but you have to pass it before you can get
 into Heaven.   Forest responds,&quot;It sure is good
 to be here St. Peter, sir. But nobody
ever told me about any entrance exam. sure hope the test isn&apos;t too hard;
life was a big enough test as it was.&quot;    St. Peter goes on,&quot;Yes, I know,
 Forest, but the test is only three questions. First: What two days of
 the week begin with the letter T? Second: How many seconds are there in a
 year? Third: ! What is God&apos;s first name?&quot;   Forest leaves to think the questions
 over. He returns the next day and
sees St. Peter who waves him up and says,&quot;Now that you have had a chance
to think the questions over, tell me your answers.&quot;   Forest says,&quot;Well, the first one
 -- which two days in the week begin
with the letter &apos;&apos;T?&quot; Shucks, that one&apos;s easy. That&apos;d be
 Today and
Tomorrow.&quot;   The Saint&apos;s eyes open wide and he
 exclaims,&quot;Forest, that&apos;&apos;s not what I
was thinking, but you do have a point, and I guess I didn&apos;t specify, so
I&apos;&apos;ll give you credit for that answer.   How about the next one?&quot; asks
 St. Peter. &quot;How many seconds in a year?&quot;
&quot;Twelve.&quot; Said Forest   Astounded, St. Peter says,&quot;Twelve? Twelve!? Forest, how in Heaven&apos;s
name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?&quot;   Forest says&quot;Shucks, there&apos;s gotta
 be twelve: January 2nd, February 2nd, March 2nd...&quot;   &quot;Hold it,&quot;interrupts St.! Peter. &quot;I see where you&apos;re going with this,
and I see your point, though that wasn&apos;t quite what I had in
mind.....but I&apos;ll have to give you credit for that one, too.   Let&apos;s go on with the third and final
 question. Can you tell me God&apos;s first name?   &quot;Sure&quot;Forest replied,&quot;it&apos;s Andy.&quot;   Andy?!&quot; exclaimed an
 exasperated and frustrated St. Peter. &quot;OK, I can
understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions,
but just how in the world did you come up with the name Andy as the first name
 of God?&quot;   &quot;Shucks, that was the easiest one
 of all,&quot;Forest replied. &quot;I learnt it
from the song...&quot;ANDY WALKS WITH ME, ANDY TALKS WITH
ME, ANDY TELLS ME I AM HIS OWN. . . .&quot;   St. Peter opened the Pearly Gates and
 said:&quot;Run Forest, run&quot;.

 Swedish joke forwarded by Dr. Wolff 

 A
northern Minnesota construction site boss was interviewing men for a job, when
along came a Swede. I&apos;m not hiring any Swedes, the foreman thought to himself,
so he made up a test to avoid hiring the Swede without getting into an argument.

&quot;Here&apos;s your first question,&quot;the foreman said.&quot;Without using
numbers, represent the number 9.&quot;

&quot;Without numbers?&quot;the Swede says.&quot;Dat is easy,&quot;and
proceeds to draw three trees.

&quot;What&apos;s this?&quot;the boss asks.

&quot;&apos;Ave you got no brain? Tree and tree and tree make nine,&quot;says the Swede.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot;says the boss.

&quot;Here&apos;s your second question. Use the same rules, but this time the number
is 99.&quot;

The Swede stares into space for a while, then picks up the picture that he has
just drawn and makes a smudge on each tree.

&quot;&apos;ere you go.&quot;

The boss scratches his head and says,&quot;How on earth do you get that to
represent 99?&quot;

&quot;Each of da trees is dirty now! So it&apos;s dirty tree, and dirty tree, and
dirty tree. Dat is 99.&quot;

The boss is getting worried he&apos;s going to have to hire this Swede, so he says,&quot;All right, last question. Same rules again, but represent the number
100.&quot;

The Swede stares into space some more, then he picks up the picture again and
makes a little mark at the base of each tree, and says,&quot;Ere you go. One
hundred.&quot;

The boss looks at the attempt.&quot;You must be nuts if you think that
represents a hundred.&quot;

The Swede leans forward and points to the marks at the base of each tree,and
says,&quot;A little dog come along and craps by each tree. So now you got dirty
tree and a turd, dirty tree and a turd, and dirty tree and a turd, which make
one hundred. So when I start?&quot;

I was performing a complete physical, including the visual acuity test. I placed

I requested. There was silence. He couldn&apos;t even read the large E on the top
line. I
turned and discovered that he had done exactly what I had asked; he was standing
there with both his eyes covered. I was laughing too hard to finish the
exam.

breakfast this morning?&quot; &quot;It&apos;s very good, except for the

replied. I then asked to see the jelly and the woman produced a foil packet
labeled&quot;KY Jelly.&quot;
--Dr. Leonard Kransdorf, Detroit, MI

And Finally . . . .

A new, young MD doing his residency in OB was quite embarrassed performing
female pelvic exams. To cover his embarrassment he had unconsciously formed a
habit of whistling softly.  The middle aged lady upon whom he was
performing this exam suddenly burst out laughing and further embarrassed him. He looked up from
his work and sheepishly said,&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Was I tickling you?&quot; She replied,&quot;No doctor, but the song you were whistling was, &apos;I wish
I was an Oscar Meyer Wiener.&quot;
