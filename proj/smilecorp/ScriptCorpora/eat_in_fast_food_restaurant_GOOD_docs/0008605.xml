Safety in Guangzhou / A Visit to Foshan (with the message)
Sorry for the blank message that I posted. Just a wrong button being pressed and the entire message that I spent half an hour to write is gone. Now I need to rewrite the whole thing from scratch. Moderator: Please delete my previous topic.

I will be visiting Guangzhou two weeks later to attend a conference. This is going to be my first visit to the city. I will spend my spare time to go for sightseeing. FYI, I&apos;m an overseas Chinese male who speak fluent Mandarin and clumsy Cantonese (but I would rather not to speak the latter). I&apos;m going to travel alone all the way.

I need some advice on several matters,

(1) Safety issue - GZ is arguably the Chinese city with the highest crime rate. I&apos;ve come across news reports on serious cases from time to time. A friend told me that a walk on the crowded&quot;Nui Ren Jie&quot;(Ladies&apos; Street) may attract groups of robbers surrounding you even in the daylight, and you can&apos;t do anything (unless you are a kungfu master) but give them whatever valuables you have. Are there any special safety precautions to visit there? Also, is it safe to take cabs?

(2) I will lodge in a so-called 4-star hotel within a university campus where the conference will be held. Is it safe if I leave my laptop in my guestroom when I&apos;m away? Having visited a couple of other Chinese cities for several times in the past, I&apos;ve constantly be advised not to leave any valuable belonging in hotel room. I even came across a notice of the local police department in a hotel guestroom (in a 3-star hotel in Beijing ), advising the same thing. However, it&apos;s going to be troublesome and perhaps unsafe as well if I bring along my laptop (about 2kg but still ...) with me for sightseeing. So, if neither way is 100% safe, which way is safer?

(3) I&apos;m planning to visit the nearby Foshan (a suburb of GZ?), the hometown of Wong Fei Hong (if you know who he is ... but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any place of interest related to him). What is the best way to travel from GZ city center to the town? I&apos;m inclined to take a train (is it safe anyway?) but my friend advised me that it is not expensive to take a cab either (RMB2 per km, and the travel distance is less than 40km). On the other hand, is Foshan safer than GZ city center or is there different kind of precaution that I need to take?

Appreciate your advice. Thank you in anticipation!

Train Guangzhou &gt; Foshan isn&apos;t very frequent and Foshan Station isn&apos;t in the city centre.

Bus isn&apos;t bad at all, leaving every 15 minutes or so from the Liuhua Station right across from the main Guangzhou rail station.

Foshan will probably seem safer to you than Guangzhou. But as always in China, watch for pickpockets and such.

Take a taxi to Foshan . It&apos;s not far and saves you the worry about looking around all the time.
Keep banging those rocks together, guys.

There isn&apos;t much interesting sightseeing at Guangzhou .
No safety precuations but to be careful all the times. Busy streets can be dangerous, not to mention quiet places.
If you are not familiar with the buses, don&apos;t take local buses. Take taxi which is more safe and fast. Taxis are safe, just don&apos;t take non-licenced taxis. Don&apos;t talk mobile phones on the streets. Don&apos;t paranoid anyway.

Put your valuable stuff in a safe, the hotel may have it. Otherwise carry it in the bag with you all the times, don&apos;t show it out oftenly.

 Foshan is officially another city but is closely linked to Guangzhou. Foshan is not particularly interesting, but yeah, there&apos;s some martial arts stuff&quot;Wing Chun?&quot;, Po Chi Lam?

If you are staying at a 4 star hotel, they will have a safe deposit area. Ask when you check in. When you leave the hotel, leave your laptop in the safe deposit area of the hotel, and make sure they give you a receipt. Each time you go out, just take enough cash for the day, plus one credit card. That way, if the worst happens, you have another credit card (I hope) and more money back at your hotel. Divide your cash up into smaller amounts and separate them from each other. Put the card and the money inside some clothing at the bottom of your bag, and lock the bag when you leave the room. Most hotel staff in 4 star hotels value their job too much to steal anything, but you should not tempt them by leaving valuable things in plain view. Of course, when you go out, keep your valuables in a money belt underneath your clothing,with only the day&apos;s money easily accessible. Lastly, don&apos;t stress too much and ruin your trip. If you are sensible, you won&apos;t have trouble.

Thanks a lot for your advices. They are quite useful.

marttwo, what is meant by&quot;don&apos;t stress too much and ruin your trip&quot;?

889, I thought the Foshan train station is located within the old town center where the&quot;Anchestral Temple&quot;is within walking distance. According to my friend in Hong Kong , the temple is a must go. I&apos;m thinking of visiting Bruce Lee&apos;s Residence but I don&apos;t know where it is. I understand that there are&quot;tourism bus lines&quot;in Foshan. Are they worth taking? What if I take taxi to commute within the city all the way?

On the other hand, is it worth a trip to Baiyun Shan Park? Okay to take a cab? It seems a bit inaccessible (or the area is too big?).

As a history buff, I&apos;m also interested in Huangpu Military School. But I think it&apos;s even farther as compared to Foshan. Anybody familiar with this?

The Ancestral Temple is spot in the centre of Foshan and is worth a visit if you&apos;re in Foshan, but it&apos;s not practical to walk there from the train station. Even the bus station is maybe a 15-minute walk to the temple. But there are convenient city buses that tie everything together: not sure about&quot;tourist buses&quot;as such.

I lived in GZ for 4 years and think that warnings of danger are amusing. I always felt safe there. I&apos;m a tall blonde Canadian female. Since you are Chinese, you&apos;ll just blend in the crowd and not seem like a &apos;mark&apos;. Use a money belt inside your clothes and you&apos;ll be fine. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s more unsafe than other places in China or other parts of the world, for that matter. But do be careful crossing the streets.

When I visited FoShan from GZ my friends and I took a taxi. You could take a train and then a taxi from the station. The Ancestral Temple IS worth a visit. They often have performances of martial arts, Chinese opera and lion dancers. Seeing the porcelain factories and the paper cut museum is also worth your time. You can do it all in half a day.
 FoShan pics 

The main problem with cabs is that drivers will try to pass off counterfeit cash. Make sure you have correct change. Otherwise the cabs are fine. Not all will want to make the long trip to FoShan so it might take a bit of time finding one that will. Ask at your hotel...someone there might have a friend interested in taking you for the day.

I would leave your laptop with the front desk. Or a 4 star hotel might have a safe in the room you can use. During conferences, I&apos;ve seen a great many laptops for sale in front of the hotel the conference is at. Don&apos;t leave it unattended in a fast food restaurant or cafe.

Other good things to see in GZ are the Chen Family Temple, the Nanyue King Tomb south of the China Hotel , Shamian Island , and there are some excellent restaurants all over the city. Baiyun Mountain is okay, but very busy on weekends.

Google Wong Fei Hong and you will see there are websites that say there is a museum dedicated to him in FoShan. I didn&apos;t find the exact address.

Here&apos;s more info:

Have a good trip!

Thanks again for the advices. I did find out about the museum dedicated to Wong Fei Hong, but it&apos;s located in a suburb. Since I only plan for a day trip, I need to be selective in the places to visit. However, it seems that Ancestral Temple is a must. As a film buff, I will also prioritize Bruce Lee and Wong Fei Hong unless the time and distance do not permit me to visit these places.

And yes, Nanyue King Tomb and Shamian are also in my&quot;hunting list&quot;, as I should have 3 full free-and-easy days (minus Foshan , I will still have 2 days) for myself in GZ. I used to put Chen Family Temple at a low priority but maybe I should visit it after all. Looking forward to Beijing Road (or Peking Road?), old houses at Xiguan, Sacred Church, and maybe Wong Tai Sin, Huaisheng Temple, Hong Xiuquan Residence, Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall ... Well, a bit too greedy.

I used to travela alone in the two Italian cities with the highest crime rate - Rome and Naples - and I survived, with the similar precautions that you guys have advised. Thanks for making me more confident in enjoying the trip. BTW, an ex-student of mine (I&apos;m teaching in the university) who was born in Guangdong Province told me that the city center of GZ is relatively safer since their city authorities ban motorcycles from entering the area. However, I wonder if that means the suburb will be more dangerous ...

Motorcycle purse-snatching is no more in GZ , it&apos;s true.
I really don&apos;t think you need to be worried about the &apos;burbs.

You can easily travel around GZ by Metro which is fast, cheap and safe. Beijing Lu is not all that great for shopping, actually. It&apos;s full of men asking if you want to buy watches. The area around LiWan Plaza is much better. This is just east of ChangShouLu Metro Station. Haizhu Square market is good for shopping as well. Shamian and Qing Ping Market is reached by getting off at HuangSha Metro Stop.

Have a good time in GZ.
cheers from Ruth

As for Crime in China relative to Guangzhou , it is the only place where I have encountered any experience. My camera was lifted from my closed camera bag (Velcro sealed) while walking down the street by an old woman beggar. Was skillfully done under my nose without missing my stride. How she got it defies my senses. So be prepared for such situations and keep your guard up even for situations that seem innocuous.
Ready!... Fire!.... Aim!!!

Thanks again!

&gt;Beijing Lu is not all that great for shopping, actually.

What the road attracts me, as described on the web, is that it&apos;s a millennium-old road (remember, I&apos;m a history buff). However, has it become way too modernized nowadays?

&gt;My camera was lifted from my closed camera bag (Velcro sealed) while walking down the street by an old woman beggar. Was skillfully done under my nose without missing my stride.

Point noted. I received a similar advised by my ex-Italian colleague before I visited Naples last year. I was safe all the way and instead, when I proceeded to Sicily , I met a young man from the UK whose passport, money and credit card where he kept in his travel bag were stolen when he got up a train.

I suppose it should be a lot safer if I keep my money, passport and credit card in a money belt under my shirt, which I always do when I go for backpacking - robbery is a different story, though.

For the&quot;old shopping street&quot;experience -- such as it is in today&apos;s China -- you&apos;ll want to visit Shangxia Jiu Lu. Do this in the early evening, when the shop signs are lit and the crowds dense.

On the other hand, I quite like taking photos when I&apos;m going for tours - even just ordinary street snapshots. I set the record of taking more than 500 photos within a day when I visited Yunnan last year. I wonder if that will attract criminals&apos; attentions.

There is a section in the middle of the pedestrian walking mall on Beijing Lu just south of ZhongShan Lu where you can see bits of the old road with plexiglass over it. You&apos;ll have to dodge the Coke vendor stands to see them though.

My husband has happily taken 1000 photos a day and never attracted criminals.
