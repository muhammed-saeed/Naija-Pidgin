 ★★★★★ With sympathy 
 Justa N. 5 Wooden Goose Cafe 
 
There was a tragic death in the immediate family today and that is why the restaurant is closed. I don&apos;t know what the family plans are for reopening.

Closed until Further Notice!!!

This is what a sign found on their Door on 12/11/2008 reads.

I have eaten here once and found it a bit pricey but you got a good amount of food that wasn&apos;t too bad.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Slow service, rude employees, but the food is ok 
Anonymous 1 Wooden Goose Cafe 
 
I had been a patron of the Wooden Goose for many years. There food has always been good and their service a little on the slow side. My most recent experience there was very bad. The waitress got angry when I asked (after 20 minutes, which she acknowledged) if our order was about ready. Two tables of people, who arrived after our party ordered and received their food, ate it and left - and our food still had not arrived.After 30 minutes we finally went to the cash-register and asked for the bill as we were running out of time. The waitress became irritated all over again. I asked to speak to the manager, who said if I wanted food faster I should go to McDonalds! He defended his cooks and waitress saying they were working hard. I can not recommend this establishment to anyone. I know people who are regulars and seem to like it. Perhaps you have to be a &apos;regular&apos; customer to get normal service and a civil attitude. Maybe their regular patrons can carry their business.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Snobby and Rude 
 C.C. R. 1 Wooden Goose Cafe 
 
I totally agree with the other rating. The review that says how good it is, and the only con is that it closes at 2pm, was obviously written by the owner, or an employee.

I am quite surprised that this place is still in business. Definately their&quot;stick&quot;is to be as rude as possible, and to let you know that you are inconvienincing them with any and all requests.

Smiles are non existent, and if you don&apos;t smile, and don&apos;t talk back, you will have a much better chance of being honored enough to get a coffee re-fill. But, if you smile, and ask for a refill, don&apos;t be surprised to be asked to leave.

Yes, they really do refuse service and request. A good friend of mine asked to&quot;try&quot;a spoon full of the tuna salad ( to see how much mayo was used ) and was absolutely denied. They will no longer return.

If you have not been here, I would recommend you go, just so you can see that I am not exagerrating here, then you can help to spread the bad word about this incredibly rude resturant.

 ★★☆☆☆ Less Than Pleasant 
Anonymous 2 Wooden Goose Cafe 
 
My father and I stopped at the Wooden Goose Cafe on a Sunday morning and walked away with a not-so-good attitude toward the establishment.

Upon entering, we noticed a few dirty tables and the hostess was assisting a customer, so we waited...and waited...and waited to even be acknowledged. Five minutes passed as we watched her help two customers sitting at the bar-style table and run someone&apos;s credit card. Then, we were told that we would get a table in a few minutes, but the food would take about 35 minutes after we ordered because the kitchen couldn&apos;t keep up with the orders.

We stuck around anyway, and as we waited for our table, we noticed a sign that emphasized that if we wanted our food to arrive quickly, we should visit a fast food restaurant, McDonalds or Culver&apos;s, which was down the road. It also said the staff was doing the best they could do. To me, that meant that the service was not about to improve, so deal with your losses. I found this extremely rude and snobby.

We finally got a table, ordered coffee, and were given menus containing some fairly overpriced items. The menu also states,&quot;We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone...&amp;anything!!&quot;Seemed strange...

After placing the order, the waitress did not come back to the table to refill our coffee or ask if we needed anything. I finally had to speak up to get a refill. We also waited the anticipated 35 minutes for breakfast.

The food arrived warm and tasted decent, but not worth the money. My french toast was a bit soggy and flat, but I ate it anyway. The waitress didn&apos;t come back until my father was finished eating and I was waiting for a box. She dropped off the bill and bid us a good day.

There is no way I would re-visit the establishment considering that I felt offended and mistreated
by their poor service. Maybe just one smile from any staff member would have made the experience a little pleasant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and there are plenty of better places for breakfast in the area.

Pros: Hot coffee
Cons: LONG wait for meal, rude service, overpriced menu

 ★★★★★ Awesome Breakfast!!! 
 K A. | Insider Expert
| Rank: 11,161 5 Wooden Goose Cafe 
 
My wife and I visited this cute diner in Mequon for breakfast. We sat in the sun by the southern windows and enjoyed the variety of geese items in the restaurant. The breakfast which consisted of eggs and a very unique potato were absolutely outstanding. The cinnamon roll was by far the best I&apos;ve ever had (enough for 2 people by the way!). It was warm, soft and the cream cheese was dripping off of it. With the freshly brewed coffee we were in heaven! This place rocks for breakfast!!

PROS: Perfectly cooked eggs and cinnamon roll was heavenly
CONS: Closes at 2pm.
