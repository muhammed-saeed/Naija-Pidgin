3 Fast Family Casual Restaurants in Chicago That Are Worth a Visit

 By Alton Rush 
 
There is a whole new segment of the restaurant industry that is embracing the concept of good, casual food prepared quickly and served to you at a table. With real plates and utensils. I for one am very happy with this development. I&apos;ve never liked to eat my food out of a greasy paper sack. Not that you can really call most of what you get at fast food restaurant &quot;food.&quot;

 Here Are 3 Delicious Non-Chain, Fast-Casual Restaurants to Try in Chicago 

 Mizrahi Grill 

The menu here is kosher -- with Israeli appetizers, salads, meals and sandwiches.

Be sure to try Grandma&apos;s kubeh or the falafel sandwich. The grilled chicken breast sandwich is also quite good.

The pita sandwiches come stuffed with the usual suspects but also includes cabbage salad, pickles and fries.

Mizrahi Grill is located at 215 Skokie Valley Road in Highland Park

 Chickpea 

Isn&apos;t that a cute name for this hip Palestinian spot? Gotta love that name.

Look for Middle Eastern appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees on the menu. Plus ask about &quot;Mama&apos;s Special&quot; of the day.

Try the kibbeh with yogurt, cucumber and mint salad also with laham ma hummus. Or maybe the falafel plate and the stuffed grape leaves.

Don&apos;t miss the Arabic posters for American movies on the walls.

Chickpea is at 2018 West Chicago

 Wishbone 

Wishbone is a cozy little place that dishes up some big Southern favorites. Corn cakes, cheese grits with shrimp and plump crab cakes had me thinking of NaLeans with every mouthful. Don&apos;t miss the hoe cakes or pecan topped sweet potatoes. Heavenly.

The desserts are from below the Mason Dixon line, too. Peach cobbler and chocolate pecan pie are my personal choices. Don&apos;t bother to decide. Just order both.

Wishborn is at 6611 West Roosevelt in Berwyn
 
Alton Rush (that&apos;s me) loves to eat, loves Chicago and write about both. In that order. When I am traveling I like to carry my essentials in a backpack. I choose a JanSport Backpack because they are built for comfort and built to last.

Check out my favorite, the JanSport Right Pack and see if it isn&apos;t the Right Pack for you, too.

That was kinda clever, wasn&apos;t it?
