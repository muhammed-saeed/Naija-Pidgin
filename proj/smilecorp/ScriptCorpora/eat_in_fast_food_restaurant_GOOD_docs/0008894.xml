Fast Food Chain Is Trading Coffee For Canned Goods in Ozarks
 Article | October 30, 2008 - 3:23pm | By Jamie Givens A local food bank is teaming up with an international burger joint to help feed needy families in the Ozarks. KSMU’s Jamie Givens reports. The currency most people use when paying at a fast food restaurant consists of dollar bills or coins. But for the next three weeks, one chain is accepting cans of food in exchange for a cup-of-joe. Ozarks Food Harvest has joined forces with McDonald’s to give customers coffee in exchange for food items that will be used to help feed individuals struggling to put food on their own tables in the Ozarks. Denise Gibson is a spokesperson for Ozarks Food Harvest. “For any consumer that comes through the drive-in or steps into a McDonalds and brings a non-perishable food item, a canned good or a couple of canned goods, they will give that customer a free McCafe coffee.” Customers will be able to get their coffee for almost an entire month. The“Cans for Coffee”promotion begins November 1 st and will last through November 23 rd . More than 60 local McDonald’s will be participating in the“Cans for Coffee”drive. Gibson says McDonald’s and Ozarks Food Harvest have found a unique way to inform customers about the food bank and its programs. “There are going to be specially designed tray liners. So, there will be thousands of tray liners that have been created that talk about the promotion and have a picture of our mobile food pantry on it. And talks about Ozarks Food Harvest and briefly mentions some of our children’s feeding programs. So, that will be great exposure for us as people are getting their trays of food inside the stores.” For those non-coffee drinkers, hot chocolate is an alternative option. For KSMU News, I’m Jamie Givens.
