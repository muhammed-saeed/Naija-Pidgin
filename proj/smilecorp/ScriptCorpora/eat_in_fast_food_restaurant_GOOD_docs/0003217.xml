 Fast Food Solutions For The Holidays 

 BIGrigdave Healthy Eating Wellness 2 Comments 
 
 For a truck driver working holidays is very common. One thing that makes working on holidays incredibly hard is when you can’t find a place to eat. On holidays many places close and forget about the truck drivers that may be working.

If you’re a driver your only alternative may be to visit a fast food restaurant. Here are some places that serve slightly healthier menu items so you don’t have eat something dripping in grease like this chili burger.

 Subway Restaurants 
Probably the healthiest of all the fast-food chains, Subway offers a variety of sandwiches that are 6 grams of fat or less. Just ask the attendant and they will show you all the options. We suggest the turkey breast or Veggie sub loaded with crisp veggies and your favorite fat-free dressings and condiments.

 Arby’s 
With several salads and wraps on the menu, Arby’s offers a wide range of healthy alternatives to burger and fries. The healthiest? The chopped turkey club salad is loaded with roast ham, turkey, lettuce, chopped bacon, onion, tomato, and cheddar cheese and is only 233 calories without dressing.

 Burger King 
The famed Whopper Jr. burger is just 380 calories if ordered without cheese and mayo. But if you’ve ever ordered a Whopper Jr., you know how small they are! So to fill you up, also order their garden salad with chicken and a fat-free or reduced fat dressing.

 Kentucky Fried Chicken 
Yep! We just listed KFC. That’s because KFC now offers delicious grilled chicken! You can also order one of their healthy sides such as green beans, a side salad, corn on the cob, and rice. This can be way better for you than a box of Twinkies from the c-store.

 McDonald’s 
Like many of its fast-food counterparts, McDonald’s also offers a wide range of salads on its menu but steer clear of anything with fried chicken; instead, order your salads with grilled chicken. Other healthier options include the basic hamburger (just 250 calories) or the grilled Snack Wraps (just 260 calories).

Hope fully this list gives you some ideas for when you are out and about. We wish you happy holidays.

 Foods That Will Help You Sleep 

 BIGrigdave Healthy Eating , Trucking Jobs Wellness 1 Comment 
 
 

Trucking Jobs keep drivers on a busy schedule that can sometimes be unpredictable. That schedule can sometimes leave a driver wide awake during his or her rest time. This is a list of foods a truck drivers can eat that will help them get rest when they need it.

A little back ground first. Just about everyone knows that they if they eat a big meal that is loaded with fats they will most likely need a nap shortly after. That is because meals like that are filled with foods that rank high on the Glycemic Index. They are however, not recommended for individuals that are watching what they eat or for those with diabetes. Instead this list covers healthy foods that can induce sleep.

Eat these four healthy foods to induce sleep:

 Cherries fresh or dried.
 Cherries contain melatonin which helps the body regulate sleep. 
 Small amount of warm milk.
 A small glass of milk is loaded with tryptophan. A small portion will help promote sleep. 
 Whole wheat toast or English muffin.
 A small serving will speed up the body’s release of tryptophan and serotonin. 
 Bananas
 Potassium and magnesium are natural muscle relaxants, and bananas are a good source of both. 
 

This is a list of foods that should be available at truck stops or Walmart stores across the country. When you’re an over the road truck driver getting good rest is one of the keys to being a safe truck driver. When it is time to rest eating these foods before bed can help you get the sleep you need.
