Novice Amateur Hunt Seat Equitation Over Fences
 Story by Laura Stevens | Photo by Jessica Hein | Paint Horse Journal | November 2, 2011 

 
 
 Michaella Gallina of Lakewood, Colorado, pilots Sacredhopesndreams through the course to win a world championship in Novice Amateur Hunt Seat Equitation Over Fences. 

 Michaella Gallina realizes a dream with a world championship win on Sacredhopesndreams. 

 When a summer injury forced stall rest, Michaella Gallina wasn’t sure she and her brown tobiano gelding Sacredhopesndreams would be ready for the 2011 APHA World Championship Show, but Michaella’s teammates at White Harvest Farm in Brighton, Colorado, encouraged her to show. The decision proved fortunate when Michaella and &quot;Calvin&quot; rode out of the John Justin arena with the Novice Amateur Hunt Seat Equitation Over Fences world title. The Paint Horse Journal spoke to Michaella after her second class, Amateur Equitation Over Fences, in which she finished reserve. 

 Q: Congratulations! How does it feel to win a world championship? 

 Michaella: It’s such a good feeling. I’ve been through a lot with my horse this year, and he is the biggest sweetheart ever. He has a heart of gold. I am just so happy that he totes me around.

 Q: Is this your first world championship? 

 Michaella: This is my second. I won the Novice Amateur Working Hunter in 2009 with my horse A Sacred Cause. I was absolutely in love with her, but she ended up dying overnight in a freak accident in her stall not too long after we’d won the world.

 Q: How did you come to own Calvin? 

 Michaella: I thought my mare was my once-in-a-lifetime horse. After my mare died, I was moping around the barn, and my trainer Karen [Banister] said,“I know the horse you need to ride. You need to be on Calvin.”She bred and raised Calvin. So I rode him a lot after that, and when the people who owned him were ready to sell, I took him in a heartbeat. I bought him in July, and it’s so wonderful to have such a broke horse that takes care of you.

 Q: What was your plan riding into the arena? 

 Michaella: I get in the zone, so I have to consciously listen for my trainer. I had a really great warm up on him this morning, he was just a superstar so I felt really confident going in. I mentally rehearse my rounds several times. I turned it on when we got in the arena.

 Q: What’s up next for you and Calvin? 

 Michaella: Tomorrow I have the working hunter. I have a very demanding job, so I flew in last night, but I have to go to work on Friday so I’m flying back down Saturday to do the equitation on the flat.

 Q: We heard Karen say you are buying dinner. How are you going to celebrate your win? 

 Michaella: Calvin is going to get a lot of Cheez-Its. Those are his favorite snack. I have to thank Karen and everyone at White Harvest Farm so much. Karen found me the right horse, and she gave me the confidence to come down here with him. She is the best, so I have to thank her for all her support.

 Q: Was this a last-minute decision to attend? 

 Michaella: Very last minute! We pre-entered, I really planned on coming but he got injured the last weekend of August. He had been laid up since then. It’s hard with him, because he has a heart of gold so he will keep trying even when he’s hurt. So it was a long, long battle. We did everything we could to rehab him and we tested him out last Sunday. Karen was leaving for the show Monday morning at 4, and I was at the barn Sunday at 6:30 p.m. and I didn’t have anything packed--literally nothing--and I live 45 minutes away. Katie, one of the other girls who’s down here said,“He looks phenomenal! You’d be crazy not to take him.”So I said OK, drove home to get my stuff, loaded everything late that night and here we are. It really turned out well!

 Q: What is your favorite thing about Calvin? 
 Michaella: He is just a big puppy dog. He is 17.2hh but he is a gentle giant. I’ve never met a horse so willing to please who just wants to be loved on. I am just so happy, I couldn’t be happier with Calvin .
