Among those fleeing are Kurds, Albanians, Macedonians, and many from the former Soviet Union, Pakistan and Afghanistan - all dreaming of a better future in the West. To get there, they are willing to do anything, even if it means sacrificing a kidney or other organ, or their personal dignity.

 Graco booster seat Lyon 

 Advantages: Easy to fit, transportable
 Disadvantages: Doesn&apos;t look too comft...though my son doesn&apos;t mind!


...When my husband and I split up I was left needing a car seat for my son which could be used in my mums car because I do not drive but knew there would be occasions when she would be driving us places and such like. We looked around and ordered a Graco lyon booster seat off the mothercare website because I had used a Graco travel system when my son was a baby and was familiar with the brand and also more importantly I trusted the brand too.

The booster seat came packaged in a cardboard box but when we got it out of the box from memory I don?t remember there being any assembly required because this booster seat is just a bog standard one rather than one of those with the back rests too. The actual car seat is a tough dark grey plastic which has a red material seat with the Graco name in black. The seat has two arm rests for the child...

Review of Graco Booster Seat Lyon 
 
 Lyon- France&apos;s alternative city break. 

 Advantages: Wonderful city
 Disadvantages: Pollution


...Introduction

As some of you may or may not know, as part of my degree, I study an element of French language in preparation for the third year I will spend in France next year. My likely destination is Lyon and as such I decided it would be worth taking a trip to Lyon to explore what the city had to offer and get my bearings a little before I actually attended the university next year.

Lyon is situated in the Rhone- Alpes region of France, which lies in the east close to the Swiss border. It is surrounded, unsurprisingly, by the Alps and is not very far away in fact from Europe&apos;s biggest mountain, Mont Blanc. It is in fact France&apos;s second biggest city residing close to St. Etienne and Geneva (in Switzerland). So I and my fiance (who will also join me in Lyon next year) took a visit to the place.

How to get there...

Review of Lyon (France) 
 
 A-part Great, A-part Just OK 

 Advantages: Kitchens, rooms that take up to 4 people, free wifi
 Disadvantages: Handheld showers, not enough mirrors


...stop several times (great goat&apos;s cheese salads and pizzas) and also to Rouge restaurant next to the fountains which is far better than it looks from the outside and has some excellent value buffet and set menu options (even for vegetarians, of whom we know France is far from fond). 

We were comfortable here for 2 nights and it is a hotel I would recommend as even though you might not want to cook, having the fridge is very welcome, and the ability to accommodate up to 4 people in one room is a bonus. It may look far out on the map, but it&apos;s really not, and it&apos;s much better value than some of the more central places. 


The website 

http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-8418-adagio-a ccess-lyon-ex-citea/room.shtml 

has some photos that look exactly like the rooms we stayed in - almost unheard of for a hotel website! 

Part of the Accor chain...
