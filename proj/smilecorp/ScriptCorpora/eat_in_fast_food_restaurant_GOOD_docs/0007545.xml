 May 18, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Pamela ( 1 review ) Since executive chef Will Artley has started working there the food has been excellent. The main attraction is European style pizza (great for eat in but not to travel since its European style) but the rest of the food is amazing also. Rissoto,scallops, mussels, octopus, pork belly, beet and carot salad, dessert all deliscious. Fancy food at low prices and a casual atmosphere. Can&apos;t wait to go back. September 2, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Norry ( 120 reviews ) &quot;Better than 2 Amys!&quot;that&apos;s what I would like to say after trying the Capriccioza here at Orso for the first time today. I loved the dough, tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, fresh mushroom, fresh artichoke, ham, olives everything. Maybe the last time I had such good Pizza was at&quot;Da Baffetto&quot;in Roma. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 28, 2011 Great Pizza by FaithinDC ( 15 reviews ) I think trying a new restaurant has definitely been my favorite on-going goals that I&apos;ve had to accomplish each month.

Now, most of you know that I actually don&apos;t eat dairy or gluten (I&apos;m not highly allergic, I just think it&apos;s healthier to keep these to a minimum) - so pizza isn&apos;t exactly the best food for me to eat, BUT I had to make an exception for the highly-rated wood-fired pizzeria! Pizzeria Orso is known as a casual dining restaurant with traditional neopolitan pizza. It is quite a charming place, filled with hues of yellow, red, and oranges. Very bright decor - which I love, because we all know I LOVE bright colors. We were greeted and seated immediately. I&apos;d have to say my first observation was that this restaurant definitely caters to families. There were kids everywhere. My first thought was&quot;please don&apos;t sit us next to these kids&quot;. (Hmmm...I see a little of my mom in me more and more!) The last time I was in a restaurant that was inundated with families probably would date back to the best Italian place in all of Williamsport, called The Villa. I mean, let&apos;s be real, Washingtonians in my age range don&apos;t exactly go to family-friendly restaurants all the time. No, we&apos;re all about the newest lounges were you can get overpriced cocktails, appetizers, and sit in comfy chairs while you discuss things like how much you miss college, how life is so&quot;expensive&quot;, and how the jerk on the metro wouldn&apos;t stop breathing heavy on you or something ridiculous like that. Or, on the contrary, we like the bars - ones with lots of TVs, where our minds can be so over-stimulated with sports, or ones that have the best happy hour deals ($2 drinks - heck yes!). I mean, you don&apos;t exactly see 4-yr-olds running around these DC hot-spots. They sat us at a cute table and our waitress came over to give us menus. I rarely eat pizza, maybe once a year, so this was going to be a treat for me. The menu had a wide variety of food, such as, neapolitan pizza, antipasti, house made charcuterie, fried appetizers, desserts and, of course, a plethora of wine and beer to choose from. I&apos;m a big fan of restaurants that use food and ingredients from local markets - it&apos;s fresher and saves everyone money, while helping local Ma&amp;Pa businesses. Pizzeria Orso&apos;s pizzas are served unsliced, and finished with olive oil, and the mozzarella is locally produced by Blue Ridge Farms in Leesburg, VA. At just around $15, I ordered the Verdure Pizza, made with tomato, mozzarella, onion, crimini mushroom, peppers, basil, eggplant, capers (hold the capers, please!). I loved this Pizza - it had all my favorite ingredients piled high with an excellent crust and perfect amount of cheese. What&apos;s even better for us nutrition freaks (like Me!) is that it&apos;s not this overly enormous pizza. It&apos;s just the right size to get your fix but not feel like you have to go hike the Appalachian mountains to make up for it. Plus, I&apos;ve got my veggies and calcium, right? Let&apos;s just not talk about all the bread involved :). This pizza was delicious and I don&apos;t really know how to word this, but it was very easy to eat. Do you ever have a pizza where the cheese falls off in one big sheet? Or, the sauce is so overpowering that it ruins the crust? Well, this was not. Every bite had the perfect blend of cheese, sauce, savory crust, and veggies. Of course, like every other American out there, I thought I&apos;d for sure eat half and box the rest up. Yeah, that didn&apos;t happen. 7 slices in and my grandmother would have been beyond proud that I left my plate looking like it came right out of the dishwasher. Growing up, my mom never let us leave the table unless we were done. My poor brother would shove food in his cheeks for HOURS just so he could leave the table (oh the good ol&apos; days of being a kid!). But, the pizza was SOOOO good that I just had to savor every bit and finish the entire thing. The great thing was the portion was a medium size - it wasn&apos;t like a pizza you order from Papa John&apos;s or anything. It was small enough to eat in one sitting (Yes, this is me justifying the fact that I finished a whole pizza in one sitting). Additionally, Callie ordered a very yummy pizza, called The Crudo, a pizza made with tomato, mozzarella, basil, arugula, Grana Padano, and prosciutto di Parma. The combination of cheeses was superb and the added flavor of the prosciutto gave this pizza an extra kick. Depending on your pizza style, there&apos;s definitely an option for you at Pizzeria Orso. I love my pizza with tons of veggies and cheese, but if you choose to have a classic, more traditional pizza, you can have that, too! Overall, for the pizza alone, Callie and I both gave it a two thumbs up and we want to go back there again. ...Now, of course it doesn&apos;t stop there. I had indulge a little in the desserts, too. When I choose to write about a restaurant, I have to give my readers the full review from entree to dessert. Not to mention, who doesn&apos;t love a little excuse to eat something sweet after a meal. There were about four different desserts on the menu, but the one that was most intriguing to me was the Lemon Doughnuts filled with Nutella. 1) I secretly love donuts. I don&apos;t always have them, but when I do it&apos;s a nice treat. 2) Lemon flavor is one of my favorites - so refreshing, tangy, and sweet! Furthermore, the waitress raved about these lemon doughnuts, so I had to try it out! A cute little canoe-shaped plate came out with three warm mini-donuts, stuffed and topped with Nutella icing and sprinkled with powder sugar. THEY WERE DELICIOUS! They were so mouth-watering good, completed melted in your mouth. I&apos;ve never really had a dessert like this before. Normally, I&apos;ll have a piece of cake or creme brulee, but never Lemon Doughnuts! Overall, I was a big fan of this little pizzeria. It&apos;s great if you&apos;re looking for something quick, inexpensive, yummy, and moderately healthy, I recommend Pizzeria Orso in Falls Church, VA. Next time you want a piece of pizza, grab a friend and head on down to these little secret hideaway! June 30, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Out of dough by pim1950 ( 4 reviews ) Made this a destination for dinner. Arrived about 7:50 on a Wed nite and were told they were out of pizza dough. Go figure--a pizza restaurant out of dough. Guess I&apos;ll have to call ahead next time to see if they have dough. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful May 31, 2011 Really likes it Two Amy&apos;s who? by fairfax foodie ( 1 review ) Pizzeria Orso has become my new favorite restaurant. Before I discovered this fabulous place, I went to Two Amy&apos;s in DC for my neopolitan pizza, and loved it every time. I have to say, Orso has out-done them. The service and ambiance is wonderful, but the pizza is outstanding. The dough is perfectly cooked, and their in-house cured anchovies on the crust is my favorite part. They&apos;re only $1 for a generous side! Although I have tried quite a few, the Orso is my favorite pizza. Pancetta, with ricotta, mozzarella, Grana Padano, fontina, Pecorino Toscano, garlic, prosciutto di Parma is a genius combination. Not to overshadow the small plates though, my favorite being the &apos;special&apos; bone marrow crostini. It is to die for. The desserts are also fabulous. The lemon donuts with nutella are amazing, and I am not a nutella fan. The cannolis are not your traditional kind, but are great as well. I recently ordered a dessert off the specials which was my favorite, whipped ricotta with fresh strawberries and a lavendar honey crumble. Perfection. Pizzeria Orso can do no harm. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 27, 2010 Likes it Just like Napoli! by Vinnie1855 ( 5 reviews ) My wife and I have eaten at the home of pizza in Naples Italy. This is Very close to that quality! It&apos;s also like having Two Amys closer to home! December 27, 2010 Really likes it Amazing Pizza by jrlj ( 4 reviews ) We&apos;ve always loved 2 Amy&apos;s and really like Pupatella, but I think I like Pizzeria Orso more! We did not like the bruschetta, loved the pizza (margherita and cotto e funghi), and really loved the&quot;suppli al telefono.&quot;They were patient with our somewhat unruly children and brought them crayons/coloring pages and bread. June 30, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Sharon Tewksbury-Bloom ( 1 review ) They were out of dough because they got multiple great reviews today&amp;the dough takes 36 hrs of prep so they were hit by surprise. We stuck around anyways&amp;had delicious antipastis&amp;Left Hand Stout on tap! February 12, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Joey ( 1 review ) Staff was great and offered great suggestions. Food was wonderful and very much comparable to Two Amys in DC. Nice atmosphere and offered comfortable dining accomodations. I would recommend this as a great date night or special occasion as it is a little pricey for a&quot;pizza place&quot; January 8, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Don&apos;t Forget the Tums! And Keep your Receipt! by Zelda B. ( 1 review ) The atmosphere at this Pizza place is good. However, the pizza is underwhelming and highly overpriced. The sauce is thin and tastes a little better than tomato paste from the jar and the dough is chewy. The first and last time I went there with my boyfriend we charged twice for the tip. My boyfriend was lucky to make it home with clothes intact due to gastric distress from the pizza. There are much better pizza places in Falls Church to eat, don&apos;t choose this one. August 30, 2010 Likes it Great Pizza by gellystromeyer ( 3 reviews ) The pizza and service were great. It reminded me of pizza from Milan and 2 Amys! September 29, 2010 Likes it Great Service by Tracy ( 1 review ) My husband and I dined at the bar and found the service provided by Jose to be top notch. When I wasn&apos;t sure which wine I wanted he lined up glasses and gave me taste samples and with one glance at our pizza saw that it was missing the sauce and sent it back (a new pizza arrived within minutes). We also enjoyed talking with Kevin, one of the pizza chefs, about the menu and some of his recommendations. What do I recommend? The fennel salad! August 22, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Very Disappointed by janegroth2000 ( 1 review ) I had read several admiring reviews of this restaurant and how it equalled 2 Amys. I sure didn&apos;t see it. The lemonades we ordered tasted right out of a Minute Maid container. The mixed salad was good and the dressing was the best thing we had. My pizza (Crudo, recommended in some review) was so undercooked and slippery, the toppings fell off when you tried to eat it. The supposedly great crust seemed undercooked and gummy. The tomato sauce tasted like Campbell&apos;s tomato soup. The service was ok. We won&apos;t be going back there again and Peter Pastan has nothing to worry about.
