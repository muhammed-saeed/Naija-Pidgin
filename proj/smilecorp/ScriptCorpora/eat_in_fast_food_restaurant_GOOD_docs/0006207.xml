 March 27, 2012 Likes it Good Food by GeorgiaDawg316 ( 103 reviews ) I love the seafood here the Fried Shrimp is awesome good service frindly staff great atmosphere 2 out of 2 found this review helpful June 29, 2012 Great shrimp by SRICHASON ( 2 reviews ) Fried Shrimp -
My girlfriends&amp;I tried this place for a lunch outing . It was very good! The shrimp was fried in a light batter, but you could choose grilled or blackened as well. You get two sides, I chose a loaded baked potato&amp;green salad. The salad was bagged salad, nothing special. But for 7.50, I enjoyed it , we plan on going back! April 2, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Kenny ( 10 reviews ) I&apos;ve been going to the cutting board on a regular basis for over a year, but I have say that the quality of the food has dropped off over the last 4 months. I&apos;ve noticed that the quality of the ribeye steaks aren&apos;t as tasty and the size has dropped off. On my last visit, dining utinsils are cheap and flimsy. My steak knife was shimmering cause the blade is very thin. They have new owners who I have seen belittle employees out in the dining area and they give me strange looks everytime I come in. Don&apos;t know if it&apos;s my nationality or the way I dress. My last visit has convinced me that this is now an average restaurant that doesn&apos;t warrant the drive from Pensacola. February 16, 2012 by Will.i.E ( 100 reviews ) I wish Urbanspoon had an&quot;On the Fence&quot;button hahaha… Had lunch here with my girlfriend due to recommendations she read on the web. It was late afternoon, so it was fairly slow and we were seated right away. I ordered the loaded seafood potato and my girlfriend had a few sides (cheese grits, green beans, sweet potato tots, baked potato). I didn&apos;t like my potato. The concept of a loaded seafood potato is a wonderful idea, but the cook/chef missed the mark on preparing it. The crawfish and shrimp in the potato were dry, the cheese was melted, but seemed like it was sitting under a heating lamp for quite some time, and the fish (trigger fish) was almost non existent in the dish. My girlfriend is a vegetarian, so she had a few veg friendly sides. To our surprise, the green beans and grits had bacon in them. We didn&apos;t complain, but were just a bit confused because I personally never had bacon in green beans or grits. I ate the grits and they were good, but the green beans were clearly straight from a can  I&apos;d have to come back a couple more times and try different dishes to really say if&quot;I like it&quot;or&quot;I don&apos;t&quot;. April 19, 2012 Likes it Best Restaurant in Pace! by Tina H ( 3 reviews ) We have now eaten here twice and love it so much! Found it on accident driving around one sunny afternoon. We have the very fresh oysters, flounder, hamburger, butterfly shrimp, loaded baked potatoe, french fries, alll soo yummy and the service is tip top! Friendly waitresses , friendly everybody! We have dined at Landrys and the Seafood grill in downtown Pensacola and at Chets- these guys kick all their buts! Do NOT waste your money at Landrys! They are not worth it- terrible food and all the staff seems depressed because the managers treat people like garbage. January 27, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by The Apple ( 30 reviews ) Oysters so fresh, they were almost sweet, and at .40 each, a great way to start an excellent meal. Tasty, well prepared local seafood, good steaks, and a pretty good bread pudding to top it off = a place we&apos;ll certainly visit again!

The Manager never offered to take it off our bill...Although our server was great and got her 10.00 tip i made me so mad about the Poor Customer Service we yet again recieved there we WILL Never go back...Sad uh? after all this time of going and as Bussiness Owners ourselves.

August 13, 2010 Likes it Oh and... by Leah Joyner ( 45 reviews ) I had the blackened redfish one night and it too was sooo tasty! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful +1 more review from Leah Joyner August 13, 2010 Loved it! Had the sirloin with the grits and it was so yummy. Oysters were great also! Reasonable prices....always packed so hopefully they will stick around!!! November 21, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Not that good! by Arnold Newton ( 29 reviews ) Having read all the glowing reviews, my wife and I gave this place a try. The food was OK, nothing special. The service was bad. The prices were average. Don&apos;t see anything special here to deserve the good reviews. I&apos;d say average at best. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful January 6, 2011 Perfect for Pace by Amber Nelson ( 1 review ) To say my experience was lovely would be an understatement. Home style feel with home cooked meals, The Cutting Board is prime choice for Santa Rosa County. A wide variety of taste and plates from five to fifteen dollars is great for any meal or occasion. Our meal consisted of fried pickles for an appetizer, ceaser salad and half pound burgers. I elected the bbq bacon cheddar burger and was surprised when asked what temp I would like it cooked, as many restaurants do not give you the option these days. I like my burgers medium, and it was served perfect temp. Our server was prompt, friendly and efficient through out the dinning experience. We were also greeted with a smile as we entered and left. As a cultured patron to the hospitality industry, I would say The Cutting Board in Pace will be a land mark for ages to come. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful February 26, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Terrrible Service by Kristina ( 1 review ) We went to the cutting board last night and this was by far not our first time. We have frequented there often because we could get in and out quickly with good food and service at a reasonable price. With new ownership comes a new sub standard service. We were seated in within 10 minutes of arrival. We ordered our meal as soon as our drink order was taken. It took over ten minutes to get our drink and our food came over 45 minutes from the time we ordered. We were not the only ones waiting an extremely long time as the table next to us also waited an extended period of time. The waitress never updated us on our food status over this long period of time. Another disturbing event was to see the owner confront an employee at the bar in front of all the patrons to see. Very very unprofessional. The food was still pretty good overall but the wait and bad service overshadowed the food. If things don&apos;t change I can&apos;t see The Cutting Board making it. January 29, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Pearce Daley ( 3 reviews ) Great food and great value. We will definitely stop here next time we&apos;re through Pensacola. January 28, 2012 Likes it Fabulous by Sandy Hawthorne Moore ( 1 review ) We went there for Dinner too celebrate my daughter and son in-laws birthdays and my mother and father in-laws 63rd wedding anniversary. In our party were 8 adults and a teenager. We ordered many different menu items, and everyone agreed that food was fabulous; it was timely, great price and great taste. Waston our waiter was simply the best. After dinner was over Weston brought out The Cutting Boards famous Key Lime torte, to honor my mother and father in-law, of course they were to full to eat it then and took it home... If you want a great meal, with great price, and service. I would recommend The Cutting Board February 21, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by susie ( 5 reviews ) Visiting for the weekend and had to back and eat here again.

The Cutting Board will be my regular lunch spot. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful February 25, 2011 Likes it Great Place! by Sherry ( 1 review ) Steaks cut daily in house, and seafood prepared fresh in house also. Nothing prepared, frozen and shipped in! Not a fast food restaurant, orders cooked when placed, so they arrive to the table hot and delicious. The owners are very friendly and personable, but extremely busy as they are hands on owners. There is almost always a waiting line, but the food and whole dining experience is worth waiting for. It is a family restaurant, and children are treated well. You can eat lunch (a full meal) as cheaply as you can have a burger at a drive thru restaurant. A crown jewel in Pace, and we are so lucky to have this place. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful February 1, 2011 Really likes it Mobile review by Lisa Strength ( 1 review ) Wonderful family place. Good food for varied tastes. Great service. Daily specials. We are frequent returnies. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful November 22, 2010 Likes it Premier restaurant by Steve ( 1 review ) The Cutting Board is certainly one of Northwest Florida&apos;s premier restaurants. Great food, great service at reasonable prices. Often I am asked to recommend restaurants for clients and vendors visiting from out of town. The Cutting Board always receives their 100% approval. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful June 20, 2010 Best Food and Service by kmbbrown ( 1 review ) Awesome food and service. Raymond was a great server. The food was even better - great protions and great prices. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The seafood was fresh - I have never seen bigger oysters in my life. The Mango Pie rocked. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful
