		Summer Jobs: Bad, Good, Better, Best 
 
   

 During the
 summer, high school students are either worried about what they might do
 during the summer or how theyre going to get money for that car they want,
 the fast food they want to eat, or that great trip they have planned. People want the best jobs, but some people get what someone might call the
 worst job in Brunswick. I asked a few Brunswick High students and they
 all agreed that the best job would be to get paid for doing absolutely
 nothing. But the average person would also agree that that job would be
 virtually impossible to find.  

             

 After
 surveying some students about their opinions and personal experiences with
 jobs, I found that students felt that most fast food restaurants would be one
 of the worst. A sophomore commented that the fast food restaurant
 Zaxbys is very stressful and pay is not adequate or fulfilling to her
 needs. A senior quit her job as a cashier and hostess at a local
 restaurant after being sexually harassed by customers at the bar. One
 student, who chooses to be unnamed, works for a septic cleaner
 establishment. If one thought he/she had a bad job, there are worse
 jobs out there.

 Although
 there are some pretty gross, nasty, and no-fun jobs out there, there are also
 some good jobs that are the complete opposite. A co-worker of mine and
 sophomore at Brantley County High School said that Summer Waves Water Park was a satisfying job, both as a Guest Relations Representative and on the
 Lifeguard staff. Summer Waves now has a new job position as a DJ for
 the water park. The DJs get to go to all the local events and broadcast
 from there as a representative for Summer Waves. If you get the job
 they offer you a $10,000 scholarship for college. A summer job cant
 get any better than that.

 Best Summer Jobs 

   
 
 According
 to an informal sample of students I asked, for most people the best summer
 job would be to be outside and around water and be in the sun, 

   

 For Haley
 W., her summer job is a summer model She said I really like the pay,
 and I like for people to take pictures of me. I love to try on the new
 clothes. 

   

 Brandon
 D.s summer job is to be a tip-top mechanic I like to work on cars, I
 like to make the engines run smoothly, and I like to make them look good
 too, Brandon stated. 

   

 My best summer
 job would be at an ice cream parlor, Mrs. Tharin said. I love to be in cool
 places, and it is fun to snack on the ice cream. It is also is a favorite
 places for people to hang out. 

   

 Mr.
 Brewers favorite summer job would be a lifeguard. He also said It would be
 fun because I would be outside and get to learn C.P.R. and how to save
 someones life. Knowing how to do C.P.R and skills to save someones life are
 great things to know. 

   

 Y-Quelia
 said her summer job should have to be Summer Waves. I like to be around
 people, and I love to make money, not to mention being around the cute
 boys.  

   

   
 
 
 
 Now Kritsti
 S. summer job is a bit different because she chose to go on a mission
 trip. I like to meet new people and work hard with my youth
 leader/boss who is really fun to work around, but the most important aspect
 of the job is that I get to work with and for God, Kristi stated.

 The WORST Summer Jobs 

   
 
 Yesterday
 morning, I interviewed some people about what their worst summer job would
 be, and I got a variety of responses. Nicole B, a curly-haired, tall sophomore,
 said her worst summer job would have to be working at a nursing home. Jared
 N. said, My worst summer job would be babysitting, because when parents made
 plans and needed my babysitting services, it would interrupt my own
 plans. Wesley C. said My worst job would be any kind, because that
 would mean I would have to get off the couch and go do something! La
 Toya N. said Cleaning yards would have to be mine because it would be hot
 and sweaty..  

   

 My worst summer
 job would have to be cleaning hotels. I would rather work somewhere else than
 cleaning up someone elses mess. There are many different types of jobs
 which no one likes to do, but someone has to do them. Unfortunately,
 teenagers qualify for some of those jobs.
