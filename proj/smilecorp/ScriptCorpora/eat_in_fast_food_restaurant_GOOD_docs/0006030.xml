mini-food recipes/ideas needed
 
We&apos;re hosting an engagement cocktail party and wanted to make mini-foods. The idea came as the bride-to-be is very fond of mini burgers. Any ideas/recipes for other appropriate dishes to make? Would prefer things that hold up well during the course of a 3-4 hr party. Thanks!

We had great success with mini meatball subs at a potluck. We made mini meatballs ahead of time which we kept warm with sauce in a crockpot during the party. On the side we had sub rolls topped with cheese; pre-cut into mini sub portions. It was a huge hit!

Also what about wraps cut up into bite size pieces? A big hit right now would be turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo - mini Thanksgiving bites

These are blatantly ripped off from my former employer, a white tablecloth catering firm, but with respect...

Mini&quot;quesadillias&quot;- Cut out 3&quot;Circles from corn or flour tortillia, fill with queso fresco and chorizo, fold in half, quick sear in a nonstick pan with some oil and Viola!

Mini&quot;grilled cheese&quot;
buy&quot;ribbon cut&quot;bread- sliced the longway, not up&amp;down- make giant grilled cheese sandwiches, then cut into 1&quot;squares.

Mini club sandwiches-
Find Petridge Farm ultra thin sliced bread, combine with relevant fillings, cut to size.

Those are some quickies, I hope it helps... more fun thatn pigs in a blanket, at anyrate!

Mini quiches- so easy to make using premade pastry shells or ready made pie crusts (the kind you roll out yourself) prssed into mini muffin cups if you don&apos;t want to make your own crsut. The filling combinations are endless and most are as good at room temp as they are warm.

I recently made mini-cheesecakes for a dinner party. Since I didn&apos;t want to shell out for mini-springform pans, I experimented with muffin pans and 6 oz. ramekins. The muffin pans made 2-inch cheesecakes, and the ramekins 3-inch cakes. I imagine mini-muffin pans would work as well. (If you want straight sides, bake, cool, and then trim with a biscuit cutter.) Of course, you have to adjust the baking time. For example, when using the muffin cups, a recipe that called for 50 minutes of baking for a full 9-inch cake took only 12 minutes.

For desserts, consider looking at Flo Braker&apos;s Sweet Miniatures, which is a wonderful book.

I&apos;m still waiting for the party at which I&apos;ll serve these, but I want to do mini corn dogs: cocktail weenies, with toothpicks for sticks, dipped in the same commercial batter the guys at the fair use (available as a mix at restaurant/catering outlet stores, like Smart&amp;Final).

The frozen mini-quiches you can get at these places, BTW, are almost as good as the ones I&apos;ve made from scratch (lacking only the really good bacon I insist on), and I think actually cheaper! Heck of a lot easier, too...

There was a local fast food restaurant that served these when I was little... they weren&apos;t on a stick, but they were so good! They used a whole wheat batter and I used to just eat the batter off!

I made miniature muffulattas for a party in September. Usually they are dinner plate sized. We made the rolls for them more burger bun sized and then assembled and cut into quarters. They were really tasty.

I made poki on a mini ice cream cone (chopped sashimi grade tuna with sesame oil, chopped green onions, soy sauce, and Tabasco). For the cone I just use any waffle recipe without the vanilla or sugar. Spoon the poki on top of the mini cone and shape the poki round so it looks like a little ice cream cone. Sprinkle white and black toasted sesame seeds to make the jimmy effect. To hold these little cute ice cream cone, I just use a big bowl and fill it with raw wild rice mix with white rice and stick the cone into the rice mixture.

 re: theSauce 
This sounds like an excellent way for us mere mortals to create French Laundry-style cornets. I take it you use a waffle cone or pizzelle iron? I&apos;m going to have to try this some time.

 re: Jennifer 
Yep, I got the idea from French Laundry&apos;s famous black sesame seed tuile with salmon tartare, red onion creme fraiche and chive topping.

Mine is more of Asian influence and actually uses white&amp;black sesame and tuna rather than salmon. Below is my tuiles recipe and instructions.

4 Oz. Butter
2 Oz. Powdered Sugar
1/2 Cup Egg Whites
4 Oz. Cake Flour
1 Tsp. Toasted Sesame Seeds black and white
1 Tsp. Furi Kakee (Japanese Spice Mix, optional)
Salt to Taste

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

2. Grease a flat cookie sheet with food release spray (Pam).

3. In a bowl, whip butter&amp;powdered sugar together until light&amp;fluffy. Add egg whites, then flour; mix slowly until a smooth semi-runny batter forms.

4. spread a thin layer of batter forming a circle about 3 inches in diameter.

I find it a lot easier to make a template using a piece of heavier stock paper 80lbs paper stock. Fold the paper in half, use scissors to cut a half circle (so when you unfold the paper it makes a full circle). Place the paper template on the cookie sheet and spread with a butter knife or spatula. This will give you a perfect circle without fussing with the spatula too much.

5. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and Furi Kakee.

6. Bake till golden brown (about 6-8 minutes).

7. Remove from oven: Using a spatula, carefully pick up Tuile and roll into a cone with the sesame seed on the outside. Shaping must be done quickly while the cookie is still hot because the Tuile becomes crispy when cooled.

I suppose you can use waffle cone or pizzelle iron for this.

As for the tuna, dice 6 oz. sashimi grade hamachi (yellow) or maguro (regular red) tuna to small pieces.

1 Tsp mayo (If you don&apos;t like mayo use 2 Tsp. of sesame oil)
1 Tsp. Sesame Oil
2 Tbsp. Green Onions (finely chopped )
1/2 Ttsp. Sambal chili paste or the one that comes in a squeeze bottle at Vietnamese pho place (optional, adjust heat accordingly. If your guest cant take the heat you can sub for wasabi)
Lightly mix fish with the rest of the ingredients in a bowl.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

For crunch factor I like to add diced cucumber in at the bottom of the cone and top it off with tuna. It&apos;s that element of suprise.

You don&apos;t have to use raw fish, seared meats will work just as well.

 re: theSauce 
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. And your presentation in the photo is striking and gorgeous. Will definitely have to try it sometime soon. Also seems like there is a lot of potential for fun experimentation (a sweet/savory Moroccan version, or a medley of dessert variations). Thanks for the inspiration!

This sounds like fun! Some thoughts: mini crabcakes, twice-baked new potatoes, cream soups served in shot glasses, crudités platter using baby vegetables (baby squash&amp;bell peppers, young carrots&amp;asparagus).

Michael Chiarello (Food Network-Easy Entertaining) did a&quot;Little Bitty Bites&quot;show with mini burgers, mini pizzas, asparagus soup in espresso cups, and tiny banana splits. (I haven&apos;t tried the recipes.) http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_mo/episode/0,1976,FOOD_14518_38628,00.html 

And the book Finger Food by Elsa Petersen-Schepelern includes a number of interesting miniature foods. (Again, I haven&apos;t tried these.) http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/spe...

Another one. Fill Chinese porcelain soup spoons with cooked creme brulee (see recipe below).

1-1/2 cups heavy (whipping) cream
1/4 cup of your favorite fresh fruit, pureed
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
3 egg yolks
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon unsalted butter

In a heavy, medium pan over very low heat, bring the cream to a low simmer. Add the fresh fruit puree and lemon juice and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and strain through 2 layers of cheesecloth into a small bowl, pressing down on the pulp with the back of a spoon to extract all the liquid.

In a double boiler over simmering water, whisk yolks and sugar together and cook until very thick, about 5 minutes. Place the pan in a bowl of ice water, gently stirring the egg mixture. Stir in the infused cream and butter until blended. Remove from the ice bath, pour in spoons, cover, and refrigerate.

Sprinkle sugar and use blow torche to crystalize the sugar 1/2 hour before serving.

Mini Rueben sandwiches on cocktail rye bread, mini tacos, mini bagels and lox and I have always wanted to do mini savory cheese cakes using the recipe linked below. I&apos;d check the library for Martha Stewart&apos;s Appetizer Handbook, there are a lot of mini ideas in the book.

What you could do also is to take some quail, cut it up like a fryer chicken, batter and deep-fry - they will look and taste like miniature fried chicken.

Here is a sandwich idea too - take some super-tiny hot rolls, and make quarter-sized burgers. Add slices of pearl onion, cherry or grape tomatoes, baby lettuce leaf, and if you like them, sliced cornichons. Serve with those Durkee potato sticks to look like micro burger and fries.
