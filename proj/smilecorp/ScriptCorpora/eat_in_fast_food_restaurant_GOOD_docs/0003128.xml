The Early Word: Otarian

 Otarian invites you to judge its food by its cover. 
 

If you&apos;ve ever stopped to wonder what a restaurant created in a joint effort between some Simpsons writers, a bored McDonald&apos;s mid-level executive, and a rogue band of profit-minded Hare Krishnas might look like, then Otarian might be for you.

Otarian bills itself as the world&apos;s first low-carbon restaurant, and serves an entirely vegetarian menu. It is also the first outpost of a planned chain, and thus can be described as the world&apos;s first low-carbon, vegetarian fast-food chain. A couple of weeks ago, Radhika Oswal, the founder of Otarian, told us about her vision for the Bleecker Street restaurant (though she was less generous with details about her own remarkably high-carbon lifestyle).

And Otarian is indeed a vision, a bright, relentlessly cheerful place where an LCD screen broadcasts vegetarian propaganda on endless loop (&quot;the world&apos;s livestock create 13 billion tons of manure -- that&apos;s 35,616 Empire State Buildings!&quot;), cashiers end each transaction with &quot;thank-you for saving the world, one Otarian meal at a time!&quot;, and all of the food packaging informs you that it can be composted. Top 40 tunes, the kind you might listen to in a high school weight room, are broadcast from the speakers.
 


 
 The Tandoori wrap, unwrapped. 
 

Ordering off of Otarian&apos;s menu is a slightly paradoxical affair: everything is packaged just like it would be in a regular fast-food restaurant, and workers slide the burgers, wraps, and other items down a metal slide, just like they do at McDonald&apos;s. The Tandoori mushroom and paneer wrap, for example, is packaged almost exactly like a McDonald&apos;s apple pie, yet its packaging is compostable.

And unlike at McDonald&apos;s, everything on Otarian&apos;s menu advertises its carbon footprint and that of its meat equivalent. The Tandoori wrap&apos;s carbon footprint is .91 kg, compared with the 2.03 kg a toasted beef burrito inflicts upon the planet. The wrap&apos;s $7.25 price tag is higher than anything found under the Golden Arches -- Otarian may bill its menu as vegetarian fast-food, but its prices betray its loftier aspirations. Lunch for two people came to $29.51; considering that you can get a similar deal at places with prix fixe menus and tablecloths, it was a bit difficult to swallow.

Fortunately, the food was not. Admittedly, we didn&apos;t have the highest expectations for the restaurant&apos;s brand of &quot;global&quot; cuisine, which is a mishmash of wraps, veggie burgers, pastas, and vaguely Indian-inspired dishes. But we were still pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the ingredients and their generally successful transformation into things you&apos;d actually want to eat.

The vegan spinach and pea soup ($6.45 for a small) was thick, hearty, and well-seasoned, and tasted exceedingly fresh. It had a rich, vegetal funk to it, and was as good a pea soup as you can hope for at any restaurant, fast-food, vegetarian, or otherwise.

The aforementioned Tandoori wrap was similarly satisfying, if a bit shy with actual Indian spices. But the paneer was pleasingly dense and slightly tart, and the flatbread was substantial, flakey, and had character. The wrap came with a cucumber dipping sauce, which was weirdly metallic -- a better option was just to dip the sandwich in the pea soup.

Otarian offers three veggie burgers. The Tex Mex ($7.95) most closely approximates the kind of meaty excess of an actual burger (though its carbon footprint is 1.59kg, compared to a Tex Mex beef burger&apos;s 2.28 kg), and comes loaded with guac, salsa, barbecue sauce, cheese, and lettuce. Squished between a whole-wheat bun, it was junky and satisfying, kind of a cross between a Sloppy Joe, a taco, and a burger. Carnivores would no doubt scoff at it, but vegetarians, small children, or drunks in need of something substantial to fill their stomachs will most likely treat it as a grease-stained love letter sent from a benevolent god.

Looks like Otarian is involved with work VISA fraud in Australia now:&quot;A trail of documents and emails show Dr Moghe was hired last year by Oswal Projects to tutor Oswal&apos;s 12-year-old daughter Vasundhara in Perth to help her win admission to the exclusive Lawrence School in India.

But the company allegedly gained approval from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for Dr Moghe to work as a chef -- and the working visa was granted on that basis.

Dr Moghe, who has had a long career as a teacher in India, says he never worked as a chef while in Australia.

Oswal said Dr Moghe had applied for a position as a chef with Otarian, the vegetarian restaurant business run by his wife Radhika, but admitted that he went on to work as a tutor while in Australia.&quot;Source: The Australian

I just read a few other posts on here. Cool I checked it out again. Keep it up
 
Cudos on this post buddy. You&apos;ve got a a great blog here. Keep bringing us this stuff!
 
Some good observations here, my friend.
 
I concur with your belief nevertheless theres a few things I would have featured in there too.
 
I thought it seemed a lot like Danku too. They both remind me so much of Euro automats, down to the weirdly rectangular food. 

I tried the portobella burger too and thought it was really good -- I was super impressed by the quality of ingredients. The fries were those awful heart-healthy things which I hate. I think I might try the soup or veggie burger, but I would never go for any of that post-apocalyptic pellet food.

Although the quality of ingredients somewhat make up for the price, the atmosphere was so annoying that I probably will only go there once or twice more for the novelty of being able to order anything off a menu...
 
The propaganda is off-putting but... the food is really good! I had a portobella burger, which was topped by very fresh condiments, arugula, cheese, and a delicious pesto sauce. $7. 95 is a bit steep for a veggie burger, but this was delicious. The fries, I believe called&quot;sweet potato crispers,&quot;resemble those from McDonald&apos;s in thickness and color, but they are supposedly made out of sweet potatoes. The ideals and prices may be lofty, but the food is worth it. As I ate, I forgot about the layers of irony and allowed my appetite to be satiated. And while the messaging was constantly telling me I was doing something good for the environment, I felt reassured that I was doing something sufficiently bad for my body. Honestly, it&apos;s a lot like any other fast food chain, but if they do compost 90% of their waste, that&apos;s great.
 
This sounds like a cult food chain to me. As a vegetarian, I would rather order a veggie dish from an ethnic restaurant than go there. I do not need all these propaganda messages swirling around me while I eat their food. Can&apos;t imagine working there too...
