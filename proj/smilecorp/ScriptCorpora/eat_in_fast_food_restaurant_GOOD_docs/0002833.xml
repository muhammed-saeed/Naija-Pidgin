 Dear BA Foodist,

I was dining out recently and found a hair on my plate. I wanted to send the food back, but my date told me to forget about it and not to make a fuss. Needless to say, I couldn&apos;t enjoy the rest of my meal. When is it okay to send the plate back or ask for a refund?

Sheila Etchen, Louisville, Kentucky 


Dear Sheila,

I&apos;m a bit over-forgiving about unexpected items in my food. I&apos;ve found all kinds of things: a deep-fried moth and bee, live inchworms and ladybugs, rubber bands and pieces of plastic bags. I&apos;ve never found a Band-Aid--yet. But I know folks who have. The live garden bugs (which I sometimes spot in salads) don&apos;t bother me--I somehow think they are a sign of a salad&apos;s freshness, although restaurants should wash the greens better. With any of these intruders, I strategically place them on the side of the plate so that the waiter will see them. I&apos;m not expecting a free meal; I simply want to remind the staff to be on top of things. Sending a dish back because of a foreign object is a pain really--it throws off the timing of your meal. Also, you really don&apos;t know if you&apos;ll get a new dish after all.

Hair is an entirely different matter, and it can ruin even the best meal at the best restaurant. No matter how great your tolerance for &quot;tainted&quot; foods, you always have the right to send something back, and any good restaurant will either replace your dish or give you a credit on the check.

 Nichole  •  1 year 11 months ago I am with you Mrs. James. I try not to send my food back. However, finding hair in my food is a total turn off and I will send it back. I am not paying to eat hair, lol. I have been a waitress so I know how customers can get. It is stressful enough without them complaining about every single thing. I was all smiles and apologetic but inside I was screaming:) Willlow: cockroaches? OMG, I am laughing but totally disgusted as well. lovely1  •  2 years 0 months ago That is sick. Thats why I don&apos;t eat out! Amanda  •  2 years 0 months ago I&apos;m sorry, if there is something in my food that is obviously not supposed to be there-some bit of plastic or metal, bugs, hair-that food is not going to be eaten. They can bring me something else if they want to get paid. Kate154  •  2 years 0 months ago bad experiences:
1) A Mom-and-Pop restaurant: my parents and I went to for dinner and I was walking back from the bathroom, the waitress wasn&apos;t paying attention and she hit me with a plate. It was so hot because there was an extremely large fat man consuming food at a rapid pace. When I got back to my table, I saw blood on my plate and I looked at my mom about to ask her a question when she freaked out. There was a roach in her food then she saw my face. The manager saw my face and came running. He&quot;paid&quot;for our meal even though none of us ate because it had just gotten there. They went out of business a couple of weeks later. Apparently, finding&quot;little friends&quot;was not uncommon.

2) Large breakfast chain: My husband found crystallized dishsoap at the bottom of his tea glass; he kept complaining that it tasted salt until we saw the soap. He let the waitress know and he got a different drink. End of the meal, nice surprise it was free; though both of us told the manager it wasn&apos;t necessary. Yankees Fan  •  2 years 0 months ago I am a waitress so I&apos;ll give my two cents. IF THERE IS A HAIR, FLY, OR ANYTHING IN YOUR FOOD THAT SHOULDN&apos;T BE THERE, SEND IT BACK! Since I&apos;m a waitress I can be more critical of restaurants and servers, but something like that needs to be pointed out to the staff and returned or refunded. I like my customers to be happy, so I will always tell my managers to refund food if there is something in it.

Now, the only thing that bugs me is when people make too big a deal out of over cooked steak. I understand if it&apos;s UNDERcooked because some people will be grossed out, but unless it&apos;s shoe leather, let the mid-well that was supposed to be medium steak go.

I was at a restaurant a while ago and found a hair in my food, and I told my waiter who acted like that was an inconvenience for him so I asked for a manager. The manager huffed and puffed about having to get a new side dish of macaroni and cheese for me. They neither apologized or refunded the meal. I will not eat there again!

My last statement on this subject is this. There are always people who come to restaurants regularly and order the same thing each time and complain every time. Trust me, everyone there remembers you and hates you. After a certain point don&apos;t be surprised if they ask you not to return. PennyBeGood  •  2 years 0 months ago I was eating a tacos-to-go with my father and he found a hair in his taco. He was annoyed, but shrugged it off. Then he found another hair, and another, and another... He opened the taco and found a good-sized human hair ball mixed in with the meat. We couldn&apos;t finish our meal because it so disgusting to find a hair ball(!) and we got our money back. G  •  2 years 0 months ago I found broken glass in my salad once. That was weird. The manager freaked. There was no bill for that meal. Andrea  •  2 years 0 months ago My b/f and I were eating at one of our fave places several months back and as he was nearly done with his meal, I noticed something shiny on his plate that looked weird to me. I picked it up and it turned out to be a small chunk of glass? Weird we thought. Since he only had a few bites to go he didn&apos;t want to make a fuss, but I thought we should at least mention it to the waitress. I don&apos;t know, maybe something had broken in the kitchen and I thought by telling her that could prevent somebody else getting glass on their plate and choking on it or whatever. So anyways, the waitress came back to our table a short time later and I mentioned that we had found the chunk of glass on his plate and thought she should be aware of it. She took the piece of glass and apologized, but a few minutes the manager came to our table. She looked at my b/f and said&quot;you must have clanked your beer mug against your glass or somehow brought that in with you&quot;!! (it was his birthday and yes he had drank one draft beer). I could not believe the nerve of this stupid lady to actually accuse us of like planting this piece of glass on his plate or whatever!! Who knows maybe they thought we were trying to get the meal free or something? Needless to say we have not gone back there again. I should have written a letter to the owner/parent of the place, but somethings are better left alone. Rocky  •  2 years 0 months ago I bit into a hamburger at a fast food restaurant, and enjoyed the first bite, until I looked down at the burger to find a partial thumb nail with bright red polish on it...barely made it to the bathroom...needless to say, got refund, never returned... Snow Bunny  •  1 year 11 months ago I was at a&quot;diner&quot;with the band after the bar closed. I had just started eating some delicious vegetable-beef soup when a huge cockroach fell off the ceiling into my bowl. It did a few backstrokes and died. I pushed the dish to the side&amp;went on talking with my friends. When the waitress asked if there was anything wrong, I said,&quot;I think&apos;it&apos;was hungrier than me.&quot;She laughed and took it off the bill. Thank goodness I&apos;m a happy drunk! Cherokee  •  2 years 0 months ago I ask the waitress, what is the fly doing in my soup,,?she looked and replied,,looks like the&quot;back stroke&apos;,a friend at work was eating rasins,,oe flew away,,, Snow White  •  2 years 0 months ago SOme people make such a big deal to the waiter. ITs not their fault just politely let them know, what are they gona do, make you eat it? of course theyll fix it. hair isnt that bad come on...

i send it back when they dont get my order right, im payin for a satisfying service, not just what they want to give me. Constellation  •  2 years 0 months ago I found a clothing tag in the belgian waffle I was enjoying at an IHOP once. Like, the little plastic part and the cardboard tag. The server came over and asked,&quot;How is everything?&quot;And I said,&quot;Well, it was great....till I saw this.&quot;And we both quietly looked at the tag sticking out of my waffle and she said,&quot;Iew.&quot;So, she gladly took it back and they whipped me up something new. I didn&apos;t make a fuss or anything, but I certainly wasn&apos;t going to eat around it! Jamie:  •  1 year 11 months ago I don&apos;t complain at restaurants, but I will send it back if there&apos;s something odd in it. My friend got a chewed up straw in her ice water and my co-worker got a cigarette butt in her fried rice. We think the chinese restaurant was scraping uneaten food off plates they cleared from the table and someone in the smoking section has put a cigarette out in their leftover food. GROSS. Some things I can overlook, but something that is a sign that the kitchen is just poorly kept (like flies=uncovered food)I will send it back and ask for a refund and order nothing else. Lil Bear  •  2 years 0 months ago I would definitely send it back. I&apos;m not going to pay for bugs in my food when I can get fresh food at home for free! I&apos;m not one to throw a fit but if I see something inedible on my plate, I&apos;m going to ask for a new plate of food or I&apos;ll leave. Candy  •  2 years 0 months ago I found a gigantic steak bone in my chicken quesadilla once at a Ruby Tuesdays. Bout broke my tooth. Strangely though my husband is the one always finding the weird stuff.... pieces of steel wool, bones, plastic, hair... However the other day I was eating a spring roll at a chinese buffet and I&apos;m pretty sure there was a piece of octopus in it. Even though that&apos;s edible I still just about puked. I&apos;d rather find a hair. Angel  •  1 year 11 months ago If there is something in my food at all that should not be there; whether the order is wrong, or if there is a hair, bug, or any other foreign object in it, I&apos;m sending the plate back. If I am not completely grossed out, they can fix me something different, but if I am grossed out, I will not pay for the food I had to send back, and just leave. Simple as that. heather  •  2 years 0 months ago me and my boyfriend were eating at a seafood resturant and had ordered the fried shrimp basket. mine was fine but about halfway through the meal he made a face i looked up and he had a half chewed piece of shrimp held out on his fork that smelled like turd. how gross. we still dont know what it was but we couldnt eat anymore. i asked him how did it taste and he said exactly how it smells. i broke out laughing and couldnt stop we paid and left, they didnt offer any credit. needless to say we dont eat there anymore. Amanda  •  1 year 11 months ago I was at a hometown buffet and I found a dead fly in my salad. I know, not that bad, but I HATE bugs. Besides being thoroughly freaked out (It was on my fork headed to be eaten) I could have just gotten up and get a new plate and gotten more food. it was a biffet place food is left open. My parents are the ones who pointed it out, and since all of us were done- that was timing- we left. they were extremly apologetic and the entire meal was on the house. And there were 6 of us. That is service. Stil, I don&apos;t eat there anymore. Bugs scare me that much. (Won&apos;t start on when i thought it was a spider baked onto my pizza and it was just the end of the pepperoni thing. didn&apos;t eat pizza for almost a month. And that wasn&apos;t real!) A Yahoo! User  •  1 year 11 months ago Feel free to make a stink, just be aware that what will be in your food (on purpose, on the house from the staff) will be far more unappetizing and difficult to spot.

The arrogance of your average American amazes me. They think they have&quot;rights&quot;all the while constantly relying on others to serve them. Guess what... if you didn&apos;t do it for yourself and aren&apos;t paying top dollar you have no right to expect champagne treatment on a beer budget. When I spot something I don&apos;t like in my food I make a comment... only after I am not going to be served anymore food!
