Description
 This is Beijing&apos;s most famous Peking Duck restaurant, and also one of the oldest, having been established in 1864. The huge, plush dining hall is filled with diners eager to try this dish in its most authentic setting. A basic duck starts at CNY108, but the pancakes, scallions and sauces are extra. For CNY168 you can choose your bird before it is roasted, and get all the trimmings &quot;for free&quot;. The menu also has dishes made from every other part of the duck, save the quack. Beers, spirits and soft drinks are served, and there is a separate fast-food section.   No Photos Available Add Your Own Photos Image Search» See all Beijing Restaurants»   Add to Trip     Loading...

 Reviews for Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant: 18           AVERAGE OVERALL RATING SERVICE (3) FOOD (3) AMBIENCE (3.5) VALUE (2.5) Showing 1 - 10 of 18 Previous | 1 | 2 | Next Sort By: Most Recent Positive Negative Most Helpful           USER RATING Don&apos;t risk your health. By andi , 5/30/12 I ate at 2 of their locations in Beijing at least once a week, if not twice for business entertainment from oct. 2011 to january, 2012 when i was stationed in Beijing. The food was OK, nothing special.
But i developed health problems but did not make the connection. I had bloody stool which was traced to stomach ulcer. It wasn&apos;t until recently i found QuanjuDe was using garbage oil to cook their veggie dishes and various other accompaniments to the Roast Duck. Evidently, they also bought veggies preserved with Formaldehyde , a toxic, carcinogenic chemical. If you value your health, AVOID this sham restaurant at all costs. I m hoping i have not suffered long term damage ingesting their toxic food/duck. Was this review helpful?

We loved it so much and visited twice during our short 5 days trip. This time, the service is terrible, duck is just so so. I had better duck in some Chinese restaurant in New Jersey. Greatly disappointed. They charged a pot of tea for $5. Everything is additional to the duck. We ordered half duck for two people and I barley ate. They just kind of cut 1/2 duck with a lot of left on the body and they took the duck away. Never again. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 2 of 2 Yahoo! Users found this review helpful SERVICE (1) FOOD (2) AMBIENCE (3) VALUE (1)           USER RATING Overpriced By A Yahoo! Contributor , 9/23/11 This place is overpriced. The food really is not any better than the cheaper stores selling Beijing Duck, but the restuarant is pretty clean with good service. Average cost is around 150RMB per person. You can do better at that price range. This place is resting on its laurels. Was this review helpful?

Our experience in this place very bad. We come one time it was closed. A second time it was full so the restaurant send us to their duck fast food beside, it wasn&apos;t good for 120 yuan by person. For the last time we reserved and for 380 yuans they served us just little bite of duck with shrimps and another dish. We refused to eat here because when we reserved the waitress doesn&apos;t tell us that the menu wasn&apos;t only duck. The waitress didn&apos;t respect us and stand up to us during 30 minuts.
If you want to eat a really duck in beijing don&apos;t go there but here (one street after) : Minfuju Restaurant - 18 LangFang Er tiao, Dashilanr, XuanWu District of Beijing Was this review helpful?

Users found this review helpful SERVICE (5) FOOD (5) AMBIENCE (5) VALUE (5)           USER RATING Terrible service, mediocre food, very overpriced By Paul , 5/14/10 We spent a week in Beijing recently and although we were already sick of Peking Duck, we gave Quanjude a try because our friend who is a local said it is the original Peking duck restaurant in Beijing. I sincerely wish we had left our last peking duck memory at Dadong, where we ate before this! Quanjude charges more for the duck than any other Peking duck restaurant in Beijing, and then they charge you separately for each plate of sauce&amp;onion, cucumber, basket of wraps for the duck, etc! This makes it the worst value for Peking duck in Beijing.
Apart from that, service was TERRIBLE! When you order Peking Duck in Beijing, they normally carve a plate of just skin (at Quanjude they gave us a plate with just 8 pieces of skin), then a plate of skin with meat which gets wrapped w/the cucumber etc, and then the bones and remaining parts either get turned into a soup or chopped up and served for you to pick at. Since none of us enjoyed the soup at Dadong but picking the meat off the bones was yummy, we asked the waitress at Quanjude if they could chop up the remainder and serve it to us as is. But at Quanjude they normally give you the entire remaining carcass in a bag to take home and when we asked them to chop it so we could eat it now their reply was&quot;we don&apos;t have a chopping knife in the kitchen&quot;!!! What kind of kitchen at a restaurant does not have a chopping knife??? They ended up giving us plastic gloves so we could tear the carcass apart to pick at and eat, which is utterly ridiculous for the amount they are charging. There are definitely better places to have Peking duck and I don&apos;t know how this restaurant has managed to stay in business as long as it has with this kind of service. I strongly recommend you get your peking duck experience somewhere else since most places do as good or better of a job Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 2 of 3 Yahoo! Users found this review helpful SERVICE (2) FOOD (1) AMBIENCE (3) VALUE (1)           USER RATING Overpriced, Over-rated, Terrible By A Yahoo! Contributor , 1/11/10 I have lived in Beijing for 2 years and Beijing duck is one of my favorite dishes. I have tried dozens of restaurants&apos;duck and found this tourist trap to be the worst Beiing Kaoya I have ever tried. In fact, I left without finishing, and picked up some dumplings at the corner stand to satisfy my hunger.

From dry duck to sticky, inedible pancakes to limp cucumber, this place failed at every step. 

If you are here on holiday, save yourself the horrible memory and avoid Quanjude at all costs. Better to have no duck in China, then to go home and tell your friends that you have had better in your own country. There is no risk, and a completely rewarding experience, in ignoring your concierge, striking out on your own, and finding a jewel in the lane behind your hotel.

If you live here, you already know and either stopped reading earlier, or are nodding your head sagaciously. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 1 of 2 Yahoo!
