 Rights assessment is your responsibility. 
 


The Library of Congress generally does not own rights to material in 
 its collections and, therefore, cannot grant or deny permission to
 publish or otherwise distribute the material. For further rights 
 information, see &quot;Rights Information&quot; below and the Rights and 
 Restrictions Information page 
 ( http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/res/rights.html ).

 Rights Advisory : Publication may be restricted. For information see&quot;Architecture, Design, and Engineering (ADE) Drawings&quot;( http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/res/103_ade.html ). Reproduction Number : --- Call Number : ADE - UNIT 2658 [P&amp;P] Medium : 9 items : blueprint, graphite, and colored pencil ; in folder(s) 71 x 102 cm. 

 Rights assessment is your responsibility. 

 Step 1: Look in the Medium field above to 
determine whether the record is describing one drawing or more than one.
 The Architectural, Design and Engineering Drawings include records 
 for groups of drawings and single drawings.

 Step 2: Determine which category below fits the 
circumstances.

SINGLE DRAWINGS

If an image is displaying, you can download it yourself (some images 
display only as thumbnails outside the Library of Congress, but you have
 access to larger size images on site).

Alternatively, you can purchase copies of various types through 
Library of Congress Duplication Services.


 If a digital image is displaying: The qualities 
of the digital image partially depend on whether it was made from the 
original or an intermediate such as a copy negative or transparency. 
If the Reproduction Number field above includes a reproduction number 
that starts with LC-DIG..., then there is a digital image that was 
made directly from the original and is of sufficient resolution for 
most publication purposes. 

 If there is information listed in the Reproduction Number 
field above: You can use the reproduction number to purchase 
a copy from Duplication Services. It will be made from the source 
listed in the parentheses after the number. If only black-and-white
 (&quot;b&amp;w&quot;) sources are listed and you desire a copy showing color or tint (assuming the original has any), you will need to order photography of the original in color. Order photography of the original by citing the Call Number listed above and including the catalog record (&quot;About This Item&quot;) with your request. 

 If there is no information listed in the Reproduction Number
 field above: The original will have to be photographed by 
 Duplication Services. Order photography of the original by citing the 
 Call Number listed above and including the catalog record (&quot;About This 
 Item&quot;) with your request. 


Price lists, contact information, and order forms are available on the Duplication Services Web site .

GROUPS OF DRAWINGS

A selection must be made from the group:


 Try the&quot; Check for online items from this 
group &quot;link to see if any of the individual images 
in the group have been cataloged online/digitized. If so, see 
information above for single drawings. 

 If the items in the group are not online, generally you will need
 to visit the Prints&amp;Photographs Reading Room (see information 
 on service
 of architectural drawings ). 

 It is not possible to photocopy (&quot;quick copy&quot;) original 
drawings. 

 
 Call Number: ADE - UNIT 2658 [P&amp;P] Medium: 9 items : blueprint, graphite, and colored pencil ; in folder(s) 71 x 102 cm. Access Advisory: Original materials served by appointment only. 

 Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to 
 fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room 
 to view the original item(s). In some cases, a surrogate 
 (substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital 
 image, a copy print, or microfilm. 

 Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will 
 be visible on the left.) 
 
 Yes, the item is digitized. Please use the digital image in preference to requesting 
 the original. All images can be viewed at a large size 
 when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress. 
 In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available 
 when you are outside the Library of Congress because the 
 item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for 
 rights restrictions.

As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an 
 original item when a digital image is available. If you 
 have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with 
 a reference librarian. (Sometimes, the original is simply 
 too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic 
 negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also 
 easier to see online where they are presented as positive 
 images.)
 
 No, the item is not digitized. Please go to #2. 
 
 Do the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that 
 a non-digital surrogate exists, such as microfilm or copy prints? 
 
 Yes, another surrogate exists. Reference staff can direct you to this surrogate.
 
 No, another surrogate does not exist. Please go to #3. 
 
 
If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another 
 surrogate, please fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs 
 Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a 
 few minutes. Other materials require appointments for later the 
 same day or in the future. Reference staff can advise you in 
 both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served.
 

To contact Reference staff in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room, 
please use our Ask A Librarian service or 
call the reading room between 8:30 and 5:00 at 202-707-6394, and Press 3.
