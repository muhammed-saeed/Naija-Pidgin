Our Concept

Vanellis is constantly evolving to stay ahead of the rapidly changing quick service industry. We only purchase our products from the most reputable suppliers and never settle for anything less.
 
For many years, we have been serving traditional pizzas and pastas. Recently, we have added a selection of gourmet pastas and pizzas to our menu. Our pastas are always freshly prepared in front of our customers, allowing them to select the appropriate ingredients that meet their nutritional and dietary needs. We enjoy having our customers involved in making their nutritional choices. This also ensures that the food is fresh and hot!
