What to Eat Instead of Fast Food
 13 quick-fix ideas to help you drive past the drive-through. By Jeanie Lerche Davis 
WebMD Weight Loss Clinic-Feature Reviewed by Kathleen M. Zelman, MPH, RD, LD 


You&apos;re starving. The kids are starving. A cheeseburger and fries would be
the easy fix. But let&apos;s face it: a Happy Meal is not necessarily a healthy
meal. You need nutritious food you can grab fast, whether you&apos;re on the road or
have just walked into the house.

It&apos;s not an impossible dream -- at least, not with a little planning and a
few essential items in your fridge or pantry, say experts who spoke with WebMD.
Before you duck into the drive-through, try their lightning-fast tricks for
healthy meals.

Healthy Meals on Wheels

To avoid fast-food temptations, Althea Zanecosky, MS, RD, keeps an 8x12-inch
insulated cooler tucked in her car&apos;s back seat.

&quot;It&apos;s like having a mini-kitchen in your car,&quot; says Zanecosky, a
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. &quot;We pack food for every
member of the family -- bottled water, 16 oz bottles of chocolate milk, juices,
nuts, seeds, pretzels, yogurt, fruit, cereal, health bars.

&quot;It saves time, money, and it saves fat and calories. It keeps us from
eating mall food or hitting the drive-through for french fries.&quot;

Healthy Meals at Home

At home, you can assemble a healthy meal in about the time it takes you to
scoot through the drive-through.

Convenience foods -- anything frozen, canned, pre-cut, pre-washed, and
pre-bagged -- is fair game for healthy meals, says Lynn Fischer, author of Lowfat Cooking for Dummies and Quick&amp;Healthy Cooking for Dummies. &quot;Try any new product that comes out. Use everything to your advantage.

&quot;Some vegetarian burgers are very good,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;But I
don&apos;t go for turkey burgers. Unless you have a butcher grind the meat
especially for you, ground turkey often contains a lot of fat.&quot;

The French concept of accoutrement -- accessorizing -- is key for
healthy meals, Fischer tells WebMD. &quot;That means a main dish with lots of
side dishes, like a nice salad plus four or five vegetables. Your family can
get full, they&apos;re eating a lot of vegetables, and there are plenty of choices.
The kid who doesn&apos;t like the corn can eat something else.&quot;

Here are a few dinner suggestions:

 Little Dippers : Set out a &quot;party
tray&quot; of vegetables and fruits for your family, Fischer suggests. Mix it up
with interesting, lower-fat dips -- even melted chocolate and strawberries once
in a while for dessert.

 Freezer-to-Table Main Dish : &quot;For a
dinner that&apos;s ready in seven or eight minutes, start with a frozen healthy meal
like Healthy Choice or Lean Cuisine,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;They don&apos;t give
you a lot of meat, which is good.&quot; If you use a frozen-in-the-bag vegetable
dinner, don&apos;t add much meat; keep it the size of your palm, she adds. &quot;Some
huge chicken breasts are enough for two servings.&quot;

 Speedy Side Dishes : Keep frozen, canned, or
fresh veggies on hand to round out a healthy meal. &quot;A lot of frozen
vegetables are frozen fresh, right on the spot, so they still have all the
nutrients,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;Canned vegetables are also good. And you
need some fresh vegetables, like celery, carrots, and tomatoes and fresh fruits
like oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, and grapes.&quot;
