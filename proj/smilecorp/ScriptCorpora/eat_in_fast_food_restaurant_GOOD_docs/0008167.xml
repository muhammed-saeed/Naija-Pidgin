   Procrastinator&apos;s Creed... 
 You may wish to delay reading this until you have more free time. 

 I believe that if anything is worth doing, it would have been done already. I shall never move quickly, except to avoid more work or find excuses. I will never rush into a job without a lifetime of consideration. I shall meet all of my deadlines directly in proportion to the amount of bodily injury I could expect to receive from missing them. I firmly believe that tomorrow holds the possibility for new technologies, astounding discoveries, and a reprieve from my obligations. I truly believe that all deadlines are unreasonable regardless of the amount of time given. If at first I don&apos;t succeed, there is always next year. I shall always decide not to decide, unless of course I decide to change my mind. I shall always begin, start, initiate, take the first step, and/or write the first word, when I get around to it. I will never put off tomorrow, what I can forget about forever.

 Does a clean house indicate that there is a broken computer in it? Why is it that no matter what color of bubble bath you use the bubbles are always white? Is there ever a day that mattresses are not on sale? Why do people constantly return to the refrigerator with hopes that something new to eat will have materialized? On electric toasters, why do they engrave the message&quot;oneslice&quot;? How many pieces of bread do they think people are really gonna try to stuff in that slot? Why do people keep running over a string a dozen times with their vacuum cleaner, then reach down, pick it up, examine it, then put it down to give the vacuum one more chance? Why is it that no plastic garbage bag will open from the end you first try? How do those dead bugs get into those closed light fixtures? Considering all the lint you get in your dryer, if you kept drying your clothes would they eventually just disappear? When we are in the supermarket and someone rams our ankle with a shopping cart than apologizes for doing so, why do we say,&quot;It&apos;s all right?&quot;When, it isn&apos;t all right . Why is it that whenever you attempt to catch something that&apos;s falling off the table you always manage to knock something else over? Is it true that the only difference between a yard sale and a trash pickup is how close to the road the stuff is placed? In winter why do we try to keep the house as warm as it was in summer when we complained about the heat? How come we never hear father-in-law jokes? If at first you don&apos;t succeed, shouldn&apos;t you try doing it like your wife told you to do it? The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four Americans is suffering from sort of mental illness. Think of your three best friends, if they&apos;re okay, then it&apos;s you.

 Nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you realize you&apos;re wrong. I don&apos;t understand the purpose of the line,&quot;I don&apos;t need to drink to have fun.&quot;Great, no one does. But why start a fire with flint and sticks when they&apos;ve invented the lighter? I totally take back all those times I didn&apos;t want to nap when I was younger. Is it just me, or are 80% of the people in the&quot;people you may know&quot;feature on Facebook people that I do know, but I deliberately choose not to be friends with? Do you remember when you were a kid, playing Nintendo and it wouldn&apos;t work? You take the cartridge out, blow in it and that would magically fix the problem. Every kid in America did that, but how did we all know how to fix the problem? There was no internet or message boards or FAQ&apos;s. We just figured it out. 
 Today&apos;s kids are soft. There is a great need for sarcasm font. I think part of a best friend&apos;s job should be to immediately clear your computer history if you die. Was learning cursive really necessary? Lol has gone from meaning,&quot;laugh out loud&quot;to&quot;I have nothing else to say&quot;. I have a hard time deciphering the fine line between boredom and hunger. Whenever someone says&quot;I&apos;m not book smart, but I&apos;m street smart&quot;, all I hear is&quot;I&apos;m not real smart, but I&apos;m imaginary smart&quot;. How many times is it appropriate to say&quot;What?&quot;before you just nod and smile because you still didn&apos;t hear what they said? Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using &apos;as in&apos; examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss&apos;s last name to an attorney and said&quot;Yes that&apos;s G as in... (10 second lapse) ... ummm ... Goonies&quot; What would happen if I hired two private investigators to follow each other? MapQuest really needs to start their directions on #5. Pretty sure I know how to get out of my neighborhood. Obituaries would be a lot more interesting if they told you how the person died. I find it hard to believe there are actually people who get in the shower first and THEN turn on the water. Shirts get dirty. Underwear gets dirty. Pants? Pants never get dirty, and you can wear them forever. I would like to officially coin the phrase &apos;catching the swine flu&apos; to be used as a way to make fun of a friend for hooking up with an overweight woman. Example:&quot;Dave caught the swine flu last night.&quot; I can&apos;t remember the last time I wasn&apos;t at least kind of tired. Bad decisions make good stories Whenever I&apos;m Facebook stalking someone and I find out that their profile is public I feel like a kid on Christmas morning who just got the Red Ryder BB gun that I always wanted. 546 pictures? Don&apos;t mind if I do! Is it just me or do high school girls get sluttier&amp;sluttier every year? If Carmen San Diego and Waldo ever got together, their offspring would probably just be completely invisible. Why is it that during an icebreaker, when the whole room has to go around and say their name and where they are from, I get so incredibly nervous? Like I know my name, I know where I&apos;m from, this shouldn&apos;t be a problem.... You never know when it will strike, but there comes a moment at work when you&apos;ve made up your mind that you just aren&apos;t doing anything productive for the rest of the day. Can we all just agree to ignore whatever comes after DVDs? I don&apos;t want to have to restart my collection. There&apos;s no worse feeling than that millisecond you&apos;re sure you are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too far. I&apos;m always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks me if I want to save any changes to my ten page research paper that I swear I did not make any changes to. &quot;Do not machine wash or tumble dry&quot;means I will never wash this ever. hate being the one with the remote in a room full of people watching TV. There&apos;s so much pressure. &apos;I love this show, but will they judge me if I keep it on? I bet everyone is wishing we weren&apos;t watching this. It&apos;s only a matter of time before they all get up and leave the room. Will we still be friends after 
 this?&apos; I hate when I just miss a call by the last ring (Hello? Hello? Dammit!), but when I immediately call back, it rings nine times and goes to voicemail. What&apos;d you do after I didn&apos;t answer? Drop the phone and run away? I hate leaving my house confident and looking good and then not seeing anyone of importance the entire day. What a waste. When I meet a new girl, I&apos;m terrified of mentioning something she hasn&apos;t already told me but that I have learned from some light internet stalking. I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it&apos;s on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes. Why is a school zone 20 mph? That seems like the optimal cruising speed for pedophiles... As a driver I hate pedestrians, and as a pedestrian I hate drivers, but no matter what the mode of transportation, I always hate cyclists. Sometimes I&apos;ll look down at my watch 3 consecutive times and still not know what time it is. It should probably be called Unplanned Parenthood. I keep some people&apos;s phone numbers in my phone just so I know not to answer when they call. Even if I knew your social security number, I wouldn&apos;t know what do to with it. Even under ideal conditions people have trouble locating their car keys in a pocket, hitting the Gspot, and Pinning the Tail on the Donkey but Id bet my ass everyone can find and push the Snooze button from 3 feet away, in about 1.7 seconds, eyes closed, first time every time... My 4year old son asked me in the car the other day&quot;Dad what would happen if you ran over a ninja?&quot;How the hell do I respond to that? It really pisses me off when I want to read a story on CNN.com and the link takes me to a video instead of text. I wonder if cops ever get pissed off at the fact that everyone they drive behind obeys the speed limit. I think the freezer deserves a light as well. I disagree with Kay Jewelers. I would bet on any given Friday or Saturday night more kisses begin with Miller Lites than Kay. The other night I ordered takeout, and when I looked in the bag, saw they had included four sets of plastic silverware. In other words, someone at the restaurant packed my order, took a second to think about it, and then estimated that there must be at least four people eating to require such a large amount of food. Too bad I was eating by myself. There&apos;s nothing 
 like being made to feel like a fat bastard before dinner.

When you gas up, the attendant asks,&quot;Can I re-duct tape that windshield for you?&quot; Thieves repeatedly break in your car just to steal the&quot;Club&quot;. While sitting at a stop light, people keep running up to you and asking if anyone was hurt.
