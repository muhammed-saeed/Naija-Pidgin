 Date Event 23rd January 1955 The Sutton Coldfield rail crash kills seventeen people near Birmingham. 25th January 1955 The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in the Soviet Union announces the end of the war between the USSR and Germany. This conflict had begun during the Second World War in 1941. 20th March 1955 “Blackboard Jungle” opens in movie theatres featuring the song “Rock Around the Clock” by Bill Haley and his Comets. The impact of the song is massive, propelling Rock and Roll music as a mainstream genre. 6th April 1955 Anthony Eden becomes Prime Minister following the resignation of Sir Winston Churchill. 12th April 1955 The Salk Polio Vaccine is introduced, consisting of an injected dose of the dead poliovirus. Following the subsequent development of an oral vaccine, polio is eradicated in most countries. 15th April 1955 Ray Kroc opens the ninth McDonald&apos;s fast food restaurant since the company was founded in 1940.
