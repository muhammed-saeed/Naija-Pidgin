 Timnath gets big box;another project on the way 

 By Dan MacArthur
Fossil Creek Current 

The region&apos;s worst-kept secret is officially out now with the announcement 
that Timnath has landed a new Wal-Mart Supercenter.

The supercenter is predicted to bring the town a $1 million annual sales 
tax windfall while further deflating Fort Collins&apos; efforts to reverse the 
migration of shopper dollars to other communities.

Mayor Donna Benson said the new revenues will enable the town to at last 
begin making long-overdue infrastructure improvements. Before work begins, 
however, the proposal will face scrutiny at a number of public hearings.

And another big box likely is on the horizon. It would be located across 
Harmony Road directly south of the supercenter site on a similar-sized 
parcel also owned by Wal-Mart developer Mark Goldberg.

Goldberg confirmed that he is negotiating with at least two retailers interested 
in the other property but was not yet prepared to make an announcement.&quot;It takes time to consummate these deals,&quot;he said.

Timnath for years has identified the supercenter property at the northeast 
corner of Harmony Road and Interstate 25 as a site for regional commercial 
development. Rumored negotiations with big-box retailers have long been 
circulating. Further, tangible evidence of the pending action was apparent 
weeks before the formal announcement as earth movers worked to expand the 
building site by half to a total of 20 acres.

&quot;I don&apos;t think it was a big surprise,&quot;said Benson.&quot;From a land-use perspective, 
it&apos;s exactly where it should be,&quot;she added, noting that the supercenter&apos;s 
location on the interstate should minimize additional traffic through the 
town.

&quot;We always expected something big. That&apos;s where the big stuff goes,&quot;agreed 
town planner Tim Katers.

According to Wal-Mart, the 204,000-square-foot supercenter will contain 
the typical wide selection of groceries and general merchandise as well 
as an array of specialty shops such as a photo center, hair salon, branch 
bank and fast-food restaurant.

Wal-Mart expects to open the store in the fall of 2007, a deadline Katers 
said is entirely possible. Once an application is received, he said, the 
annexation and zoning could be completed within 60 days. After the property 
is platted, a site plan would be prepared detailing every element of the 
development from tree plantings to trash containers.&quot;The short way of 
describing it is everything,&quot;Katers said.

When approved, following intensive review to assure it meets what Benson 
described as rigorous town code standards, the developer could immediately 
obtain a building permit and begin construction.

Depending on how the process plays out, Katers said, there would be seven 
to nine opportunities for comment at public hearings.

Goldberg acknowledged access issues remain to be addressed, principally 
reconstruction of the Poudre River bridge necessary for widening Harmony 
Road to four lanes. But Goldberg said he is working with the town to coordinate 
the necessary improvements, which should pose no obstacle to the scheduled 
opening.

Wal-Mart in 2004 attempted to win approval for a superstore in Windsor, 
but abandoned its efforts after the town board rejected a request to rezone 
the proposed site on Main Street between 16th and 17th streets.
