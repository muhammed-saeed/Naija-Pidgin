 unless you are on snow or water, i wouldn&apos;t try it. you will mess up the car&apos;s tranny

fwd-can&apos;t do it. its just understeering

 FWD car- ya don&apos;t do doughnuts

RWD car - from a stop turn your wheel all the way to the left/right then give it a little gas then hammer it to the floor

AWD car - It&apos;s the hardest to do but the best way to explain it is from a stop turn the wheel all the way to the left/right give it a little gas then hammer it to the floor let off the gas for not even 2 seconds to get your car sideways then hammer it to the floor again. repeat if ya could get it! Using the e-brake wont help you at all so don&apos;t pull it.

 hm..... odd question you didnt evan tell us what it is :o if its a car, its most likely front wheel drive. so go on a gravel road, and turn the wheel and hit the gas in revers
it will spin around...

if its a truck you have to get a lil bit of speed, turn the wheel and when the vehicle starts turning punch the gas.. unless this vehicle has no guts lol

 spray amor tire shiner all over the tires that have the power if at fwd(front wheel drive) then front tires only.if a rwd (rear wheel drive)then back tires only.or put a little car oil on them a little goes a long way.

 Steal 2 plastic trays from a fast food restaurant, and put them under your back tires.

Do this in a parking lot, go forward at about 30kmph, then whip your back end around, slam the parking brake on and you&apos;ll spin.

 Well, you shouldn&apos;t do donuts in a slow car or a front or all wheel drive car. With that said, power brake it, and go.
