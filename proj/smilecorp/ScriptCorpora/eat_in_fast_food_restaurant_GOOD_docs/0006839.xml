Basha or Boustan - I just don&apos;t remember which!: shawarma and shish tawook

I cannot remember the name of the place and suspect it is either a Basha&apos;s or a Boustan&apos;s but maybe not! In the underground shopping mall near the Hyatt Regency. Both the shawarma and the shish tawook were great.

Basha: Lebanese food
 
 Helpfulness
 TangoNuevo   22 reviews 
Huge portion of Lebanese food. It&apos;s quite crowded on the weekends. It seems to be a hot spot for the locals.

The food is great! The menu is numbered 1-10. And you just pick out a number. And they&apos;ll serve it on the plate.
It&apos;s like going to a food court.

Basha: For a quick yet healthy lunch
 
 Helpfulness
 galeena1   18 reviews 
Basha is everywhere. They serve Lebanese food. If you like Shawarma you probably know what to expect. I prefer the other stuff they have like: green bean and tomato, rice and lentils, fatoush... They have great veggie dishes for the vegeterians out there or for those who simply dont like to eaat meat like myself.

 Favorite Dish: I prefer to have the Broccoli salad with the rice and lentil dish

Basha: I Want Shish Taouk
 
 Helpfulness
 Stellaluna   106 reviews 
Taouk, which means chicken. The is grilled chicken. Shwarma and donair (or doner) are cooked another way. These are thin slices of meat, usually chicken or lamb, marinated and stacked firmly on a large skewer. This is held vertically and turned slowly in front of an upright gas or charcoal grill. The meat is sliced in thin strips as the outside of the stack broils.

 Favorite Dish: Shish Taouk platter

Basha: The best Shish Taouk in town.

 Bela_LUng   251 reviews 
Basha makes some great food. They have location all over downtown and now some in the West Island. The plates are large and food is amazing and cost reasonable. The plates and sandwiches are well portioned.

Try the Shish Taouk plate...it&apos;s soooo damn good. Shish Taouk chicken, rice, salad, potatos, humus and a pita....damn!

 Favorite Dish: Shish Taouk!

Basha&apos;s: Superb Lebanese Food Downtown
 
 Helpfulness
 rmdw   596 reviews 
If you&apos;re shopping downtown and looking for a flavourful meal then do check out Basha&apos;s. It&apos;s set up cafeteria style but the decor is nice and the music is very appropriate for the food.

 Favorite Dish: They offer a wide assortment of choices, most consisting of meat, rice or potatoes, vegetables, and a salad.

Basha: Good place for Lebanese food
 
 Helpfulness
 yul001   7 reviews 
Cafeteria style with very friendly staff. There are actually 2 Basha in Montreal. This one on the corner of St-Catherine and Metcalfe and one further west, also on St-Catherine.

 Favorite Dish: If you have never been there, take a combo plate, for a taste of everything.
Otherwise, go ahead, try the daily specials. They&apos;re cheaper and delicious.
