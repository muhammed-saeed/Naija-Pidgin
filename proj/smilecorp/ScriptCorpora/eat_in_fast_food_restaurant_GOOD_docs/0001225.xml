 Cringeworthy: Which Food Buzzwords Should Get Nixed? 
 
 The food world is rife with culinary catch phrases and overused foodie buzzwords these days, isn&apos;t it? Which one...or more!...terms do you think should get put to rest this year? Maybe it&apos;s even the term &quot;foodie&quot; itself that gets your feathers ruffled!

Personally we&apos;re tired of hearing the term &quot;tablescape.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s the Sandra Lee associations, but we cringe every time we hear it. We have nothing against table decorations, but why not just call them table decorations?

Another one we&apos;d add in there is &quot;healthful.&quot; Again, no real reason for this other than, why? Why not just say &quot;healthy&quot;? Is simply calling something &quot;healthy&quot; a bad thing now?!

Then there&apos;s &quot;foodporn,&quot; &quot;delish,&quot; and the ever-persistent &quot;yum-o,&quot; as well...

There&apos;s not necessarily any rhyme or reason why some of these words make us shudder, but shudder we do! What food terms get under your skin?

If Rachael Ray says it, you can bet I hate hearing it.

Anything out of Rachael Ray&apos;s mouth!
 posted by Patty708 on 01.05.10 at 12:08PM 
I, too, shudder at the word &quot;healthful&quot;. Urg! Drives me nuts. Same with delish and yum-o

Definitely see the annoyance with &quot;tablescape&quot;.
 posted by Magda29 on 01.05.10 at 12:16PM 
agreed on the Rachel Ray crap. i know she says it to be cute, but it comes out annoying.

Another vote for any noun, verb, adjective, adverb, interjection, acronym, or dangling participle that emits from Rachel Ray&apos;s ever so slightly crooked mouth.

I don&apos;t like mouthfeel for food but I think it is a good descriptor word for words.

food porn. yuck.

The word I really hate hearing come out of Rachael&apos;s mouth is: burger! Does she not understand that we all see right through the burger recipe and recognize she&apos;s really saying &quot;I&apos;ve run out of ways to make meals fast and I&apos;m too busy on my other projects to put time into thinking up something new for the show that rocketed me to stardom in the first place?&quot; I mean, come on! :)
 posted by reddylee on 01.05.10 at 12:23PM 
Ever since seeing a brand of wine called &quot;Wine for Foodies&quot;, foodie has started to grate me.

Wouldn&apos;t a foodie know precisely what kind of wine they would most enjoy with a certain meal without a label preaching to them? Talk about a term spiraling into meaninglessness.
 posted by akay on 01.05.10 at 12:25PM 
I&apos;ve always hated the word yummy. Ick. And looking at that image, I would say that at least half of the words irritate me. Hah! I second (third, fourth, whatever) the Rachel Ray comments above, too.
 posted by Kate H. on 01.05.10 at 12:26PM 
&quot;Healthy&quot; means that your food is not sick. Is that what you&apos;re trying to say? If not, &quot;healthful&quot; is the correct adjective to mean good for you, or wholesome.

I detest the word foodie.
 posted by bubble on 01.05.10 at 12:30PM 
The one that makes me cringe is &quot;nom&quot;. I hear and see it everywhere.

And agreed re: Rachel Ray.
 posted by cianan on 01.05.10 at 12:30PM 
@reddylee @Patty708 Ditto that. I enjoy 30-minute meals but it&apos;s gotten to the point where I almost have to watch it with the volume off.

&quot;Yum-o&quot;
&quot;Yummo&quot;
&quot;Sammy&quot;
&quot;EVOO&quot;

And &quot;Rachel Ray.&quot; That word wasn&apos;t listed.
 posted by The Kitchenette on 01.05.10 at 12:32PM 
I actually like the word--&quot;toothsome&quot;
 posted by coffeesnob on 01.05.10 at 12:37PM 
Dislike: Foodie, Yum-O, Healthful, Deconstructed, Gelee and I agree on Tablescape.

Don&apos;t mind: Delish or Sammie (People were saying these before RR), EVOO (C&apos;mon its just easier), Om Nom...
 posted by Tara in Florida on 01.05.10 at 12:39PM 
Anything relating to bacon. So over it.

&quot;Sammies&quot; for sandwiches; &quot;patty&quot; for anything other than a piece of squished-together ground meat meant to be eaten in a bun-- sounds so cheap; I prefer the term &quot;cake&quot; (i.e. salmon cakes to salmon &quot;patties&quot;) or even burger. I can&apos;t decide if recipes that include &quot;perfect&quot; in the title annoy me or delight me, so I&apos;ll hold off on that for now (probably depends on whether I already have my own version).
 posted by heatherk on 01.05.10 at 12:42PM 
SO glad that I am not the only one who wants to punch Rachel Ray in the face every time she opens her mouth! ...doubly so when she says EVOO.

Just reading the headline of this post, the only thing that came to mind was &quot;anything Rachel Ray says.&quot;

Foodie. We have a real word for that - gourmand.

I hate anything that ends in -porn. Especially foodporn. It just reminds me of regular porn, and I don&apos;t need that near my food. Gross.
 posted by mandarinmarie on 01.05.10 at 01:06PM 
If so many people find RR as annoying as I do, why is she EVERYWHERE? Someone somewhere is supporting her, we must find this person and knock some sense into her.

I think that buzzword burnout is kind of inevitable seeing how many new food writers pop up every day, and how there are only so many adjectives you can use to describe the experience of eating anything.

What I think gets on my nerves more than anything are the catchphrases. Yum-o, Bam, EVOO, etc. And foodie does get on my nerves because I think, &quot;What, before the last decade no one ever liked to cook or eat?&quot;
 posted by mlleErica on 01.05.10 at 01:13PM 
Actually, healthful is correct when describing food, unless you mean that the food is not sick. Healthful means full of health; healthy means in good health. I know that healthful has given way to healthy in common usage, but I&apos;m not willing to give it up.
 posted by Emily G. on 01.05.10 at 01:14PM 
Sorry to be the lone voice of dissent, but I am a Rachel Ray fan.

She is approachable, realistic, and has done more for home-cooking than she gets credit for. I prefer 30-Minute Meals to the daily talk show, but I still like her.

Give me Rachel over the Barefoot Contessa ANY day.

Rustic--it seems to be just a code word for messy.
 posted by Pecali8 on 01.05.10 at 01:18PM 
Artisian...everything trendy is labeled artisian. artisian bread, artisian cheese, artisian wines. It&apos;s just an adjective to justify a large $$. I&apos;m sick of hearing vegan this and vegan that, free range this and pasture fed that. Most of these terms have no definition, they only delude the person into spending more for something they preceive as more wholesome.
 posted by lona on 01.05.10 at 01:26PM 
hahah! patty708! i agree. i can&apos;t say that i&apos;ve ever watched the rachel ray show or any of her cooking segments but she reminds me of jim rome (the sports talk radio guy) when it comes to using terms. she creates her own little buzz words about stuff and then followers repeat that jargon and speak in catch phrases and unintelligible mumbo jumbo. shh, don&apos;t tell her, but it&apos;s actually my mom that does this.

EVOO.
foodie.
sammy/sammich.

Ditto on artisan! I can handle &quot;yummy&quot; when my 4-year-old says it. Everyone else? You sound like a 4-year-old when you say this.

&quot;Delish&quot; has got to go! It&apos;s like people that say &quot;guac&quot; instead of &quot;guacamole.&quot; Just say the whole word. Stop being lazy. It sounds stupid.

And I hate to say it, but I&apos;m getting pretty tired of EVOO...I just call it olive oil and move on.

What the heck does EVOO mean?
 posted by BrooklynBaker on 01.05.10 at 01:53PM 
It&apos;s not a word, but a phrase. I hate the expression &quot;to die for&quot; when connected to food. I would die for my son and perhaps for my husband, but certainly for not a piece of chocolate cake.

My major annoyance with food packaging is the term &quot;all-natural&quot; or just &quot;natural.&quot; What the heck does that mean? It&apos;s not organic. And it&apos;s not regulated by the FDA for the use of the term so it really means nothing. It&apos;s usually a marketing ploy and still has some sort of preservative or MSG or something else that I don&apos;t want in my body! Yuck.

Ditto on Rachel Ray. Yes, it&apos;s nice that she&apos;s getting people to have home-cooked meals that are approachable...but all the catchphrases drive me nuts.
 posted by 7lina7 on 01.05.10 at 02:10PM 
Agree wholeheartedly on banishing &quot;foodie&quot;, &quot;EVOO&quot; and some of the others mentioned. I admit that I am guilty of using food porn as a description for my numerous cooking magazines that I subscribe to and cringe even when I use it. But I&apos;m not sure what &quot;nom&quot; is referring to???
 posted by rosebud on 01.05.10 at 02:39PM 
MELTY! I think it started with a Taco Bell ad. Every time it came on I was like, &quot;That&apos;s not even a word!!&quot; And then it spread to other places...

VEG is annoying when non-Brits say it. I&apos;m a non-Brit, I don&apos;t say it.
 posted by curbappeal on 01.05.10 at 02:48PM 
BrooklynBaker... Extra Virgin Olive Oil... EVOO.

Like rosebud I don&apos;t know of &quot;nom&quot;... is it like num? nummy? yummy?

Iona... vegan does have meaning... no flesh or animal products (milk, eggs, honey are examples).

The popular catch-phrases are extremely irritating when they&apos;re heard over and over... I can&apos;t watch a lot of the cooking shows anymore and RR is at the top of my irritation list.

Slow Food. Ever since Alice white cooked an egg on a spoon over a wood fire in her home kitchen on 60 minutes I have been unable to deal with the concept. I love the idea, but the presentation is odious.

Stoup. EVOO. Sammy. Any nickname word created by Rachel Ray that she still explains everytime she says it? Irritating.

&quot;Its a good thing&quot;, because, invariably, with martha&apos;s recipes, its not.

&quot;Fat free&quot; ... but this only really bothers me when related to butter flavor sprays whose main ingredients are oil and salt.

Home style - especially when related to canned soups. Its not how I would make my soup taste, stop insulting my cooking.
 posted by fi_burke on 01.05.10 at 03:54PM 
Flexatarian. It doesn&apos;t mean anything.

Artisan&amp;hand-crafted have been used to death and are now being used to sell fast food. And honestly, even a Big Mac is &quot;hand-crafted.&quot;

And let&apos;s get rid of the exaggerated eye-roll that happens before a food personality has even closed their lips around the tines of their fork. &quot;You haven&apos;t even tasted it yet!&quot;
 posted by ah-ha on 01.05.10 at 03:57PM 
FWIW, &quot;Nom&quot; is a word that describes the sound of eating joyously. Imagine the noise Cookie Monster made when eating cookies ( &quot;Om NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM&quot; ).
 posted by fi_burke on 01.05.10 at 03:57PM 
Almost right on the alternate word for &quot;foodie&quot;:

gourmand - one who is excessively fond of eating and drinking

*gourmet (when used as a noun) - a connossieur of food and drink

Stoup. Gah.

Nom is fantastic but only when said by an LOL cat .
 posted by akay on 01.05.10 at 04:27PM 
Seems any word can be annoying when over used. Feeling a little defensive I guess of a few things.

Slow Food: If it&apos;s used to describe a cooking process I can see it as being annoying. But as a concept of embracing food that is cultivated in your back yard (locally) and not purchased from a fast food restaurant seems an excellent catchy term for a movement. If you want to move a movement forward people need a name for it.

Food Porn: A lot of people post pics on FB of the dinner they made last night. Seems the best descriptor for that is Food Porn.

RR: I guess I don&apos;t watch her enough anymore to be annoyed by her terms. I did watch her exclusively while living with my parents after college. She inspired me to cook for them and made cooking seem less intimidating. I&apos;m sure she did this for many young adults. Anyone who can do that should not be totally thrown to the wolves.

&quot;Unctuous&quot; is one I hate, because it just sounds sooo pretentious. I bet most people who use that word don&apos;t even know what it means.

Also, I sort of hate &quot;mouth feel&quot; (which, funnily enough, is often used in combination with &quot;unctuous.)&quot; &quot;Soupcon&quot; also bugs me. Basically I hate the terms that make people sound prissy.

Like this:

&quot;Oooh, this soupcon of patéhas such an unctuous mouth feel!&quot;

Okay, I&apos;m sorry in advance - but just &apos;cause nobody has linked to this video when explaining the term &quot; om nom nom .&quot;

Personally, I love the concept of nomming!

However, I definitely agree with the hate for &quot;EVOO&quot;. And I can live with &quot;guac&quot; in speech, but not in writing.

I&apos;ll fourth, fifth, whateverth &quot;Anything that comes out of Rachel Ray&apos;s mouth.&quot; I HATE the deliberate cutesiness of it. HATE. I find it offensive and demeaning to all women who cram making dinner for their families or themselves into already swamped schedules.

I also like the concept of nomming. But mostly in relation to ice cream and other sweets, much like Cookie Monster. I think it&apos;s a geek thing.

Gastropub.

Setting aside for a moment that the word reads and sounds like something you don&apos;t want happening to your lower intestines, the bigger issue is that it&apos;s increasingly being used incorrectly by places that have neither fine beer or food, by any stretch of the imagination.
 posted by dantsea on 01.05.10 at 10:04PM 
Mouthfeel. I hate it.

I don&apos;t even know what &quot;stoup&quot; is! Is it a food network thing? Because I don&apos;t even have tv.
 posted by Hannah - Honey&amp;Jam on 01.06.10 at 12:03AM 
@Ah-ha - I completely agree. It enrages me how these weird TV people taste their food!! It&apos;s so irritating. I can watch the Travel Channel shows but the Food Network shows are so irritating - they must show all their presenters how they want them to eat the crap they make. It&apos;s so irritating! Watching Tony Bourdain eating is fine though. He&apos;s more normal.

I don&apos;t watch FN anymore but it didn&apos;t used to be like that. It&apos;s sad. I learned how to cook from watching Sara Molton, David Rosenberg, etc. - not being afraid and just go for it once you got the basic concept and learned about the ingredients. Now we&apos;re stuck with the Barefoot Contessa who measures the herbs she chops yet is constantly saying &quot;approximately&quot; so I stopped watching. The HGTV/Food Network/DIY juggernaut must be stopped!
 posted by Joan in SB on 01.06.10 at 01:09AM 
Dee-lish and Yummo-good grief, Rachael Ray is annoying.

I watch mostly the PBS shows now or those on Create tv. Food Network has taken a real nosedive in the last 10 years.

Anyone who describes something food-related as &quot;a revelation.&quot; Enough already.

Most food commentary should be done the old fashioned TV way: bite, close your eyes, smile and nod.
