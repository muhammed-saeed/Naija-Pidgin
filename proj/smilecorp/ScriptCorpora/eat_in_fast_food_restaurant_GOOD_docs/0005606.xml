The restaurants of Beverly Hills, similar to those of its nearby cousin Bel Air, cater to the rich and famous as well as those simply looking for a night out in the company of Hollywood elite. From the couches and chairs to the drapes and table settings, everything about the majority of Beverly Hills restaurants screams class, and each value the style as much as the quality of the food they serve. While Beverly Hills is not known for discounts and bargains, restaurants providing good deals for even the tightest pocketbook are out there. Both quaint new-age bistros and grilled sandwich shops that have been around since the days of Marilyn Monroe bring in the popular crowds on a daily basis. Chic locations in Los Angeles like these are often prime gathering spots for locals, even more so than the expensive brethren they share the same streets with.
