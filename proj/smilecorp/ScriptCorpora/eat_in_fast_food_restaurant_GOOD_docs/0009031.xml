I&apos;ll likely never pass thru Kanab again, so I&apos;m almost sad that I had the best biscuits and gravy ever in this town. To be fair I&apos;ve only had biscuits and gravy a couple times, but this blew those away.

I got the sausage skillet - slightly spicy sausage patties cut up and served over hash browns w 2 fluffy biscuits smothered with rich delicious sausage gravy and topped with eggs (I opted for scrambled). Not my normal breakfast but hey I&apos;m on vacation. Everybody had to have a taste, then another. It was that good.

I didn&apos;t try anyone else&apos;s food but they said the pancakes were exceptional as well as the breakfast sandwich with I think was ham, eggs, tomato and green chilis.

Prices for food were not bad, but nearly $3 for coffee seemed excessive for this place. Which by the way was so awesomely retro and cowboy themed you just had to love it.

Based on the bad reviews, I wouldn&apos;t have chosen this place, but so glad the outside appealed to my friends mom or I never would&apos;ve discovered this gem. I had an older lady waitress, didn&apos;t catch a name but she was friendly and kept topping off our coffee. Nothing special, but nothing bad either.

One of the reviews mentioned they may be racist and we were the only non whites there, but our table of 3 Asians had no issues. Who knows if they talked smack after we left, and honestly who cares.

IF I ever end up in this random town again I&apos;d definitely hit Houston&apos;s one more time.

We went back last night. Our server was more attentive than our first, and we all enjoyed our meals.

Our kids liked the steak so much they split one (this time it was cooked medium as ordered). My wife had the southwest chicken and I had the boneless pork ribs. I think I should have had the chicken fried steak again.The ribs were OK, but they were underseasoned and covered in a strong sauce to make up for it.

This time split one piece of pie and were glad we did. The slice was huge! After tax and tip our total for 3 adult entrees and pie came to a tad over $70. If we&apos;re in Kanab again we&apos;ll come back.

By the way, there&apos;s another dining room in back we didn&apos;t see the first time.

WAY over priced. Typical greasy spoon breakfast in a bland environment. Really nice waitresses though, and that is great!

Have eaten here on two separate trips through Kanab. Astonishingly good steaks, mashed potato, gravy. Good service considering the high volume. Really worth a visit.

We have been eating at Houston&apos;s for over 10 years.  We make it a point to stop there every time we travel through from Phoenix,Arizona, to anywhere in Idaho.

My favorite is the chicken fried steak, smothered with real country gravy, served with a fresh, homemade, melt in your mouth roll, and homemade mashed potatoes.

We&apos;ve eaten here many times and always enjoy it.   I do agree though, the service can be hit and miss.  When we walked in today, even though there were three waitresses, they all looked at us, and went on with their business.  No one greeted us for about 5 minutes.    However, after they seated us, they were friendly and the food was excellent.

I now thank God that I live in California, in a  big city with a huge diversified  population.

Walking into this restaurant, it was like walking into the first day of class in a new high school, in the South. I swear  my life on it. I think I got death dagger stares coming into this place.

Their Country fried steak was actually decent, however, their burgers? Kind of a joke. It was worse than a back-yard bbq burger.  Really.

Service...service was being served on a need-to-serve basis...if you catch my drift.  The waitress surely took our order and checked on us, but she seemed timid every time she walked up to our table.

And sitting there eating?...i felt like i was in High School all over again. You honestly couldn&apos;t avoid the high school kids talking, or rather, shouting at the top of their lungs while sitting within a foot from each other. And the throwing of food? yea, there was that too.

- Family Run Restaurant for over 35 years.
- Almost everything is homemade
- Cute old western decor
- Delicious homemade chicken noodle soup
- Service a little slow but place is always busy
- Walls were really dirty with dust on the ledges and decor and food splattered on wall paper.  Not very appetizing.
- The only alcohol they serve is bottles (Bud light)
- Not much else to choose from to eat in town so this is probably the best food in town.

It appears that I got the same bitter waitress as everyone else.  I went in for breakfast with my wife. father, and five year old son for breakfast.  It took her a while to take our order.  I order coffee which I then had to ask for again 2 more times (keep in mind this is at breakfast).  I also asked for syrup with my pancakes, which I consider to be a reasonable request, and that never arrived until I asked another waitress.  Believe it or not, we actually went back the next day (didnt know where else to go for breakfast - the Rewind was closed) and the service was better.

The food was OK.  I&apos;ve travelled enough to surmise that I don&apos;t share Houston&apos;s view on how much butter is acceptable on food, so we made sure to order the pancakes and the toast dry.

Maybe the key here is to get the right waitress.  It seemed like there were a lot of locals/regulars, and they seemed to have better interaction with the wait staff

BEWARE!  This place appears to be busy, but it&apos;s busy with tourist diners, not local diners. So I was staying at the local holiday inn, and thought why not ask the guy at the front desk for some restaurant recommendations.  Stupid stupid me.  I should have stuck to my instincts and yelped the area for honest opinions.

So the place was busy, and I thought, okay that&apos;s a good sign.  But our service was mediocre, the waitress never smiled the entire time, and was very blah in her tone of voice, so it was up to me and Alisha to amuse ourselves, which we did by people watching.  You get some interesting folks up in there.

The menu wasn&apos;t too impressive, just your typical denny&apos;s style menu.  Fries, burgers, steak, chicken.  So I opted for the &quot;exotics&quot; portion of the menu which was just pasta w/alfredo sauce and veggies, and Alisha got the Stir Fried Rice, their very sad attempt at Asian cuisine.  Pasta sauce was bleh, veggies were over steamed, and noodles seemed a little over done.  The Stir Fried Rice thingy was Uncle Bens rice with veggies and some weird brown sauce over it.

We normally always get dessert, but even the dessert menu was just too boring for us.  jello w/whip cream type of deal.  My advice, if you are into flavor, taste, and friendly service...then go somewhere else, like Rocking V Cafe.

PS...they only had beer, no wine or well drinks.  Overall, this place was a waste of time and money.

Went here on Labor Day weekend because for a Sunday there didn&apos;t seem to be a lot open.  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with both the food and the service.
We both had the rib eye steak that was seasoned well and cooked to our liking.  They served us home made rolls and butter which were fluffy and warm.
The topper was the banana cream pie.  I&apos;m not lying when I tell you that pie was to die for.  It had to have been the best banana cream pie I have ever had.  Again it was homemade and huge.  Good thing we shared it.
If you are passing thru, give it a try.  Hopefully you&apos;ll find it as good as we did.

Ate there twice during our stay at best friends last week.  At dinner, I had the chicken fried steak and it was great.  I had never had chicken fried steak before, but now I want to eat it again.  The second trip we stopped for breakfast on the way back to Las Vegas.  My sister got the chicken fried steak and eggs after she had tasted my chicken fried steak before.  I got a sausage and biscuit skillet.  One of my favorite meals- biscuits and gravy, combined with eggs and hashbrowns.  So good.  I&apos;ll definitely stop there again when we&apos;re back in Kanab next year.

Houston&apos;s sits in downtown Kanab, a cute dot on the map dressed up like an old Western town. The restaurant has cutesy Western decor and the waitresses are dressed up like cowgirls complete with gun holsters. Okay, all the cutesy aside, check out the menu. I ordered the chicken fried steak which is their specialty at $12.95. My wife ordered the &quot;small&quot; prime rib at $19.95 We also ordered tossed salad at $1.95 - which were enormous. The chicken fried steak was well seasoned, crunchy smothered with thick gravy alongside the mashed potatoes. My wife&apos;s prime rib was giganto-sized. We brought half of it home. Zowee. Only problem, only alcohol is beer -no wine but after all, this is in Utah. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Reading the other reviews, I guess we must have been lucky. All in all, a pleasant experience.

When I told my friends that I was going to Utah, every single person told me, &quot;Why?  I don&apos;t know if I want you to go there, that&apos;s a very trippy place...&quot;  I must add they&apos;re mostly Caucasian and some African American young and older folks and I am an Asian American woman.  I was by myself and tired, I just wanted to take out some food and eat at my hotel.  I went in and asked if I can order to go.  This very unfriendly girl told me I have to go around their gift area and order.  Basically the cashier is the same but they divide restaurant area and the gift shop area with a wall, so I just have to go back to their front door and around to the other side of cashier, so I did.  I waited for a few minutes but nobody came to the cashier but the same girl was doing something in front of me.  Finally a different young girl came to her and the first girl told to this second girl, &quot;I&apos;ve got something for ya.&quot; and pointed her &quot;chin&quot; toward me.  The second girl looked at me and looked back at her and said very sarcastically, &quot;oooh, thaaanks...&quot;   Then to me, &quot;can I help you?&quot;  At that moment, I HAD to look back, just to make sure if that &quot;something&quot; was me or something else.  The wall against this gift shop is long and there was nobody behind me but souvenirs.  I was stunned.  They didn&apos;t even whisper.  They said it loud and clear.  Living in Los Angeles sometimes makes me forget there are still many uneducated racist people who can&apos;t accept diversity.  They were only about 19 or early 20&apos;s, they were young.  It made me very sad because nobody was born to hate, you are taught by someone else, like your parents.  I thought to ask for a manager but remembered my friends saying and wondered what if the owner was also a racist.  He or she hired these girls to begin with and I&apos;ve read several reviews about thier horrible services also.  I was tired so I just ordered a burger and asked the girl to let me know when it&apos;s done but I&apos;d be outside.  After 20 minutes, nobody came out, so I went back in.  I stood at the cashier for another good 10 minutes.  When the second girl went to talk with a kitchen boy who saw me standing there the whole time, he said something to her and the girl looked at me and went, &quot;ooh...&quot;  She handed me a cold burger in a box.  I heated it in a microwave but  the food was just edible.  Needless to say, I will never go back there ever again.
