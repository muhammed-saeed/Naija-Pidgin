Fast food workers: You ever screw up some customer&apos;s food in a bad way?
 For example, dropped the patties on the floor, either by accident or on purpose?

 I can speak for nearly everyone who works the late shift at both McDonald&apos;s, AND Burger King in my city when I say that yes, they manage to get my order wrong most of the time,....and I am not rude about it. I just go on my way and pick off the cheese as best I can. No need to be mean, as I fear the next time I do go in, my food may have&quot;extra&quot;ingredients. Cheers! Jen

 Asker&apos;s Rating: Asker&apos;s Comment: Yeah, you have to be crystal clear at the DT. If it&apos;s a place where I know the workers are dumb, I&apos;ll just order chicken nuggets or something. It&apos;s hard to screw those up (though I sometimes get the wrong sauce).

 Almost never, but on the rare occasion I do. It&apos;s really funny when they come back screaming and stuff about how I totally ruined their order. It&apos;s usually when someone has a retarded order like&quot;give me 3 hamburgers, one with extra mayo, cheese and lettuce, no ketchup, the other one, no mayo, no cheese, just lettuce and ketchup, and they other one, mayo, no lettuce, extra cheese, ketchup and extra, extra pickles. Then I want two chicken sandwhiches, one with everything on it, except pickles and lettuce, and I want extra, extra mayo with cheese on the side. The next one, 5 pieces of cheese, and pickles, but only half of the usual amount of pickles. Then I want a large dr.pepper mixed with coke and sprite. That&apos;ll be all, thanks.&quot;When someone does that, I just give them all plain food. It&apos;s pretty funny.

 When I was younger, I worked at a Burger King. It was late, and I was tired, and felt like just having some fun. So an order came through in the drive-thru, for a whopper meal with extra mayo. And I put extra mayo - I mean, there was so much frickin mayo... Turns out, it was a friend of the manager, so I heard about it on my next shift!

 I use to work in a bakery and never had any issues. They put me on the sandwich side of the shop for one day. I cut my hand open and bleed all over the sandwich and the counter and yes..its was in front of my customers in rush hour lunch..

That wasn&apos;t good!

 Yup, but only because they deserved it. If a random patty dropped on the ground i would NOT use it. Only for the people that come in screaming and swearing at me.
