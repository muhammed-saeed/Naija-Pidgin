 Problem 16-16 Using present value techniques to evaluate alternative investment opportunities- ANSWER KEY 
 
Problem 16-16 Using present value techniques to evaluate alternative investment opportunities 
 
Fast Delivery is a small company that transports business packages between New York and Chicago. It operates a fleet of small vans that moves packages to and from a central depot within each city and uses a common carrier to deliver the packages between the depots in the two cities. Fast recently acquired approximately $6 million of cash capital from its owners, and its president, Don Keenon, is trying to identify the most profitable way to invest these funds. Clarence Roy, the company’s operations manager, believes that the money should be used to expand the fleet of city vans at a cost of $720,000. He argues that more vans would enable the company to expand its services into new markets, thereby increasing the revenue base. More specifically, he expects cash inflows to increase by $280,000 per year. The additional vans are expected to have an average useful life of four years and a combined salvage value of $100,000. Operating the vans will require additional working capital of $40,000, which will be recovered at the end of the fourth year. In contrast, Patricia Lipa, the company’s chief accountant believes that the funds should be used to purchase large trucks to deliver the packages between depots in the two cities. The conversion process would produce continuing improvement in operating savings with reductions in cash outflows as the following. Year 1 $160,000; Year 2 $320,000; Year 3 $400,000; Year 4 $440,000. The large trucks are expected to cost $800,000 and to have a four-year useful life and a $80,000 salvage value. In addition to the purchase price of the trucks, up-front training costs are expected to amount to $16,000. Fast Delivery’s management has established a 16 percent desired rate of return.

 Required. 

Determine the net present value of the two investment alternatives.

Calculate the present value index of each alternative.

Indicate which investment alternative you would recommend. Explain your choice.

 16-29 Sonimad Sawmill, Inc. (381), purchases logs from independent timber- ANSWER KEY 
 16-29 Joint-cost allocation, process further or sell (CMA, adapted). 


Sonimad Sawmill, Inc. (381), purchases logs from independent timber contractors and processes the logs into three types of lumber products:
Studs for residential buildings (walls, ceilings)
Decorative pieces (fireplace mantels, beams for cathedral ceilings)
Posts used as support braces (mine support braces, braces for exterior fences on ranch properties)

The studs are sold as rough-cut lumber after emerging from the sawmill operation without further processing by SSI. Also, the posts require no further processing beyond the splitoff point The decorative pieces must be planed and further sized after emerging from the sawmill. This additional processing costs $100,000 per month and normally results in a loss of 10% of the units entering the process. Without this planning and sizing process, there is still an active intermediate market for the unfinished decorative pieces in which the selling price averages $60 per unit

1. Based on the information given for Sonimad Sawmill, allocate the joint processing costs of $1,000,000 to the three products using:

a. Sales value at split-off method

b. Physical-measure method (volume in units)

c. NRV method

2. Prepare an analysis for Sonimad Sawmill that compares processing the decorative pieces further, as they currently do, with selling them as a rough-cut product immediately at split-off

3. Assume Sonimad Sawmill announced that in six months it will sell the unfinished decorative pieces at split-off due to increasing competitive pressure. Identify at least three types of likely behavior that will be demonstrated by the skilled labor in the planning-and-sizing process as a result of this announcement. Include in your discussion how this behavior could be influenced by management.

 12-29 Cutler Electronics makes a radio-cassette player, CE100, which has 80 components- ANSWER KEY 
 12-29 Target prices, target costs, value engineering, cost incurrence, locked-in cost, activity-based costing. 



Target prices, target costs, value engineering, cost incurrence, locked-in costs, activity based costing.

Cutler Electronics makes a radio-cassette player, CE100, which has 80 components. Cutler sells 7,000 units each month for $70 each. The costs of manufacturing CE100 are $45 per unit, or $315,000 per month. Monthly manufacturing costs incurred are:

Cutler’s management views direct material costs and direct manufacturing labor costs as variable with respect to the units of CE100 manufactured. Over a long-run horizon, each of the overhead costs described in the preceding table varies, as described, with the chosen cost drivers.

The following additional information describes the existing design:

a. Testing and inspection time per unit is 2.5 hours.

b. 10% of the CE100’s manufactured are reworked.

c. Cutler places two orders with each component supplier each month. Each component is supplied by a different supplier.

d. It currently takes 1 hour to manufacture each unit of CE100.



In response to competitive pressures, Cutler must reduce its price to $62 per unit and its costs by $8 per unit. No additional sales are anticipated at this lower price. However, Cutler stands to lose significant sales if it does not reduce its price. Manufacturing has been asked to reduce its costs by $6 per unit. Improvements in manufacturing efficiency are expected to yield a net savings of $1.50 per radio-cassette player, but that is not enough. The chief engineer has proposed a new modular design that reduces the number or components to 50 and also simplifies testing. The newly designed radio-cassette player, called“New CE100”will replace CE100.

The expected effects of the new design are as follows:

a. Direct material costs for the New CE100 is expected to be lower by $2.20 per unit.

b. Direct manufacturing labor cost for the New CE100 is expected to be lower by $0.50 per unit.

c. Machining time required to manufacture the New CE100 is expected to be 20% less, but machine-hour capacity will not be reduced.

d. Time required for testing New CE100 is expected to be lower by 20%.

e. Rework is expected to decline to 4% of New CE100s manufactured.

f. Engineering-hours capacity will remain the same.

Assume that the cost per unit of each driver for CE100 continues to apply to New CE100.



1. Calculate Cutler’s manufacturing costs per unit of New CE100.

2. Will the new design achieve the per-unit costs-reduction targets that have been set for the manufacturing costs of New CE100? Show your calculations.

3. The problem describes two strategies to reduce costs: (a) improving manufacturing efficiency and (b) modifying product design. Which strategy has more impact on Cutler’s costs? Why? Explain briefly.

 9-A1 Responsibility of Purchasing Agent- ANSWER KEY 
 9-A1 Responsibility of Purchasing Agent 

 Excel Electronics Company, a privately held enterprise, has a subcontract from a large aerospace company in Chicago. Although Excel was a low bidder, the aerospace company was reluctant to award the business to the company because it was a newcomer to this kind of activity. Consequently, Excel assured the aerospace company of its financial strength by submitting its audited financial statements. Moreover, Excel agreed to pay a penalty of $5,000 per day for each day of late delivery for whatever cause.

Jean Schlinger, the Excel purchasing agent, is responsible for acquiring materials and parts in time to meet production schedules. She placed an order with an Excel supplier for a critical manufactured component. The supplier, who had a reliable record for meeting schedules, gave Schlinger an acceptable delivery date. Schlinger checked up several times and was assured that the component would arrive at Excel on schedule.

On the date specified by the supplier for shipment to Excel, Schlinger was informed that the component had been damaged during final inspection. It was delivered ten days late. Schlinger had allowed four extra days for possible delays, but Excel was six days late in delivering to the aerospace company and so had to pay a penalty of $30,000.

What department should bear the penalty? Why?

 8-48 Delaware Chemical Company supplies primarily industrial users-ANSWER KEY 
 8-48 Standard Material Allowances 

 Delaware Chemical Company supplies primarily industrial users. Your superior has asked you to develop a standard product cost for a new solution the company plans to introduce.
The new chemical solution is made by combining altium and bollium, boiling the mixture, adding credix, and bottling the resulting solution in 20-liter containers. The initial mix, which is 20 liters in volume, consists of 24 kilograms of altium and 19.2 liters of bollium. A 20% reduction in volume occurs during the boiling process. The solution is then cooled slightly before adding 10 kilograms of credix to each 20-liter container; the addition of credix does not affect the total liquid volume.
The purchase prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of this new chemical solution are as follows:
______________________________
Altium $2.20 per kilogram
Bollium $4.60 per liter
Credix $2.80 per kilogram


Determine the standard quantity for each of the raw materials needed to produce 20 liters of Delaware Chemical Company&apos;s new chemical solution and the total standard materials cost of 20 liters of the new product.

 8-46 Poulsbo Kayak Company makes molded plastic kayaks-ANSWER KEY 
 8-46 Material, Labor, and Overhead Variances 

 Poulsbo Kayak Company makes molded plastic kayaks. Standard costs for an entry-level whitewater kayak are
_________________________________________
Direct materials, 60 lb @ $5.50/lb $330
Direct labor, 1.5 hr @ $16/hr 24
Overhead, @ $12 per kayak 12
Total $366

The overhead rate assumes production of 450 kayaks per month. The overhead cost function is $2,808 + ($5.76 X number of kayaks). During March, Poulsbo produced 430 kayaks and had the following actual results.
_______________________________________________________
Direct materials purchased and used 27,000 pounds @ $5.30/lb
Direct labor 670 hours @ $15.90/hr
Actual overhead $5,335

1. Compute material, labor, and overhead variances

2. Interpret the variances.

3. Suppose the cost function for variable overhead was $3.84 per labor hour instead of $5.76 per kayak. Compute the variable-overhead efficiency variance and the total overhead spending variance. Would these variances lead you to a different interpretation of the overhead variances from the interpretation in requirement 2? Explain.

 8-28 Materials-support costs for the Pittsburgh Steel Company (PSC)- ANSWER KEY 
 8-28 Activity-Level Variances 

Materials-support costs for the Pittsburgh Steel Company (PSC) are variable costs that depend on the weight of material (plate steel, castings, etc.) moved. For the current budget period and based on scheduled production, PSC expected to move 750,000 pounds of material at a cost of $.25 per pound. Several orders were canceled by customers, and PSC moved only 650,000 pounds of material. Total materials support costs for the period were $177,000. Compare actual support costs to the static-budget support costs by computing static budget, activity-level, and flexible-budget variances for materials-support costs.

Burton Transportation Company’s general manager reports quarterly to the company president on the firm’s operating performance. The company uses a budget based on detailed expectations for the forthcoming quarter. The general manager has just received the condensed quarterly performance report shown in Exhibit 8-10.
Although the general manager was upset about not obtaining enough revenue, she was happy that her cost performance was favorable; otherwise her net operating income would be even worse.
The president was totally unhappy and remarked,“I can see some merit in comparing actual performance with budgeted performance because we can see whether actual revenue coincided with our best guess for budget purposes. But I can’t see how this performance report helps me evaluate cost control performance”.
 
1. Prepare a columnar flexible budget for Burton Transportation at revenue levels of $7,600,000, $8,000,000 and $8,400,000. Use the format of the last three columns of Exhibit 8-2, pae 345, Assume that the prices and mix of products sold are equal to the budgeted prices and mix.

 ACC 206- Decision Case 1 PowerSwitch, Inc., designs and manufactures switches used in telecommunications-ANSWER KEY 
 ACC 206: Accounting II Chapter 18 

 Decision Case 1 

PowerSwitch, Inc., designs and manufactures switches used in telecommunications. Serious flooding throughoutNorth Carolinaaffected PowerSwitch&apos;s facilities. Inventory was completely ruined, and the company&apos;s computer system, including all accounting records, was destroyed. Before the disaster recovery specialists clean the buildings, Stephen Plum, the company controller, is anxious to salvage whatever records he can to support an insurance claim for the destroyed inventory. He is standing in what is left of the accounting department with Paul Lopez, the cost accountant.

“I didn’t know mud could smell so bad,”Paul says.“What should I be looking for?”“Don’t worry about beginning inventory numbers.”responds Stephen,“we’ll get them from last year&apos;s annual report. We need first-quarter cost data.”

“I was working on the first-quarter results just before the storm hit,”Paul says.“Look, my report&apos;s still in my desk drawer. All I can make out is that for the first quarter, material purchases were $476,000 and direct labor, manufacturing overhead, and total manufacturing costs to account for were $505,000; $245,000; and $1,425,000; respectively. Wait! Cost of goods available for sale was $1,340,000.”“Great,”says Stephen.“I remember that sales for the period were approximately $1,700,000. Given our gross profit of 30%, that&apos;s all you should need.”

Paul is not sure about that, but decides to see what he can do with this information. The beginning inventory numbers are

•Direct materials, $113,000

•Work in process, $229,000

•Finished goods, $154,000.

He remembers a schedule he learned in college that may help him get started.

Requirements

1. Exhibit 16-11 resembles the schedule Paul has in mind. Use it to determine the ending inventories of direct materials, work in process, and finished goods.

2. Draft an insurance claim letter for the controller, seeking reimbursement for the flood damage to inventory. PowerSwitch’s insurance representative is Gary Ogleby, at Industrial Insurance Co.,1122 Main Street,Hartford,CT06268. The policy number is #3454340-23. PowerSwitch’s address is5 Research Triangle Way,Raleigh,NC27698.
