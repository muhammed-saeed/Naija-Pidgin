The Miami Shit Lady

It was the summer of 2005 and I was about to embark upon a month-long trip to Europe. After my parents dropped me off at the airport in Miami, the point of origin for my summer adventures, I had some time to kill before the flight. Naturally, I stopped at the airport bar.



I had a few beers. I pondered the trip on which I was about to embark. I wondered what adventures lay ahead. I people-watched. I enjoyed those beers. I decided that before I would go to the gate I should use the restroom, because no one likes going to the bathroom on an airplane and this was going to be a long flight to London. I gathered my belongings and headed to the head.



As I walked, I noticed a strong odor permeating the air. It got stronger as I approached the bathrooms. I figured it was coming from the men&apos;s room, because a smell that foul does not usually come from a female -- at least, not in public. I trudged forward and, upon looking down, noticed brown smears on the ground. I thought to myself that it was fudge or, at worst, dog shit or some other explainable substance.



I reached the ladies room and fear gripped me as I realized that the smell was emanating from the female latrine.



&quot;Fine,&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;It will dissipate. I can handle it.&quot;



I stepped inside the bathroom and looked to my right, following the brown smear trail with my eyes, noticing that it headed to a stall. There was someone in that first stall against the wall. I looked down again, as my attention was drawn to what was on the ground: crumpled on the floor of the stall were a pair of what I assume were once white pants. Surrounding, covering, and fully entwined in the pile of white fabric was the stinkiest shit I have ever smelled. It looked to be the consistency of oatmeal. Brown, stinky oatmeal.



I hurried to the stall, embarrassed to be there, embarrassed more for whatever poor soul was occupying that stall. I quickly took care of what I needed to do and -- just as I was about to exit the stall, relieved with the knowledge that it would all soon be over -- I heard a toilet flush and a woman say, in a heavy accent, &apos;&apos;I had the diarrhea and couldn&apos;t make it in time.&apos;&apos;



I froze. When I was able to move again, I realized that the smell was beginning to make me queasy. I gagged. I knew I had to get out of there fast, but now I was faced with another problem: I knew that if I were to leave that stall, I would come face to face with a woman who had shit her pants. What would I do? What could I say?



I braved it. I had no other choice. I opened the stall door. And what I saw haunts me still.



There, standing in front of the sink, was the woman. She was an older woman who, under better circumstances, would probably be a nice, cordial lady. She stood at the sink, fear and shame lining her face, washing pants that had previously been covered in shit. Now, you may ask yourself, what was she wearing if she was washing her pants in the sink? Well, I will tell you, nothing. She was standing there dressed from the waist up, but she wore nothing below the waist except for some shit and some shit-covered Pumas.



I gagged as I washed my hands. There was another girl in the bathroom and we both desperately clawed at the paper towel dispensers for something to dry our hands with, all the while looking at each other uncomfortably. I almost gagged again as I ran out of there.



The shit trail was still outside, a bitter reminder of the horrors within. I got to the gate and then decided to call my friend Brandon because I had to tell *someone* of the nightmare that had just been realized right before my eyes. I stood at the payphone, noticing a man to my right, hung up, and just stood by the gate. I then checked the bottom of my shoe because who knows, I may have stepped in human fecal matter.



I did.



There, on the bottom of my shoe, was human crap.



I cleaned that off in a *different* restroom. (Where I received some curious looks.)



I thought that I had seen the last of the Miami Shit Lady. But just as that thought had been fully processed in my head, I smelled the faint odor of human shit. Panic-struck, I looked around and there, approaching my gate, was the Miami Shit Lady herself. She spoke to her husband -- the man by the payphone.



She was wearing those pants, shit-stained and smelly and wet.



I was certain that I would be sat next to the couple on the plane. I rehearsed and rehearsed what I would say to get out of that situation. The story has a happy ending, though. She did not sit anywhere near me.

Why didn&apos;t you try to find another bathroom?

I suspect that you had some sort of morbid fascination regarding this human melodrama similar to &quot;rubber necking&quot; on the highway.

But I had to admit that seeing a human being standing in an airport latrine naked from the waste down scrubbing poo out of their skivvies ranks right up there in melodramatic horrors.

I guess this is off topic, but what is it about human nature that draws us to the most disgusting type of spectacles?

For that matter, I confess to a uniquely male temptation to look down women&apos;s shirts when they bend over in public. Doesnt matter how old they are, the boobies call my name. I feel like a degenerate pervert when I see a pair of eighty year old boobs but i still look

I&apos;m in a panic mood right now. I fly into Miami Thursday! If I see the shit lady I&apos;ll give her a friendly wave. Let her know how famous she is now.

Luckly i&apos;m a guy, so she won&apos;t be adding terror to my restroom at the airport.

I can&apos;t believe she&apos;d stand there bottomless. I guess she already lost her pride in little bits and pieces on the way to the restroom. Can&apos;t do much worse.

That was a funny story. It made me laugh out loud.

This reminds me of an incident that happened when I worked at a department store about 15 years ago.
The employees were forced to use the customer restrooms. One time I went in the men&apos;s room and I too saw a crumpled pair of pants covered in shit on a stall floor. The guy was on the pot shitting and moaning.
I immediately left and about an hour later I returned to the same restroom and the guy was still in the stall, naked and sitting on the floor, apparently ill.
We called the manager and he dealt with it; I wish I could have seen what happened but those slave drivers made me get back to work.

My heart goes out to that poor woman.We should all carry some type of over the counter medication for the runs when we travel.You never know when you might eat something that gives you the shits.If she was willing to stand bottomless at the sink maybe she should have dropped trou and let fly and saved her pants.

no over the counter medication is going to stop a colon full of raging diarrhea from exploding.

I will never shit my pants unless I am in a coma or otherwise unconscience. No matter how embarrassing it might be to blow mud in front of strangers, I would prefer that to wearing shitted in pants from Miami to London, or any other place. Good story

Merc, I dont think I knew at the time where there was another bathroom. Also, I think perhaps there was a panic-survival mode that was kicked into gear and all I could think about was the purpose of my visit, thank god I didn&apos;t have to do anything serious in there!

Wipeitclean, I&apos;d still be a little worried... My friend just flew into Miami a couple days ago and he saw poop on the floor in the mens room!

I really did feel bad for the lady. I would have tried to help her out some but the smell really was just tremendous! I seriously almost vomited.

For the entire trip in Europe, I would suddenly get the image of the poop-pants one the floor in my mind. I would be walking down the street in Vienna and have to stop in my tracks and take a deep breath to try to clear the image from my head... It was disturbing.

GGG, Daphne - You have good hearts and speak the truth. I&apos;m glad I read this post because should I happen upon someone in this situation in the future, I will remember it and hopefully be jarred from the initial shock and think to offer some assistance. Gym shorts in my travel bag I can spare, clean tee shirt, go fetch your travel companion, etc?

For those who think it could never happen to them, google &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;diarrhea&quot; (million plus hits). There but for the grace of God &quot;go&quot; you. Believe it.

GGG, yours was the reaction I was hoping to see. We PoopReporters are enlightened to the circumstances that underly every nightmare. We see the humor, but we also see the tragedy -- and where other people will run from the scene, we are the people who will rise to the occasion and do what we can to return the poor victim&apos;s humanity.

Easier said than done, of course. But I like to think we&apos;d be the kind to help in spite of our horror.

I was recently on a flight from Denver to Seattle, this woman may have been on the plane. A couple of minutes after take off, I looked at my friend and asked him if he shit himself, he in turn asked if it was me. Both of us knowing we would claim it knew neither of us did it. I really dont think it was a fart, and the smell lasted half of the flight. It was so bad at one point I asked one of the flight attendants to make an announcement that the toilet in the middle of the plane was unoccupied and available for use.
I understand people get nervouse flying, but my god after the second fart if you have not litteraly shat yourself please. Go use the uncomfortable toilet and expell the demon trying to get out.
Im a big man, and if I can fit in there virtually anyone else can as well. Think of the rest of us.

In light of Dave&apos;s, Daphne&apos;s and 3G&apos;s commments, it would have been wrong then to tell the nearest airline employee that there was somebody committing an act of bio-terrorism in the women&apos;s room? I&apos;m sure that airport security would have been more than happy to help her with her needs.

&quot;...what the fuck is a moral black hole?&quot; George Bush&apos;s foreign policy. And, of course, the story&apos;s victim&apos;s husband&apos;s failure to get new clothes for his wife. Also, see my previous post.

&quot;Do you speak english?&quot; I thought it was English. Unless, of course TD was writing in some very strange dialect of English, like Ebonics for literate people.

Of course, maybe I missed the point. TD wrote in English. TD posted in English. I haven&apos;t actually heard TD speak in english, or in English either, for that matter. So, I can&apos;t actually say that TD speaks english. I can, however, say that CEP fell for TD&apos;s troll bait.

Okay, 3G. The next time you shit all over yourself at the airport, I&apos;ll be sure to let the nearest airport employee know. And I&apos;ll even let you borrow my handkerchief as well.

Besides, I don&apos;t mean to doubt DF&apos;s veracity, but do you think that the airline employees at the gate or the flight crew would actually let somebody that clearly wreaked of crap on a crowded airplane for a 5+ hour flight? I&apos;m willing to suspend disbelief for this one only because it&apos;s funny and the woman wasn&apos;t getting on my international flight.

Deja Poo, I know the story seems, at times, like I bent the truth, but it really happened like that (trust me, it replayed in my mind over and over and over again).

In retrospect I wish I could/would have helped her. I was just so shocked that clear, logical, good-samaritan thought escaped me. I know if the situation ever presented itself to me again, I would certainly purchase a pair of pants for her. At the time, I had never seen or heard of such a happening. Now, with this experience under my belt, I have learned that you never know what situation you might find yourself in when you enter a restroom. I know that I will be stronger and more willing to lend aid to a person in need next time.

Drowned Ferret, I can&apos;t begin to tell you how many times in the past that I didn&apos;t do what I wanted to in a crazy situation because I was either too shocked or afraid to. So, don&apos;t feel bad. It took me over 30 years of floundering around on this earth before I found the confidence to get involved with other people&apos;s problems when it seemed like someone needed help.

Years ago I was managing the night shift at a fast food restaurant when a young boy approached the counter and told me he puked in the lobby. When a crew person and I went to investigate we found a big pile of puke right next to a trail of liquid shit. The trail of shit led right into the mens restroom and into a vacant stall where there was a pair of completely soaked-in-poop underwear next to the toilet and shit EVERYWHERE! There was shit on the toilet, the handrail, the flusher, the TP dispenser, the walls, the floor, the sink, even the hand drier. Someones ass had to have exploded. The smell was so overpowering It makes me sick just thinking about it. I considered asking the fire department to blast the entire facility with a fire hose.

Nice debut Drowned Ferret! I thought about what GGG said about helping this person out in her time of need, if it was me and a guys bathroom I probably would have done what you did. For all we know the woman could&apos;ve been a cocaine mule and a condom broke and sped up her bowels to Formula One proportions. Miami is the leader for cocaine seizures of passengers entering the US.

Yeah, but the story and GGG and Daphne&apos;s comments reminded me of the lessons I leaned in sociology, about the Kitty Genovese case: &quot;bystander apathy&quot;-- &apos;the reluctance of people to &quot;get involved&quot; in an apparent emergency affecting a stranger in public.&apos;
I learned from that to always ask if someone needs help, even if it&apos;s just something minor. Tho&apos; I DO admit, it would be quite difficult to approach a shit covered person!!!! Yikes!

As someone who has shit their pants in public (at a strip shopping mall) I can sympathize completely with this poor lady. I had the same thing, shit leaking down the legs of my pants, pooling onto the floor, I too had to wash my pants out half-naked at the sink. I was lucky, no one else came in, but here&apos;s the kicker. The restrooms were locked, and in order to gain access, you had to go to any one of the stores in the mall and ask for a key. Immediately after shitting my pants, I went to the nearest store-a women&apos;s craft store, and Just my luck, the elderly female clerk was talking with two other ladies. I tried to hide my shame, but a gob of shit rolled down my leg, out onto the floor. The clerk and the two ladies looked down for a minute at my feet and this gob of poop, saying nothing, then she said very matter-of-factly &quot;Yes, I think you&apos;d better get to the restroom. So I left, leaving the same type of brown trail that you described, all the way to the john. Did the same things that this lady did-cleaned up the best I could, then I still had to return the key to the store. On the way back, I noticed that my shit trail was cleaned up-the custodial staff must have worked fast. I returned the key to the lady in the store, still stinking like shit and muttering my apologies. She just told me not to worry and to get home and get cleaned up-she was a sweetheart and tried not to embarrass me any more than I already was. If I had been in this lady&apos;s situation in a crowded airport infront of tons of people-I don&apos;t know how I would have handled it. I&apos;d have fear and shame on my face, too. The poor thing. You said she had a heavy accent, she was probally from a foreign country-maybe the change in food gave her the diarrhea. And she had to sit on a plane for hours yet in these shitty pants. Oh my!!! If I ever travel, I&apos;ll carry extra clothing and a clean-up kit of wet-wipes and paper towels just in case I ever run into someone in this same situation, or it happens to me. It COULD have happened to you, you know, could happen to anyone. So let&apos;s not be so harsh and judge others.

About ...
 
PoopReport.com is a community with a unique agenda: we are an intellectual poop site. A salon. A brokerage house that specializes in a specific category of humor: brown humor (vs. gallows humor or black humor). We explore, even meditate upon the human condition from the vantage point of pooping and poop. In a way, this is a site for philosophers, sociologists and amateur theologians.

Sometimes we talk about sex, but there&apos;s no erotic agenda. (There are other sites for that.) Because PR is a community and not a porno site, we do not come here to get our rocks off. And that also means we don&apos;t come to PR to be used as objects by voyeurs, or use others as objects. Voyeurism destroys mutuality. PoopReport.com is rooted in mutuality because it celebrates the universality of poop.
