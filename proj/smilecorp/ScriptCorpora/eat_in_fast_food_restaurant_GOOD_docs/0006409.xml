 &quot;Should you give money to homeless people?&quot; No 
 Good article:
 http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/03/should-you-give-money-to-homeless-people/72820/ 

Unrelated, I just watched the DVD &quot;The Bum Show.com&quot; and it was terrible. Most of it is bums enacting lame skits. Stick with the original Bum Fights series. They are absolute classics.

 Homeless upset that businesses actually want to make money 
 From http://www.myfoxny.com/dpps/news/homeless-upset-about-mcdonalds-dollar-menu-increase-dpgoh-20100907-fc_9517802 

 Homeless Upset About McDonald&apos;s Dollar Menu Increase

...the eatery [McDonald&apos;s] got rid of its Dollar Menu about a month ago. That move, which McDonald&apos;s called a simple business decision, means items on the menu are now too expensive for the people who spend much of their day hanging out on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.

Items on the Dollar Menu now cost around $1.50. OMG 50 cents more! You&apos;re breaking my bank!

The article goes on to say:
 Homelessness has been a problem in San Francisco for decades. Tension between business owners and homeless people who hang out on sidewalks in front of their stores and offices has prompted Mayor Gavin Newsom and some Haight Street merchants to support a ballot measure in November that would ban sitting or lying on public sidewalks, The Chronicle reported.

Some homeless people think the more expensive menu is the next logical step in the crackdown, though the move does not affect other McDonald&apos;s in the city.

&quot;That means that the Dollar Menu is a hoax, a fraud, a phony,&quot; Blake Edwards told KGO-TV . Homeless people are like the opposite of Vulcans when it comes to logic. McDonalds restaurants all over the United States have price differences. It is totally within the rights of a restaurant to raise their prices, and it can certainly make sense to do so if profitable. As discussed in the Bum Hate article &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons - An example of bums ruining it for everyone&quot; , some McDonalds have to turn off their soda fountains and not offer free refills because of the homeless people stealing soda. If the bums don&apos;t like the price increase, they&apos;re more than welcome to go to a competing restaurant. That&apos;s how capitalism works baby! FUCK YEAH!

 &quot;We reserve the right to refuse service to any dirty homeless mother fucker&quot;

 Carts of Darkness - Real documentary on homeless extreme shopping cart racing 
 

Here&apos;s the description from nfb.ca:
 Murray Siple&apos;s feature-length documentary follows a group of homeless men who have combined bottle picking with the extreme sport of racing shopping carts down the steep hills of North Vancouver. This subculture depicts street life as much more than the stereotypes portrayed in mainstream media. The film takes a deep look into the lives of the men who race carts, the adversity they face and the appeal of cart racing despite the risk. Shot in high-definition and featuring tracks from Black Mountain, Ladyhawk, Vetiver, Bison, and Alan Boyd of Little Sparta. LoL in the first 3 minutes a bum crashes his cart full of shit into a car, breaks his leg, and says &quot;Just get me the hell out of here.&quot; Great, the bum will pay nothing and both the insurance company and the government will lose money by paying for the car repairs and the bum&apos;s medical bills respectively.

The documentary shows a bunch of homeless scavengers stealing money from the city of Vancouver by taking all the recyclables out of the recycle bins. Why this is stealing is addressed in a previous Bum Hate article found here. 

I started writing this post nearly two years ago, so the rest of the post will be mostly from memory, since I&apos;m not going to watch the entire documentary again...

First off, these bums are stealing shopping carts. Shopping carts cost money. Now a days many stores have to put electronic devices on the shopping carts to prevent their theft, which costs even more money.

It&apos;s actually kind of impressive how good these bums are at riding the carts. The bums act like the carts are skateboards.

One of the bums says he &quot;could probably get a damn job tomorrow&quot; but then wouldn&apos;t show up for two days in a row because he was on bender and would get fired. That&apos;s messed up. The guy lacks responsibility and discipline and would rather leech off of society. Yes I realize he most likely has an alcohol problem. In fact, the video shows quite a few bums that just sit around and drink booze instead of working. They should be saving their money for something important like food or a home. Hell, one of the bums is even wearing a Budweiser t-shirt. It&apos;s ironic that he&apos;s basically advertising for the root of his problems.

Lastly, some of the homeless in this documentary say what many homeless people say: they prefer being homeless because of the freedom. Sorry bums, but this is just backwards rationalization for being homeless. Who has more freedom, an employed man with money in his pocket who can eat at whatever restaurant he wants, or a bum with no money who, for every meal, must scavenge for garbage, steal, or beg for change just to afford the cheapest of food items? Who has more freedom, an employed man with money who can choose to live in a variety of apartments, condos, or houses, or a bum with no money who can choose to sleep in a limited selection of alleys or shelters that must provide enough warmth so he doesn&apos;t die of hypothermia at night? The freedom that homelessness offers is like the freedom to get hit in the nut sack a variety of different ways. It sucks any which way.

 Booze leads to a variety of problems

 Bum wins money, blows it all and dies in a pile of malt liquor bottles 
 This story is amazing and really doesn&apos;t even need any commentary from me, because it writes itself.
 From skid row to riches to an early grave
Steven Schulman, a homeless man who won a large judgment after being run over by a semi, is found dead at age 55. http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-rags-to-riches-20100818,0,6926110.story 

His story was originally chronicled in the LA Times at http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/14/local/la-me-rags-to-riches-20100615 

Basically this bum Schulman was sleeping in the middle of an alley, and a trucker accidentally ran over the guy&apos;s legs, because he didn&apos;t think anyone would be stupid enough to sleep in the middle of a fucking alley. An ambulance-chasing vampiric lawyer saw an opportunity to turn Schulman&apos;s bloody legs into money and sued the trucking company of the driver. Schulman won almost $700,000!
 
Story highlights: In the months that followed, Schulman wasted no time spending his fortune. He took frequent trips to fine sushi restaurants, hollering for sake refills and filets. He adorned his new apartment with flat screen TVs and sports memorabilia. 

 When a lightly used black Corvette he purchased went missing, he didn&apos;t wait longer than a couple of days to replace it with a brand new red Corvette. The misplaced Corvette was later recoveredâ€”and he kept both. He burned through more than $200,000 of his lawsuit money (from a total of $350,000 after lawyer fees, loans and other costs) in less than a year.

 ...Doctors warned him to stop drinking, but on a recent afternoon his home was littered with empty cans of mixed drinks. 
 He was found dead beside several empty bottles of King Cobra malt liquor Tuesday morning, said his attorney, Gary Casselman. Neighbors grew concerned when they heard his dog, Pebbles, whimpering behind the door. Their attention had already been piqued, Casselman said, because they hadn&apos;t seen Schulman walking the massive German shepherd mix outside the apartment complex. ...Since Schulman&apos;s legal victory, Casselman said, the dog had grown fat from a steady diet of cheeseburgers. Wow, that is all spectacular and sensational. This story really illustrates how giving homeless people money is not much better than throwing the money away. Separately it shows how some people will always be broke no matter how much money they make. Schulman suffered from sheer and utter stupidity when it came to money. He was an alcoholic, but there are alcoholics that earn wages and don&apos;t go broke. However, if this guy had freed himself of his addiction to alcohol, he still would have blown all of his money, as evident by his frivolous purchases. Science has not yet developed a way to inject intelligence into dumb mother fuckers like this bum. What are our options then? Unfortunately smacking the shit out of him won&apos;t knock some sense into him. He would have been better off if someone (his lawyer? the government?) confiscated his money and gave it to him in small payments, rather than giving him the lump sum that he blew through. Perhaps there could be government intervention on spending for those who have been on welfare or who have been homeless...If society has had to support someone, that person gives up some rights for a period of time with any money earned and has to show good spending habits to prove that society won&apos;t have to support them again.

 Steven Schulman would have blown through even a gorillion dollars.

 Homeless can&apos;t resist eating poisoned food 
 From Sintaxi: http://www.thelocal.se/15682/20081113/ 
 Lidl issues scavenger poisoned food apology
Discount German supermarket chain Lidl has issued an apology after workers at one of its Swedish stores deliberately poisoned discarded food in a bid to keep homeless people at bay.

&quot;Lidl Sweden has been informed that cleaning liquids have been poured into the trash to stop trespassers from stealing garbage at one of our stores during a short time period,&quot; Mathias Kivikoski, Lidl&apos;s chief executive in Sweden, said in a statement.

&quot;We deeply regret what has happened and this is not something the company recommends or permits,&quot; it added. Don&apos;t apologize, you have nothing to be sorry about.
 A newspaper in the Stockholm suburb of Solna revealed that Lidl employees at a local store had become tired of homeless people searching trash bins had last week begun pouring toxic cleaning products on discarded food.

They put up a sign near the bins warning that the goods had been poisoned, but it remained unclear if anyone had eaten the food, the Mitt i Solna paper reported.
Food had disappeared from the bins after the staff began poisoning it, it said. LoLz don&apos;t put it past a homeless person to ignore the danger signs and eat the poisoned food. Poisoned garbage sounds delicious.
 Rolf Nilsson, who heads a Stockholm homeless organization, described the employees&apos; actions as &quot;crazy.&quot;
&quot;This is just so upsetting and distressing. We&apos;re talking about people who have to dig in garbage containers to find food to eat,&quot; Nilsson told the Aftonbladet daily. I guarantee that the article omits the part where the homeless people make a huge fucking mess when they scavenge for food and don&apos;t clean it up. In general they are filthy fucking parasites who leave a place messier and worse off than it was when they got there. If the bums didn&apos;t create extra work for the supermarkets, restaurants, and garbage men by throwing trash out of the dumpster and leaving it strewn about, then there wouldn&apos;t be a problem. Gawd forbid that the bums pick up after themselves or, *GASP*, leave the place cleaner and better than when they found it! That&apos;s just CrAzY TaLK!

 Hell yeah Admiral Ackbar, but when you post a sign saying that the food is poison, then it&apos;s not really a trap... at 7:36 PM 4 comments: Links to this post

 God Damn Transients 
 http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-station-fire20-2009oct20,0,2477803.story?track=rss 

 
Babatunsin Olukunle 
 Transient charged with setting blaze 6 days before Station fire

Officials say they&apos;re still investigating whether Babatunsin Olukunle, a 25-year-old Nigerian national, may have played a role in the massive Station wildfire as well.

A man sought for questioning in the massive Station wildfire that killed two firefighters has been arrested and charged with setting a smaller blaze less than a week before in Angeles National Forest, authorities said Monday. Really transient? You can&apos;t just stay out of the way, you have to set fires that cause millions of dollars worth of damage and take innocent lives? Man you suck. You&apos;re the worst.

 Tito Ortiz is AWESOME 
 From TMZ, check out the video:
 Tito Chastises &apos;Lazy&apos; Homeless Guy

A self-described &quot;homeless&quot; man hit up the wrong person for cash -- because last night Tito Ortiz handed out brutal honesty instead of $10 bills. http://www.tmz.com/2009/09/30/tito-chastises-lazy-homeless-guy/ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I was already a big fan of Tito Ortiz and even used to have a Punishment Athletics poster hanging up in my apartment. This just makes me love him more. at 7:34 PM 1 comment: Links to this post

 Quick anecdote - Hood Rich 
 So my former roommate on Facebook posted &quot;Just got asked for change by an individual with real 135 dollar basketball shoes on. Are you kidding me?&quot;

This is the same roommate that was with me for the Taco Bell &quot;change comes from within&quot; story .

Back in Chicago in 2005, there was always this beggar by Ogilvie train station asking for change. He was always smoking cigarettes and I saw him wearing a complete matching outfit: shirt, shorts, shoes, all perfectly coordinated with its purposefully obscure matching colors of maroon and baby blue. He was dressed nicer than me yet was shaking a cup full of change at people while smoking a cancer stick! What an asshole.

Wearing expensive ass shoes or clothes and at the same time asking for money really shows the ignorant &quot;hood rich&quot; mentality of these people. Friends of mine who are teachers in ghetto areas see kids come to school with the newest Air Jordans, yet the same kids don&apos;t even have money to eat lunch. This ignorance even spreads across continents. On the Jay-Z &quot;Water For Life&quot; MTV special , Jay-Z travels to Angola and South Africa and meets people who have to travel a couple of miles to haul back a small tank of water, which needs to last an entire family one week for drinking, bathing, cleaning, etc. They then show that these same people own cell phones! WTF? Do the cell phones even get service out there? It&apos;s ridiculous and sad that some people place vain frivolous material possessions ahead of basic life necessities. Expensive cars, jewelry, lavish houses...you don&apos;t need these things, save your money instead.
