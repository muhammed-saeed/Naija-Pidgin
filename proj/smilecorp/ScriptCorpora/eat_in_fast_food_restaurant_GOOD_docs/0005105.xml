 Advantages: Great food, good service and away from the crowds

 Disadvantages: The small walk from the town centre
 
I&apos;m rather surprised by the lack of good reviews this place has. I&apos;ve eaten there about half a dozen times in the last two years, with various friends, girlfriend and even my 6 aside football team. Each time everyone has agreed that the food is outstanding, a real good tasty meal, well balanced curries and plenty of choice for those less adventerous souls who prefer a lesser degree of spice. In fact that is my only problem with the place, they rate their dishes on a system of chillies (more symbols the hotter the dish) which is pretty standard stuff, is that I find the dishes a little cool for my liking. We have always found the staff helpful and quick to serve without being overly attentive. Nothing is worse than being in a restuarant and having waiters standing over you whilst you try to have a normal conversation and enjoyable evening. I find the waiters quite funny, for example when I go with my girlfriend they try their best to sell us wine and when the football team go they immediately remove the wine glasses and expect us to all order beer. Its also one of the best Indian takeaways in town, always had good quick service though they don&apos;t deliver. Once when they did mess up my order they gave us a large bottle of beer to compensate.
 
 Summary: A great eatery for any occasion and dishes to suit all
