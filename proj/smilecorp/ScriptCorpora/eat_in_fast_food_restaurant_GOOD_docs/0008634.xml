Many individuals, schools, county employees and businesses are working to &quot;green&quot; Wheaton. I think we can learn from one another about simple ways to reduce our environmental impacts.

I am planning to periodically post examples of what people are doing to reduce their environmental footprint in their small piece of Wheaton. One of my objectives is for homeowners to learn from their neighbors how they can green their homes and yards.  A second objective of these blogs is to inform Wheaton residents about which Wheaton businesses are working to make Wheaton and our nation more sustainable.

A few years ago University of Maryland students surveyed Wheaton residents and found that many Wheaton residents were interested in patronizing Wheaton&apos;s green businesses, but it was not always obvious which businesses were green. For my first attempt at passing along information on green businesses, I am going to blog about Elevation Burger at the Westfield Shoppingtown Mall. 

Elevation Burger is a nationwide burger chain that has made reducing its environmental impact and providing healthy options an ongoing effort.  The restaurant offers 100% USDA-Certified organic beef. The beef is 100% grass fed and free-range.  Elevation Burger also offers customers vegetarian and vegan burgers.

According to its website, the restaurant uses fresh and sustainably grown vegetables and produce. The website also notes that the restaurant uses local sources when practical.

While waiting for our order, it was fun watching the staff cutting potatoes into fries, which are cooked in olive oil.  You can choose from several toppings for your burger.  I was impressed that the menu appeared to have healthy options (side salads), and the calories per serving were not going to put you over your daily recommended calorie intake.

We found the service quick and courteous. Elevation Burger does have a fast food atmosphere, yet the company uses sustainable building materials and furnishings.  The tabletops, for example, are made from bamboo.  The restaurant works to minimize waste, serving food on reusable metal trays. Many of the restaurant’s green practices are not obvious. Elevation Burger converts its used veggie oil into bio-diesel.  It also purchases Clean Energy Offset Credits.

Overall, my family enjoyed the food, and the prices were reasonable. I also found the visit very educational. Did you know that the corn-fed beef industry is a major source of greenhouse gases?  I learned this from their cold drink cup. For a fast food restaurant, the food was good, and I would encourage you to check out the Elevation Burger the next time you are shopping at Westfield Shoppingtown Mall.

Are you doing anything to green your lifestyle at home or in your Wheaton business? Let me know, and I will try to feature what you are doing.

Had dinner there tonight. Delish. I had the&quot;half the guilt&quot;burger, it had one beef patty and one of the veggie burgers, very tasty. The manager Ed Gruin stopped over to say hello and introduce himself. I told him about Green Wheaton and he&apos;s interested in learning more so I&apos;m sending him the link to your blog Ed. Oh and the vanilla malt was really yummy too. I haven&apos;t eaten fast food in about 20 years, but I&apos;ll make an exception for the occasional elevation burger.
