 Colonial Era McDonald&apos;s This McDonald&apos;s is indeed in a historic building but it is most certainly not from the colonial era. I believe it&apos;s late 19th century (the exact date is on a plaque inside). [Edward Mazza, 07/03/2010] Colonial McDonald&apos;s There&apos;s the colonial McDonald&apos;s in New Hyde Park, NY (on Long Island). The landmark commission wouldn&apos;t let them tear down the historic mansion they purchased, so they restored the outside and converted the inside to a fast food restaurant. [Bob Buethe, 06/20/1998] [ RA : Photo of McD&apos;s in August 2001, courtesy Mike Hoffman.]
