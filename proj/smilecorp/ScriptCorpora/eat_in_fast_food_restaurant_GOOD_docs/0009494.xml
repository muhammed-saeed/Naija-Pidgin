Description:

 BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 

 [0001] The present invention relates to a trash receiving device more
 particular a device that allows an easy and efficient way of handling
 trays.

 BACKGROUND 

 [0002] Fast food restaurants all use trash cans that allow their customers
 to discard their trash after they eat. Most of these trash cans are
 simple in design. The customer pushes back a flip in the front of the
 trash can and turns their trays to dump everything from their tray in to
 a trash receptacle area in the trash can and place their tray on top of
 the trash can.

 [0003] This design is not efficient as the customer can spill trash on
 themselves and the floor creating a mess for the employees of the fast
 food restaurant to clean up.

 [0004] Trash cans are widely found in parks, offices, malls, streets, fast
 food restaurants and in many other public places and facilities. However,
 people hardly use these trash cans particularly in fast food restaurants.
 They find it difficult to empty their trays after they finish eating, so
 many times the trays are being left on the tables for a cleaner to pick
 them up.

 [0005] Based on the desirability and the infinitely many needs of human
 beings, a new design for a trash can was required for an alternative to
 those used today. A trash can is a container made out of metal, wood or
 plastic and is used to dispose of waste such as waste paper, food
 leftovers, and any disposable material.

 [0006] There is room for improvement in the art.

 SUMMARY OF INVENTION 

 [0007] The present invention relates to a new design for a trash can
 designed to be used in fast food restaurants, in particular. Many
 problems have been solved regarding the fact that the current trash cans
 are being misused or not used at all because they are difficult to use.

 [0008] Most trash cans have lids that need to be opened manually, whereas
 the current invention has a pedal that when stepped on, is used to open
 the lid. A tray loaded with rubbish will be laid on a board that is
 placed at a certain angle. When the foot pedal, which is attached to the
 lid by a spring, is released the board moves and touches the tray at the
 tip, which flips the tray over and causes all the rubbish to fall in the
 hole designed for the trash bag.

 [0009] An electric chip, which uses AA batteries, is being used so that as
 soon as the lid closes again it will make a sound that says, &quot;Thank You!&quot;
 Aluminum rollers are used to roll the tray down to a pile of trays in a
 container.

 [0010] This design will require less from employers and customers and will
 be a benefit for fast food restaurants.

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

 [0020] The following description is demonstrative in nature and is not
 intended to limit the scope of the invention or its application of uses.

 [0021] There are a number of significant design features and improvements
 incorporated within the invention.

 [0022] The device is a trash can 1. The design is called &quot;flipping
 trash-can.&quot; The trash can 1 is designed to flip a tray 10 over. FIG. 1
 shows a front view of the trash can 1. FIG. 2 shows a side view of the
 trash can 1. FIG. 3 shows a top view of the trash can.

 [0023] The major components for the trash can 1 as shown in the cut away
 view in FIG. 4 are the Foot pedal 20, Spring 30, Lid 40, Cover 50, Hole
 60 (for trash bags 65), Rollers 70 and Trays container 80. There is also
 a frame 90 with a bottom 91, top 92, left side 93, right side 94, back
 side 95 and front side 96. The trash can 1 can also have an electric chip
 500.

 [0024] The frame 90 is rectangular in shape with the bottom 91 and top 92
 attaching to all four sides, the front 96, right 94, left 93 and back 95
 with the front 96 attaching to the right 94 and the left 93 in a 90
 degree angle and the back 95 attaching to the right 94 and the left 93 in
 a 90 degree. These sides can be connected through any standard connecting
 means such as glue, bolts, screws and welds.

 [0025] There is a lid 40 attached to the top 92 of the trash can 1. The lid
 40 is attached to a foot pedal 20 that is positioned in the front of the
 trash can 1. The foot pedal 20 is a standard foot pedal. The foot pedal
 20 is attached to the lid 40 by a spring 27. The spring 27 is attached to
 the foot pedal 20 and moved down when the foot pedal 20 is moved down by
 stepping on it. The spring 27 is also attached to lid 40. When the
 connecting rod 27 moves down it pulls the lid 40 down to an open
 position. If a tray 10 is on the lid 40 the tray 10 slides down the lid
 40 when the lid 40 is on the open position.

 [0026] Attached to right side 93 and the left side 92 is the rectangular
 tray block 11 0. The rectangular tray block 110 is in the shape of a &quot;U&quot;
 with the well of the &quot;U&quot; wider than the height of the tray 10. The
 rectangular block 110 stops and tips the tray 10 while it is flipped.

 [0027] Attached to the right side 93 and the left side 92 is the tray slide
 120. The tray slide 120 is a flat surface that is at an angle down from
 the front of the trash can 1. The tray slide&apos;s upper surface is made from
 or coated with a friction reduction surface. In the middle of the tray
 slide 120 is the rectangular hole 60 which opens up to the trash bag 65.
 When the tray 10 is flipped the trash 100 falls into the hole 60 and into
 the trash bag 65. At the bottom of the tray slide 120 is a series of
 rollers 70 which the flipped tray 10 rolls down into the trays container
 80.

 [0028] The trays container 80 is rectangular in shape with a back and
 sides. The trays container 80 is designed so that the trays 10 will stack
 on their side once they roll down the rollers. This keeps the trays 10 in
 order for easy removal.

 [0029] In the preferred embodiment, the top 92 will have a tray holding
 space 17 which will hold the trays 10 for use. The holding space 17 is a
 flat area large enough to hold a tray.

 [0030] The trash can 1 omits a little sound to attract children and
 encourage them to throw away garbage. When they push the door they hear a
 sound like &quot;Thank you&quot;. This is an electric chip 500, which uses AA
 batteries in the preferred embodiment. The sound could also be produced
 by a speaker attached to a sound producing device such as a recorded
 message and an amplifier which is attached to a trigger and a power
 source such as a battery. When the tray passes by the trigger the
 recorded message will play through the speaker. As shown in FIG. 9 the
 microprocessor 500 or a different sound omitting device and trigger can
 be in several locations.

 [0031] The trash can 1 can be made out of metal, wood or plastic and can be
 used to dispose of waste such as waste paper, food leftovers, and any
 disposable material.

 [0032] Operation

 [0033] The person with the tray 10 steps on the pedal 20 at the bottom of
 the trash can 1, which opens the cover 50 at the top because of a spring
 27 between the pedal and the cover 50 at the top. As shown in FIGS. 5 and
 6, the tray 10 slides down until the tray 10 hits the rectangular tray
 block 110. As soon as the person removes his foot from the pedal 20, the
 cover 50 hits the tray 10 and flips it upside down, which makes all the
 trash 100 fall into the trash bag 61. The tray 10 then hits the rollers
 70 and slides down to the pile of trays 10 in the tray container 80.

 [0034] FIG. 6 shows how the tray flips to drop items such as trash 100 into
 the trash bag 61. The tray 10 with the trash on it is placed on the cover
 50 and slides down the cover 50 to the rectangular tray block 110. The
 tray 10 rests briefly on its side at an angle. When the cover 50 is
 released it moves forward hitting the back of the tray 10 and flipping it
 in an orderly fashion. This action deposits the trash 100 from the top of
 the tray 10 to the hole 60 into the trash bag 61. The flipped tray 10
 slides down the trash can&apos;s tray ramp 15 inside the body of the trash can
 1. The last part of the tray ramp 15 has rollers 70 in the preferred
 embodiment for the tray to slide down. The trays slides and falls into
 the tray container 80. The tray container 80 is designed to stack the
 trays as they come down the tray slide 15.

 Alternate Embodiments 

 [0035] There are a number of alternative embodiments for the trash can 1.
 The trash can 1 can be shaped into different shapes such as into teddy
 bears and bunnies to attract children and encourage them to keep the
 place clean as shown in FIG. 7.

 [0036] Another embodiment is to have a transparent plastic sheet 420 on the
 side of the trash can 1 to know when the trash bag 65 is full as shown in
 FIG. 7.

 [0037] In an additional embodiment, an upper handle could be added to the
 lid 40 to ease up opening the door of the garbage for handicapped as also
 shown in FIG. 8.

 [0038] The trash can 1 can also have a small box inside the body 8 that
 gives the person who throws the trash some kind of ticket and the
 restaurant gives the person with the largest number of tickets a
 promotion or free meals to encourage use of the trash can 1. A ticket
 dispenser 400 can be attached to the front of the trash can 1 and
 connected to the microprocessor 500. The ticket dispenser 400 will
 distribute one or more tickets when the microprocessor 500 tells it that
 a tray 10 has been run through the trash can 1 as shown in FIG. 7.

 [0039] Advantages

 [0040] The design of the current invention is like a small factory in a
 garbage can. It benefits a lot of people with its ease of use and eases
 up the process of cleaning. The current invention is designed to be able
 to satisfy cleanliness, ease of use, durability, practicality, external
 appearance, simplicity, age expectancy, and strength of material required
 by a trash can.

 [0041] Although the present invention has been described in considerable
 detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other
 versions are possible. Therefore, the point and scope of the appended
 claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions
 contained herein.

 [0042] As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of
 the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above
 description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of
 usage and operation will be provided.

 [0043] With respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the
 optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to

 of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious
 to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those
 illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are
 intended to be encompassed by the present invention.

 [0044] Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the
 principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and
 changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired
 to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and
 described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents
 may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
