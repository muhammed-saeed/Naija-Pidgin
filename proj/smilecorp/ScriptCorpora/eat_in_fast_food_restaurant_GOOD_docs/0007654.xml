About the Restaurant :

Lascari’s has been serving homestyle italian fare to patrons from Los Angeles and Orange County for 41 years. Lascari’s opened their doors in Whittier in the year of 1970, offering a full service italian restaurant to many of the locals and those who travel to enjoy the food. Recently, they have embarked upon a new era of small cucina style locations all over Orange County. Lascari’s has been acquiring the closed locations of the late Pasta Bravo restaurants. Many of the Pasta Bravo locations were amongst the many failing eatery locations sprinkled across Orange County’s malls and shopping venues. Closed kitchens in locations such as Anaheim Hills, La Habra and Brea opened the opportunity for Lascari’s to expand. Most took place in the later quarter of 2010, just as did the opening of the location at the Block of Orange, at the intersection of Victoria’s Secret and the Block Party, a lane loaded with culinary taste.

These cucina style locations are a counter to table type of service, giving a fast food feel, with restaurant taste. Items such as pizza, pasta, salads and baked sandwiches give patrons of all types a tasty choice. The pasta can be whatever you like, from spaghetti to penne to bow tie. Baked items, such as lasagna and ziti offer a fantastic homestyle appeal without the robust guest check we associate them with. Just don’t forget to save room for a cannoli that will fill the sweet tooth in all of us.

About the Food:

First, the chicken pesto, with penne pasta, was very tasty. The sauce, which sometimes tends to be a little too oily, was perfect. The right combination of basil, garlic and olive oil blended perfectly with the pasta and chicken. The chicken was plentiful, for sure you will not feel gypped for there was actually enough chicken for every bite and then some.

The baked ziti was a fairly large portion, filling a full boat with meat, ricotta, penne pasta and marinara sauce. The sauce was a little under salted, however the whole plate blended well. On top of all else, the bread really added an extra flare to the dishes that cannot be left out. The sourdough rolls, served two per dish, were excellent. The tangy sourdough provides a perfect vessel to mop up all of the gooey cheese and rich marinara, not to mention a crispy crust that will leave diners asking for more.

On top of all that:

Each Lascari’s locations offer a full catering menu. Favorites can be ordered by the tray, foot or square footage for pizza, some items have minimums. Pasta bars are available on a per person charge and advanced notice is definitely suggested. Not a bad idea for those having big game parties this weekend. Get your order in today.
