 More: Fast Food Mythology Food Myths 
 Flag Close Throughout my life, I&apos;ve had a variety of different jobs. I am a foodie and you would think I would love working around food, even if it meant working in a fast food restaurant. Well, you&apos;d be wrong. I&apos;ve worked in three different fast food restaurants and never could get interested in my work. Anyone who&apos;s ever worked in fast food will tell you that it&apos;s one of the worst jobs they&apos;ve ever had. While I didn&apos;t enjoy working in fast food, I did learn several fast food myths. I warn you though; you may not want to eat fast food after reading some of these myths.
 Fast Food Myth #1: An &quot;A&quot; from the Department of Health Means the Food is Always Safe 

This fast food myth would seem to be true, but in my time working in fast food restaurants I learned that this myth was false. Some how, managers seem to know when the department of health is coming to inspect them. A week or so before their arrival, employees are taught new ways to do their job. I would like to say that employees were properly trained when they first began their job, but I&apos;d be lying. The fact is you don&apos;t know what employees have been doing. I&apos;m a germ-a-phob, so I was always clean, but that doesn&apos;t mean that other employees are.

 Fast Food Myth #2: Cooks Wear Hairnets and Gloves 

While many larger restaurants do instruct their employees to wear hairnets and gloves, this isn&apos;t the case in most fast food restaurants. The only truth behind this myth is that workers are required to wear hats, which does help to keep hair out of the food.

 Fast Food Myth #3: Your Food is Always Cooked for the Proper Amount of Time 

Sadly, this myth is false. Many fast food restaurants rush their food during lunch hour. People want their food and they want it right then. Most of the restaurants I worked for were good about cooking chicken for the proper amount of time, but not all of them were. Before gobbling down a large order of chicken fingers, be sure to break one open to make sure it&apos;s done.

 Fast Food Myth #4: You Can Only Get it Your Way at Burger King 

This myth is false. Every fast food place I&apos;ve worked for, or eaten at, has been more than willing to customize a customers order. If you want more mayonnaise, just tell them. If you don&apos;t like tomatoes, tell them to leave them off.

 Fast Food Myth #5: Salads are Made Fresh 

While salads are made on site, salads are not made when you order them. This fast food myth is only true if the restaurant runs out of salads. The rest of the time salads are made in the mornings and then stored in the refrigerator. Salads may even have been prepared a couple of days in advance. If you add chicken to your salad, this is one ingredient that is freshly prepared.

 Fast Food Myth #6: There is No Such Thing as Healthy Fast Food 

Many people believe this myth because when they get to a fast food restaurant they are overwhelmed by the smell of French fries and order something that isn&apos;t healthy. But this myth is false. Many fast food restaurants offer healthy choices.

 Fast Food Myth #7: Food is Always Prepared in Sanitary Conditions 

I hate telling people this, but this myth is false. Many times it&apos;s impossible to keep food as sanitary as people would like. First of all, when drive thru windows are open, bugs enter the restaurant. Second, cashiers often have to prepare part of your meal and they don&apos;t have time to wash their hands after accepting your money.

 Fast Food Myth #8: The Coffee and Tea is Always Fresh 

You may have noticed on your coffee cup that coffee and tea is always fresh at your favorite fast food restaurant. This myth is false. I even worked at a restaurant that wrote the time on their coffee pots, but instructed employees to change the time, rather than making a fresh pot. Also tea is only made when it runs out, so it may have set there all day before you ordered it.

 Fast Food Myth #9: There is No Advantage Working in Fast Food 

While this myth does seem true, there is one advantage to working in fast food. The hours are extremely flexible; this is why many college students work in these restaurants. Other than that, working in fast food is absolutely horrible.

 Fast Food Myth #10: You&apos;ll Always Get a Free Meal 

You would think that all restaurants would give their employees a free meal, while they were on duty, but they don&apos;t. While most restaurants do, there are some that make their employees pay for their food. I even worked at one restaurant that took a certain amount out of your check each week, whether you ate or not.
