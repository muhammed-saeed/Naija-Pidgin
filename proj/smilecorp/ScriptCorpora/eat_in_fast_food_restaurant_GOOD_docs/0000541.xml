 Logic Puzzle (Open Thread 90) 
 Posted by Jim Macdonald at 06:07 PM * 
Miss Teresa started an Open Thread. The first five folks who posted in it were (not necessarily in this order, abi, Bruce Cohen (SpeakerToManagers), chris y, debcha, and ethan. Remarkably (or maybe not so remarkably) all five of their posts were poems in a different poetic form. What order did they post in, and what kind of poem did each supply?
 Ethan posted before the person who wrote a haiku but after the person who wrote a villanelle. Debcha didn’t write the limerick. The person who posted a double dactyl posted first, but wasn’t Bruce. The sonnet, the haiku, and the limerick were posted in that order. Everyone applauded chris y’s villanelle. Abi commented later in the thread,“I wish I’d written the limerick; it’s so much better than my effort, and the haiku is better still.” The sonnet was written by someone whose name starts with the vowel. The haiku was a particularly witty response to the villanelle. Debcha had hoped to have the first post but instead came in fourth. Chris y posted after abi but before the person who posted the sonnet. Remarkably, no one parodied William Carlos Williams.

I don&apos;t care who wrote what or in which order; I want to read that thread.
 #11 ::: elissa ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 08:00 PM : 

aquaeri: Because although Debcha had hoped to post first, she didn&apos;t. She posted fourth. (See clue #9.)
 #12 ::: Kip W ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 08:06 PM : 

Thanks! Solved.

elissa: But she was writing it in response, and a first post isn&apos;t a response, and a response isn&apos;t a first post. How could she have intended a response to be the first post?

Not all the clues were necessary to solving, but they helped me see I&apos;d got it right, as they were in agreement with what I put down.
 #13 ::: Tim May ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 08:12 PM : 

I think aquaeri&apos;s point is that &quot;hoped to post first&quot; carries an implicature that she hoped to post that poem first, which isn&apos;t possible if it was a response to an earlier one. But you often have to restrict yourself to entailment in logic puzzles, and it&apos;s not a very strong implicature to begin with.
 #14 ::: NelC ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 09:07 PM : 

I read it that Debcha wanted to post first, just to be first, but by the time she read the thread someone else had posted first. So she read the thread, and composed a response. If she&apos;d gotten there early enough she would have composed a completely different post.
 #15 ::: Konrad ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 09:08 PM : 

Derek #5: Really? I didn&apos;t need 7, 9, nor 11, but I did find 8 and 10 to be useful. Did you assume 4 meant &quot;without gaps&quot;?
 #16 ::: Diatryma ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 09:22 PM : 

First post denied me!
Like Chris, I think fair trade for
dactylic Abi.

Because it&apos;s not enough to have poetry and pastiches all over the place, we must also have talking about poetry and pastiches, and now speculation about the content of an imaginary poem posted in response to another imaginary poem. Debcha, I am sure mine is not as good a response as the one the imaginary (or real) you would have produced, but it is something.

 #17 ::: Gigi Rose ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 09:24 PM : 

I had no clue how to do these puzzles until about 10 years ago when they used them at the Junior high where I taught. (I learned how to do them in self defense, I can&apos;t have students knowing more than I do.) Our test scores improved. I&apos;m not sure this was one of the reasons, but I suspect it had something to do with it.
 #18 ::: Jeff Davis ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 09:36 PM : 

Konrad #15: I&apos;m not Derek, but I definitely made that assumption. It doesn&apos;t appear to be wrong.

Gigi Rose #17: Is there a particular technique that one should use to solve these things besides putting the position of each element on paper? I&apos;m usually not good at logic puzzles; I&apos;d love to know if there&apos;s some method I should be applying.

Konrad @ 15:
#8 is definitely redundant, given #1.[*] I know that I made use of 7, 9, and 10, but there could be some redundancy elsewhere I didn&apos;t notice. (And, for what it&apos;s worth, I didn&apos;t assume that 4 meant &quot;without gaps.&quot;)

[*] Unless it was intended that &quot;particularly witty&quot; should be a clue... but that&apos;s not how these puzzles work.
 #21 ::: Diatryma ::: (view all by) ::: August 18, 2007, 09:50 PM : 

Jeff at 18, I was taught to draw a grid for simple ones-- name and poem only-- and then a more complex one for ones like this. It&apos;s three grids together in a corner-L shape. Across the top I have position and poem, running vertically I have name and poem, and I just fill in Xs and Os as I go through the clues. I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;d lay out a more complex one, like if we&apos;d had to handle the subject of the poem as well.

Lovely. Been a while since I&apos;ve had to grid one of those out.

I once got away with writing a poem instead of an essay— for a poetry class, natch. The trick is to know that the professor will be impressed instead of annoyed, especially as a poem on the definition of poetry, improvised, is not likely to be much good.

I wish I had that poem. It would be good for a laugh.

Diatryma @ 21, your system extends neatly. Just tack the new category to the end horizontally, and tuck it in the middle vertically. My attempt at an ascii illustration was woeful, but I&apos;m sure a nearby newsagent will sell Puzzle books with examples, which is where I learned it.

 #44 ::: Gursky ::: (view all by) ::: August 19, 2007, 01:56 AM : 

I agree that the latter 4 clues were unnecessary. My method of just drawing up a list and slotting the poems and authors in when I was sure of them worked well enough here, but would probably break down (into the grid, if further structure can be called a break down) as more items were added to the initial puzzle.
 #45 ::: Evan ::: (view all by) ::: August 19, 2007, 02:20 AM : 

(I apologize in advance if I guessed anyone&apos;s sex wrong.)

A Making Light poster named abi
Had a dactl that wasn&apos;t too shabby
Said she: &quot;This is no trouble!
Why, I&apos;ll make it a double!&quot;
Then posted it, quick as a tabby

Chris Y took a bit of a chance:
He composed in a form fancy-schmanced.
&quot;Of this ball, I&apos;ll be belle,
With my fine villanelle!&quot;
Said Chris Y, just before being pantsed.

Then ethan composed us a sonnet:
It was hard work, and he got right on it
Such extravaganzas
Of well-crafted stanzas!
We all wished that *we* could&apos;ve done it.

Now Debcha felt slightly morose:
&quot;I tried to be quick, not verbose,
For writing haikus
Takes a short-winded muse,
But still I&apos;m in fourth! Well, &apos;twas close.&quot;

And finally there was Bruce Cohen
Whose limericks are widely-known
For hilarious rhyme
And for scansion sublime--
Shitloads better, I&apos;d say, than my own.
 #46 ::: Gursky ::: (view all by) ::: August 19, 2007, 02:25 AM : 

Actually, I&apos;ve sort of been hoping for an open thread to mention two things, so I&apos;ll pretend we&apos;re just treating this as such. The words are used in the original post, after all. With no gaps, either.

First, I tried Mimolette for the first time this week. They have a bunch at Gourmet Garage right now. It was great, except persistent thought of tiny red hexapods scurrying across my gums.

Second, I&apos;ve been thinking of putting up a desert-themed display in the bookstore&apos;s F/SF section. Does anyone have any suggestions?
So far I may use:
Dune
Sandworms of Dune
Acacia
A Canticle for Leibowitz
The Temptation of Saint Anthony (gothic fantasy of the highest order)
Soldier of Sidon
That cyberpunk novel that Tor reprinted a year or two ago, set in a future Norther Africa, if I can ever find it on my shelf and order a few copies.

A standing rule seems to be that I&apos;m considering a desert to be a biome, the &quot;bio-&quot; root being the key point. Thus extraterrestrial deserts are no problem. Nor, clearly, are post-apocalyptic wastelands. All standard lunar deserts are. I&apos;ve also decided to exclude all martian settings, whether full of flora or not. There are just too many of them, and I want these deserts to feel hot. Given all that, if anyone has a good book or two that I should be sure to include, I &apos;d love the help.

Woo-hoo, a logic puzzle! I love these. I used to play on a site called chatgames.com that had them weekly, but they don&apos;t any more.

I got the same answers as everyone else, and I concur that clues 7-10 are unnecessary. (And no, I didn&apos;t assume that #4 meant &quot;in a row&quot;.)

 #51 ::: Tania ::: (view all by) ::: August 19, 2007, 03:37 AM : 

Dang it, I missed out on the fun. I love puzzles, and I did take the time to figure it out before I read comments.

Gursky - books that have deserts* as a primary residence that come to mind:

Chaz Brenchley&apos;s Outremer
Melanie Rawn&apos;s Dragon series
CJ Cherryh&apos;s Faded Sun novels (Serge, am I remembering this correctly? I haven&apos;t read the Faded Sun books in a looong time. I associate them with deserts)
Alan Dean Foster&apos;s Pip&amp;Flinx book Reunion 

I&apos;ve got a few others ideas rolling around in the back of my brain, but I am going to bed. I&apos;ll see if the unconscious/subconscious/not-tired brain floats the other titles to the surface.


*I initially read desserts and was wondering how Dune related to tasty snacks. Sandworm Surprise? Bene Gessarit Biscotti? Arrakis Cobbler? Then I came to my senses.

Lizzy L said @ 30:
 Got it. I hate logic puzzles, but this one was too much fun to pass up. 

That&apos;s kind of my feeling about them. I find it easier to solve logic puzzles if they deal with something intrinsically interesting[*]. In one sense, that goes against the point of logic puzzles -- ideally, one should reduce them to a set of purely abstract entities and relations -- but there are only so many times you can contemplate re-arranging entities A, B, C, D, E.

[*] I remember two logic puzzles in particular from when I took the GRE&apos;s: one dealt with arranging different kinds of power tools along a bench, the other with arranging different kinds of books along a bookshelf. The former was tedious; the latter was easy, since it was something I could imagine doing for fun....

Walter Carlos Williams was the poet&apos;s evil twin;
He wasn&apos;t a physician and he didn&apos;t just stay in.
No, Walter, he took passage on a ship bound for Belize,
And asked how he would live his life, he answered &quot;As I please.&quot;

He thrilled to eating hardtack and the sound of native drums
And he didn&apos;t have an icebox and he didn&apos;t care for plums.
He never saw a barrow, whether black or white or red,
And he never saw New Jersey, and before long he was dead.

His life was all ideas, and it wasn&apos;t much in things:
But William stayed at home. I wonder why the caged bird sings?

There were a few more in the series, including one where the lead is dumped in the Rub&apos; al-Khali (the Arabian peninsula&apos;s Empty Quarter), which is about as desert as it gets. IIRC, Liz Williams&apos;s City of Bones qualifies if you&apos;re allowing cities surrounded by desert and I haven&apos;t confused it with another of hers.
Also: Dry Water (Eric Nylund) and Child of a Rainless Year (Jane Lindskjold) -- the desert is perhaps not the main theme, but is a dominating presence in the towns where the stories happen. Nylund may be OOP (~9 years old), but the Lindskjold is recent and IMO her best yet. (Her two Athanor books are set in Santa Fe et al but IIRC aren&apos;t strongly desert-connected.)
Tania is correct about The Faded Sun , but I have no idea where you&apos;d find it; Hammerfall is relatively recent, and the jacket says it&apos;s set on a desert world, but I haven&apos;t read it yet.

Looking for people knowledgeable about the ins&amp;outs of mp3/ID3 headers.

I&apos;m testing a new toy which is supposed to help me archive my EXTENSIVE cassette-tape collection to CD and MP3 formats. The problem I&apos;m having is that Nero (which I&apos;m using to create the CDs) doesn&apos;t play nicely with the .wav tracks I&apos;ve created, and iTunes doesn&apos;t play nicely with the .mp3 extractions of them. In the latter case, tracks play in what appears to be a completely random order, even though the list appears in the order I want them to play.

I suspect that I need to follow a specific format when I name the tracks, but I can&apos;t find anything with Google that will tell me exactly what that format is.

When I say I don&apos;t regret not going because of the noise, that means that apart from noise I greatly regret the low probability that I will ever go.

Not criticism. Just sour grapes, Aesop style.

As I understand it, you&apos;re
1. somehow making WAV files from casettes
2. burning those as audio CDs, which play as you want
3. creating MP3s from ??? using ???
4. importing those MP3s into iTunes, which plays them out of order

Is that right? If so, can you fill in the question marks in step 3?

What you&apos;re reallying trying to set (assuming you&apos;re using ID3 v2.3 which is a reasonable assumption in the absence of good reason otherwise) is the TRCK tag (and, if it&apos;s a multi-tape/CD album, TPOS). The naming will only be important if whatever software you&apos;re using for setting the tags uses that to fill in the tags.

 This is what it looks like from above now. Remember, not one of those buildings existed then, and the roads. what there were then, were just somewhat graded dirt. I sure hope they figured out what to do with that one 400 ft. wide arroyo that flooded every afternoon in summer when the rains came.

3. Hands them a copy of the Bill of Rights (laminated wallet type) and zips away.

1 and 3 I can take care of.

In the last post I made about software development in the Bad Sources thread, I promised I&apos;d take the discussion to the open thread, and this seems to be it now.

My take on software is highly personal, first because I&apos;m not originally a student of computer science or software*, and second because for some years my job was to evaluate software technology and transfer it into the corporate software process at Tektronix. Because of where I&apos;ve worked and who I&apos;ve worked with, I&apos;ve gotten to know many people who&apos;ve been involved in writing about, consulting in, and selling software development techniques and methodologies. So some of my opinions are based on my opinions of the people involved as well as of the technologies they&apos;re involved with. I know that&apos;s not very scientific, but then the subject matter isn&apos;t very scientific either. Very little of the writing on the subject of software development is based on careful experimental design and analysis, and for all the talk of metrics, very little good data is available on how software is developed in real projects.

The other major reason why there&apos;s no science of software development is that any software project has to be involved, to a greater or lesser degree, with organizational politics. So there are often reasons why accurate measurement of the effectiveness of the processes in use is not desired, and even more often reasons why the actual progress is not reported or perhaps even known.

I look at the spectrum of development methodologies as running from the extreme of central control, highly structured project organization and planning embodied in the waterfall method to the other extreme of local decision-making, unstructured communication, and short-term planning of XP and agile programming. While it&apos;s true that the spectrum is usually considered to also run over the range of organization size and project complexity, where waterfall is suited primarily for large, complex projects, and XP for small, short-term projects, I believe that this is very much an over-simplification.

There is one principle that seems to hold true across the spectrum of development projects: the organization and architecture of software is determined by the structure of the organization which develops it. I wish I knew who first came up with this idea, I don&apos;t, but I certainly can&apos;t claim it for myself.

One thing that interested me about the agile/extreme programming movement was the idea of embedding technical writers in the programming team in a larger than normal ratio of tech writers to programmers, with the goal of matching emergent working software with equally emergent complete documentation.

I feel the same way about Copland; overexposure makes me change the radio channel anytime Rodeo or Appalachian Spring makes an appearance. I&apos;m not sure how many years those would have to go away before I could tolerate them again.

 Pachelbel can just go away.

I agree, R. gallica was the first thing that came to my mind as well, until I looked again at &quot;blood&quot; red; it&apos;s usually described as &quot;light&quot; red, I think. I am nearly sure there are no strong reds among the Damasks, though.

What I did think of later was the modern Gallica hybrids such as &apos;Poinsettia&apos; and &apos;James Mason.&apos;

re myself @87,

The &quot;Flamer Bingo&quot; thread is a near-canonical list of troll and flamer sign.

Has anyone here seen something similar for questioning patriotism? i.e. What do patriot-trolls say?

The bingo thread itself has a couple (&quot;The president is doing God&apos;s work..&quot;). I&apos;ve seen short lists at Glen Greenwald and a few other places (in response to claims that Republicans have never questioned Democrat&apos;s patriotism, for example). But I haven&apos;t seen a longer list / don&apos;t know who might have one.

The book on my shelf I was trying to remember, that I later found when callous morning came calling to wake my girlfriend and let me turn on the lights in our studio apartment, was indeed Effinger. Specifically, his A Fire in the Sun , which I rather liked.
I&apos;ve put some of your suggestions on order at the bookstore. Usually my displays don&apos;t actually sell any books*, but I have fun choosing them regardless.

*Last month&apos;s for instance. Apparently anyone who cared about the Heinlein centennial already owns his books. Silly me, I thought Farnham&apos;s Freehold would fly off the shelf with sheer kitsch power alone.

I somehow thought &quot;can you grok it?&quot; was sheer placard gold, too, until I slowly realized that no, no of course they could not grok it. I was, in fact, trying to sell them the book that would allow them to grok it. Like advertising a Mandarin for Beginners course in Mandarin .

I used to not own &apos;patriotic gear.&apos;

As said, every last piece was made in China*, thong shoes to headscarf. If I try a hyperpatriot act**, I&apos;ll have leave the tags on for the irony.

* to be fair, the flag they sold was made in the US. But it wasn&apos;t on sale, and I didn&apos;t buy one.

Because just about every generaton of my men-folk have been in some branch of service as far as I know (I&apos;m&apos; certain about mine and earlier generations, I expect that male pretty-much-unknown-cause they&apos;re on my fahter&apos;s side have signed up for more current warfare, I think the whole yellow ribbon thing is stupid.

Someone whose blog I read regularly who was in the service got berated at a gas station for not having the magnetic stickers on their car. The woman who berated him got really defensive when he pointed out that the stickers don&apos;t send money to the troops and that he had been collecting and sending along goods to actually help the troops in the field (http://skippyslist.com/2007/08/21/warning-signs/)

I got talked out of joining the army by my dad (Air Force Major, at the time reservist) and my brother (Army Captain, active) in my early college years. After I got a little older and more experienced I realized they regarded the woman&apos;s service as little more than a lesbian recruiting system and they were scared of that for me (silly men!).

Abi: It happens. My &quot;little&quot; sister (the middle one, who is now... lessee 40-18=22, and has three kids) was going back to her chair (at the age of 1 1/2, or so, and tripped, right onto the hard wooden arm, at the cubical corner.

Took three stitches. Sooner or later they all break themselves. Some are more serious than others and there&apos;s nothing you did to make it happen.

Enough of the Polonial advice (having been in my late-teens/early twenties for the birth of two kids, while I was still living with my folks, and having spent time as an au pair I am probably as ready as any non-parent can be to deal with them).

You could also say &quot;Melville&quot; but he hated the &quot;Enchanted Isles&quot;, so perhaps it&apos;s not the best of ejaculations when one thinks of them.

It is cool, and something of a surprise that we&apos;re going. It was added to a different trip (on which I am not going), and I wanted in on that (I was pickling with envy, until I got the gumption to say I wanted to go).

Frigate birds and tortises, sea-going iguanas and finches.

Blue-footed boobies.

Five days on a boat, and a couple of day trips (the timing of one-week boat trips doesn&apos;t work right). Maia is skipping two-weeks of school to make her trips, and I&apos;m trusting the plants to others (again) so I can go.

It&apos;s tight, for money, but there are rumors the islands will be closed, and when else were we going to be in the area?

I managed to knock my little sister down hard enough to make her go in for stitches on her chin* when she was four or five. Both of us were out at the park with our very large dog and he ran past her on one side while I ran past on the other, and without meaning it at all we clotheslined her neatly with the leash right onto her face on the pavement.

I&apos;m really not sure what my parents were thinking, in letting an eight-year-old run around with a very large and only moderately trained dog on a leash. Probably that the dog could use some exercise, and it would do me some good to get out of the house and go to the park with my little sister for a while.

i have a pdf that i made in illustrator. it has three layers: a drawn image, some shadows, and more drawn images (handlettered text in speech balloons&amp;captions). i need to put these pdfs together in acrobat to make one big pdf (comic pages in sequence).

acrobat just now started , sorry for the shouting, but inverting the top layer only, so all the speech balloons are black where they should be white, etc.

i open&amp;open&amp;open the files in illustrator&amp;they&apos;re right, i open&amp;open&amp;open the files in acrobat&amp;they&apos;re wrong. i printed out one page to see if it&apos;s just showing up wrong on the screen,&amp;the printout&apos;s wrong, too.

i may have given acrobat ideas because i did have cause to invert some of the text-images, to white on a black background. but that was in photoshop, before it got to illustrator to get to acrobat,&amp;also all the text-images were inverted, not just the ones that may have been inverted already.

am i making sense? does anyone have an idea what&apos;s happening?

Sorry this is so long after your post; my access to ML is limited to non-work hours these days, and the house remodeling is stealing a lot of the time that remains, so I have to skim, and sometimes miss things.

I haven&apos;t read Dreaming in Code, but I think I&apos;m going to now that you&apos;ve mentioned it. I&apos;ll get back to you when I can.

This comment isn&apos;t just an apology and a promise, though, because the title, Dreaming in Code, reminded me of some of the more, erm, fringe-oriented movements in software that I&apos;ve tripped over in the last few years.

Aside from the stuff that since has become orthodox, like the open-source movement that&apos;s coalesced around Eric Raymond&apos;s book The Cathedral and the Bazaar , there are some less well-known and still avant-garde ideas floating around in the infosphere. One of them is the &quot;Futurist Programming Movement&quot; , which is not as political as it&apos;s early 20th century namesake. I don&apos;t know a lot about the specifics of the movement, but I know of Paul Haeberli&apos;s work, and I&apos;m moderately impressed with some of his ideas. Another is Richard Gabriel&apos;s Feyerabend Project . Richard is trying, among other things, to find an objective way to prescribe the mathematical quality of elegance, since elegant software is much more likely to both work well and be easier to maintain. Richard and I meet at conferences every once in awhile, and I attended one of his workshops on the subject. I think he&apos;s got something there, but I don&apos;t know what yet. He thinks there should be some way to make aesthetic qualities objectively useful; my experience of photography agrees with him*.

Hmm, it&apos;s getting late and this is starting to get long. I&apos;ll see if I can go into this subject more thoroughly in the next few days on my own blog. Thanks for the forum.

abi,

I&apos;ll join the chorus: accidents happen to kids, and there&apos;s not much you can do about it. Just try to get over those moments of terror, and go back to appreciating your child.

For about 8 or 10 years there our younger son Jeremy was really accident prone. To the point where we started to get funny looks from the emergency room doctors, clearly having dark thoughts about child abuse. The climax to that came one day when Jeremy was about 6 or 7 and he and I were rough-housing (not very roughly) and he grabbed my hand as he fell over and dislocated his elbow. We took him into the hospital immediately, and when the doctor started examining the arm, Jeremy started screaming in pain; the the doctor reset the arm and Jeremy suddenly stopped yelling, as if in great surprise, because it didn&apos;t hurt any more. The resident who examined him was rather suspicious of all this, so he talked to the attending physician, who took a look at the records, took one look at Jeremy, and said to us &quot;Oh, he&apos;s accident prone, isn&apos;t he?&quot; That, of course, didn&apos;t much relieve the sense of guilt I had for the next few days, but at least it removed an additional burden I might otherwise have had to deal with.

The thing about being a parent is that you just don&apos;t have time to feel bad about things until after it&apos;s all over; before that you&apos;re going to be too busy dealing with the situation. And afterwards you need to make sure that the kid doesn&apos;t get a bad feeling about it all from you. It sounds like your daughter isn&apos;t likely to do that; good work.

Yep, the fibula isn&apos;t a weight supporting bone. I know, I&apos;m missing 20cm of the one on my left. I had an open Tib/Oblique Fib fracture (I did something stupid for a Bostonian, I crossed Mass Ave. -- in a cross walk , what was I thinking? So rod in Tibia, bolted both ends. Fib heals first, and ends up a bit longer than proper. They had to take a section of the Fib out so that there&apos;d be enough pressure on the pieces of Tib for it to heal (they also took out the distal bolts which may have been part, or all, of the problem). Once the bones fragments got real close, the osteoblasts got busy). Original prediction: 6 weeks on crutches, actual 12 1/2 months (6 extra weeks due to my insisting that the rod come out). The gap in the bone is annoying when I wear boots, especially ski boots, otherwise no problem. The related soft tissue injuries in knee and ankle still bother me (14 years later).

Bruce Cohen (SpeakerToManagers) #203:
The standard instruction for applying traction to a broken femur is to increase tension until the patient&apos;s face relaxes (the ends of the bone aren&apos;t pressing painfully on anything anymore, etc).

I was noodling around with the latest version of Google Earth the other day* when I found a placemarker someone left a couple of years ago on the site of the base I spent a year at in Vietnam back in the Second Age. Weird; it used to be a small compound, about the size of two football fields, surrounded by rice paddies; the nearest hamlet was about half a klick down the road. Now the satellite photo barely shows where the perimeter fence was. It looks like parts of the battalion office and the comm center are still there, and the barracks buildings; because they were built on concrete pads they would have been worth keeping. But the entire area is buildings now, no trace of rice paddy. Not sure what I&apos;m feeling right now; it&apos;s not exactly nostalgia, and it&apos;s not exactly remembered fear.

I seem to recall the most common scar is just under the chin. I have a variation of it, a small angled scar on my lower lip.

I got it falling down and catching my face on the wing nut which held the leg of the table I knocked over on the way down.

I still recall (vaguely, I was 3-4) the trips to the dentist to have the tooth rebuilt. It probably shaped my tastes, because the nature of the cap prevented me from certain types of sweets (lest it be pulled off).

 Bruce Cohen (STM) Being a (lapsed) cellist, who cut almost the entire tip off his, bow-hand, pinky, [I was whittling, the kife was sharp. I set it down on the arm of the chair, it fell. I was removing my had from the area when the edge brushed my pinky. It didn&apos;t, quite, remove the whole tip. I stuck it in my mouth, and called my sister; that she might butterfly it. I have an interesting, if faint, scar] I think it might be that we do so much with our hands.

Further lots of that is delicate; with things in our hands, so we assume we have the same level of desterity with other things. Sometimes that&apos;s not the case.

The chin scar is really common. Baby Sister (who leaves for college today) fell while running at the pool. I think my brother has one, but the one on his forehead is more apparent-- two rounds of stitches because he tore it open pretty soon after getting it fixed the first time. Mom blamed me for some reason; I am still a bit resentful. He also has a dip in his tongue from where he bit it about halfway through, ridgey fingernails from scarlet fever, and some nice dog-bite marks on his arm. We could see the layers of tissue when he came in.
My own scars aren&apos;t as good. I have a thing people think is a mole which began as a cat-scratch-thing, dog bite on nose, dog bite on hand, dog bite on arm (that one had incisor marks for a few months), cat scratches on wrist, piranha bite on finger (my stupidity), barnacle scrapes on legs....

That makes a strange sort of sense. I have some dancer friends who are amazingly graceful on the dance floor and yet somehow guaranteed to walk into every desk corner in a 50-mile radius.

Bruce 226: Ming the Merciless has been turned into Ming the Merely Grumpy. 

It&apos;s the Banality of Evil. This Ming isn&apos;t as gaudily deranged (thanks PNH) as the older version—instead he&apos;s the kind of evil we see in our world every day: the corporation that takes political power and enforces a monopoly with draconian laws. He&apos;s more...well, OK, less un realistic than the previous one.

 ibid. , 227: Same principle. The evil in our world is drab and conservative. FG is showing our world exaggerated, not some other world, and it&apos;s no longer a total comic book. (Reference is only to four-color printing, pace you comics fans.)

Bruce 229: ack! Is that construction correct? 

Yes, it is, assuming you&apos;re talking about the verb form prior to the asterisk, and not the incorrect French contraction following it...the &apos;e&apos; in &apos;de&apos; can only be elided when the following word begins with a vowel. Nom de Net, please, though actually (ref. Earl 230) I like &apos;electronym&apos; better.

TexAnne 234: Dancing is just fancy walking 

West African proverb: &quot;If you can walk, you can dance; if you can talk, you can sing.&quot; The latter is possibly aided by the fact that many West African languages are tone languages (Yoruba, Hausa, and Twi just to name a few), which means you actually need some pitch sense to speak them correctly, but the former applies everywhere.

#210/213: Seeing a formerly-remote area overrun by &quot;civilization&quot; isn&apos;t uncommon, given the way most cities in the U.S. sprawl. Googlemap 10835 South Glen Road, 20854; my parents built the multi-gabled house in 1951, and I can clearly remember that the 1/2 x 3/4 - mile lot across the road had cows on it. (Don&apos;t look too closely at that space now -- several people committed architecture there.) The more-compact house next door is a fake-Georgian put where it could make best use of the lot after it was subdivided, which our house hadn&apos;t been placed to make easy; they&apos;ve also erased substantial berry and vegetable gardens and an orchard.
   Or look around 7101 Democracy Blvd 20817, noticing the winding stubs of Bells Mill Rd that were left after a 6-lane &quot;boulevard&quot; was rammed straight through the area to connect one of the US&apos;s first malls with the interstate. To the west, the area between Seven Locks Rd and what they now call Democracy Ln was a huge summer camp (almost all the way up to where Inverness Ridge Rd is now, and mostly woods); it was all townhice by ~1989. The pond is the only remaining trace, and they&apos;ve probably kept it only because the nearby spring keeps that spot too wet to build in easily; even the multipurpose building (a community theater in 1989) is gone if I&apos;m reading the pictures correctly. (Can&apos;t be certain as it was just over the edge of the we-can&apos;t-zoom-here zone on top of Seven Locks Rd.)

The U.S also has its strangely-abandoned areas, even close to cities. Try 7280 Macarthur Blvd 20818; the white-roofed buildings are still walled with sandstone cobbles from when this was a Chautauqua in the 1890&apos;s, but it was a thriving amusement park when I moved away in 1967. (It had been a trolley park, but an asset-stripper destroyed the trolley network a few years before that.) It looks like more of the park traces are gone now; when I visited in 1995 I noticed all of the concrete underlay of the minigolf course (the carpet was long-rotted) and 3 ~30-foot sycamores where the roller-coaster loading area had been. (I was there in December; the broken-down leftover bits (some since cleaned up) made it look like a set for Batman: The Killing Joke .) I haven&apos;t even been in working amusement park since 1992; omnia mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis .
   Worse is 430 Commonwealth Rd 01778; the flat area left of the driveway end used to be the lab where I had my first professional job -- Dow pulled out and I suspect the town decided to cap the land just to be sure. So omnia mutantur, nihil interit is literally untrue. (Thanks to Fritz Leiber for the omnias -- The Big Time has a million of &apos;em.)

And there&apos;s the 1&quot; round on one knee due to trying to race a bicycle around a tight corner \and/ not cleaning the mess up afterward.

I really like the guy who&apos;s playing Flash, I&apos;m just not nuts about the direction the producers? writers? Powers that Be? decided to take. It feels Stargate-y to me - maybe Stargate with a side of X-files - and as mentioned above, just not gonzo enough. Sometimes I like subtle in my sci-fi; just not with Flash.

I&apos;m pretty bummed about the Dresden cancellation, but not surprised. I caught a couple of episodes, enjoyed them and then figured I should immediately stop watching before I got involved, since it was sure to be cancelled. (also, I knew I needed to stop before I developed a crush on a character who was technically just a skull. Damn that Terrence Mann and his righteous speaking voice.)

About dexterity and music - I&apos;m a passable cellist, and have made a few bucks here and there. I don&apos;t think my missing bit of fingertip, or the broken left hand (done in a fall onto icy concrete) would have made the difference between being a hobbyist and a professional. Not like, say, a great deal more talent might have. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m more accident prone with my hand and fingers, but I&apos;m constantly tripping and spraining things, bumping into stuff and generally being a klutz. I&apos;m terrible at sports and hopeless at dancing, so I generally assume that&apos;s related to my awkwardness.

nerdycellist,

I mentioned that our younger son was accident-prone? He was a real klutz through much of his childhood, and we found out why at about the age of 8 when he as diagnosed as having in general rather loose ligaments in his hands, arms, and legs. This made him clumsy and uncoordinated. The treatment was to have him take keyboard lessons*, and get on a soccer team for a year.** The point being that sometimes there are physical reasons, not just general dorkiness, that cause clumsiness.


* He ended up with the organ rather than the piano, because of all the cool things you can make an electronic organ do.

** A social nightmare for us hippie parents who had rejected the whole suburban middle-class lifestyle.

Neat, I love pipe organs. Did I mention that I work for one of the very few companies left in the world that does nothing but build church and theatre organs? These days it&apos;s a subsidiary of a Japanese company that makes electronic instruments for rock musicians. We don&apos;t make pipe organs per se any more, all our organs are basically Linux computers with organ keyboards, tab and piston bars, and pedals. But for the traditionalists, we make a gadget that plugs into the organ to control a set of pipes.

I don&apos;t play the organ myself, but it&apos;s nice sometimes to be working away on the organ software and have someone fire up a console to test it by playing Bach.

Mom plays the piano and organ for church, and when there was a church-wide mandate to give all the buildings the same organ, she got dibs on the old one. It&apos;s just a console (? - not a pipe organ anyway) and it&apos;s now ensconced happily in the dining room (which has never been used as such) in their 1100 sqft ranch. A few years back she bought some fancy-ass digital piano that had a reasonable organ setting with a good touch so she could practice the hymns at home any time of the day or night with the headphones plugged in so as not to disturb my dad. Now even with only one speaker hooked up to the organ (two was just too much space for their house) she could probably be heard halfway down the block.

Until my brother picked it up, she had here original upright piano as well as the digital piano and organ in the house. I told her all she needed was a harpsichord and a virginal and she could have a whole set.

I very nearly deleted the email with the subject like &quot;11th Hour&quot; from the sender &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio&quot; expecting that it was SPAM.

If your people want email to NOT get thrown into the electronic garbage can, please get a few clues about using COMMON SENSE for emailing (and please get RID of the SPYING that tries to stick PEEPHOLES on people&apos;s computers when visiting Sen Kerry&apos;s website! Talk about SPYING on people, do you REALLY need to put tags on visitor;s computers that stay until 2037?! How would you like it if you walked into a store and someone injected an RF ID tag into your butt the instant you walked in the door to TRACK you? That is in effect what a &quot;cookie&quot; does.. somehow I do NOT think that Samuel Adams, John Hancock, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc., would approve or consider it anything but offensive and indecent and uncivil!):

1. Spammers and malicious emails often claim to be from celebrities... there are such noxiousnesses as &quot;Britney Spear goes bra-less&quot; on the &quot;From&quot; line... so anytime I get email purporting to be from a celebrity when I have not subscribed to any mailing list from that celebrity, I suspect it&apos;s spam...

2. The title &quot;11th Hour&quot; is the sort of thing that a spammer or malicous email generator would use for a subject line.

3. There is NOTHING in either the FROM line or the subject line to indicate that this apparent piece of SPAM or malicious email actually is from johnkerry.com for people who are subscribed to the johnkerry.com mailing list.

4. If it looks like spam or a malicious message, MOST people are going to delete it sight unseen and unread, assuming that it gets through their anti-spam filters in the first place.

5. Therefore, this message is NOT effective... and whoever presumable got PAID to generate it, is an incompent who should never have been hired to woek on any email campaign in the first place, the person does NOT have CLUE about email and NETIQUETTE. You would be FAR better off to contact e.g. Daniel Dern and Bobbie Fox, two constituents of Sen Kerry, Daniel is a long time computer trade journalist and author of articles and books about the Internet, Bobbi does website design and such, instead of whatever highly overpaid and overrated incompetents came up with the incredibly STUPID idea of using Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s name on the FROM line and &quot;11th Hour&quot; as the subject line for any email you expected anyone to actually LOOK at, instead of identifying the email as being from johnkerry.com and a title that would make it clear that the email is neither spam NOT malicious!

If possible, make it &quot;transparent.&quot; That is, if it&apos;s ordinary to the characters, then try to avoid doing -technical- descriptions unless the viewpoint character deals with the tech guts and likes talking about it... instead, describe the effects. The classic was something like Heinlein writing that a door dilated. The more one tried to do detailed technical description of somethinng that doesn&apos;t exist and one doesn&apos;t have a technical clue about, the worse the results tend to be as far as contributing to the willing suspension of disbelief instead of exploding it....


 Note that this is not the same thing as asking if we will live in a future with technology that seems magical to us, we surely will, but from a story told now should with technology that would be magical to us now for the sake of suspension of disbelief should the time be far enough from now to get rid of the question of how people now would feel about this magical technology? 

Concentrate on the story . Conventions in SF include &quot;assume that supraluminal travel exists.&quot; Note that e.g. C. J. Cherry doesn&apos;t go into detail about jump engines generally, only that they exist, and focuses on some of the effects of it on people and hani. Schmitz in The Witches of Karres described the Sheewash Drive as &quot;something you have to do yourself&quot; I think it was, said by one of the three girls, and Captain Pausert got a brief glimpse of something metal they were using.

One makes nonexistent technology in fiction or fact [government contract proposals....] by describing the effects and what can be done with it....

Holy Crap:

 Government Training Clergy to &quot;quell dissent.&quot; 

&apos;A KSLA-TV news report from Louisiana has confirmed the story that Clergy Response Teams are being trained by the federal government to &quot;quell dissent&quot; and pacify citizens to obey the government in the event of a declaration of martial law.

The report confirms the existence of a nationwide Homeland Security program which is training pastors and other religious representatives to teach their congregations to &quot;obey the government&quot; in preparation for a declaration of martial law.

A whistleblower who attended one of the training sessions reports that the feds were recruiting religious leaders to help implement government Homeland Security directives in anticipation of a terrorist attack or a nationally declared emergency.&apos;

The first directive was for pastors to preach to their congregations Romans 13, the often taken out of context bible passage that was used by Hitler to hoodwink Christians into supporting him, in order to teach them to &quot;obey the government&quot; when martial law is declared.

It was stressed that the pastors needed to preach subservience to the authorities ahead of time in preparation for the round-ups and to make it clear to the congregation that &quot;this is for their own good.&quot;

nerdycellist @ 255: How sad that this instrument never became standard in the recording studio. I&apos;m thinking specifically of tv shows that have been cheaply scored; the great swells of fake strings during dramatic moments are really jarring. 

I think of that sort of thing as &quot;the Mighty Wurlitzer meets the Uncanny Valley.&quot;

While the keyboard-centric MIDI protocol has held back controller design to some extent, there are electronic instruments out there capable of expressive performance. I just bought a wind controller (new toy, oh-way-oh), and for a mere gazillion dollars you can snag a Haken Continuum and get your finger vibrato on.

Xopher @ 271: Coolest instrument EVAH. 

They didn&apos;t even show one of my favorite things: the bizarre collection of custom speaker cabinets incorporating springs and gongs for additional timbral wackiness.

That said, they also didn&apos;t mention that they&apos;re fragile enough that you have to travel with two. In fact, I remember hearing that there was a Martenot breakdown during the SFS&apos;s Turangalîla (not on the night I was there, though). I highly recommend seeing that if your local orchestra ever puts it on; it&apos;s a ravishing piece (Boulez called it &quot;whorehouse music,&quot; so you know it&apos;s got to be good), and it&apos;s much easier to hear the cool stuff the Martenot is doing live than on record. And in our case the Martenot player gave a great pre-concert demo.

 finally found a place that sells a kind of modern knock-off, but you really have to dig to find the price, and it&apos;s not clear they&apos;ll actually sell you one. 

I assume you mean this . I don&apos;t know anything about that unit, but the company is real and sells stuff.

Last night my husband and I watched an interesting duo on cable TV (only missing 15 minutes of the second one when we switched stations after the first): 21,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Independence Day . Despite the obligatory Mad Scientist organ solo in League , James Mason/Nemo came across as a justly cynical former idealist and ultimate tragic martyr for the cause of peace, with Kirk Douglas as the irritating American yahoo (despite his interesting &quot;odd couple&quot; scenes with Peter Lorre, which should play well in the Castro). As for Independence Day , a mere 11 years old, a lot of it seems unintentionally poignant -- shots of the twin towers (before the squid aliens demolish NYC) and a faith in good old American know-how and massive bombing attacks to save the day (once the hunk hacker has done his job). The president there may look like San Francisco&apos;s current mayor, but I wonder if his exploits sent GWB into a wet dream that ended up with that flight deck &quot;Mission Accomplished!&quot; nonsense.

I was an infant when 20,000 Leagues first came out, so it took several viewings for me to realize how close Hiroshima was in memory back when it was made -- less than a decade. And despite the pet seal and Kirk&apos;s singing, it doesn&apos;t seem much like a typical Disney film.

 Bruce Cohen (SpeakerToManagers) writes: &quot;Also there&apos;s a certain irony in you, who do not* capitalize your nom d&apos;net, grousing about others&apos; quirks of capitalization.&quot; 

It&apos;s an alias derived by abbreviating of my full legal name, and I&apos;m pretty sure there isn&apos;t a useful distinction between the capitalized version and the all lower-case version. If there were, I&apos;d be really annoyed about it.

There is (or at least, there has been ) a useful distinction between the capitalized and non-capitalized version of Internet , i.e. between the Internet and the various other internets which are not the Internet.

I maintain that Wired, by making this change, is smudging that distinction. I&apos;d offer a wild paranoid conspiracy theory to explain why Wired might do this, but it&apos;s so dumb that even I can&apos;t relate it with a straight face. I think Wired has just decided that what the capitalization has traditionally signaled isn&apos;t comprehensible to their audience, much less all that important, and they&apos;ve tossed it, probably without thinking much about the consequences. That doesn&apos;t mean there won&apos;t be consequences if this construction takes hold.

For what it&apos;s worth, I saw this change coming a few years ago and started referring to the Internet as &quot;the public Internet&quot; in my technical correspondence. It tends to make the messages wordier than I would like, and it hasn&apos;t caught on yet, but it does eliminate the ambiguity. Perhaps, it will catch on if I stop capitalizing the &apos;I&apos; like those sooperhipsters at Wired have chosen to do.

Xopher #321, I&apos;m not j h, but I&apos;ll take a shot at it anyway.

Back in the olden days (after the days of yore, but before yesteryear), before TCP/IP was ubiquitous, there were lots of different networking protocols. They differed in all sorts of ways, from the lowest physical levels (how many volts are on the wires) up to the highest levels (what word processor file format do you use?), and somewhat bizarrely to our current minds all those things were generally assumed to go together.

That is, you&apos;d run a Banyan Vines network over Token Ring with Type 1 Connectors, using the Vines addressing system. Or you&apos;d run a Network Novell network over Ethernet with 10-base-2 in a ring configuration. Or you&apos;d run AppleTalk over twisted pair with a star/hub configuration. If you changed any of those things, you&apos;d be expected to change all of them, and you&apos;d have an entirely different network.

Any attempt to get two or more of these networks talking to one another was an internetworking project. The end result, if it was at all successful, was an internetwork, or just an internet.

 Xopher @ 321 asks: &quot;I don&apos;t know of any other internets. Could you elucidate? The private ones are usually called VPNs or intranets. Or are you being sarky and I&apos;m missing the joke?&quot; 

I&apos;m not being snarky, and it&apos;s not a joke. Todd Larason @ 323 explains the more archaic usage of &quot;internets&quot; in the plural form as a way of distinguishing IP-based internets from others, e.g. Appletalk, ISO, et cetera. I was thinking of a different distinction— admittedly a pretty technical one— that&apos;s relevant to people like me in the Internet engineering community, i.e. the distinction between the public Internet including the default-free zone and the transit networks operating as common carriers, and the various private internets that you often see referred to as &quot;intranets&quot; or &quot;B2B networks&quot; or what-have-you. It&apos;s important to us because we like to think we&apos;re documenting standards for the operation of the public Internet as opposed to the various internets that aren&apos;t public.

This more modern usage is basically the result of carrying forward the definition you find in RFC 1392 (written in January 1993 and quite dated now): 
 internet: While an internet is a network, the term &quot;internet&quot; is usually used to refer to a collection of networks interconnected with routers. See also: network. 
 Internet: (note the capital &quot;I&quot;) The Internet is the largest internet in the
 world. Is a three level hierarchy composed of backbone networks
 (e.g., NSFNET, MILNET), mid-level networks, and stub networks.
 The Internet is a multiprotocol internet. See also: backbone,
 mid-level network, stub network, transit network, Internet
 Protocol, Corporation for Research and Educational Networks,
 National Science Foundation. What the Internet was in 1993 is still more or less what it is today: a multiprotocol internet (it&apos;s both IPv4 and IPv6 now). It&apos;s just much larger and the pieces are owned and operated by a more diverse collection of players. You can still see this convention in use by reading more recent IETF documents. Culturally, we still cling to this distinction.
One of the interesting and arcane bits of controversy in the IETF these days sorta revolves around whether the idea of a &quot;public&quot; Internet makes any sense now. Some folks think it&apos;s time to recognize that the thing is all privately owned and operated from the top all the way down. Even the DNS root and the BGP default-free zone are just their own weird domains with unusual operating principles. Certainly, some people will never need them. Maybe, none of us do? That seems to be the thinking.

Or, do we? Perhaps, there is something to be said for having a single global root of the public DNS namespace, and a single global addressing and routing system. I would say so, but I don&apos;t think the nice folks at Wired magazine were thinking about that issue when they decided to &quot;clean up&quot; their orthographic conventions.

In any case, I&apos;ll soon have to be qualifying the word &apos;internet&apos; with the adjective &apos;public&apos; if I expect anybody to know that I&apos;m really talking about the three-level hierarchy of backbone, transit and service provider networks that actually connect the Public together, as opposed to the internet qua internetworking system, embodied in the protocol specifications, the running code and the rough consensus about how nodes and routers are supposed to function together going forward.

 Internet Protocol. What the Internet was in 1996 is still more or less what it is today: a multiprotocol internet (it&apos;s both IPv4 and IPv6 now). It&apos;s just much larger and the pieces are owned and operated by a more diverse collection of players. You can still see this convention in use by reading more recent IETF documents. Culturally, we still cling to this distinction.
One of the interesting and arcane bits of controversy in the IETF these days sorta revolves around whether the idea of a &quot;public&quot; Internet makes any sense now. Some folks think it&apos;s time to recognize that the thing is all privately owned and operated from the top all the way down. Even the DNS root and the BGP default-free zone are just their own weird domains with unusual operating principles. Certainly, some people will never need them. Maybe, none of us do? That seems to be the thinking.

Or, do we? Perhaps, there is something to be said for having a single global root of the public DNS namespace, and a single global addressing and routing system. I would say so, but I don&apos;t think the nice folks at Wired magazine were thinking about that issue when they decided to &quot;clean up&quot; their orthographic conventions.

In any case, I&apos;ll soon have to be qualifying the word &apos;internet&apos; with the adjective &apos;public&apos; if I expect anybody to know that I&apos;m really talking about the three-level hierarchy of backbone, transit and service provider networks that actually connect the Public together, as opposed to the internet qua internetworking system, embodied in the protocol specifications, the running code and the rough consensus about how nodes and routers are supposed to function together going forward.

He was an anthropologist, and a contemporary of Marshall McLuhan in Toronto (worked on constructing the Toronto subway during the 50&apos;s) . He described an isolated island group that had been contacted (during the 30&apos;s?) , and the initial contacts were filmed. 30 years later, these same people are shown the films of those early contacts. They have had 30 years of absorbing the wider world culture; they saw the images of themselves 30 years earlier and refused to believe they were the same people.

Rob@336: They have had 30 years of absorbing the wider world culture; they saw the images of themselves 30 years earlier and refused to believe they were the same people. 

I think that&apos;s a standard human development feature in most folks. We respond to the world through the filter of our personal worldview. We track and follow changes that occur as registered by that worldview.

We have little capacity for seeing our worldview itself, though, so we have little capacity to see it change.

Psychologists testing children for their capacity to understand the volume of water being held in different shaped glasses saw similar results in as little as one year. The experiment involved something like pouring a glass of water into tall/skinny container, and then pouring the same glass of water into a short/fat container, and then asking kids to identify which container held more water. Kids who failed generally said the tall glass held more water. They&apos;d tape the experiment, kids would fail the test. A year later, they give the same kids the same test. Then they&apos;d take the kids who passed and show them the tape from last year where they failed. The kids would generally make accusations that the tape was photoshopped or CGI or something. They could not believe it they had failed something that seemed so obvious to them now.

They had no experience, no memory, of their worldview changing, of their brain rewiring, so that it could suddenly register the concept of &quot;volume&quot; that could be independent of &quot;height&quot;. As far as the kids were concerned, they hadn&apos;t changed in the previous 12 months.

But the tapes were clear that they had.

I was once a test subject for a friend of the family&apos;s undergrad child-psych project. She had me, at seven, and a younger friend do the water thing. I remember realizing that wider glasses held more around that age-- I felt very smart-- and sort of remember not knowing that. But I had younger siblings, so what I knew was also defined by what they didn&apos;t know yet; it wasn&apos;t something everyone knew, so I might not have felt weird acknowledging that I didn&apos;t.

The specificity is amazing .

The WashPost has a columnist named Dana Milbank who writes &quot;Washington Sketch&quot; most days. It&apos;s a political column and he adds some humor to it.

ethan@342: I still can&apos;t judge volume independent of height. 

If I recall correctly, this was a rather basic test. Pour water from a pitcher into regular glass A until A is full. Then pour water from A into a tall skinny glass B. Then refill A till full, and pour into a short, fat glass C. The kids were then asked something like &quot;Which glass currently has more water in it?&quot;

I believe the point was to test whether the kids had the capacity to hold the sequence of events in their mind so that it was clear that B and C must have the same amount of water, regardless of shape.

If they don&apos;t have that capacity, then it becomes a purely visual test, looking at B and C without any knowledge that they both contain &quot;A&quot; amount of water.

The thing that makes it interesting is that a kid who failed the test would watch a kid who passed the test and it would seem like magic. The kid who passed the test would probably more often than not, be unable to explain it to the kid who failed so that the failing kid could pass a similar test. The point where the kid who failed suddenly can pass is almost a moment of satori, where the same koan is senseless before, but brilliance after.

The filter through which we view the world is to us like water to fish.

I think The Day the Earth Stood Still is a great choice for a movie to remake right now. Unfortunately, the choice of Keanu Reeve tells me they&apos;re probably doing it for all the wrong reasons.

Then again, he was also in A Scanner Darkly , and that was about as well-intentioned as you can get without being actually any good.

Huh. According to imdb, the guy directing it directed the awful The Excorcism of Emily Rose and is attached to, no joke, an upcoming Paradise Lost project. I guess I know what aspects of the Day the Earth Stood Still story he&apos;s interested in...

Well, who knows? Maybe that remake will actually be enjoyable. Still, I&apos;m not going to rush in, no matter who plays Klaatu.

One movie I&apos;d like to see remade is Forbidden Planet . It&apos;s probably one of the most sophisticated SF movies ever made, as far as concepts are concerned. The direction though could have been improved. I think.

 The Day the Earth Stood Still A fresh adaptation from the original story, &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot;, might be worth watching and Reeves might be able to play Klaatu acceptably well. I suppose the giant robot would be a digital creation, so I suppose Andy Serkis is most qualified.

I was leery of the prospect of another remake, this time &quot;Halloween&quot;, but then I found out that Rob Zombie was doing it, and felt better about it.

 Rob Zombie had this to say about John Carpenter in an interview with Variety: &quot;The original &apos;Halloween&apos; is hallowed ground to me, and I talked to him about it and he was very supportive of what I wanted to do,&quot; Zombie said. &quot;He said, &apos;Go for it, Rob. Make it your own.&apos; And that&apos;s exactly what I intend to do. Over 25 years and a lot of movies, a very scary character became something of a Halloween cliché, with Michael Myers dolls that play the Halloween music when you press their stomachs. By the end of the sequel cycle, there was little connection to the original. I take that film very seriously, and I want to make it terrifying again.&quot; 
 #402 ::: Xopher ::: (view all by) ::: August 29, 2007, 02:02 PM : 

Keanu Reeves is a decent human being who doesn&apos;t happen to be very bright (by his own admission). He works out all right in movies that don&apos;t require a lot of acting chops ( The Matrix, for example, where as a just-unplugged person his woodenness was entirely plausible).

I&apos;ve seen The Day the Earth Stood Still several times, and I thought Michael Rainey was if anything too expressive, too culturally appropriate, too human. Maybe Keanu can improve on that.

Ahhh, they&apos;ll probably put in a bunch of raygun battles and car chases and spoil the whole thing. If the SFX budget is more than $1.29, it&apos;s gonna be a crummy movie.

I&apos;m all messed up on my feelings about Halloween . The original version, when I finally saw it last year, bored me to tears (I don&apos;t think it&apos;s just a question of novelty, because I&apos;m usually pretty good at putting myself in the place of the original audience, at least intellectually--I think I just didn&apos;t like it, and wouldn&apos;t have no matter what), so I don&apos;t have any vested emotions in the story itself. But then Rob Zombie-- House of 1000 Corpses was the silliest, dullest piece of garbage, but The Devil&apos;s Rejects was far and away my favorite movie of 2005. So now the question is--is he a good director who got off to a shkay start? Was The Devil&apos;s Rejects a fluke? I desperately want it not to be a fluke, so now I&apos;m all invested in Halloween being good...but then, the original was so boring!

And then the whole cycle starts over in my head.

Rennie was perfect, projecting intelligence and culture. And he was pretty much unknown to Americans, which made him believable as an alien. Speaking of actors who bring in baggage, Klaatu was originally going to be played by Spencer Tracy. A cranky Klaatu... Just what this Mission of Peace needed.

A remake that actually followed the idea behind the original story would be nice. In the story (which was quite short), it turns out that the robots were given complete control of the defense of galactic civilization, with the duty to destroy, on their own initiative, any planet which shows it&apos;s a threat by using nuclear weapons. Gort is left behind on Earth as judge, jury, and executioner, if necessary. Not quite as optimistic as the movie.

 Electronic music . As an aside, the use of classical music in 2001: A Space Odyssey was described as a case of frustrating expectations: Clarke described the audience&apos;s expectations as for electronic music as in Forbidden Planet.

Of course, the saucer in the Forbidden Planet ended up in at least one Twilight Zone story, and I think &apos;Robbie the Robot&apos; ended up in more than one.

Much of the design was picked up for Lost in Space . Although not the same spaceship, a similar layout (with a central astronavigational console) was used. The same designer who created &apos;Robbie the Robot&apos; for Forbidden Plantet created the robot used in LIS (eventually, the robots met and had a smackdown) .

Leslie Nielsen plays a &apos;serious&apos; role as Commander John J. Adams. The relationship between this character and Lt. &apos;Doc&apos; Ostrow (Warren Stevens) has been described as anticipating the &apos;Kirk-Bones&apos; relationship in ST-TOS.

The &apos;invisible monster&apos; effect was used in an episode of LIS, and the &apos;monsters from the id&apos;* was used in a Peter Davidson Doctor Who, &apos;Snakedance&apos;.

&quot;Pentagon Chaplain Accused of Aiding Proselytizing
&quot; By Jason Leopold
&quot; t r u t h o u t | Report

&quot; Thursday 30 August 2007

&quot;... the Pentagon&apos;s top chaplain opened its doors yet again to another evangelical group whose leader recently spent two days at the facility proselytizing, passing out Christian literature, and &quot;saving souls.&quot;

&quot;....David Kistler, President of Hickory, North Carolina-based H.O.P.E. Ministries International, embarked on a &quot;DC Crusade&quot; along with dozens of members of the evangelical organization for two weeks that included two days inside the Pentagon proselytizing and preaching the &quot;gospel&quot; to government employees and &quot;saving souls.&quot;
&quot;....
&quot;Weinstein said the lawsuit has been delayed only because of the &quot;overwhelming, non-stop reports of out-of-control Christian fundamentalism his organization has been receiving&quot; from soldiers who indicated to Weinstein&apos;s staff that rampant Christian fundamentalism has plagued the halls of the DOD and soldiers on the battlefield in Iraq are being forced by their superiors to accept Jesus Christ as their saviors. Weinstein, a former White House attorney under Ronald Reagan, general counsel H. Ross Perot and an Air Force Judge Advocate (JAG), has called for Congressional hearings into the Pentagon&apos;s attempts to &quot;Christianize&quot; the military and the DOD.&quot;
&quot;....
&quot;Two weeks ago, following a story published by Max Blumenthal in The Nation, the Pentagon scrapped plans to send so-called &quot;Freedom Packages&quot; to soldiers in Iraq. The packages, put together by the fundamentalist Christian ministry called Operation Straight Up, contained among other things, Bibles and the apocalyptic computer game &quot;Left Behind: Eternal Forces,&quot; in which &quot;soldiers for Christ&quot; hunt down enemies of Christianity.&quot;

What is, this, the Russian Army pre-Revolution drafting Jews for thirty or forty years&apos; service with non-stop proselytizing at them the entire time to the State Religion?

Note that other Christian denominations get witnessed at, too, and that the Southern Baptist Convention targets Roman Catholics and in eastern Europe Orthodox Christians, along with proselytizing non-Christians....

We got to talking about various other approaches and he said the mmost exicting take-off he&apos;d done was in a civil aviation bird; from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, when weight/altitude/engine power made it impossible to load more than half a tank of fuel, if the bird wasn&apos;t to end up in pieces floating down the Colorado.

Sounds like it was fun.

Denver in &apos;81. They rented a light plane and flew from Orange County to Denver and back. It was supposed to be a turbocharged plane but turned out not to be (last minute rental of oxygen tanks and masks).
Frisbie described the approach to Denver as ATC asking them if they could get some more altitude as they flew through canyons trying to keep within the plane&apos;s altitude limit.

Coming back, they had to spend some time at Grand Canyon waiting for the area to cool off so the plane had enough lift to get off the ground.

I don&apos;t have much strong memory of the trip, it was a long time ago.

However, I don&apos;t remember it being a really big deal to me with the altitude--several years earlier I&apos;d been in a Cessna 172 flying over Pike&apos;s Peak with two other people in the plane, the plane was up over 16,000 feet (Pike&apos;s Peak was something like 14,441 feet or so). Granted, back when I was living in Colorado Springs and working in Cheyenne Mountain, my body was much more adapted to altitude at the time than someone living at sealevel, where the atmospheric pressure is higher and there&apos;s more oxygen per unit volume....

The really horrible thing is, that I -did- have a current pilot&apos;s license and the time and must have been doing some of the flying, but I don&apos;t have any more real memory that a hazy looking out the cockpit of small plane at mountains recollection! &quot;There I was at 10,000 feet&quot; and I don&apos;t remember much about it! I do remember landing and taking off from an airport in Colorado at the top of a mountain, I remember some flying out in Colorado, I remember the haze over in the LA South Basin that restricted visibility, but....

&quot;In Emails, Political Pressure on Ex-Surgeon General
&quot;By Christopher Lee
&quot;The Washington Post

&quot;Friday 31 August 2007&quot;


&quot; &quot;He needs to be the SG [Surgeon General] with specific speeches, on specific topics addressing the Secretary&apos;s and the president&apos;s agenda - which will become more political as the re-elect gets underway,&quot; Turenne wrote.

&quot;In a Sept. 25, 2002, e-mail to Schofield, Turenne described Carmona as &quot;wandering&quot; and &quot;not focused on the president&apos;s/secretary&apos;s agenda.&quot;

&quot;&quot;These documents confirm that White House and HHS officials improperly sought to influence the activities of the Surgeon General to achieve political goals,&quot; Kennedy wrote yesterday in a letter to HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt....&quot;

Kennedy, chairman of the Senate health committee, obtained the e-mails as part of a probe into political interference in public health matters. In his letter, Kennedy noted that many of the White House e-mails were sent from Republican National Committee accounts held by White House officials, and he requested more documents.

Still not what you&apos;re looking for because people are facing each other before and after (which means they both turn net 180 degrees) but closer.

There are also many contra dances which net out to bookstore shuffles, but usually that&apos;s the result of several maneuvers with their own names. &quot;casting&quot; is a single maneuver like the shuffle, but involves one person doing a 360 (turn 270 while stepping outside the line, walk down while the neighbor sidles up, complete the turn).

 Her height, thought Ben Christie, was about five feet six or seven; not small, but seemingly so when compared with the legend surrounding her name.

We did have a couple of people citing Modesty&apos;s height as five foot six, back in the heptalogies thread ( from the first novel ; from the first sequence of the comic strip ). That detail seems to be pretty consistent.

A small datum-point. Within the last 5-10 years I have seen a survey of some physical characteristics of Australian women. The only one that&apos;s stuck is that their &apos;average height&apos; was between 5&apos;4&quot; and 5&apos;5&quot; (around 1.64m).

I wouldn&apos;t call anyone above that &quot;tall&quot;; that would have to be a distinct chunk above average, like at least half a head.

BTW, I&apos;ve used this figure many times while pointing out how awkwardly&amp;badly designed things like our local bus shelter seats, and indeed seats in buses, are for women of average height like me—maybe even contributing to DVT, but certainly yet another reason discouraging people from using public transport, and helping to make people&apos;s lives more miserable.

For some reason, my stack included records I never remembered listening too, much less owning: Three Judy Collins albums. Percy Faith and his Orchestra performing songs from The Sound of Music. The soundtrack to Gigi. A JFK Tribute album. How did I come to have these? Did they belong to a family member and accidentally got packed with my stuff when I moved west? I suppose, since know one has expressed grief or puzzlement about missing records at family get-togethers, that I can safely donate or toss them.

The stuff I know is mine is more troubling. Do I really WANT mp3s of the three Steve Martin and four Monty Python albums I haven&apos;t listened to in 20 years? Do those half-dozen Talking Heads discs have anything my Talking Heads CDs don&apos;t? And that literal-album of shellac 78s I bought for a quarter so I could show a co-worker where the name &quot;album&quot; came from . . . do I have any obligation to preserve it (&quot;Piano Reflections by Joe Reichman&quot;) for posterity?

This is similar to what Gaiman&amp;Pratchett tell us in Good Omens about any tape left in a car for more than a fortnight turning into The Best of Queen . Each of those albums you name is spontaneously generated in any batch of records left unattended for more than a month.

Re: Sabre-Tooth , I didn&apos;t dislike it enough to stop reading the series (though I am taking a break until I can get the stack of books I currently have out from the library to a more manageable size), but it just seemed kind of...diffuse, maybe?...compared to the first book. Vaguely unsatisfying for reasons I can&apos;t quite name.

On a completely unrelated, vague, and personal note, I find it amazing that, just as one reaches the verge of utter desperation, suddenly plans for making both the short and long term vastly more wonderful than one had thought possible suddenly materialize, out of nowhere. I almost don&apos;t want to say anything about it for fear that the bubble will burst, but things might be looking up for me for once.

I call it &quot;the curse of the six foot male,&quot; because everything seems designed for the the comfort and convenience of six foot males--automatic toll collectors, ATM/charge/credit card machines user interface area heights, counters at banks and car rental agencies for the customers, mirrors in restrooms, the damn collating table leg extensions at NESFA, computer lab tables, the height of the swipers at every supermarket within twenty miles of where I live that I&apos;ve been in with the sole exception of Stop&amp;Shop, store aisles (stuff way up over my head), instructions high I can&apos;t -see- them, let along -read- them, for various things at variious places; Cessna and Piper single ending FIXED landing gear planes (ironically, the twin-engine movable gear planes made by Cessna, did NOT require the use of #(*^#$(Y#IO@#PO# cushions/phone books/briefcases for me to be see even horizontally, let alone a runway for takeoff and landing, out of the cockpit, and reach the controls; any sedan or hatchback car made in the USA by Ford (even the hatch on Ford&apos;s smallest US-made car I can&apos;t reach to SHUT when it&apos;s open. Why don&apos;t I buy US-made cars? Simple, anything I have trouble seeing over the dashboard of, gets an automatic and non-waiverable disqualification. And the Taurus that my parents had had, had an door less-than-90-degree-corner, at the level of my forehead/eye and I got HIT in the forehead with the )#(%$#()$Y# door trying to get and in out of it... I really, really REALLY HATE MALE designers who design things with the automatic unquestioned assumption that they are the Standard Person.. that is, they don&apos;t ever look at things like demographics and consider that &quot;acessibility&apos; and &quot;usablity&quot; for five foot tall women, and 40% of the women in the USA are no more than 5&apos;1&quot; are things they should even CONSIDER considering. They design for what&apos;s easy for them to reach and do, and don&apos;t even consider that there are short women (and short men) who can&apos;t reach or even SEE what are are comfortable heights for the six foot male to reach, and convenient to see, at. I can&apos;t even -see- the damned text on the too-high electronic swipers, it&apos;s too close to my eyes at a bad angle, since is at the level of my NOSE for most installations with small type and does not move much... and I;&apos;m supposd to SIGN something at the level of my nose?! I snarl at these abominations and their perpetrators a LOT.

I keep vindictively hoping that someone will chop the damned designers legs off the at the knees and force THEM to go around stuck at MY height and see just how cheery THEY are with everythign designed for someone a foot taller than they are....

Oh, about the planes--can&apos;t get a certificate for flying the twin engine planes without first getting the Single Engine Land certificate... the twin-engine planes have a wider range of seat adjustment (yes, there is seat adjustment in both height and distance from the controls, on single engine fixed gear planes, but there is -more- adjustment available on the twin engine planes, to get closer to the controls and up higher). It&apos;s effectively once again, bar the entry gate to women, whether or NOT it&apos;s INTENTIONAL... and the fact that the more expensive higher performance planes DO have the adjustments, makes me VERY suspicious.

It would be less expensive to build planes for 5&apos;1 pilots, by the way, because less material would be necessary (smaller plane), cable runs would be shorter (smaller plane), the mass would be less meaning a less powerful engine consuming less fuel (which would mass less) would be necessary, lower operating costs (lower fuel consumption_), etc. ....

That&apos;s because everything was: RAF pilots, to be specific. Seriously.

In WW2, when they were designing planes, they did a lot of measuring of the guys who were going to be flying them so as to come up with some limited set of standardized measurements they could use to make sure all the planes could be used by all the pilots. And the RAF had a height minimum.

And after the War, when folks were designing other things and needed or wanted sets of standardized numbers, why, there was this handy set the Brits had done! Why bother doing it again?

Thus, the world is designed for the convenience of 6-foot males.

Second the rant ... I hate stores that put stuff on shelves more than six feet off the floor, and if there&apos;s a ladder, it&apos;s off-limits; any stools for standing on that they might have probably also have someone sitting on them.

The flipside of Paula&apos;s concerns is that well-designed things get my business.

However, I am still waiting for the actual gas nozzle to be redesigned with ergonomics that reflect its usage: that a) the new standard is that you have to hold it the whole time because of static discharge issues and b) that it&apos;s uncomfortable for a large fraction of users (I&apos;m 5&apos;7 and female, and it&apos;s too large for my hand).

&quot;Average&quot; gets very misleading very quickly--most people can bend to reach/see below their eye height and shoulder height. Short people cannot reach/see beyond their height limit. Eye level to a six footer is above the five footer&apos;s head. Something that the six footer can reach on that just over the head shelf, I can&apos;t even see what&apos;s on the blasted shelf, and can&apos;t read the price label at the front of the shelf.

But back to &quot;average,&quot; there&apos;s a bimodal average--the average height of women in the US is 5&apos;4&quot;, the average height of males is 5&apos;9&quot; ... put them together and... one gets average gender discrimination against women. And, the six foots and 5&apos;9&quot; types can BEND OVER. But those in power would rather not pay any attention most of the time (there is the exception of Stop&amp;Shop for the checkout counter flat area for signing charge slips)to the disaccommodation of short people.

&quot;What I&apos;m looking for is a sideways exchange. One person goes behind the other, both facing the same direction (in this case, the wall of pictures). The front person takes one step (to the right, say), while the back person will probably need to take at least two steps in the opposite direction. The maneuver should be fairly familiar to us literate types as the old bookstore switcheroo.&quot;

In English dance, this would be called a &quot;Mad Robin&quot;*. I suspect that&apos;s a neologism though -- the dance &quot;Mad Robin&quot; which includes this figure is quite old (1686) but I think using it to refer to the figure is a good deal younger. I also doubt that this would be current to a typical person in 1907.

In short, I probably haven&apos;t helped you at all, but you&apos;ve given me a new way to explain the Mad Robin.

* More precisely, a Mad Robin does this and goes back again, with the other person in front, just as a do-si-do returns to the original position if not otherwise specified. But I assume this sort of cheating is OK by you.

523: speaking as a six-foot male, I would like to assure Paula that, while much of the world may well have been designed for my convenience, long-distance mass transit bloody well wasn&apos;t. Coaches and airliners, in particular.

524: I find it very unlikely that the RAF had a six-foot minimum height during WW2. In fact, I don&apos;t believe it. Men were shorter then than now, and this would have ruled out a lot of potential pilots. A maximum height is more likely - even today, there are maximum heights for some aircraft, like the Harrier, because tall men simply can&apos;t fit in.
This is from the wiki on Guy Gibson:
&quot;After several operational sorties with 106 Squadron he considered two members of his allotted crew sub-standard and had them replaced. However, when a visiting Air Ministry team considered his 5&apos; 11&quot; tall rear-gunner (Pilot Officer John Wickens) too tall to be a Lancaster gunner, Gibson told them to forget the rules, as his gunner was staying.&quot;

And this is from an interview with a Spitfire pilot on the BBC People&apos;s War site:
&quot;I went in for one of the medical examinations, and they measured my height. I was 5 feet 3 inches tall, and the medical officer said I was half an inch too short to be considered for pilot training.&quot;
 #532 ::: Carrie S. ::: (view all by) ::: September 04, 2007, 12:22 PM : 

531: I didn&apos;t say the minimum was six feet, merely that there was a minimum--in fact I don&apos;t know what the minimum was, but the fact that one existed implies that there were a significant number of applicants who fell under it. This skewed their average towards taller men and biased their measurements.

Maybe not intentional, but when they don&apos;t make it easy to reach stuff on upper shelves (either with steps or with tall employees around to reach stuff for you), it&apos;s effectively discrimination, and women get more of it, because there are more short women than short men. You get really tired of &apos;standard size&apos; furniture that&apos;s too big.

Northwest Airlines had had a policy of not hiring anyone to be a pilot who was below six feet talll--and that was back in the days when the airlines liked to hire men with military pilot experience, and banned women from being flight engineers and pilots.

I get aggravated when I can see an item that I cannot see a PRICE for, much less reach... and that&apos;s for things that aren&apos;t cut off from me SEEING them!

As regards what gets shelved where, in a lot of cases there is what essentially are kickbacks for product placement on specific shelves--that is, it&apos;s NOT customer demand that drives the initial and much of the continuing placement of products on shelves, it&apos;s what the manufacturers are paying the stores (or not paying...) to put the products in specific locations or prime viewing/accessibility areas, and what the store designers decide, and what the individual store managers and the stocking clerks decide--most of whom are NOT short, and NOT female!

On heights and product placements, an international perspective:

I&apos;m 5&apos;6&quot; tall. In the last few months I&apos;ve gone from being relatively tall (in Scotland) to being fairly short (in the Netherlands).

I used to have to make sure, when (for instance) pulling a binder out of a set of shelves and setting it somewhere to leaf through with a colleague, to put it sufficiently low . My neighbours used to call me &quot;that tall girl with the long hair.&quot;

Now when my colleagues take things off shelves to look at with me, I find myself stretching and craning (or jumping up and down*). And I&apos;m among the smaller women in every crowd.

Another thing I&apos;ve noticed is that there are national assumptions about product placement in supermarkets. My acid test is where you find the sugar: in Britain it&apos;s with the flour and the baking ingredients. In the Netherlands, it&apos;s with the tea and coffee.**

Note that there are stores that specialize in Big and Tall for men, that men&apos;s clothing gets sized by height and width and neck diameter measurements...but women Don&apos;t Seem to Matter. &quot;I don&apos;t expect....&quot; Who -should- things be designed for, the 6&apos; males who are not that much as a larger percentage of the population than 4&apos;1&quot; women?! The standard deviation of male height is 3&quot;, a six foot male is one standard deviation off from 5&apos;9&quot;. A 4&apos;11&quot; female is more than one standard deviation off from the 5&apos;4&quot; average for women, however, there i that -claim- that women do most of e.g. the grocery shopping.... (Although the local supermarket I shop in, there are times when it looks like it&apos;s 50-50. I&apos;ve seen adult males go shopping with one or two or three schoolage children, along with men shopping solo, and men shopping with women, with wife and offspring, etc., and though I haven&apos;t seen it there, there are probably men married to one another who go shopping in the region, too.

Using this height chart (and pretending to be 20 instead of 36), 4&apos;11&quot; puts me at below the 3rd percentile for height for US women. I simply can&apos;t feel outraged about my lack of height being catered to.

I don&apos;t pretend that I don&apos;t have trouble finding clothing, but there&apos;s certainly a decent petite women&apos;s clothing market in the US and there are stores that cater specifically to the short.

It can be -worse- to be left -out- completely via no provision for existing, than to be deliberately left out--at least in the former case one is acknowledged to exist and be worthy of being discriminated against/admitted to actually exist, as opposed to, &quot;You are not even worthy of being NOTICED to have an existence, you don&apos;t exist and aren&apos;t of sufficient relevance to get an admission of existence!&quot;

Thanks for the link. That gets me to 30th percentile.[*] If *I* can&apos;t reach something, then almost a third (and maybe more) of the adult female population can&apos;t reach it either.

* It occurs to me that these percentiles probably get more skewed toward the shorter end as the ages increase, because height seems to have been increasing with each generation, I&apos;m told. Someone 30 years or so older than the 20 allowed for on your chart is more likely to be short; any given height, therefore, would be at a higher percentile.

When I was in college in the late 60&apos;s, our prof demonstrated mean, median, average, etc. by using the heights of the two dozen or so students. Half a dozen of us women were 5&apos;2&quot;, which skewed the bell curve considerably. Over the past several years, I&apos;ve stabilized at 5&apos;.

My greatest height grievance is womens&apos; towel dispensers in public restrooms that occasionally are hung over 4&apos; from the floor.

This once made me irate enough to initiate espionage into the mens&apos; to verify that their towel dispensers were LOWER.

And certainly the design of modern cars reflects the fact that women are the buyers and drivers - think powered doors on minivans, for example - in a way that they didn&apos;t two decades ago.

 #582 ::: albatross ::: (view all by) ::: September 04, 2007, 11:20 PM : 

It&apos;s pretty striking to me how often people make dumb design decisions, without apparently even noticing. When we first had a baby, I started noticing how many tasks required both hands, even when it was immediately obvious that they could have been done with one. People just flat didn&apos;t think about it. Of *course* you should need two hands to get a paper towel in the bathroom, or to open 90%+ of packages. (The others require three hands, a knife, and patience.)

More recently, I&apos;ve noticed the bizarre decision to put urinals at a height where even a short adult man would have a hard time hitting them. The problem here becomes obvious when your six year old boy wants to use them, and must either find a sit-down toilet or leave a puddle.

And there are so many other examples. Furniture with sharp corners. (Why would *anyone* design a knee-level table with sharp corners? Have these people no knees?) Faucets that require more strength than a healthy six year old kid has to turn on and adjust temperature for. Or those new handsfree ones, which at least 30% of the time have the temperature set too hot, making it a real joy to get your kids to wash their hands after using the cleaned-once-a-week airport toilets. Airline beverage carts with sharp corners (why not pad the damned things, since you hit ten knees on every fking trip, and eight of them are mine?) Back when they had smoking in restaurants where I lived, people inevitably set the smoking section in the middle of the nonsmoking section, even when a nice isolated room was available. And of course they didn&apos;t do something really wacky like, say, put in a vent fan so that air would flow into the smoking section instead of out.

None of this appears to be active malice or even greed. I mean, it can&apos;t really be cheaper to set the urinals and sinks and paper towel dispensers too high for small kids to use, and presumably it doesn&apos;t save much money to make it impossible to get napkins or ketchup one-handed at the fast-food restaurant. It&apos;s just that nobody who has any power to decide how these things are designed notices that they&apos;ve screwed 20 or 30% of their customers, for no profit whatsoever, just from not thinking through their design.

What was that quote? Against stupidity, the gods themselves struggle in vain.

Carrie S. @ 468, Bellatrys reviewed the upcoming Dark is Rising movie here . Sample quotation:

---
The most prominent point has been the claim of eliminating or &quot;downplaying&quot; (whatever that means) the pagan elements in the originals, by an admittedly-evangelical-Christian company dedicated to producing works of sound Christian entertainment - at least as they define &quot;Christianity.&quot;

So what exactly have they downplayed, and what added, that would constitute taking out the heathenry and putting in the Gospels?

Well, judging by the trailer and the descriptions of the script and shooting by those who are making it, they have taken out - in addition to the King Arthur element , which I might remind you was according to Tolkien too Christian a mythos to work as proper epic fantasy - they have taken out all of the moral ambiguity and inner struggle in the originals, and replaced it with sex, greed, and violence.

Opening a plastic bag usually requires 2 friends and a broadsword, though I&apos;ve occasionally made do with a blowtorch.

Also note the &quot;automatic&quot; paper towel dispensers in restrooms. Just have to wave one hand over the photocell, and it dispenses a length of towel—just long enough not to be useful. If you want more you have to pull on the towel, and you need both hands, one on either side, or it binds up and won&apos;t come out at all.

Re ergonomic design. I went to my bookshelves to find my 1955 paperback of Henry Dreyfuss&apos; &quot;Designing for People&quot; (turning very brown), intending to wave it around as proof that designers back then had the information they needed about average dimensions of men and women and their various parts, and that it was sheer lazyness that prevented them from using the data.

Then I looked up the charts in the book. Pages 32 - 35 show dimensioned drawings of the bodies of average size adult men and women, and children of several ages, also showing some of the reach and angle of rotation of the limbs. Aha, says I, here&apos;s the data! But—the drawings were substantially different between the male and female adults. I&apos;ll ignore the fact that a keyboard was shown with the appropriate 15° incline under the man&apos;s hands and nothing under the woman&apos;s, that&apos;s just an effect of the expected sexual stereotypes of the time. But why, for instance, does the man&apos;s figure show the cones of visual coverage and the range of head and arm movement, and the woman&apos;s and the children&apos;s do not? The man&apos;s also shows leg clearance under a table, and the other&apos;s don&apos;t. Were the others measured for these variables, or was it just assumed they were the same?

And this was the man who convinced everybody, in the US, at an any rate, that designing for the way people were shaped was important. Looks to me like even he wasn&apos;t willing to think it all the way through.

The curves of that website are skewed ones--there are -different- iso-something-or-others for &quot;white,&quot; &quot;hispanic,&quot; &quot;black,&quot; and &quot;other&quot; women.... something like 17% of the US population is now or soon will be categorizable as hispanic, and note that the curve for percentile height of 20 year olds is shorter comparing hispanic women&apos;s height to &quot;white&quot; women&apos;s height. Women from the eastern Pacific Rim and south Asia tend to be short--there are lots of women either in attire characteristic of India or wearing headscarves indicative of south Asian Islamic culture in the supermarkets I shop in, and they&apos;re almost all short .

The assumptions of uniform distribution for making nice smooth curves, don&apos;t seem to be to be good assumptions--it&apos;s not the nice smooth symmetrical &quot;normal distribution&quot; curve with the single peak that fits what it is, constant-1 times e to the minus constant2-times-(x-squared)--the curves are multimodal, that is, there are multiple peaks, there are valleys, etc., and change in height over time also puts in skewing that means that taking a simple-minded average and standard deviation and proclaiming that here are the numbers, is misleading... It&apos;s the stuff of Michael Flynn&apos;s talk &quot;How to Lie with Statistics.&quot;

I was looking for a site with actual demographic data and couldn&apos;t find it, instead of a bogus calculator full of what seems to me to be bogus assumptions... This whole discussion comes out of the general characteristic of taking the path of least attention and concern and consideration, of assuming &quot;everyone else out there is just like me or a Standard Person Defined as a tall White Male for vision, for mobility, for ability to reach....&quot; and not doing actual demographic investigation and analysis... just as the assumption is that women do the shopping and the ads get pitched to make women feel inadequate as they are but buying these cleaning products will give them self-esteem and power [somewhat paraphrasing and reinterpreting some of the stuff that Tony Cherubini who quit the network commercial and nonprofit TV industry for small town producer-video-instructor-small-farmer life, told me years ago]. The stores don&apos;t really distinguish -who- does the shopping, because debit cards don&apos;t say which of the people with the family account are doing the buying on it, cash doesn&apos;t carry data about the buyer with it, etc. So the pronouncement is out there that women do the grocery shopping and I&apos;m still waiting for the ads showing males doing laundry, cleaning, cooking, buying groceries, etc., as if they do it as an ordinary daily chore and part of their life, instead of the damned Clorox bimbo slave housewife and mother whose sons and husbands piss all over the toilet, for her to HAPPILY go about cleaning up after (I&apos;m using coarser language, but that radio ad actually was the most to my perspective outrageous of an ad compaign in which not ONE other member of a household ever evinced the slightest attention to a) not making repulsive messes, b) cleaning anything up, or c) regarding Mama as other than an slavish appliance that would automatically revert everything to sparkling clean. &quot;Mama makes the house fresh with the magic of Clorox&quot; went dancing about in the wake of all the other members of the family who give slobs a good name for tidyness and cleanliness, cleaning up everything.... )]

 *This is not a second-person you. 

It&apos;s an omission--the people don&apos;t -exist- to the designer. It never occurs to the designer to consider that mobility-impaired people exist or if they exist, that building design should accommodate them: the designer is designing with the implicit assumption that everyone else is like the designer and walks up and down steps, has no trouble negotiating up and down a curbstone, that comfortable field of view (I don&apos;t want to say &quot;eye level,&quot; because when e.g. I put up pictures on the wall at home, I have to -consciously- think of where -my- eye level is, otherwise I almost automatically put things where I&apos;m used to seeing them on walls generally --
That is, there is default behavior, which is what what is accustomed/acclimatized to, and internalizes, unless there is some substantiative overt obstacle preventing one from automatic assimilation of the situation and using it as default.

Er, translating--people who can walk up and down stairs without much trouble, don&apos;t particularly notice stairs consciously that they negotiate on a regular basis. It becomes automatic to go up and down those stairs without conscious attention, and when thinking about buildings, one then has the reflexive definition that stairs belong on buildings--because that&apos;s what one sees and goes up and down everyday, the stairs become internalized and invisible as regards considering them as things to think about as issues. Only if one has issues with stairs does one think of them as issues/obstacles/[literal] impediments, or if one is dealing with people who have issues with stairs, and has to keep consciously remembering that stairs are issues/problems, if not for them, for people they are concerned with.

it is discrimination, because the folks with mobility issues, are being left out of the equation of &quot;requirements/things to consider when designing and constructing buildings.&quot; It&apos;s as if they shouldn&apos;t exist even though they do exist. Their requirements don&apos;t get considered unless the designer gets slammed over the head, repeatedly, with it in way too many cases. In the pure form, I would say it&apos;s a form of sociopathy, an inability to consider or consider relevant, anything that is not one&apos;s own situation.

Regarding Sarah S&apos; comments about short women versus women--it is discrimation in both cases, there is absolutely no real conflict involved--the people responsible for supermarket design and the ad producers are not the same people, and they each are looking from their own particular bigoted views, and being sociopathic about it. The marketing people don&apos;t care about the anger that women like me feel about the portrayal of women as household slaves--their intent is to brainwash women who identify with the situation of wanting a clean house and having a family that makes messes, of feeling empowered with Clorox Wipes to at least make the house clean and feel good about -that- and and power via Housecleaning Supremacy and Competence.. and persuade them also that they shouldn&apos;t have any other foci to their lives (see &quot;Southern Baptist Convention What We Believe stuff....) than subservience.

The supermarket builders are out to put maximum amounts of product in minimum amount of space, and the anger of under half of the femal population regarding inacessible items, isn&apos;t something they particularly have any concern about... THEY are not the ones who are trying to get at objects placed inaccessibly for them, they are like the designers of staircases who consider stairs normal, and to whom those who have difficulty with stairs, are nonexistent/of no pertinence/can&apos;t make THEIR lives miserable [until ADA...]

Until and unless the designers and marketeers internalize that women and particularly short women are PEOPLE (and short men, and movement-impaired and vision-impaired etc.) and deserving of respect and consideration as opposed to being targets with no respect and consideration of the women&apos;s/short women&apos;s/short men&apos;s/disableds&apos; concerns involved, the discrimination stays....

Women formerly were locked out of military pilot status, because they were women . It was a combination of social values and attitudes and beliefs and not wanting competition from women--which again is social values and attitudes--and utter disdain for the desire of any woman to be a military pilot and utter disdain that any woman might have the ability along with the interest to be a military pilot. &quot;Women, they&apos;re women, they shouldn&apos;t be pilots.&quot; Pure unadulterated bigoted discriminatory prejudicial credo and arrogance and sociopathy....

A girl* I knew in college did a research project on campus accessibility... after she broke her leg and spent some months in a wheelchair. She didn&apos;t concentrate on the big issues, like most of the dorms not having elevators or one building that cannot be entered without stairs, but on false accessibility-- wheelchair ramps she couldn&apos;t find, curb ramps with a one-inch drop to them so she couldn&apos;t get up them, door-opening buttons she couldn&apos;t reach. I expect they&apos;re doing better now, but there was a lot to improve upon. The one thing the campus really did have going for it was that it&apos;s in Illinois, so it was flat.

This is what we do with ADA and fire codes and building codes, but I suspect it only works with a tiny fraction of the bad design problem. There must be a couple million decisions involved in designing and putting up an office building, and maybe the rules can impose sensible decisions (assuming the rules are sensible--definitely not guaranteed!) on a few hundred. And obvious public safety issues have led us to have an infrastructure for publishing and enforcing rules on how to design and put up buildings. We just don&apos;t have that infrastructure, and probably couldn&apos;t afford it, for the millions of other dumb design decisions that smack us in the face every day.

I wish I had an answer. I don&apos;t think you can pass a law against dumb or thoughtless, or that you can enumerate any significant fraction of sensible design decisions in law or rules.

The ADA examples prove that, right--it&apos;s common to see setups where someone has put in curb cuts and ramps, but done it in a way that&apos;s massively inconvenient or dangerous or not really quite functional. Almost certainly, that&apos;s not intentional--the ramp and curb cuts cost the same whether they&apos;re sited intelligently or not, and hardly anyone explicitly wants to screw over people in wheelchairs. But it&apos;s a nice example of how you can get a legal requirement for certain sensible things like ramps and curb cuts and elevators, but still not get an accessible building. I suspect that any attempt to solve the broad bad design problem with law runs into the same issues.

Discrimination is treating an individual based on the group they belong to, not on their individual merit.

The store owner is treating everyone the same as far as he knows. (Or he&apos;s simply trying to maximize product in a fixed floor space, and height/gender isn&apos;t a concern.) He isn&apos;t intending to discriminate against women, he isn&apos;t intending to discriminate against short people.

 This is what we do with ADA and fire codes and building codes, but I suspect it only works with a tiny fraction of the bad design problem. 

The actual preferred intent when written by clueful sorts, is to get people to if not think about what they&apos;re doing and comply with intents such as making buildings effectively accessible to people, get them into design habits which promote accessibility, and have it be one of their criteria when designing....

The checklist system that the military and some other organizations have that require checking off things and soemtimes having someone who&apos;s an expert or official designee in some area for certification, provides some assurance for compliance, and that someone with a clue has looked over it. The whole formal Professional Engineer certification system and requirements for legally signing off on commercial buildings, on bridges and roads, etc., is one for safety and the assurance that the building/tunnel/bridge won&apos;t collapse--and if it does, the PE who signed off is legally liable for the failure, unless e.g. fraud on someone else&apos;s part get proven. Elevating ADA to that level might be drastic, however, it would probably dramatically increase the accessibility of buildings, particularly if the PE gets legal responsibility. Checking that ramps really work and access is actually present, can&apos;t be more difficult than e.g.inspecting rods and concrete sampling and epoxy [see, &quot;Big Dig, Wrong Type of Expoxy, ceiling panel collapse, wrongful death, big lawsuit...] for materials properties and correct applications and use of materials with appropriate tensile strength and curing conditions....

 There must be a couple million decisions involved in designing and putting up an office building, and maybe the rules can impose sensible decisions (assuming the rules are sensible--definitely not guaranteed!) on a few hundred. 

Often the rules are commonsense sorts of things and &quot;were the instructions followed for setting the concrete? Please provide the documentation...&quot;

 And obvious public safety issues have led us to have an infrastructure for publishing and enforcing rules on how to design and put up buildings. We just don&apos;t have that infrastructure, 

I think that at least some of it exists--ramps and rules for things like angle of inclination, width, type of materials, weight loading, gaps allowed, etc., are not anything new... the distance between rails on railroad tracks got standardized a long time ago, also requirements on railroad ties, etc. There are all sorts of long-standing regulatings of height minimums for attics, for crawl spaces, ventilations recommendations, distances of different types of pipes and wires from various things in buildings, the height of electrical outlets... the lists go on and on and on. When OSHA first go enacted, there were hundreds of pages of material going down to what toilet seats had to be made of (solid materials, no laminate originally, it got eased up later).

 and probably couldn&apos;t afford it, for the millions of other dumb design decisions that smack us in the face every day. 

Much of it is lack of paying attention or laziness....

 I wish I had an answer. I don&apos;t think you can pass a law against dumb or thoughtless, or that you can enumerate any significant fraction of sensible design decisions in law or rules. consider what they&apos;re doing, and get them into the habit of paying attention...

 The ADA examples prove that, right--it&apos;s common to see setups where someone has put in curb cuts and ramps, but done it in a way that&apos;s massively inconvenient or dangerous or not really quite functional. Almost certainly, that&apos;s not intentional--the ramp and curb cuts cost the same whether they&apos;re sited intelligently or not, and hardly anyone explicitly wants to screw over people in wheelchairs. But it&apos;s a nice example of how you can get a legal requirement for certain sensible things like ramps and curb cuts and elevators, but still not get an accessible building. 

They did it wrong then, ignoring the spirit of intent of the law... better than nothing, but not better than designing with the intent to be accessible, instead of putting in a ramp because the law says there must be a ramp....

 I suspect that any attempt to solve the broad bad design problem with law runs into the same issues. 

The issue is one of perceptions--the law is playing two-by-four-on-the-mule-to-get-its-attention....

 Is there a good solution, other than trying to reward designers of usable products by buying them? 

One way might to be mandate that before the building get approval for use, that someone has to travel around in it and use the facilities who uses a wheelchair....

 Paula@613: Women formerly were locked out of military pilot status, because they were women. 

 Yes. And that&apos;s not the same as a tall male supermarket owner designing his shelves for people his height. 

Yeah, the latter has even less of a clue... the former shuts women out of the cockpit and then designs the cockpit for the 5th to 95th percentile of male height, the latter is ignoring customers and doing customer disservice... for someone in a service industry, that is obnoxious. Would he do the same to his male customers if he thought there were lots of male customers?!

 Discrimination is treating an individual based on the group they belong to, not on their individual merit. 

There are lots of different types of discrimination, there is discrimination on an individual basis.... &quot;discrimination&quot; as a word merely means making one more more distinctions and screening based on the one or more distinctions, as in &quot;discriminating taste&quot; which tends to be a positive use of the word.. that&apos;s why the term is &quot;discriminated against when someone is being given the brushoff for being of a discriminated against group, or for some other reason. It&apos;s discrimination to make someone take a bath if they&apos;ve been mucking out sewers before allowing them into a cocktail party, on the basis of &quot;you -stink-!,&quot; it&apos;s discrimination to refuse to hire someone to paint rainbows who can&apos;t distinguish between green and red--if the requirement is &quot;normal color vision&quot; soemone with abnormal color vision is not capable of doing the job! Discrimination agasint someone when the person is capable of doing the job but has been denied the opportunity because of e.g. race, creed, color, national origin, gender, etc., involves a factor that has nothing to do with the actual work.

In the case of, &quot;I can&apos;t reach that!&quot; the real question is, &quot;Who set the standard for reaching?!&quot; A six foot male setting a reaching standard for the general populace is discrimination against short people; someone setting the reaching standard in their own private home, is a purely private, personal matter, not job and work and public disaccommodation.

 The store owner is treating everyone the same as far as he knows.
He&apos;s exhibiting discrimination, applying his personal non-general reach metrics to the general public--instead of using ergonomics he&apos;s using himself as the measure of all things, which is arrogance....

 (Or he&apos;s simply trying to maximize product in a fixed floor space, and height/gender isn&apos;t a concern.) 

Again, that is discrimination, by using his personal metrics instead of considering the customer base interests. In the privacy of his own home, fine, but the store is supposed to be serving the public and accommodating them. Note that a lot of supermarkets have mobies these days for patrons who have mobility impairments, to use....

 He isn&apos;t intending to discriminate against women, he isn&apos;t intending to discriminate against short people. 

He has not done anything to accommodate the consumer who is below average height, and that is discriminatory against short people... it&apos;s disaccommodation and inconveniencing, again.

 Tall men do not get into the grocery store business to discriminate against short women.
Men didn&apos;t go into the military per se to discriminate against women, but they were discriminating against women nonetheless....

 And if you&apos;re throwing them into the same bin as overt, intentional, sexist behavior, then you need to get better bins. 

The effect being the same, pragmatically they don&apos;t look a whole lot different from the perspective of the offended-against party. Or as the store clerk in the market halfway between MIT and Harvard said at the student with the loaded cart at the ten or fewer items line, &quot;Do you go to Harvard and can&apos;t add or MIT and can&apos;t read?&quot;

 Or get out of the binning business.

That is a different level of intent than the store owner. The store owner isn&apos;t actively prohibiting something.

If &quot;centrism&quot; (and I use that word since I can&apos;t think of anything better to fill that hole with) is the same as active discrimination, then the following groups of people can claim supermarkets actively discriminate:

poor people, people who can&apos;t get transportation, people who can&apos;t carry groceries, people who have obscure food allergy (xxx), people who are trying to eat proper nutrition (my recent annoyance), people who can&apos;t bend over, people who can&apos;t reach high, people who can&apos;t walk, people who can&apos;t speak, people who can&apos;t see.

because no supermarket is going to place all of its food in small, easy to lift packages, at a consistent height of 3 feet 6 inches from the floor, with nothing no higher and no lower, with all the junk food separate from all the healthy food, all marked in braile, with people assigned to carry it for you and deliver it to your home or spot under the bridge, for free.

In California law*, there are two possible bases for a successful discrimination suit:
- differential intent, ie, the defendant&apos;s behaviour was intended to discriminate against a particular group, and
- differential impact, meaning that the defendant&apos;s behaviour had the effect of discrimination, regardless of intent.

The law surrounding differential impact was controversial, obviously. I can picture Greg&apos;s reaction on reading this.

But the thing is, as adults, we are responsible for the forseeable consequences of our actions, even if they are unintended. To take an extreme example: I may not intend to kill anyone when I drive recklessly into a crowd of people, but I am accountable if I do so nonetheless.

On a smaller scale, a tall male business owner may not have the intent to inconvenience short and/or female shoppers. But if he can reasonably forsee that they will be inconvenienced**, and decides that their inconvenience doesn&apos;t matter?

The fascist kleptcratic oligarchs who put in a junta to remove the idea of government for the people, as opposed to for the fattest profit of the oligarachs, have been removing every public interest rule and regulation and structure for data collection that could be used to show unfairness that they can get at to dismantle, from Mine Safety, to discontinuing collecting data about women in the workforce which was the basis of many a discrimination lawsuit, to purging the Justice Department of anyone pursuing civil rights cases denying people voting rights who are poor/Hispanic/dark-skinned and instead pushing essentially fraudulent cases to remove likely-to-vote-Democratic voters from the voting rolls and from access to voting locations and equipment (wrong information distributed about polling locations, locking up voting machines in districts seen as Democratic in Ohio three during the last Presidential election, etc.)

They&apos;re trying to get rid of labelling requirements, and they&apos;re promoting redefining &quot;Chocolate&quot; as cocoa powder with whatever adulterant fat or oil they can get cheapest instead of cocoa butter....

Paula@631: Would he do the same to his male customers if he thought there were lots of male customers?! 

If he was clueless, yes. If he wasn&apos;t clueless, then it is active discrimination. Once again, you continue to twist the circumstances so that the store owner somehow is a male actively looking for ways to discriminate against women, rather than allowing for any possibility at all that the owner might be a woman, or that a store owner of either gender might be doing it for non discriminatory reasons, i.e. more product per square foot.

 There are lots of different types of discrimination 

No. Discrimination is very simple. It is treating an individual in a way that is not based on the individual&apos;s merits. &quot;discriminating taste&quot; has nothing to do with it. It&apos;s a completely different connotation of the word.

 It&apos;s discrimination to make someone take a bath if they&apos;ve been mucking out sewers before allowing them into a cocktail party 

Of course it isn&apos;t discrimination. It&apos;s based on merit, and showing up in sh!t waders to a cocktail party gets you kicked out.

You have expanded the definition of discrimination to include anything that prohibits anyone from doing anything they want at any time for any reason, and you have completely eliminated any concept of &quot;merit&quot; being applied to the process. If covered in filth and smelling like shit isn&apos;t merit but discrimination then life must make you feel miserable, because everything is discrimination.

Xopher , I don&apos;t see where merit comes into this at all. I don&apos;t understand what you mean with that sentence. 

Since your example of the law against sleeping under bridges changed the context of intent, I&apos;ll shift it back to the store owner example.

if a store owner is &quot;discriminating&quot; against poor people because they can&apos;t afford the store&apos;s groceries, then the word discrimination has become meaningless.

There are noble reasons to help the poor and have programs like food stamps and unemployment and subsidized housing, but &quot;fighting discrimination&quot; isn&apos;t one of them.


 #639 ::: Paula Lieberman ::: (view all by) ::: September 05, 2007, 05:14 PM : 

Greg, try looking up a definition of discrimination. I&apos;m making a distinction between &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;discrimination against&quot; that seems to be too discriminating for you to deal with.

As for the store owner/operator, the person could be a tall woman , too. It&apos;s usually de facto discrimination against short women because of that difference in average height, that people discriminated against the most by the unthinking posting of bills at a six footer comfort level, by counters too high and by car seat to dashboard distance too great, are more likely to be female than male, but there&apos;s discrimination against short men, too--they get paid less than taller men, for one thing. Because the 5th percentile of male height is not that far from the 50th percentile of female height, a male has to be really short to get the full short shrift effect of being short.

The gender discrimination is associational with the fact that women tend to be around 8 percent shorter than men, and that women tend to get ignored and brushed off a lot more than men do... consider the &quot;women talk more than men do&quot; allegations, which turn out to be very bogus... there are skewed perceptions involved, that don&apos;t put equal weighting and a lack of bias into the listeners. When measurements get made of how much time women speak and how much men speak, there isn&apos;t a whole lot of difference involved.... just bigoted perceptions.

The store operator has both expensive and inexpensive items for sale usually, that is not discriminating against poor people, there are cuts of meat at different price points, brown eggs in New England are $0.20 a dozen less expensive than white and vice versa in California and there is no nutritional difference, there is store brand merchandise that&apos;s less expensive than national name brand merchandise, and the store owner is NOT telling the customer how to split up the customer&apos;s purchasing... the poor person has the CHOICE to blow money on junk food or nutritious food, just as the wealthier person does--and oh, by the way, I know a millionaire who shops the day-old bread and meat because he&apos;s stingy.... and there are poor folk who splurge on expensive food at the other side. The store is not preventing or forcing the person what to buy from what&apos;s available...

The issue of affordable foodstores in poor neighborhoods hinges more on safety issues... there&apos;s a big Stop&amp;Shop near the less desirable areas of Boston, because the store chain realized that there was an opportunity to make money there from the people there.... equating &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;bad neighborhood&quot; isn&apos;t a identity relationship--yes, some poor neighborhoods are bad ones, and vice versa, but there are also high income areas with a lot of crime and high crime areas with a lot of income. Having access to a supermarket is something that involves there being -space- for a supermarket and for cars to park and some amount of security for the store and patrons to not feel threatened by crime , and having the location be one that the chain feels will provide the profit desired--and some supermarkets are in poor neighborhoods, and some are several miles away from people in McMansions on five acres of land... those big houses on those huge lots, don&apos;t have ANYTHING near that that you don&apos;t need a car to get to and from!

Greg 638: I was thinking of the short people, actually. The bridge thing is a way of saying &quot;you&apos;re in the grip of a false equivalence.&quot;

How about discrimination is &quot;inappropriately differentiating between people on any basis not reasonably relevant to the transaction in question.&quot; Because I don&apos;t think my merit or lack of same has anything to do with my shopping in a grocery store. A cat may look at a king.

Not giving groceries to people who do not have the money to pay for them is not discrimination under the above definition. It WOULD be discrimination, I&apos;m sure you&apos;d agree, to stop anyone under 5&apos;10&quot; at the door, saying &quot;sorry, we don&apos;t allow shorties to shop here.&quot;

Putting the goods up too high for us shorties to reach? Well, I can see an argument that that&apos;s discrimination, though I personally think it&apos;s just stupid (they lose the business on that item, and once we go to another store for that item, we buy other things there too).

I&apos;ve reached many a thing down for other people, though I&apos;m only 5&apos;7&quot; myself. I once broke a huge jar trying to reach it down; I felt terrible, but in fact it shouldn&apos;t have been so hard to get to. I offered to pay but the store owner (little place in Hoboken, otherwise delightful, take you there sometime) refused.

There are a couple of things I think you&apos;re missing in this conversation, Greg. One is that Paula&apos;s examples (correct me if I&apos;m wrong, Paula) were designed to show that not all discrimination is inappropriate ; she wasn&apos;t advocating unwashed sewer workers being welcome to the cocktail party. The problem is that &apos;discrimination&apos; has a standard meaning, which Paula was using, and a political/quasi-legal term-of-art meaning, which you and I employ (note that any term about which you can say &quot;let&apos;s try this definition&quot; is a term of art).

The other thing I think you may be missing is that the argument that shelf height can be a form of discrimination is based on the idea that a) placing things up high makes it harder on shorter people, b) shorter people are disproportionately women, and c) this means that placing things up high has the effect (though not necessarily the intent) of discriminating against women.

My local grocery store has an interesting way of dealing with this. If they do enough volume on a particular product, they stock it in columns: that is, one shelf will have a single row of (say) Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail, and the shelves above and below will have exactly the same thing. The next row over on ALL the shelves is the Cran-Raspberry, then Cran-Grape and whatever. This takes no more space than putting all the Cran-Raspberry way up high, but is much better for the store&apos;s customers.

I know you do see why that&apos;s better; I just want to point out that relatively minor changes can make big differences.

Shelves might be a tiny bit harder to stock, but... columns.

Yeah, that would be discrimination. There is no merit in preventing people from entering the store simply on that basis.

 The problem is that &apos;discrimination&apos; has a standard meaning, which Paula was using, and a political/quasi-legal term-of-art meaning, which you and I employ 

That she kept comparing store shelves to the military prohibition against female fighter pilots sort of pointed me in the direction that she meant the &quot;non-merit-based interaction&quot; rather than, say, having the discriminating taste that prefers high class truffles rather than run of the mill fungus.

 The other thing I think you may be missing ... that placing things up high has the effect (though not necessarily the intent) of discriminating against women. 

again, repeatedly comparing the store shelves to fighter pilots seems to me an indicator that some people do not have a bins that differentiate between active discrimination and unintentional centrism. Everything goes in the same bin. There is no difference.

Not only that, but folks writing the narrative behind the store shelves so that not only was the store owner aware of the issue, but that he choose to implement poor shelving techniques anyway out of spite , indicates that the interpretation of the raw data (shelf height) was loaded with bias.

The original point of my objection was to point out the lack of distinction between active discrimination and what I&apos;ll for now call unintentional centrism. What seems obvious since then is that there is massive bias in the interpretation of facts for some folks that prevents them from seeing this distinction. And trying to make this distinction in the face of embedded bias is a waste of time.

Hmm. Would you object to calling that second one &quot;passive discrimination&quot;—&apos;passive&apos; indicating a failure to act?

I think the fundamental difference is that you think it matters what the store owner was thinking, and some others in this conversation do not. I have empathy for everyone, which inclines me to your point of view, but also I see how such a distinction could be gamed, which makes me think it probably shouldn&apos;t matter.

There&apos;s a bar in my neighborhood which has banned baggy clothes and workboots. They want the yuppies on my block but not the guys from the projects a block away. (I never go in there, and it&apos;s only partly because I always wear workboots, except at the office.) They can claim, and probably will, that they just want people to be dressed neatly, but in fact they&apos;re trying to keep out blacks and all working-class people.

See where I&apos;m going with that? They&apos;re discriminating, but they can claim they had no such intention. Now I personally don&apos;t think the law should intervene against this bar; I just will look down on anyone who goes there. But it&apos;s that kind of thing that leads to the idea that it doesn&apos;t matter what the store owner is thinking; it can&apos;t, because then an actively malevolent store owner can hide behind that excuse.

I don&apos;t think anyone here seriously believes tall men who own stores are rubbing their hands together and saying &quot;Let&apos;s see how we can make life more miserable for those goddamn shrimpy women! Oh, I hate them so!&quot;* It&apos;s just that a bullet in the head is a bullet in the head, whether it was a stray shot or an act of deliberate malice. Yes, the LAW needs to differentiate those cases, but it doesn&apos;t matter at all to the victim.

*If I&apos;m mistaken about this...I will join you in pointing and laughing at anyone who does believe that.

Also: I don&apos;t think anyone built fighter jets to discriminate against women, either. I think there was an existing policy of discrimination against women in the USAF, and that led to the jet designers designing cockpits to the sizes of their likely users, all of whom (they quite reasonably believed) would be tallish men.

Then, of course, that gives the USAF an excuse to keep women out of the cockpits. &quot;They&apos;re just not tall enough!&quot; &quot;We&apos;d have to redesign our cockpits!&quot;

But in both cases, it is the USAF who is discriminating against women, not the cockpit designer.

Going back to shoes:

 #594 ::: Faren Miller ::: (view all by) ::: September 05, 2007, 09:59 AM: 

[snip]

 Any other fellow-sufferers out there with wide but not very large feet? Over-tight shoes can be a health hazard, so I&apos;m still using a lot of old canvas ones (in nice colors) that I can&apos;t seem to replace. 

Count me as one. Short wide feet with high arches and high insteps. I also have a weak ankle and an aversion to pain that keep me out of heels (mostly). I&apos;ve never had a pair of shoes that were too wide. My mom had a pair of New Balance sextuple E shoes that I didn&apos;t steal. Though I was tempted. They didn&apos;t feel too wide, though.

There was a period when I went looking for men&apos;s/boy&apos;s athletic shoes, on the theory that male shoes actually seemed to be designed with actual human feet in mind. My feet are smaller than the smallest men&apos;s shoes, I was told, and when I asked to see the boy&apos;s shoes, was told they didn&apos;t get that big, leading me to theorize that if you&apos;re male, a)your feet magically skip over the size mine are/were or b)you wear girl&apos;s/women&apos;s shoes while you&apos;re in that awkward size. I find a) to be marginally more believable.

American shoe manufacturers seem to feel that if your feet are short, they&apos;re also narrow, and the converse. This means my stepmother also has trouble finding shoes to fit, as she has long, narrow feet.

Me, I live in Birkenstocks, a pair of Mephistos, and New Balances.

V Carlson @ 651, my son&apos;s feet did, indeed jump from the largest boy&apos;s size to a men&apos;s size nine, and then grew to their current size 11 1/2 in about eight months. It was an expensive time of life.

I am in possession of feet which are wide and flat in the metatarsal arch and with a high instep, and generally unsatisfactory for most of the purposes to which one would like to put one&apos;s feet. Always have been, although now that I&apos;m a diabetic in my fifties it sucks even more than it did when I was a seventh grader wearing orthopedic saddle shoes. Shoes made for bad feet are not made for my lifestyle and budget, so I troll Nordstrom&apos;s Rack for wide women&apos;s shoes and Famous Footwear for men&apos;s shoes to workin (I got a pair of Steve Madden driving boots for five bucks at FF, and they&apos;re good for everything except mud and hot weather).

If I were rich I&apos;d have someone make me two pairs of twelve-eyelet logger&apos;s boots, without the caulks, one for work and a spiffier pair for town, but as it is I keep spending three times as much time and twice as much money shopping for so-so shoes.

 Bush knew Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction 

By Sidney Blumenthal

&quot;Sept. 6, 2007 | On Sept. 18, 2002, CIA director George Tenet briefed President Bush in the Oval Office on top-secret intelligence that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, according to two former senior CIA officers. Bush dismissed as worthless this information from the Iraqi foreign minister, a member of Saddam&apos;s inner circle, although it turned out to be accurate in every detail. Tenet never brought it up again.

Nor was the intelligence included in the National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002, which stated categorically that Iraq possessed WMD. No one in Congress was aware of the secret intelligence that Saddam had no WMD as the House of Representatives and the Senate voted, a week after the submission of the NIE, on the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq. The information, moreover, was not circulated within the CIA among those agents involved in operations to prove whether Saddam had WMD.&quot;

 Would you object to calling that second one &quot;passive discrimination&quot;—&apos;passive&apos; indicating a failure to act? 

Yes, because discrimination means:

to interact with an individual on a basis other than individual merit

Failing to act resulting in discrimination is different than acting in a centrist way that others see as discrimination. Acting in a centrist way means that you think you&apos;re interacting with everyone based on merit, but somewhere you assumed that everyone is similar to you in some way. And here&apos;s the thing for me: as a life coach, these sorts of assumptions come up all the time, with everyone, everywhere, relating to anyone. It is a part of being human. It&apos;s one of the things that makes even a simple one-on-one relationship maddeningly difficult. Therefore I think intent must be taken into account when looking at a situation.

Yes, if you allow rules such as &quot;dress codes&quot;, then places like the bar you mention can game the rules to keep out minorities. But that does not mean that the rules must ignore any distinction that can be gamed by trolls, because you&apos;d have no rules and simply judgement calls.

I never said it would be easy or clear cut. And I know it is a concept that can be gamed by bigots. But I also believe that someone who truly does not intend to discriminate should not be held to the same account as those who do intend to discriminate.

If you or anyone else thinks that intention should not be part of the equation, that the only thing that matters is the practical effects of a behaviour, than that&apos;s one thing. If you think intention makes a difference, then it should not be thrown out simply because someone can misuse it and game the rule.

However, I do know that if intention matters, then it is imperitive that the distinction be made between intended discrimination and unintentional centrism. And that if intention is to be ascertained from a particular situation or whether someone is gaming the rules, then that&apos;s a decision that can only be made by those not predisposed to a biased decision.

Xopher @ 649: &quot;I think the fundamental difference is that you think it matters what the store owner was thinking, and some others in this conversation do not.&quot; 

I think it depends on which aspect of discrimination you think is more important. Is discrimination primarily something that people do, or something that is done to people? If the former, then intent matters enormously. If the latter, then intent doesn’t matter at all: the effects are the same.

I’ve found, in my journeys through these vast and untamed ‘nets, that people tend to see discrimination through the prism of their own experience of it (or lack thereof). Those who are in the (potentially) discriminating class tend to see discrimination as something that people do. People in the discriminated-against class, in contrast, tend to see it as something that is done to people: specifically, them. They tend to be much less interested in the why of it. It’s equally inconvenient (or horrible) either way.

I can see the merits of both views. I agree that there is a very important difference between intentional discrimination and unintentional discrimination. The thing is, though, they’re both still discrimination . You don’t get to define unintentional discrimination away. Discrimination is defined as &quot;Treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit.&quot; It doesn&apos;t say anything about intentionality.

Heresiarch@663: Discrimination is defined as &quot;Treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit.&quot; It doesn&apos;t say anything about intentionality. 

To discriminate means to judge, to percieve some difference, to distinguish from, all of which require the person to make an active judgement that a difference other than merit exists and treat the person based on that non-merit way.

If judgement is no longer required to discriminate, if any behaviour that fails to interact with a statistical distribution of the local population is deemed discrimination, then merit, once again, has been rendered moot. Because merit will always be overridden by population statistics.

If some measure of merit is deemed neccessary for joining my group, but my group&apos;s statistical distrubution fails to match the local population by having 50% women and 50% men and W% white and B% black and so on, then by redefining &quot;discrimination&quot; to mean any interation that fails to follow the local population distribution qualifies as discrimination. By removing intent, you&apos;ve just set the requirement that every organization have a distribution exactly matching the local population or someone must shout discrimination.

No. That&apos;s not what the word means. Judgement, discerning, observing some difference, distinguishing some feature, finding out something about a person other than merit and then relating to that person based on that non-merit status is discrimination.

If you remove the judgement, the intent of the observer, then you have completely redefined the word into something else entirely.

You have just nailed the reason this conversation is diverging. Beautifully done. Rereading the previous comments, you really can see who is identifying with whom in the hypothetical transaction of shopkeeper and customer.

My view is that, even if you are in the fortunate group who can identify with the shopkeeper, basic empathy suggests that you try to see the world from the customer&apos;s view, rather than just telling him/her that it isn&apos;t really discrimination because it wasn&apos;t intended (subtext: so suck it up).

 If some measure of merit is deemed neccessary for joining my group, but my group&apos;s statistical distrubution fails to match the local population by having 50% women and 50% men and W% white and B% black and so on, then by redefining &quot;discrimination&quot; to mean any interation that fails to follow the local population distribution qualifies as discrimination. By removing intent, you&apos;ve just set the requirement that every organization have a distribution exactly matching the local population or someone must shout discrimination. 

Yes, but...
 Never believe in a meritocracy in which no one is funny-looking. 

So very often these merit-based selections &quot;just happen&quot; to end up with nothing but tall white men in them. Straight ones. With good teeth. After a while, the notion that this is a coincidence loses plausibility.

I think Cory Doctorow has made a small slip in his Particled Article on the impossibility of DRM.

He makes mention of the fact that the cipher system dioesn&apos;t need to be a secret. The security in in the key. And then he refers to Alan Turing and Enigma.

I&apos;m going on slightly hazy memory of Kahn&apos;s The Codebreakers : it&apos;s certainly an American cryptographer of the WW1 era, who published. I&apos;m not sure if it was Yardley or Friedman, but William Friedman sounds the better fit of the two.

I suspect that this process, where your standards of training and equipment and procedure are built on the assumption of only men (or only large men) doing some job, is pretty common. For example, when you design equipment for some job, you might determine how much weight you can put on a person&apos;s back based on the current population of all large men doing the job. Even if that was a pretty arbitrary decision, it now turns out that hardly any women can do the job, because they mostly can&apos;t carry that much weight on their backs. Or if you designed fighter cockpits starting from the assumption that only women would fly them, you would probably do the opposite--any guy above about 5&apos;10&quot; would just not fit in the cockpit.

Now, sometimes, requirements of a job are genuinely related to the job--it&apos;s nice if the fireman can actually carry an injured adult man over his shoulder, for example. But a lot of times, the strength or size requirements seem like they&apos;re just &quot;this is what all the people we tried this equipment on could do.&quot;

FWIW, most big-chain grocery stores in the US do scarily minute analysis of shelf placement as it relates to sales. That&apos;s why, for instance, there&apos;s so much candy and junk at kneee level just by the checkout, where you have to stand in line with the kids (I worked at one of the companies that does this analysis, so this isn&apos;t just paranoid speculation, honest!). It&apos;s also why the soup isn&apos;t alphabetized, because it turns out you buy less of it, if the kind you want is easy to find.

So it&apos;s possible that the height assumptions in the stores are based on putting the stuff they want to sell the most* at arm level for the average shoppers, and the stuff that they don&apos;t care about selling goes where it&apos;s hardest to reach. That still doesn&apos;t make it any more convenient to be shorter than average and trying to reach something that&apos;s less popular than, for instance, wonder bread. But the motives that create that situation may be less discriminatory, and yet more sinister, than they appear.

*and yes, manufacturers can pay for better placement.

The thing is, meritocracies can be full of funny looking people, but usually they&apos;re not a reflection of the surrounding population in sex and ethnicity terms. Mathematical fields tend to be overwhelmingly male, and overwhelmingly white/East Asian/South Asian, and the whites are often Jewish. That&apos;s a meritocracy, but it lends itself to charges of discrimination, and demanding serious math talent probably has a different impact on different groups. In my own field (cryptography), this is the reality you see at every conference and workshop.

I think a broader form of Teresa&apos;s law is that meritocracies seldom reflect an ethnic and sex distribution that is ideal for the political or social goals of the organization. Even if you live somewhere/when where &quot;everyone knows&quot; that only white men can be programmers, a meritocracy will give you some women and some brown/black programmers. Even if you live somewhere/when where &quot;everyone knows&quot; that everyone has the same ability to be programmers, you&apos;ll probably end up with more men than women, and a skewed ethnic distribution. (Or maybe this will change in the future, but if so, it probably still won&apos;t change to exactly reflect America.)

And this implies that demanding a politically or socially acceptable set of outcomes (making the meritocracy only white males, only Protestants, making it &quot;reflect America&quot;, requiring political balance between liberals and conservatives, etc.) will break a meritocracy.

I can see a couple different threads of discussion here:

a. There&apos;s a moral meaning to the term &quot;discrimination&quot; in this context, and it&apos;s negative. The implication there is drawing a parallel between &quot;back of the bus, uncle&quot; and shelving some stuff in a location that&apos;s inconvenient for a lot of short women. Maybe that&apos;s not the implication anyone should take, but it&apos;s certainly the sense I get from a lot of this discussion.

b. There&apos;s an implied legal/political meaning, in the sense that we outlaw a lot of overt discrimination. So it seems like we&apos;re also at least potentially talking about something someone should be subject to lawsuit for.

c. The specific stuff being complained about seems to me to mostly be about dumb or thoughtless design. Not always, but I think that&apos;s usually the case. Turning dumb or thoughtless into grounds for either moral condemnation or legal action seems like it&apos;s very seldom going to lead to anything good. That is, both the implications of (a) and (b) strike me as being pretty bad ways to address the set of problems we&apos;re talking about.

Greg 659: The space capsules were cramped, so height was a luxury we could not afford. Was that discrimination? Or merit? 

You&apos;re using &apos;merit&apos; as a term-of-art, and I don&apos;t understand your definition of it. Could you clarify?

If merit is what I think it is (a person&apos;s demonstrated worth, including education, talent, and experience), then under your definition of discrimination that example would qualify. But not, note, by my definition, where despite being meritorious, a 6-foot man can be excluded from that capsule for a reason that really is relevant to the transaction.

It&apos;s no more discrimination than &quot;You must be this tall to ride this ride.&quot; There are legitimate reasons in both circumstances to place upper or lower bounds on suitable height.

Women are automatically disqualified as sperm donors. They may be just as good at what they do as men (i.e. their merit is equal), but they can&apos;t do that job. That&apos;s not discrimination under my definition. But it would be under yours, mod the term-of-art definition of &apos;merit&apos;, which is why I&apos;m sure you&apos;re using one.

IMO, at least as interesting a question is how you determine which potentially relevant criteria for hiring or other transactions are allowed to be taken into account. This often seems to involve a tradeoff between somewhat relevant criteria and impact on some minority group, and it looks like the kind of decision that&apos;s just hard for almost anyone to do a good job with.

Frex, is a felony record relevant for some random job? Note that blacks have much higher rates of felony records than whites, and men have much higher rates than women. Most employers would probably prefer not to have felons working behind their cash registers, or watching their kids, or helping close up the store at night, for good reasons. And yet this has a different impact on different groups. It&apos;s hard for me to imagine that there&apos;s a good imposed-from-above way to make this tradeoff, though if this becomes a matter of law, it will be decided in Congress or in a courtroom somewhere and imposed on people far away from the decisionmakers.

All kinds of similar things exist: Height, strength, IQ, grades in school, work history, people skills, thickness of accent, etc. These things aren&apos;t distributed evenly across the world, and they have some relevance for many jobs, and can also be used as ways to discriminate. (Are you rejecting applicants with thick accents to keep hispanics out, or because you need your receptionist to be understood easily?) In the extreme case of this, you get gerrymandered job descriptions written for a specific person. On the other extreme end, you get bottom tier jobs where all that&apos;s wanted is a warm body that will show up and do what they&apos;re told. And to tangle up the mix, you get cases where the law *requires* certain kinds of irrational discrimination (requiring legal documentation to work, Federal jobs with veterans&apos; preferences, some kinds of affirmative action, citizenship requirements for some jobs, credential or licensing requirements whose purpose is to protect some group from competition).

 Failing to act resulting in discrimination is different than acting in a centrist way that others see as discrimination. Acting in a centrist way 

Just what do you mean by &quot;centrist way&quot;? The height average in the USA for all persons is below 5&apos;6&quot; tall (remember that there are small children and they are a significant fraction of the population...) &quot;just like me&quot; for height, unless that height is the average for the entire country, and the person is -female- (more than half the population is female, and since gender tends to be quantized, it quantizes to &quot;female&quot;) therefore the &quot;average&quot; person is woman, and going to be a short woman, averaging in children as &quot;people.&quot; So, if being &quot;centrist&quot; in height, means going to -the center- for the USA average for height over all the people in the country, that six foot male most definitely is NOT &quot;centrist&quot; acting as though everyone else is the size of that six foot male with the same vision instantaneous field of view and reach and general footprint.

 means that you think you&apos;re interacting with everyone based on merit, but somewhere you assumed that everyone is similar to you in some way. And here&apos;s the thing for me: as a life coach,
these sorts of assumptions come up all the time, with everyone, everywhere, relating to anyone. It is a part of being human. It&apos;s one of the things that makes even a simple one-on-one relationship maddeningly difficult. Therefore I think intent must be taken into account when looking at a situation. 

Seems to me that you&apos;re taking your own sets of biases as universal... there are people out there who when they design things, do consciously think of people other than themselves. E.g., at Noreascon IV one of the things done before the convention started, was sending someone around in a wheelchair to check for accessibility, even though nobody on the committee was wheelchair-bound.

As regards astronauts and Mercury, the reality of spaceflight is that the larger one makes a space vehicle, the more expensive and the greater the difficulties involved for building the launch system. Making the Mercury capsules larger would have required a lot more effort and expense for e.g. the rockets to be more powerful--bigger means heavier, heavier means bigger boosters and engines, which gets more expensive, and since the volume increase makes a mass increase that&apos;s faster than linear, the expenses and effort go up faster than linear....

The basic decisions come down to &quot;who get accommodated?&quot; Most of the time that decision is not a conscious one--that&apos;s one of my main points, that it is discriminatory to not even bothering thinking about that very basic decision! The default isn&apos;t always the unvoiced unconsidered value &quot;everyone else is like me&quot; -- very often people who are short arrange things the way they&apos;re acclimatized to things being and that way is the way that&apos;s most efficacious for taller people!, or someone who&apos;s quite tall will arrange things, again, in the way the person is accustomed to that&apos;s most comfortable for people of a more average, and lower, height.

Years ago on a TV game show, a baseball player with a Polish surname deliberately spelled his name incorrectly in response to the host requesting the game show contestants spell his last name--he did that so that it would be more likely to match what the non-celebrity contestants would write down. One of them spelled it correctly, another spelling it incorrestly the way the player deliberately spelled it wrong (that being the most common way that people tended to spell it incorrectly).

My point with that anecdote was that the baseball player was very deliberately doing something to accommodate other people without anyone telling him he should consider anyone else.

When someone is automatically and seemingly arbitrarily left out of accessibility/consideration, that&apos;s discriminatory. There are situations where the cutoff is a deliberate one--weight and size and health limits for riding roller coasters because there are points at which trying to accommodate everyone would make the roller coaster uneconomic to build and operate and/or cause it to cease being a roller coaster--remove the height and speed and it&apos;s no longer presents a life threat to people with e.g. cardiac trouble, but then it&apos;s not a roller coaster anymore, either.

Another question is, &quot;what are reasonables levels of accommodation and reasonable levels of limits?&quot; Blocking someone for something based on purely cosmetic issues that don&apos;t involve &quot;take off the makeup/take a bath/wear a hairnet-so-you-hair-will-not-go-in-the-food/wear gloves for food preparation/wear-some-other-color-that-won&apos;t-upset-the-animals/etc., is usually arbitrary and exclusionary--skin color, natural hair color, etc. and blocking based on gender when it doesn&apos;t involve sperm donor or egg donation is usually arbitrary. Defining jobs so that no one of a particular religion finds the employment conditions reasonable, usually is intentionally discriminating against people of that religion... until the repeal of Blue Laws, it was very rare for businesses to be open on Christmas and Easter, meaning that Christians of the varieties celebrating Christmas and Easter on those days of business cessation got their holy days off, but people of other religions didn&apos;t (Christians of other branches got Easter off as it&apos;s on a Sunday, but not their Christmas...] Few businesses give time off to Jews for Jewish holy days, or non-Judaeo-Christians their holy days off.... and most organizations don&apos;t bother to even consider them when scheduling events, and that gets EXTREMELY irritating.

The point is that to discriminate means to judge, to percieve some difference, to distinguish from, all of which require the person to make an active judgement that a difference other than merit exists and treat the person based on that non-merit way.

There is no discrimination if the person accused of the deed did not discern of any differences. It&apos;s not even passive discrimination. It is something else, the best term I&apos;ve heard so far is centrism, which essentially means to assume everyone is like you are, which exactly reflects a lack of discernment.

The only way to passively discriminate is to know of a difference and do nothing to fix it. If someone doesn&apos;t know, it isn&apos;t discrimination.

Yes, for gawds sake, it can be gamed. You can find groups with no funny looking people.

That does not mean you alter the definition of discrimination to get rid of whether or not the person observed a difference and intended to act on it.

You do NOT charge everyone who kills someone else with murder in the first degree. A car accident that kills someone has a different intent. A response that occurs in self defense has a different intent. A killing that was thought out and planned has the intent of murder one.

And, hey! look at that! people who planned a murder end up being convicted of murder in teh second degree because the police can&apos;t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was murder one.

That is not an excuse to get rid of the different intentions behind murder to make sure the cold blooded killers don&apos;t go free.

If you think you&apos;re going to come up with a measure of discrimination that does not involve the observation and intent of the accused, then you&apos;ve done nothing but lump everyone into the equivalent of a &quot;murder one&quot; charge.

YOu can keep arguing about all the baddies that will slip through the system. And I refuse to endorse an approach that does the equivalent of putting self defense in with murder one. If you insist, then I think we both understand the other&apos;s positions, and we&apos;ll just have to agree to disagree.

I think that for some, it is a case of the victims determining the punishment, acting as judge, and jury. Those who have shoved in my face the fact that they&apos;ve been discriminated against, are probably the equivalent of someone who has had a family member killed by violence, and now lobby for the death penalty for all killers. I&apos;m not trying to minimize your experience, but I won&apos;t go along with something that&apos;s clearly wrong just because you&apos;ve been wronged.

Paula, the words that keep showing up in all those definitions are to judge, to percieve a difference, to distinguish, to make a distinction. All of those require the person to observe a difference, to perceive it and act on it.

You are not discriminating if you blindly reach into a bin of cherries and grab what you can grab, even if it turns out you pulled nothing but tall, male, cherries. You did not observe, so you did not discriminate. You assumed all the cherries were the same.

If you decided that cherries with stems tasted better (and lets assume that taste is independent of stems), then you are observing a difference from one cherry to the other, discerning the one with stems from the ones without, and discriminating between them on some non-meritous measure.

 Being overlooked/ignored/pretended to not exist/etc., is rarely an issue of merit, and more usually is more of an issue of bigotry, 

Since you are able to determine a priori the motivations of an individual accused of discrimination before you&apos;ve actually seen the evidence, I will assume you are prejudiced in these sorts of cases. You are biased. Prior to evidence, you already have a determination of guilt.

Worse than that, you are angry about it. So, clearly, you are unpersuadable. Therefore I will stop trying to persuade. If you continue making biased and prejudiced statements, however, I may point them out.

Mark Liberman of Language Log notes that an actual recent poll ( pdf file ) puts the number of &quot;young Americans&quot;[1] who cannot find the US on a world map at 6%, not 20%; he suggests that the 20% figure is something of an urban legend, and speculates about some possible origins. From the report summarizing the poll:
 Nearly all (94%) young Americans can find the United States on the world map, and Canada
(92%) and Mexico (88%) are nearly as familiar. Wide majorities can find bordering bodies of
water including the Pacific Ocean (79%) and the Gulf of Mexico (75%). 

Of course, there are some less than encouraging results in that poll; e.g., only 50% can find the state of New York on a map, and 63% can&apos;t find Iraq.

Sorry if I wasn&apos;t clear: Cory attached Alan Turing&apos;s name to the idea that you didn&apos;t need to keep the mechanism of a cryptographis system a secret. I&apos;m pretty sure that this goes back to Friedman (who broke a book cipher without needing to discover the book used).

This might have been sloppy phrasing. And the Bletchley Park team were certainly helped by knowing the details of the machines. And that still fits with the general tenet: if you want people to be able to view digital media, you have to let them know how to decode it.

Mary Dell (583) said, &quot;I know a few men who seem to have body dysmorphia, but instead of looking in the mirror and seeing a fatter person, they see a taller person.&quot; 

First, I think the word you want is &quot;anamorphia&quot;. &quot;Dysmorphia&quot; is a faulty shape (and &quot;body dysmorphia&quot; refers to preoccupation with perceived body faults) but, hey, I&apos;m just playing erudite.

At 182cm, I&apos;ve never known whether to call myself six feet (exaggeration), five eleven (incorrect rounding), five eleven and a half (do I sound preoccupied?), or five eleven and five eighths (quick, where&apos;s the DSM?). I also don&apos;t usually think of myself as tall, because I know tall guys: they&apos;re the guys who are taller than me. On the other hand, I usually think of guys shorter than me as average height, down to about four feet, though sometimes I notice guys with short guy syndrome, a particularly offensive form of internalized body dysmorphia.

I can see this developing into a &quot;when I was a lad&quot; thread.

My brother works in education statistics, and a large part of his job is keeping the grades for British A-level exams consistent. He&apos;s one of the few John F. Bells you&apos;ll find on Google. In one case, a pubished paper, the exam syllabus had been unchanged for some twenty years, and some old exam scripts turned up. So they were able to check the marking in the same way as they did for the current exam work.

In Britain, at least, the general better exam results in A-levels are an improvement in the students&apos; work, not a fall in exam standards.

I think there&apos;s something brewing: he was bending my ear about a few things this last weekend, including what he sees as the poor teaching when we were at school. He reckons we could both have passed the old Oxbridge extrance exams, because they were designed to look past knowledge to see how you attacked a problem.

Personally, I think the David Bell of 1976 wasn&apos;t quite the David Bell who blazed across the firmament of fandom in the late Eighties.

Most of the rest of what he said seemed to be based on the idea that the Universities aren&apos;t doing a good job of managing their exam standards. The numbers getting the highest pass grades are small enough that the year-on-year variations are suspiciously small.

I don&apos;t share my brothers ability with math, but we do have a slide-rule inculated* talent for making rough arithmetic approximations.

(I confess I am bidding on eBay for a slide rule like the ones we used at school. Anyone know how to clean ballpoint pen ink off plastic. It could well be a Crimble pressie. &quot;In cas of emergency, break glass.&quot;)

*But not according to the top definition that pops out of Google: something called the Urban Dictionary which purports** to be a dictionary of slang. For that word to have acquired that meaning feels a trifle odd.

The point about the mechanism of a cryptosystem not needing to be a secret is, in any case, implicit in how cryptanalysis works.

Consider a monoalphabetic cipher: One plaintext letter is always represented by the same ciphertext letter. You have devised a way of generating the cipher alphabet from a keyword. Perhaps you use the keyword to control a series of letter-swaps.

But the basic mechanism used to break the cipher--freqency analysis--completely bypasses that complexity. The Dancing Men cipher that Watson describes Holmes as solving has no remnant of alphabetical order in the cipher alphabet.

More generally, whatever complexity is used to generate a repeated pattern, cryptanalysis homes in on the repetition.

If anything, Cory misses the point that DRM has to supply both the mechanism and the key to the intended reader. The secrets, whether necessarily secret or not, can never be truly secret.

Instead of trying to capture a U-boat intact, all one needs to do is buy a DVD player.

#706 Dave Bell:

The idea that the cipher&apos;s strength should not depend on the secrecy of the cipher is usually called Kerchoff&apos;s principle. For any heavily-used cryptosystem, it&apos;s hard to keep at least a few samples from being captured by an enemy. This really amounts to the idea that you should be able to separate the secret part of the cipher (the key) from the part that you assume is known to the attacker (everything else).

It&apos;s possible to attack simple cryptographic systems without knowing the internals, just by looking at statistics. But there are an enormous number of different statistical flaws possible in a cryptosystem, and in order to know which ones to check, you need some idea of the underlying mechanism. For example, if I tell you this cipher is a stream cipher based on LFSRs, you can look for certain properties that are known to exist in various badly-designed LFSR-based stream ciphers. If I tell you this is a stream cipher based some RC4-like slowly evolving permutation thingy, you&apos;re going to want to look at very different properties. If I put together a moderately complicated cipher, it can be all but impossible to attack it just requesting plaintext and ciphertext for encryption/decryption, even if it&apos;s a cipher that can be trivially broken once you see the thing.

No, Greg, you are the one who keeps sticking the &quot;judge&quot; (verb form) in there. It&apos;s your biased definition, which I do not consider a legitimate sole definition.

You seem to be claiming that systematic exclusion of groups [via e.g. not bothering to think of/notice/care about their existence, and thereby since they are invisible that or those people&apos;s perceptions, they don&apos;t exist to bother noticing and factor into account in the first place) is NOT discrimination. I vehemently disagree.

It&apos;s, yet again, marginalization--I&apos;ve seen it done to women by women, such as when Barbara Newell was President of Wellesley College, and was quoted saying, &quot;Wellesley students and MIT men&quot; and claiming that women felt like they didn&apos;t belong at places like MIT... I wrote her a scathing letter saying noting that I was an MIT student and was incensed as being treated as though female MIT students did not exist. &quot;The only time that I feel I don&apos;t belong at MIT is when people like you refuse to acknowledge that I exist!&quot;

Since you don&apos;t seem to get defined to not exist in that fashion, your arguments on the subject ring extremely hypocrital to me. Yeah, sure, right, it&apos;s NOT discrimination. Bullshit to that.

In #683 I mentioned my bike accident. I didn&apos;t notice the date until after I posted it. That accident was six years ago today.

In #686, ethan claims that &quot;e&quot; is the vowel to end all vowels. . I don&apos;t think all vowels ends with what he thinks it does. If we get classical, though, &quot;litteraturæ semivocalæ&quot; ends with &quot;æ&quot;, which looks especially nice upside-down. Speaking of which, &quot;ethan&quot; spelled upside-down is &quot;ueyta&quot;, which not only ends with a vowel, it dang well do begin with un. (Please don&apos;t take my interest in upside-down spelling as some sort of disrespect. Consider my e-mail address).

Ethan also asks, seriously or not, Hey, does that lessen the number of clues needed? Uuu....

Xopher, #699:

I was responding to Greg&apos;s The point is that to discriminate means to judge, to percieve some difference, to distinguish from, all of which require the person to make an active judgement that a difference other than merit exists and treat the person based on that non-merit way. and then 690 Paula, the words that keep showing up in all those definitions are to judge, to percieve a difference, to distinguish, to make a distinction. All of those require the person to observe a difference, to perceive it and act on it. 

Since he was claiming definition precedence, I went to an on-line dictionary for definition--and then he CONTINUED to claim that there is judging involved in discriminating (and then asserting an analogy that I don&apos;t see any congruence to the issues with of someone reaching into a bowl and grabbing cherries.... if the issue is that there are red cherries and yellow cherries, and that grabbing a handful of cherries out of a bowl that has ONLY red cherries in it, and then claiming there is no discrimination against yellow cherries when not even looking to see if there are any yellow cherries in the bowl BEFORE grabbing....

That is, discrimation against someone UPSTREAM of the selection point, is STILL discrimination against!!! If someone can&apos;t get past the gate to the gate to the gate due to the first gatekeeper turning away all the girls, or all the people with dark skin, or all the people who are short, or all the people who are tall... it DOES NOT MATTER when the people two gates beyond use for selection criteria, there aren&apos;t going to be people who got eliminated at that first gate, to select from!


Or to use math terminology, the there&apos;s a biased pool. My whole point is that there is bias involved--the bias of ignoring/eliminating/discounting groups of people on the basis of height/gender/skin color at an early stage of down-selection, such that there CONTINUES to be a bias involved, regardless of what happens later, unless the pool to select from changes by opening up and remediating that initial injustice!

That gets back to assumptions written and unwritten. The Mercury 13 got eliminated purely because they were female, and it wasn&apos;t until the 1980s that a woman got launched into space by the USA.

There are lots of &quot;oppportunities&quot; restricted to people with specific credentials, with gotchas involved as regards the acquisition of those credentials. Elizabeth Moon has written in on-line forums about how male teachers refused to teach math to her and the other girls who were her schoolmates, meaning that anything that required math literacy as prerequisite, she and they were barred from thereafter.

Few women of her generation in math and science? With teachers like the one she had, it&apos;s no wonder... and even if she hadn&apos;t had a teacher who barred the gates against girls, she still would have faced misogyny among college faculty and admissions probably, and guidance counselors who pushed girls into nurturing and clerical and public school English and primary school teaching and away from careers as scientists, engineers, politicians, MDs, lawyers, etc.

Little things like &quot;where&apos;s the nearest bathroom?&quot; make a difference-one of the Aero and Astro buildings at MIT the nearest rest room market &quot;women&quot; was in another building, and not every floor was there access through! The Aero and Astro building adjacent to the building with no toilet facilities for women, in five above ground floors and one basement, had -two- women&apos;s restrooms.... Building 9, on the other side, had two or three, and was the building that one had to remember which floors one could get to to cross over from was it Building 33 or Building 35...

A bimbo is a bimbo is a bimbo, and I have never been a fan of any gender of such (the male ones are more difficult to identify, they tend to be in suits at tradeshows, e.g. the way one identifies a male booth bimbo is by asking a technical question about the product the male BB is supposed to be marketing. The male BB will then either start spouting a rote script with no cognizant technical content, or hem and haw, or otherwise respond in a way demonstrating that the BB is technically non-cognizant--sometimes one can see the virtual rattling braincell indicators with the person being completely clueless technically--there is a script of prepared responses, stop it and they will start it up again from the original start point as one response).

Actually both you and Cory are mistaken. The concept that the security of a cipher should rest on the keys instead of the encryption algorithm is called Kerckhoffs&apos; principle after the Dutch cryptologist Auguste Kerckhoff. It is one of the six principles of practical cipher design published in 1883:
 The system should be, if not theoretically unbreakable, unbreakable in practice. 
 The design of a system should not require secrecy and compromise of the system should not inconvenience the correspondents (Kerckhoffs&apos; principle). 
 The key should be memorable without notes and should be easily changeable. 
 The cryptograms should be transmittable by telegraph. 
 The apparatus or documents should be portable and operable by a single person 
 The system should be easy, neither requiring knowledge of a long list of rules nor involving mental strain. 
A century and a quarter later, they remain good rules.

I know I started it, but I propose a moratorium on writing upside down. Nobody&apos;s any good at it, even me (I&apos;ve just been proofing my stuff like mad, and hoping Xopher doesn&apos;t take exception to being called Xophe&apos; &apos;cause I can&apos;t do rs without dipping into the Hebrew block, and that stuff goes right-to-left and really weirds me out). And it seems like prolonged proofreading might cause motion sickness, without the motion. Worse, we might have some Light Maker drop a display on their head or something. That would create a great disturbance in the fluorosphere.

But I&apos;ll second Xopher&apos;s request for the good news. We could all use some. I just hope it&apos;s not the stuff about Jesus, which I&apos;ve already heard enough.

 If I&apos;d ever made it much beyond Boreal or 4:30 I&apos;d have dropped by Math Camp / your shows. 

You didn&apos;t miss much re my shows. Two of out three were cancelled, one due to a dust storm howling through the venue and one due to a comical series of misunderstandings (&quot;What is this stuff? I want chicks in here shaking their booty, not chilling to ambient music!&quot;). The third was hamstrung by my aforementioned stage fright issues and the guitarist&apos;s being (he claims literally) asleep on stage (it was 0345 on Saturday). Fortunately, burners are very nice, and nobody threw anything at us.

Math Camp was a big hit, though. We had standing room only at the lectures. I&apos;m not much of a mathematician, but I was able to contribute a &quot;proof of the day&quot; (Cantor&apos;s diagonalization proof of the uncountability of the real numbers).

 #749 ::: ethan ::: (view all by) ::: September 07, 2007, 03:07 AM : 

I&apos;ve been vague about my good news (which, no, is not that thing about Jesus), partly out of a weird vestige of superstition that tells me that if I talk too much about it it&apos;ll go away, and partly because it&apos;s complicated and long and non-chronological and, well, vague itself. But here goes.

Short version of the background: I&apos;ve been in a terrible terrible rut in the three years since I finished college. I&apos;ve been completely unproductive in terms of things I want to be doing, I wasted two years in a hellhole of a mind-sucking shit job, I got fired from the job I settled for after spending months looking for another one, and am about right now nearing the realm of severely having absolutely no money to live off of. Meanwhile, my beloved Providence feels like it&apos;s crumbling around me, neighborhoods and businesses I love devoured by condos, the public library deliberately mismanaged nearly into non-existence, all of my friends moving away one by one (and not being replaced by new friends, ever). All this, and for the life of me I couldn&apos;t think of a plan to make any of it better.

But then! Out of nowhere one of my closest, dearest friends, one of the few who still lives here, tells me she&apos;s moving to New York City in a few months to find better work (she&apos;s a graphic designer, primarily for the web), which depresses the hell out of me. But then it gets better: through a bizarre confluence of seemingly unrelated events and connections and so forth, she suddenly realizes she&apos;s shockingly well-positioned to go into business for herself and start her own firm. Like, really, shockingly well-positioned, to the point where it almost feels dream-like (this is the bit where I&apos;m scared talking about it will make it go away).

Anyway, upshot: she&apos;s going to hire me to do her copywriting and information architecture (which I&apos;ll be learning as I go) while simultaneously giving me as much freedom as I need to go to school for Library Science, which I&apos;ve wanted to do all along. So, blammo, I&apos;m not just getting out of my rut, I&apos;m moving out of it, to New York, to work for/with my friend, doing something I sincerely want to do. At the same time, I know it&apos;s dangerous to rely so heavily on her and her plans working out, but without even thinking hard a whole bunch of not-undesirable backup plans keep occurring to me. It&apos;s looking pretty solid, in other words, that I&apos;ll be able to move to and live happily in NYC. Moving there, by the way, has been seeming more and more appealing all the time recently anyway , because I have a pretty large network of friends and family there, and because, hell, I like it. I&apos;ll miss Providence, but I won&apos;t miss watching what I love about Providence disappearing.

But, for a variety of reasons, this all won&apos;t be happening until May at the soonest, and I have to live until then (which is what I was talking about here , pretty much). So I went to a temp agency today, not hoping for much, but, lo and behold, an hour after I walk in, I&apos;m starting Monday doing Library Science-related work in walking distance of my house for better pay than I&apos;d possibly expected from temp work. Not just that, but the order for this job came in to the temp agency while I was there . As in, had I come any other time I probably wouldn&apos;t have gotten it.

So. Kind of diffuse, kind of complicated, kind of vague. But it&apos;s all making me deliriously happier than I&apos;ve been.

My feeling was that Cory Doctorow meant WWII and Bletchley Park was the end of efforts to keep a cipher safe through secrecy, not that it was the very first time anyone realized it was a bad idea. Breaking Enigma (and Shark) was so big and dramatic that afterwards it was impossible for anyone to pretend that secrecy could substitute for a well-tested cipher.

 WWII and Bletchley Park was the end of efforts to keep a cipher safe through secrecy 

From the perspective of mathematicians and professional cryptographers, perhaps. I can attest from personal knowledge that considerable efforts continued to be expended by governments, especially including the US, to keep their cryptosystems&apos; designs secret for at least the next 25 years after Enigma. I would be somewhat surprised if thia has changed even now.

Newell was being from my perspective, a complete hypocrite--she was giving an interview that included status-of-women-look-how-wonderful-Wellesley-is-and-there-is-this-exchange-program-between-MIT-and-Wellesley, and talked as if MIT were an all-male institution with no female students and without there ever having been female students, despite Ellen Swallow Richards&apos;, who had been the first female MIT student and graduate, existence being prominently featured on a relatively large bronze plaque in Building 4 on the entry area wall opposite a set of large doors opening onto the Killian Court. I don&apos;t remember the graduating class year she was in, but it was no later than the early 1920s, and MIT has had female students ever since.

Talking about promoting the lot of women in math and science and engineering and talking about the status of women in them, when one is from an elite female liberal arts school with a schizophrenic reputation--one part of it being being in the forefront of women&apos;s and family and social studies, another part being as a school which generates female professionals including scientists (not engineers however) (I don&apos;t remember if Wellesley is a graduate degree granting institution or not), and then there are the women there who are the equivalent of Harvard&apos;s legacy students, who are NOT there for anything inherently academic, they&apos;re they either because they were forced to it by the family and they want to not be there, or they&apos;re after an Mrs degree to attach to someone who&apos;d going to get a Harvard degree and the social status and economic position that often accrues to men with Harvard degrees. That is, there is a strong strain of traditionalism at Wellesley, which any woman at MIT in the 1970s and earlier had had to buck and fight simply to get past the society deterrents to girls aspiring to go to places like MIT. By the time someone female got to MIT, she tended to be extremely radicalized as regards &quot;traditional&quot; roles and models and lifepaths for women, and highly resentful of the restrictions and constraints society prescribed for women, due to years of barraging with crap about being freaks for being female and overtly interested in and competent in and wanting to professionally be in math/science/engineering instead of being e.g. a Southern Belle and aspiring to a life involved in any or several of nurturing/caretaking/homemaking/clerical work/secretarial work/nursing/fine-non-commercial-arts/noncommercial crafts/volunteer ladylike pursuits.

Basically, Ms Newell had a view of women and academia in which the women at MIT despite the fact that we existed and had existed for decades, were nonexistent and not worthy of acknowledging the existence of. She wasn&apos;t reaching out to us, she was dismissing us entirely as existing, even though she was supposed to be promoting women. Talk about hypocrisy and marginalization.... She was talking about women at MIT as not existing, totally slightug the women who were at MIT, as if we, again, were completely nonexistent. Reality check failure, spectacularly to me, and offensively.

[and as regards not wanting to talk about and celebrate something prematurely--there is nothing worse than having one&apos;s hopes and aspirations raised and then having them crushed and blighted instead... that&apos;s what e.g. led to the Russian Revolution, unmet expectations and the Tsar&apos;s troops firing on civilians who had not to that point been anti-Tsar: it radicalized and tempered Stalin, Lenin, and Trotsky, and literally the rest is history. The same is true generally for revolutions--people who had expectations of rising up to higher social/political/economic status who discovered they were blocked under the existing system, that all their expectation would come to nothing, unless they overthrew the existing order and reorganized to a system where they no longer were blocked from rising in power/financial status/social status.

NSA (and presumably other governments) try to keep their cipher designs secret, but I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t assume that secrecy when doing their own security analysis of ciphers internally.

A bunch of snake-oil ciphers are kept secret, for security-by-obscurity reasons.

RSA kept RC4 secret (as a trade secret) for many years before it was leaked. They had done some analysis internally, and had the resources to do a decent job of it, but they didn&apos;t have the kind of resources of the whole crypto community.

People sometimes keep algorithms secret to make interoperability hard--some DRM schemes have done this, though it seems like this is not so common anymore. The Clipper scheme used a classified algorithm, Skipjack, which was later declassified after Clipper seemed like an obvious failure. Probably one reason for this was to make sure that you had to use key escrow to get the benefit of the NSA-designed algorithm.

The cellphone industry kept a bunch of its encryption/key derivation/hashing algorithms secret. Partly, this was probably security by obscurity, but they also didn&apos;t want it to be obvious how terribly weak their crypto was.

DES was public, but the design behind making it resistent to differential cryptanalysis was kept secret.

And the Germans believed Enigma would be unbreakable even by someone who knew the details of how a machine worked. Bletchley was about keeping secret that that wasn&apos;t true.
The question is, had they invited public cryptanalysis of Enigma, would they have strengthened the design as a result, or would they merely have given the Allies a better start at breaking it.

Financially, I&apos;m in a position where I&apos;d have to get another full-time job (or a very lucrative part-time job) for at least a couple of years to make ends meet on retirement pay.

But the idea that I could submit retirement papers and tell my bosses they won&apos;t have me to kick around anymore is... nice.

And tempting. Even if I have to work 40 hours a week after retirement, that would still save me ten to twenty hours a week over my current situation of forced overtime and cancelled days off.

The motivation for the secrecy clearly had nothing to do with the safety of the cryptosystem. During the time I worked in that area, and was constantly being warned of the terrible danger to the Free World if I let slip a single detail of the systems I worked with, I read an article in an unclassified and not all obscure technical journal that described how to break the ciphers I used without any knowledge of the internal design, merely knowing in general what kind of algorithm generated the keystream (there were only a few obvious choices at the time) and having access to sufficient encrypted stream and some knowledge of the protocols (not the precise content) of the cleartext. All of these were readily available to anybody who care to know about them, or could make intelligent guesses.

And I can totally understand why this would make you upset, since you were both dealing with all the BS discrimination against women that was endemic in engineering/scientific academia and having your efforts demeaned to the point of nonexistence.

I have to admit that I was startled when you wrote that you &apos;never felt like you didn&apos;t belong&apos; at MIT; while I don&apos;t doubt that you were/are a remarkable person for having ended up there, I would have been astonished if you never felt discriminated against or marginalized.

My own late 70s story is truly weird, now I think back on it. I decided that I really needed to go back to school and get a computer science degree, since a major in history had qualified me to sell paint and hardware for roughly 10% above minimum wage.

So I toddle off and re-enroll as a special student, for the introductory course. And things are going along, and suddenly the halls are papered with announcements for the brand new &quot;Women in Computer Science&quot; program. Fine, says I, I don&apos;t ordinarily go in for the support group thing, but maybe this time it would be a Good Thing, particularly since I don&apos;t see any other women in the class, and perhaps a little mentoring would come in useful a couple years down the pike when it comes interview time.

So I go and find the advisor for this program, who happens to be a woman who is chairman of the department, only to be told that I&apos;m too old, already too well-entrenched, and, in fact, get this, *too damn over-qualified* for the program.

 The question is, had they invited public cryptanalysis of Enigma, would they have strengthened the design as a result, or would they merely have given the Allies a better start at breaking it. 

One of the biggest flaws that BP exploited was the fact that Enigma never enciphered something as itself - plaintext L was never cipher L. This was spotted fairly early on by the Poles, IIRC, and conceivably would have been rectified if the Germans had known about it early enough.

To be honest, though, the Germans were on their way to making it effectively unbreakable - in late &apos;44/early &apos;45 they were starting to issue each individual U-boat with its own key. This would probably have made Enigma secure against even a vastly enlarged BP, since there just wouldn&apos;t have been enough traffic in a single key for an analysis to succeed. (Prior to that, all the subs in the Atlantic used the same key settings, changed every month.)

But it&apos;s easy to overestimate BP. Don&apos;t forget that, for most of 1942, for example, BP was blacked out of the Atlantic net, and thus didn&apos;t have any impact on the convoy war at all. Better weaponry, better tactics and other intelligence like HF/DF would have won the Battle of the Atlantic without BP - not to mention the material advantage of the US shipbuilding industry. It might just have taken longer.

I should add, of course, that Enigma was a commercially available system. While you couldn&apos;t have bought a set of Kriegsmarine rotors on the open market, and the plugboard was also a Wehrmacht invention, the basic machine wasn&apos;t secret - the principles of its operation, including the never-enciphers-as-self flaw, were open to examination. It&apos;s just nobody did. There wasn&apos;t a big crypto culture then, and Enigma wasn&apos;t a commercial success - it was expensive, heavy and complex.

OK, I have to brag about this somewhere, and you guys are the only ones who will be as amused by it as I was.

Background: Last weekend was my friend Dave&apos;s birthday. His wife asked me to run a roleplaying game one-shot, since he hardly ever gets to play (as opposed to gamemaster) any more.

I chose a medieval (gonzo-medieval, not RMA) background, where none of the player characters had ever been out of the town they were born in, were totally illiterate peasants etc. The only person in town who could read was the priest.

Now the players were much more educated, so they had a hard time keeping a straight face when the priest approached the evil aliens (&quot;Saracens!&quot; cried the first NPC to see them) holding up a cross and saying &quot;Dominus vobiscum...et in terra pax hominibus...&quot;

Unfortunately they never went to the village wisewoman for healing. She was called Crazy Mary, and believed to be a witch, because she chanted magic words under her breath while bandaging. Magic words like &quot;Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu...&quot; She did make the giant alien robot flinch by shouting &quot;Μακριά, κακό!&quot;

And when the priest died, his last words were &quot;Obesa cantavit!&quot;

It was MIT, and there was that near-universal &quot;I&apos;m not the smartest person in my classes anymore&quot; experience, along with &quot;the professor teaching this class is one of the world experts, and is imperfect!&quot;
Yes, there was misogyny, but it was hardly unique as regards socially disgraceful behavior, attitudes, etc. There were various cases of which some folks would occasionally take their feet out of their mouths--I put it that way, because there were some people who had a near-perpetual case of foot-in-mouth disease. We&apos;re not talking about people selected for social graces or being accustomed to other people being polite to them, quite the contrary... put together a collection of bright curious types whose backgrounds include a lot of being weighted down as in The Marching Morons, and the response when let out of Think Stupid or Be Beaten Up for It jail, doesn&apos;t tend to include an excess of the social graces which so often got used as attack weapons! It was also a place full of ADHD types, warped senses of humor, and a lot of competitive pressure.

&quot;Belonging&quot; is an independent variable from &quot;treated respectfully,&quot; particularly when the standards for &quot;respect&quot; are moving targets.... problem sets didn&apos;t care about the gender or size or shape of the student regarding being solved, nor did lab equipment...

Basically, the overall society was hostile towards women outside of approved social roles. There was misogyny at MIT, but it didn&apos;t put official roadblocks in the way of women taking classes--there were individual professors who discriminated against students apparently on all sorts of different bases. There were systematic biases--the one keeping women off the faculty in more than miniscule numbers which was still in effect in the 1990s, for example, was a systematic in a lot of ways unconscious one--but they weren&apos;t as bad as at e.g. ROTC Summer Camp at Tyndall AFB, Florida, where I was reviled for not only being female, but also for being a Northerner, for not keeping to proper roles for women in the minds of Southern Baptist rightwinger never-been-out-of-the-Deep-South management-and-phys-ed-major males who expected to become pilots (and wouldn&apos;t know x from y in an Algebra 1 public school class....), and for being technical and scientific-method-oriented instead of demure and deferential and submissive and ladylike and nurturing and intent on an administrative/clerical or nursing or teaching lifepath....

I was part of the &quot;MIT Community&quot; and accepted by MIT and my classmates etc. as such--as opposd to the revilification by the male ROTC Summer Camp students who weren&apos;t from University of Florida or Georgia Tech--those cadet were High Intelligence Life Forms. The ones from The Citadel, Auburn, Univeristy of Alabama, etc. made trees look like attractively intelligent species...

My dormfloor had a reunion a few weeks back. One of the people who was there is an Army O-6 -- full &quot;bird&quot; colonel. She&apos;s a decade or more younger than I--I was the third woman in ROTC at MIT and the three of us were the first women commissioned as military officers out of MIT.

The gender bias is still out there, and these days in some ways it&apos;s worse than it was 32 years ago--back then the fact there was gender bias was intuitively obvious to the most casual observer generally--the bigots for the most part were not casual observers, they were malicious mandaters of the old double standards and implacable roadblocks doing their damnedest to continue suppressing women.

Today, there are all those rollbacks and subterfuges by the Schmuck and his buddies, turning the Defense Advisory Council On Women in The Service into a Family Values institution with that POS Elaine Donnelly and her revolting ilk as members who think women other than themselves should be locked in purdah, terminating the collection of data about women in the overall workforce in the USA so that there can&apos;t be any data to use to prove discrimination in wages and promotion, and there is all that damned evangelizing promotion of sects which preach that women belong as submissive and subordinate to the husband and master, within the military and the rest of the government run by the Schmuck...

Anyway, the colonel dealt with bigots in various training she had, including a senior officer training schooling. She&apos;s got a sunnier and more positive and upbeat air to her than I ever had, and got around the bigots, and in the Army of ROTC summer camp arranged things such that those the bigots were looking down on, banded together and worked so well together, than some of the bigots quit in tears as being ranked at the bottom with a hispanic and a woman as the two highest peer-ranked cadets.

But my point that it&apos;s a generation later, and the common culture retains some extremely noxious varieties of gender bias still, with very deep roots.

A moment of silence for Madeleine L&apos;Engle - A Wind in the Door is my favorite of her books, but I&apos;ve read many and loved most of them.

On the topic of height and the design of things - my husband and I have done a lot of moving in the last year or two, and generally do it ourselves with rental trucks. The Penske trucks are well-priced and well-maintained, but they are basically standard delivery-type trucks. At 5&apos;6&quot;, I am barely tall enough to use the build-in steps and handles to climb in and out of the back - I have to stretch and lunge, and sometimes do a controlled drop on the last two inches getting back down. It wouldn&apos;t be that hard to make it easier for shorter people to get in and out - a drop-down step to help climbing up, and placing a second external handle about 6-8 inches lower would do it. It&apos;s also hard to climb into the cab, for the same reasons. But amusingly, once you&apos;re in the driver&apos;s seat, there&apos;s no problem adjusting things for a shorter height.

On another site, in a discussion about &quot;Creationism vs Evolutionism (sic)&quot; (and you can tell just from that that the stupid is going to be deep in there), someone actually posted the following: Think about this, if man descended from monkeys, then where did the women descend from. Did one of the monkey&apos;s one day just decide to remove its penis and have breast implants? In order for man to reproduce there had to be a woman.

Paula, I almost went to MIT in 1972. I got a full scholarship from them (and Duke) and was going to take the one from MIT and when my father heard that, he erupted in anger and violence. I was a minor, I had to go where they wanted me to, which was a small religious liberal arts school. Then Mother died, my father remarried, my step-mother banished my brother to the next-door neighbors, and I never went back to school. When I became emancipated at 17 so I could become my brother&apos;s guardian, I found out I probably could have been emancipated earlier and gone to MIT, but it was too late then.

Tell me why again this [insult deleted] is presiding over the government of the USA and has not been hauled for among other things abrogration of the Constitution and Bill of Rights of the United States, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and promulgating torture contrary to numerous US laws? [someone seems to have gotten convicted this past week on torture committed outside the USA--oh, I remember, it&apos;s the son of Charles Taylor who presided over enormous misery and offensiveness in Liberia, the son is a US citizen by birth, and convicted of torture by a US court, for his action in Liberia... why is this same set of metrics not being applied to the Oval Orifice Oligarch?


The set-off line was
 &gt; And Bush should have to explain why he has failed to catch [Osam bin Laden etc.] 

And my response was,

 The Schmuck is a eager mostly loyal mouthpiece for his fellow skuz buddies who got him those big fat lucrative sleazy business deals involving the Texas Rangers baseball team and the stadium (the land was eminent domained from a working businessman&apos;s business who had wanted to continue doing business, the landowner got his property rights, that the Schmuck is always talking about
but in this case his actions showed just how much respect he has for anyone not one of his cronies and &quot;property rights&quot; of the them..., dispensed with and got paid a pittance for his land with buildings that he had NOT wanted to sell, he had had a business there he wanted to continue run, with employees, etc. The Schmuck got financing with Other People&apos;s Money, particularly the general public, and then sold out for tens of millions of dollars of proft--at the expense of the original property owner, and taxpayers and others who footed the REAL bills... the Schmuck is a essentially a mobster engaged in racketeering, but his buddies have immunity by their wealth and influence to all sorts of things, and so does the Schmuck--note that he got left alone by the Security and Exchange
Commission, note that his Texas Air National Guard records have interesting gaps--purged of &quot;adverse information&quot; long ago, and he was issued a new driver&apos;s license upon his accession to Governor of Texas. He&apos;s a corrupt piece of protected excrement, and Osama bin Laden was the effectuator of his assuming monarchical power in the USA...

My father died last year at the age of 99 1/2 and the rants that he&apos;d go on with regarding long dead people, including his father who died in 1957, are far beyond my rant level!

My point is that yes, life does go on, sort of, but looking at the evil that&apos;s been done effected by the current regime, the religious bigotry that&apos;s gotten institutionalized in the military, the injustice and opposition to equal opportunity in the presently oxymoronically called &quot;Justice&quot; Department, the destruction of the entire social order and culture of Iraq (see the particle regarding Raed...)... I&apos;m incensed, and upset as what has been lost--world heritage, lives and livelihood, HISTORY, freedom, the values of the Founders of the USA, human rights.... it feels like Germany in 1929-1933. And when do the theocrats start overtly the mass arrests and disappearances, as opposed to the unknown non-systematic number of &quot;renditions&quot; and the silent incarcerations on the basis of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; allegations [shades of the Stasi) of foreigners in the USA and even US citizens?

debcha, A .316 BA is good (it means that the hitter is successful around 30% of the time he faces the pitcher). Mr. Olin had a very short career, so the rule of small sample sizes should be considered.

The highest career BA was .367, held by a certain Ty Cobb, one of the meanest, nastiest, most-bigoted people ever to play the game. His average was attained over a career of 20-something years, while Mr. Olin&apos;s was over in not quite two.

I respect and honor and thank you for taking the hint about the really virulent rant (not that you were solely responsible for it). Then there was the eighteen-year-old who I thought should be cut some slack for acting immaturely (#712). I wanted to respond to your ideas (#723) on it—I&apos;ve greatly enjoyed some of our past conversations—but I didn&apos;t want to engage in an argument over whether someone in stage fright can look like a bimbo, or whether eighteen-year-olds bimbos can grow out of their bimbosity to become thoughtful, engaged adults.

I&apos;m glad your father lived at least a nigh-century, and I offer sympathy for your recent loss. But please consider whether constant rage is a good way to live your life. It so easily becomes a defense against engaging with people. You can concentrate on the your disagreements and ignore their message, and others may find it unpleasant enough to stop bothering with you (or if they do engage, we end up with the virulent, unending rant that gets nowhere). It sounds like Marshall Rosenberg&apos;s philosophy of nonviolent communication might help.

I picked up Speak Peace in a World of Conflict to look at Rosenberg&apos;s ideas, and I have to say I didn&apos;t get very far. In part, I gave in to the irritation I feel with his style, which reads like it was written for morons. But I have just realized that I am demonstrating the very thing I am cautioning you against. So I&apos;m going to felch my pride and read this now. And I hope you can find a way to get beyond your anger. Please try. You are worth more than that.

Randolph @ 842

Take a look at comment #587, where I looked up my copy of Dreyfuss for the first time in a couple of decades. That comment aside, I agree, it&apos;s a great book, and had a lot to do with how I approached the issues of computer-human interaction when I started to work on GUIs in the 80s. I really wish more &quot;interaction designers&quot; had read Dreyfuss and Donald Norman before they started believing religiously in gui-builders and widget toolkits; it&apos;s always seemed to me that if you&apos;re designing mediators between humans and machines it would be well to know as much about what the humans need from the interaction as you do about what the machines need.

This problem is hardly unique to software. I think it&apos;s the cause of a lot of the design flaws we&apos;ve been talking about: a tendency to focus much too closely on the immediate technical needs of the implementation (&quot;how do I get the most product up on the shelves I&apos;ve got?&quot;) or the entity instigating the design (&quot;what&apos;s the best way to satisfy management that we&apos;re optimizing our display for profit?&quot;).

And screamed aloud
Already we&apos;re so hungry
We want brains

Don&apos;t think that you&apos;ll be safe again.

 The door is locked. They can&apos;t get in.

Every place you hide, we&apos;ll come for you
When we break through, you&apos;ll know your hopes were wrong.

See the things you shouldn&apos;t see
Hide somewhere you think you can defend

Let us bite you
Then close your eyes
We will eat your brain
Now you stir; you&apos;re one of us.
So tell your fellow passengers
Their screaming and their struggles are in vain.

They scream now and try to flee
See the things they shouldn&apos;t see

Already I can taste the spinal fluid.

So lean back and close your eyes,
Nod off and I&apos;ll claim my prize,
Your cranium holds everything I need.

and in that dealing be both hard and kind

You hate confinement in a flying can

Hardware-wise, I&apos;m using the &quot;ARTcessories USB PhonoPlus:&quot;

http://artproaudio.com/

It&apos;s a sturdy, shielded, metal gadget with various audio connectors that links to your PC by a USB cable.

You CAN use an ordinary sound card. I have, in the past. But the sound and clean-ness of the PhonoPlus&apos;s capture is better. It comes with a pretty good freeware capture app called &quot;Audacity.&quot; (It lacks an automatic &quot;here, I&apos;ll split apart the record&apos;s tracks for you&quot; feature. Unless it&apos;s well hidden.)

Stefan Jones @ 886

 Was it common to see sandwiches in plastic wrap? 

I recall buying them from vendors on trains about this time, though I could be confabulating with trips I took a few years later, around 1964 or so.

There may have been a few anachronisms other than that, but they must have been little things, because I can&apos;t recall them, and I&apos;m usually unforgiving of mistakes like that. The thing they get right on Mad Men, is not so much the little things as the feeling of living in a society that insisted on conformity in just about everything, even when it didn&apos;t matter to anyone. And the sense of desperation that instilled in anyone who had trouble conforming (just about everybody). Also, the casual, but vicious, sexism, racism, classism, and intolerance of anyone with intelligence or an interest in snything outside the very narrow list of &quot;acceptable&quot; interests.

Oh, and the rampant cigarette smoking and alcoholism.
 #892 ::: Stefan Jones ::: (view all by) ::: September 09, 2007, 08:28 PM :

Bradbury captured the bland tyranny of conformity well in Fahrenheit 451 ; the related short story about a guy arrested for simply taking a walk is amazingly close in spirit to the neighborhood hens clucking over their new divorced-mom neighbor for enjoying walks.

The Ghoul Song

Lyrics © 1999 by Terence Chua
(to the tune of &quot;The Jet Song&quot; by Leonard Bernstein&amp;Stephen Sondheim - from &quot;West Side Story&quot;)

When you&apos;re a ghoul you&apos;re a ghoul all the way
From the dawn of the dead till the end of the day
When you&apos;re a ghoul you will dance you will sing
You&apos;ll have excellent taste (Thigh&apos;s too fat - try a wing)

Your dinner is served - the body&apos;s ripe for pickin&apos;
It&apos;s human hors d&apos;oeurve - they say it tastes like chicken
It&apos;s finger-lickin&apos;!

When you&apos;re a ghoul you&apos;ll be fleet on your feet
And each guy passing by&apos;s just a big hunk of meat
Every body - on that - ever - bloody - street!

When you&apos;re a ghoul there&apos;s a whole lot to gain
You&apos;re the creme de la creme - you&apos;re the top of the chain
When you&apos;re a ghoul all the world is your plate
And you always will have a confirmed dinner date

The funeral&apos;s done - it&apos;s time to end the stake out
We&apos;ll carry the box - the norms won&apos;t see the fake out
It&apos;s like Chinese take out!

Once you&apos;re a ghoul then your future is sealed
Every grown up&apos;s for food - and the children are veal
Every kiddy&apos;s - gonna - be a - Happy - Meal!

Off we go into the wild blue yonder
Flying high, eating your brains,
Here we come, revenants full of hunger,
Eat you up, all your blood drains!

Down we rot spouting damnation&apos;s boredom
Though we&apos;re dead, we shamble on!
We seek no blame though fried if flamed,
Nothing&apos;ll stop the zombie Air Corps!

Minds of men sought magic necromantic
Called up out of our graves,
Hands of men blasted the world asunder,
Now they are very unsaved!

Souls of men tainted from demon magic
Brought us back incarnate here,
With chants before and blood galore,
Nothing can stop the zombie Air Corp!

Here&apos;s a toast to the host of those
Who loved the vastness of the sky,
To old friends we send a message
If you&apos;re living do not fly!

Off we go into the wild sky yonder,
Keep the wings level and true!
If you&apos;d live to be a grey-haired wonder,
With us zombies do not screw.
Flying dead spurning the nation&apos;s border,
We are here, more on the way,
In echelon we&apos;re spreading on
Nothing&apos;ll stop the zombie Air Corps!

I had mentioned earlier here that my mom had had an apparent mini-stroke or something similar in early spring. We just called my mom to find out how she&apos;s doing, and whether she&apos;s still planning to visit us this fall.

My wife placed the call to her and said &quot;Hi, this is A—calling.&quot; &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;A—&quot; &quot;Who is this?&quot; &quot;A—Royston.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m sorry, who are you calling for?&quot; Since May my mom has now forgotten her daughter-in-law&apos;s name, and was unable to recognize it when she heard it. (She adored her previously, and loved talking to her.)

My wife put our 5-year-old son on, and she recognized him, and she recognized me, and by the time she finished talking to me she&apos;d gotten a bit more oriented to who we were and picked up who my wife was from the context, so that she could talk to her about visiting. Still, after the phone call was over I suddenly burst into tears. I&apos;d hoped she might improve and recover some of her lost memory function over time. This is heart-breaking.

And where&apos;er we go, you will always know

We did a patriotic medley in show choir my senior year. It included the five armed forces songs, the national anthem with a really horrible second verse, and &quot;God Bless the USA&quot;.

We will shamble up out from our graves,
In the rock and land and sea
First to fight for brains and spurting blood
And to make live humans flee,
We are proud to walk as revenants,
Resurrected as zombie!

Our rags billow in ev&apos;ry breeze
All day and through all night
We don&apos;t have to sleep or rest at all,
We will give the live a fright.,
In the snow of far-off northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes,
You will find us always on the job
Because we are zombies.

Here&apos;s toast to you and to lords
Whose throats we will rip out.
Whom we do not want serve;
In many a strife we&apos;ve ended life
Though it&apos;s done not using verve .
And the Army and the Navy
They are wusses sipping tea,
When you need tough stuff to fight that rough,
Come and make some more zombies1

Clifton, you have my utmost sympathies.

It&apos;s hardest on my brother, who lives with her (and who she&apos;s gotten confused with her late husband on more than one occasion now); there are nursemaids who come in to look after her while he&apos;s at work, but it&apos;s not enough any more and it&apos;s getting to be time to put her somewhere she can be looked after all the time.

Watching someone who was once a pillar of the family spiral down into second infancy is not an easy thing to come to terms with, ever. I&apos;m afraid we deal with it with a lot of black humor.

Clifton and Dan--those are horrible situations to be in.

My mother had a stroke sometime after congestive heart failure from kidney failure (she was put on emergency dialysis and that cleared the congestive heart failure). The stroke scrambled her ability to talk, and on one phone call months later, she asked me if I had seen or or talked to two of her sisters, who were several years deceased. That squicked me, majorly. I don&apos;t know if she&apos;d lost that information temporarily, or it was a translate-from-thought-to-speech failure and that she had meant to give the name of her surving sister and a a live sister-in-law instead.

My father didn&apos;t have Alzheimers, but what he would do was rant about people, particularly his father, who died in 1957, and/or be more directly verbally abusive, when he was even willing to talk at all. He didn&apos;t do that to non-family members, them he was affable to.

Then there are the locked ward cases--a friend had to incarcerate a close relative in a locked psychiatric ward, the friend&apos;s relative has a form of senile dementia which effects violent attacks on other people.

The horror of watching someone in an irreversible mental decline with no effective treatments available, and nothing humanly possible to improve the situation, society provide little coping support and succor for. There&apos;s pain, and more pain, and the knowledge than there is no happily ever after ending.

Wow...what an image. Too serious, and too dark for Atlantis Nights .

Above the thunder-clouds it hovers high,
Its skeletal ribs lit by lightning storms,
While rags of fabric trail in ghostly forms:
A revenant adrift in endless sky.
Below, the well-lit modern planes pass by,
And unaware, they brush its tentacles,
Old mooring-cables, trailing manacles
With which it trawls for aircraft as they fly.
And when it catches something in its snare,
It feasts on wires and microchips inside
While humans, just detritus flung aside,
Plunge screaming downward through the icy air.
Beware the king of airships; fear his chains.
The Hindenberg is feeding on jet planes.

Dan&amp;Clifton - I just want to toss in a positive thought. My grandmother came to live with us when I was about 9 years old, because she had developed Alzheimer&apos;s. We had someone come in to look after her while everyone was at school/work, and then my siblings and parents and I took care of her the rest of the time. She lived to be 91 years old --I was about 14 when she died--and while she declined extremely, she still could enjoy things, right up until the end. Often it was something very simple, like toy blocks that we would keep handy for her to fiddle with, or gardening magazines with bright pictures she could look at. Sometimes it was something more complex, like holding her first great-grandchild. She wasn&apos;t quite aware of how the baby was related to her, but she understood that the baby was part of her family, and she laughed with joy when she held her. Occasionally my Mom would help her to smoke a cigarette, which she absolutely loved .

It doesn&apos;t make it okay that she forgot having been friends with Ezra Pound and Ernest Hemingway, or having written for The Transatlantic Review, or her years of living as a stylish expat in Morocco. But it wasn&apos;t all pain, for her or for us, and the time I spent looking after her was precious to me. If she had any idea what it meant to me, I&apos;m sure it would have been precious to her too.

I&apos;m not trying to minimize how hard this is...but there are moments of respite, and often a seriously reduced life is still one that a person can enjoy living, although the adjustment is always a painful one, for them and (with alzheimers, even moreso) for their family.

I answered matter-of-factly, as though she was perfectly lucid and had asked me some mundane question (like, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, were we supposed to go out to dinner tonight?&quot;). But I began a new life at that moment.

Thanks, Mary Dell (and everyone else who offered their condolences - I swear I didn&apos;t mean to divert any much-needed sympathy from Clifton by talking about my own situation, but all your thoughts are most appreciated). I suspect the truth is that once she goes into a home - something she hates the idea of, and understandably so, but mostly because it&apos;s change and she doesn&apos;t do change - her situation may well improve; she&apos;ll be fed and looked after and will have someone to talk to all the time .

She&apos;s had a rough time of it these last six or seven years - she lost two of her three children and then her husband, battled breast cancer and a couple of other surgery-requiring conditions, and had to face the end of big family get-togethers at her house because it just got to be too overwhelming for her, and on top of it all had to cope with strangers coming into her house every day because she couldn&apos;t take care of herself any more. Under those circumstances, I&apos;d be tempted to hold reality at arm&apos;s length more than a little myself.

My grandfather was the potter Ray Gallucci, which isn&apos;t really a name I expect anyone to recognize, though he was a big enough deal in his own circles that apparently James Michener owns some of his work, and I got a couple of very nice emails from people Googling him after I posted his eulogy online. My grandmother had a lot of herself invested in being married to him, and by the time she became a widow she didn&apos;t have a lot else to fill that void; her deterioration has been frighteningly rapid over the last couple of years. If moving her to a place where she&apos;ll get the care she needs can do anything to halt or slow that, I&apos;d rather see that happen than the inevitable alternatives - especially since, if the lifespans of the other women in her family are anything to judge by, she could well be around for another fifteen years.

Mitch @ #958, I was in the car with my father at the wheel when he abruptly forgot how to drive (luckily we were stopped at a red light).

I asked him to slide over to the passenger side while I went around to the driver&apos;s side. Then I drove him home, feeling thankful that he&apos;d insisted on my learning to drive a stick shift.

(That was 12 or 13 years ago, when the doctors were still telling us TIA&apos;s &quot;don&apos;t mean anything&quot;. If it happened today, I&apos;d drive straight to the emergency room.)

Public service announcement: a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack), sometimes called a &quot;pre-stroke&quot; or &quot;mini-stroke&quot;, should be treated as a stroke.

And if you don&apos;t know the signs of a stroke, learn them!

I remember back in the seventies, when my father had what the doctors decided was a TIA (dizziness, while in a hardware store with my sister), he spent three or four days in the hospital while they ran tests. The angiogram didn&apos;t show anything. After that, my father was so tired of fat-free hospital food (boiled hamburgers - yuk!) that he told them either they let him out or he was walking out.

The first really identifiable stroke wasn&apos;t for another fifteen years, at which point the hospital had MRI and CAT scanners available, and they learned that the first incident was a micro-stroke - it had done damage. (Not treatable, unfortunately: brainstem.)

Fifteen years ago when I had my one-and-only grand mal seizure, it temporarily punched a large, irregular hole in my memory. The curious thing was that the memories themselves were generally intact; the problem was I couldn&apos;t get at them directly. In some cases, I knew that I knew, so I had to go through enough mental contortions to get at the thing without thinking about it directly. On the other hand: I remarked to my wife that I would need to buy a winter coat. She replied: &quot;you have a winter coat,&quot; and all of a sudden I did.

Genuine memory loss had to wait until I had small children.

Since there is some life still in this thread...

When I was hardly twenty, my grandma was dying, and she had lost her memory most of the time. I had to tend her all by myself at weekends, and while I try to remember her, I&apos;d much rather forget those months. She was 82 and in a wheelchair by then. She had become mean and obstructive to the point of cruelty and was like that most of the time, trying for instance to stab my hand with her fork, and handing me bits of her mind on autopilot, about, say, things I had done wrong when a child, that made me cry and again over dinner - she was nothing like her usual rather timid, kind self anymore. All the bitterness of a lifetime seemed to come up and find me as a target. I&apos;m illegitimate which must have meant something to her, after all.
Then again, there were those few times when she did remember, and she&apos;d cry for hours, apologizing over and over again, for everything, her whole life, I think - those were worse.

Many years later, I had tea with a ghost one afternoon, on a hot August day, in the room she usually lay, its shutters drawn, and in that half-light only, I could tell her how I loved her, that missed her, and did finally mourn for her.

There was a great-aunt, too, who, at the age of 102 and in a nursing home, would ramble on and on, recounting to herself the names of relatives, trying to make sure she remembered… would talk about nothing else.

We never thought then of &quot;toy blocks that we would keep handy for her to fiddle with, or gardening magazines with bright pictures she could look at&quot;, of such kind distractions, somehow - my family neither plays nor does sports nor, for that matter, talks a lot about what really matters to themselves - which is why I live away from them. But I refuse to regret ommissions and ignorance past, for times are changing.

Now, my mother is 75, in fair health, and my &apos;second mother&apos; my aunt, is 82 and still going strong, but I&apos;ll have to face it, eventually. Age sucks, no mistake. They missed a generation somewhere and I am not all that old myself, *middle-aged, but I feel the loss of strength and fading memories already. Things ommitted, mistakes made, old guilt, I think, make people lose it as much as age does, but Life goes first, to carry on the adventure. Age DOES suck, but is a given, and the love I feel sometimes, whenever I can, is the only solace. To see it through to the end, to face that game, to love. I am sure that I, myself, will not lose that one last capability.
&quot;If things aren&apos;t funny, they&apos;re just exactly what they are.&quot; - I like that, Dan @ 907.

Not quite by the way, this thread being logical puzzles originally: is what seems to be termed so bautifully the phosphoresphere aware of the fact that most people have more legs than the average person?

Thanks to Clifton, Essex, and all the others who&apos;ve written here about their experiences. &quot;Heart-breaking&quot; is the least of the words I&apos;d use to describe my years of caring–thankfully, again, with some help from our social services–for my mother as she lived with the consequences of a Transient Ischaemic Attack.

The first few years were bad enough, but her last year or so, as she deteriorated physically and mentally, were even more wrenching, especially as she started to get upset and sometimes bad-tempered. Those who only met her then wouldn&apos;t have seen the &apos;beautiful, sweet lady&apos; so many knew her as, even after the loss of so much with the first TIA.

Friends who&apos;ve been helping me with my still-continuing health issues have described the effect as being like PTSD. They also suspect the stress contributed to my cancer and other physical problems—OTOH, my husband&apos;s death and the financial mess he left made big contributions in the stress department too.

It&apos;s certainly left me terrified of how I&apos;ll be if I survive to 80- or 90-odd, particularly as I don&apos;t have close family who might remember my better days and want to take care of me, and recent Australian governments have been keen to cut back on social services as much as possible.
