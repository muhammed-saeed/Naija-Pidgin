 Another Day of Emails, Lawsuits and Blogging - The Life of a Lawyer 
 Posted by Food Poisoning Lawyer on April 30, 2009 
It is sunny and nearly 70 here in Seattle - Shhh, don&apos;t tell anyone. I was heading to the ferry to go home and decided to finish up some emails. Here is one I just got from someone that I kindly declined to help:

 I have in my posession a plastic bag of salt that i purchased here in walnut creek that made me extremly ill. The salt is emitting some kind of gas that causes the bag elastic to balloon up until i release the gas. I have been poisoned on numerous occasions from restaurant food here and was almost killed by a pizza delivered to my person by dominoes. Ive made numerous complaints to the e.p.a. concerning these issues how ever Im seeking damages. Ive found out that my very own parents poisoned me when I was very youn and that numerous time have been poisoned by mother and sister. Its some kind of magic potion. Any way is ther any thing that you could do to helpo me over the poisoned bag of salt. Ive been the victim of a really scary scam here that has cost me a lot of money and much of my life. Im at the bottom of the barrell here and could use some help to recover damages. I was set up the day I was born to be a slave laborer and then to be robbed of all my work and money. the use of poison and magic potions kept me in a state of semi conciousness for numerous years. Now, due to health detoxification, my mind and health has recovered to where I can see and understand what has been happening. Im a great guy, who works hard, and hasent wronged any one. Why is all of thgis accuring to me that I should suffer such losses? can you be of assistance. I havent been able to find any help here in this area. Ive physiucally have been able to recover from poisoning, how ever the fourty years that it has taken needs to be compensated for. can you advise me. 

Now I am stuck for an hour looking out from the 66th floor. I think I should go outside.

 Petting Zoos - Still Dangerous - E. coli O157:H7 
 Posted by E. coli Attorney on April 30, 2009 
I was reading the CDC’s MMWR article– “Outbreak of Shiga Toxin--Producing Escherichia coli O157 Infection Associated with a Day Camp Petting Zoo --- Pinellas County, Florida, May--June 2007” and it struck me how humans seem nearly incapable of learning for the past. We have been tracking this ongoing problem for years now and built www.fair-safety.com as a resource for the Fair and Petting Zoo Industry. But, they seem to be slow learners.

 According to the CDC, during 1991--2005, the CDC received reports of 32 outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 that were associated with animals in public settings. Among these, venues in certain outbreaks were not in compliance with NASPHV guidelines, with reported inadequate handwashing facilities, permitted consumption of food or drink in animal areas, unsupervised handwashing, and no signage. During 2006--2008, five E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks related to animal settings were reported (CDC, unpublished data, 2009). NASPHV guidelines include recommendations on handwashing, venue design, animal care and management, risk communication, and oversight needed for animals in public settings.

 The article was reported by: KA Alelis, MPH, PE Borkowski, Pinellas County Health Dept; P Fiorella, PhD, J Nasir, J Middaugh, MD, C Blackmore, DVM, Florida Dept of Health. J Keen, DVM, US Dept of Agriculture and Univ of Nebraska. This report is based, in part, on contributions by C Minor, Florida Dept of Health; T Holt, DVM, W Jeter, DVM, J Crews, DVM, and J Carter, Florida Dept of Agriculture and Consumer Svcs.

 Wisconsin Warns of Salmonella Spinach in Wisconsin and Illinois 
 Posted by Salmonella Lawyer on April 30, 2009 
 Wisconsin officials are recommending residents throw away bags of spinach distributed by a Milwaukee food processor after some tested positive for salmonella.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection says consumers should discard 10-ounce bags of Kleen-Pak curly-leaf fresh spinach with use-by dates of April 29, April 30 and May 1.

It says routine food safety tests of the spinach were positive for salmonella. The bacteria can cause diarrhea, fever and vomiting. Infections can be deadly to young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.

Kleen-Pak spinach is distributed in grocery stories in Wisconsin and Illinois.

 National Environmental Health Association Annual Educational Conference 
 Posted by Bill Marler on April 30, 2009 
 NEHA is having its Annual Education Conference in Atlanta June 21 through 24. Click below for brochure:
 

 

I will be speaking at some point, so making your way to Atlanta is worth it. A bit about NEHA:

 NEHA’s Origin 

The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) had its origins in the state of California where it was incorporated in 1937. The original impetus behind the creation of a national professional society for environmental health practitioners was the desire by professionals of that day to establish a standard of excellence for this developing profession. This standard, which has come to be known as the Registered Environmental Health Specialist or Registered Sanitarian credential, signifies that an environmental health professional has mastered a body of knowledge (which is verified through the passing of an examination), and has acquired sufficient experience, to satisfactorily perform work responsibilities in the environmental health field. The pioneers of the association believed that such a credential was necessary if the environmental health field was to grow and take shape as a legitimate and widely respected profession.

 NEHA’s Mission 

Drawing on the original effort that led to the creation of NEHA, the association today stands as a strong professional society with over 4,500 members across the nation. Clearly NEHA’s mission,“to advance the environmental health and protection professional for the purpose of providing a healthful environment for all”is as relevant today as it was when the organization was founded.

Advancement has been defined by NEHA in terms of both education and motivation. The basis for the association’s activities is the belief that the professional who is educated and motivated is the professional who will make the greatest contribution to the healthful environmental goals which we all seek. Accordingly, great emphasis is placed on providing, through each of NEHA’s programs, both an educational as well as a motivational opportunity. At NEHA’s conferences, for example, tremendous attention is paid to developing a quality educational program that not only imparts knowledge to the attendee but, also, through the very quality of the presentations, inspires the attendee to do more upon returning to his or her job.

 Salmonella-tainted Pudding Linked to New Hampshire Mixer 
 Posted by Salmonella Attorney on April 30, 2009 
 New Hampshire state health officials say a mixer used to make pudding was the source of salmonella that sickened children at a camp in Madison this month. The Stone Environmental Camp voluntarily closed last week, and is looking forward to reopening, now that the source has been identified.

Health investigators determined that pudding served to the campers was contaminated. Although the mixer is supposed to be sanitized after each use, a possible defect may have allowed bacteria to get to an area where it couldn&apos;t be cleaned out.

The state confirmed 15 salmonella cases among more than 120 children and adults who reported getting sick. The state said some could have had mild forms of infection also related to the mixer.

 Salmonella Lawsuit to be Filed Amid Continuing Outbreak Linked to Sprouts 
 Posted by Salmonella Attorney on April 30, 2009 
We will be filing yet another lawsuit stemming from a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella-tainted sprouts was filed today in the Tenth District Court for Sarpy County, Nebraska. Bellevue resident Daniel Krim, one of 121 people sickened in the February-March 2009 outbreak.

The lawsuit was filed against CW sprouts, the Nebraska firm whose Sunsprout brand of raw sprouts was distributed to retail customers, including grocery stores and restaurants. Also named in the lawsuit is John Doe Corporation, the yet-to-be identified company that cultivated and distributed the seeds used to grow the tainted sprouts.

Daniel Krim purchased a sandwich containing the defendant’s sprouts at a LaVista Jimmy John’s restaurant in February, and fell ill the next day with flu-like symptoms including fever, nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. His symptoms continued to worsen, causing him to seek emergency medical care. He was treated for dehydration and gave a stool sample that later revealed that he was infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella saintpaul. Mr. Krim missed more than a week of work due to his illness, and lost over ten pounds.

The CDC has opened an investigation into a new Salmonella saintpaul outbreak tied to sprouts, which to date has sickened 35 people in six states: Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia. According to preliminary testing, the new outbreak appears to be an extension of the February-March outbreak in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Kansas that sickened Daniel Krim.

 CDC - Investigation of an Outbreak of 35 Salmonella Saintpaul Infections Linked to Raw Alfalfa Sprouts in Michigan (17), Minnesota (4), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (6), South Dakota (2), Utah (1) - Manufacturers, Suppliers, Restaurants, Grocery Stores Unnamed 
 Posted by Salmonella Attorney on April 28, 2009 
 CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of human infections due to Salmonella serotype Saintpaul.

Since mid-March, 35 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Saintpaul have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Michigan (17), Minnesota (4), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (6), South Dakota (2), Utah (1), and West Virginia (2). Cases are still being reported, and possible cases are in various stages of laboratory testing, so illnesses may be reported from other states. No deaths have been reported

State and local authorities, CDC, and FDA have linked this outbreak to eating alfalfa sprouts. Most of those who became ill reported eating raw alfalfa sprouts. Some reported eating sprouts at restaurants; others purchased sprouts at the retail level.

The initial investigation has traced the contaminated raw alfalfa sprouts to multiple sprout growers in multiple states. This suggests a problem with the seeds used, as well as the possible failure of the sprout growers involved to appropriately and consistently follow the FDA Sprout Guidance issued in 1999 http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprougd1.html . The guidance recommends an effective seed disinfection treatment immediately before the start of sprouting (such as treating seeds in a 20,000 parts per million calcium hypochlorite solution with agitation for 15 minutes) and regularly testing the water used for every batch of sprouts for Salmonella and E coli O157:H7 .

 This outbreak appears to be an extension of an earlier outbreak in 2009. In February and March, an outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul infections occurred in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, and Minnesota. This outbreak was linked to raw alfalfa sprouts produced at a single facility, and the outbreak strain was indistinguishable from that of the more recently reported cases. CDC is also currently working with public health officials in several states and FDA to investigate an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked with eating alfalfa sprouts. 

Most persons infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12–72 hours after infection. Infection is usually diagnosed by culture of a stool sample. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Although most people recover without treatment, severe infections may occur. Infants, elderly persons, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness. When severe infection occurs, Salmonella may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

 Advice for consumers 

 * Do not eat raw alfalfa sprouts, including sprout blends containing alfalfa sprouts, until further notice. This warning is only for alfalfa sprouts, not other types of sprouts .
* Persons who think they may have become ill from eating raw alfalfa sprouts are advised to consult their health care providers. 

 REMINDER for high risk populations: CDC and FDA recommend at all times that persons at high risk for complications from Salmonella infection, such as the elderly, young children, and those with compromised immune systems, not eat raw sprouts. For such persons who continue to eat sprouts, FDA recommends cooking them (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2002 consumer advisory, available at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/tpsprout.html ).

 DO NOT EAT SPROUTS - FDA Tells Consumers on a Sunday Afternoon - Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia Implicated 
 Posted by Salmonella Attorney on April 26, 2009 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced today not to eat raw alfalfa sprouts, saying they may be contaminated with Salmonella .

 The contamination appears to be in seeds so washing the sprouts may not help, the FDA said in a statement. &quot;Other types of sprouts have not been implicated at this time,&quot;the agency said.

&quot;FDA will work with the alfalfa sprout industry to help identify which seeds and alfalfa sprouts are not connected with this contamination, so that this advisory can be changed as quickly as possible.&quot; The FDA said 31 Salmonella Saintpaul infections have been seen in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia.

&quot;Some reported eating raw sprouts at restaurants; others reported purchasing the raw sprouts at the retail level,&quot;the FDA said. &quot;This outbreak appears to be an extension of an earlier outbreak in 2009. In February and March, an outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul infections occurred in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, and Minnesota,&quot;the FDA added.

 Thirty-Three Sprout Linked Outbreaks Since 1990 Sicked 2,166 
 Posted by Bill Marler on April 26, 2009 
Ben Chapman, over at Bites , published a very complete list of Sprout Outbreaks Since 1990.

Since 1990, raw or slightly cooked sprouts have caused an estimated 2,166 illnesses, through 33 outbreaks (actually - 37 outbreaks, 2,273 illnesses). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that sprout-link outbreaks account for 40 per cent of all food-borne illness associated with produce.

 Salmonella Sickens 31 in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia - Who Produced Them? Where Were They Sold? FDA is Silent - So Far. 
 Posted by Salmonella Lawyer on April 25, 2009 
FDA held a call Saturday, April 25 to inform industry (but not consumers) of a forthcoming FDA press release (today or tomorrow?) related to an outbreak of Salmonella SaintPaul linked to alfalfa sprouts - AGAIN. The multi-state outbreak began mid-March and is ongoing. Currently 31 cases in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia are linked to this outbreak. The serotype and PFGE pattern are considered to be rare, and the PFGE pattern is a match to that of the strain causing illnesses from sprouts in Nebraska in February/March that was linked to CW Sprouts and Jimmy Johns . The outbreak involves multiple sprouters in multiple states and multiple lots of seeds that went to at least 20 states. Some seeds went to primary sprouters and others to distributors; FDA does not have all the data on where these distributors send seeds, so other states may be involved. It appears that a single seed supplier is involved. Many of the cases are linked to restaurants.

 FDA will be warning consumers (when?) not to eat raw alfalfa sprouts, reminding the sprouting industry of the importance of following FDA’s guidance on sprouts safety, and reminding restaurants/retailers to obtain sprouts from sprouters following the guidance. As part of this investigation FDA will be reviewing how closely sprouters are complying with the FDA guidance to assess whether changes in the guidance are needed. Information to date suggests a number of sprouters have not been following the recommended control measures.

FDA’s Guidance Document for the safe production of sprouts gives clear direction to seed producers, seed conditioners, distributors, and sprout producers on important steps that must be taken to ensure the safety of sprouts.

In 2003, FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Health Services and others jointly developed a video to assist the industry in producing the safest possible products. The video may also be useful for retailers, regulators, and anyone working with the industry that wants to better understand the product and current recommendations for best production practices.

 Both of these resources provide guidance regarding the sources of contamination, ways to eliminate potential contamination and methods to detect contamination when it happens. FDA believes strongly in these recommendations and“will consider enforcement actions against any party who does not have effective preventive controls in place, in particular, microbial testing.”

Some of the basic controls directed by FDA include:

§Seeds for sprout production must be grown under good agricultural practices. Purchasers of seed should request verification from their supplier that appropriate practices were followed.

§Seeds for sprouting should be treated with one or more treatments (such as 20,000 ppm calcium hypochlorite) that have been approved for reduction of pathogens in seeds or sprouts. Some treatments can be applied at the sprouting facility while others will have to be applied earlier in the seed production process. However, at least one approved antimicrobial treatment should be applied immediately before sprouting.

§Microbiological testing of spent irrigation water from each production lot for Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 (or EHEC), and Listeria monocytogenes. There is a potential that pathogens may survive antimicrobial treatments, even if used properly, so testing becomes the last chance to detect contaminated lots. Because testing for pathogens can be done with irrigation water as early as 48 hours into what is generally a 3 to 10 day growing period, producers who plan accordingly can obtain test results before shipping product without losing product shelf-life. Testing, whether done by the producer or contracted out, should be done by trained personnel, in a qualified laboratory, using validated methods.

 The Fight for Safe Food - The Facts, Quotes and Opinions of 16 Years of Fighting for Consumers 
 Posted by Bill Marler on April 25, 2009 
 As one reporter I spoke to last week noted:
 

 The Facts: 

 The law firm of Marler and Clark has represented victims from every major food borne illness since 1993. Marler has fought for the rights of victims of food-borne illnesses for more than 16 years now and says in that time he has seen no laws tightened to protect consumers. 

 My Quotes: 

 Lawyer says Plainview plant may not be at fault 

 &quot;What some people don’t understand is the ripple effect this kind of thing can cause,&quot;Marler said.&quot;Some 50-60 people here lose their jobs, the corporation goes bankrupt, there are other companies that go bankrupt due to the cost of the product recall, more people lose their jobs . . . . You add it up and that is some major money being lost, not to mention the human cost of people getting sick and dying.&quot; 

 Peanut Victims&apos; Lawyers Visit Blakely Plant 

 &quot;It really is a failure of not only this company, but also of government oversight,”said Bill Marler.“It&apos;s a failure of the peanut association to pay attention to all of its members and a failure on the part of consumers to hold their government accountable.&quot;
 

 &quot;125 people are out of a job, that the peanut industry is losing half a billion dollars from just one company when the last time the FDA was here was in 2001. I think most tax payers would think spending more on the FDA could have saved a lot of problems, 9 people wouldn&apos;t have died, 700 people wouldn&apos;t have been sickened and 125 people wouldn&apos;t be out of a job,&quot;Marler says.
 

 &quot;It&apos;s interesting that the president seems to be interested, he talked about his daughter eating peanut butter and hopefully that will loosen up money.&quot; 

 My Opinion: 

 I was able to tour the Peanut Corporation of America plants in Blakely, Georgia and Plainview, Texas this week. I saw mice, cockroaches, and leaking roofs–all bad signs in a food production plant. But those weren’t the only bad signs. I also saw two small towns, already struggling in this economy, that have lost steady incomes for the more than 100 people who used to work at the plants; incomes their families–and the towns–depended on. I saw seemingly endless fields lying fallow that should be full of peanuts, crops that would have supported unknown numbers of farmers and other businesses all along the line of distribution, and the communities they live in.
 

 It’s my job to focus on the people who were sickened in this outbreak–the 691 (confirmed) ill, the 160 hospitalized, and the nine families who lost loved ones. But the victims of this outbreak are everywhere. Certainly in these two towns, which have lost valuable jobs, perhaps forever. But with more than 4,800 products recalled, millions of dollars in costs all have the same ripple-out effect–the businesses suffer, then the employees suffer, then the communities suffer. We all feel the effects. And. It. Has. To. Stop.
 

 It’s ridiculous to point at the Peanut Corporation of America and say,“it was all their fault”, and go back to business as usual. Oh, PCA carries plenty of blame; I’ll be the first to say. They ran a shoddy factory and made inexcusable decisions which caused incalculable loss and suffering. And they will pay for it. But they are not alone in this. Bad actors can only flourish in a broken system, where the loopholes are truck-sized and regulation thin. We went through this two years ago with the Peter Pan/Great Value peanut butter outbreak, and we all thought it would never happen again at that scale–and we were wrong. It will happen again - and again - unless industry, government, and business interests grow collective backbones and put an end to it.

 Forbes Editor Champions Tort Plaintiffs Lawyers - ABA Reprints 
 Posted by Bill Marler on April 25, 2009 
 Spoke with Sarah Randag of the ABA last evening after she&quot;shouted out&quot;the Forbes editorial giving a&quot;tip o&apos; the hat&quot;to what I do. Generally, the ABA tends to look down on the lawyers that represent victims, so perhaps there is a positive trend here?

 Editor William Baldwin calls attention to an epidemic in a commentary piece in the May issue of Forbes: foodborne illness. It“sickens 76 million Americans a year, kills 5,000 and runs up $3 billion in hospital costs,”he writes.
 

 But his rallying cry isn’t for more federal regulation—it’s for more plaintiffs lawyers. Hear him out.“The tort bar has not, on the whole, covered itself with glory,”he wrote.“A large fraction of asbestos cases, for instance, are based on quack readings of X-rays.”
 

 In food-poisoning litigation, however, genetic subtyping can make an unmistakable link from food to victim.“The lawyer&apos;s main task is to argue over how much the kid&apos;s life is worth.”
 

 He points to the success of Seattle plaintiffs lawyer William Marler, saying that, aside from the high cost to food vendors of adverse judgments, Marler’s promotions of his efforts call attention to these adverse rulings and keep food vendors on their toes.
 

 “If it&apos;s expensive to make mistakes, more money will go into the detection and prevention of microbes,”Baldwin writes.“Entrepreneurs will find opportunity here.”
 

 Marler told the ABA Journal that at a regulatory level, at least, he has seen&quot;pretty dramatic&quot;changes in food safety practices since his career-launching 1990s verdict against Jack in the Box over undercooked hamburgers that were the source of an E. coli outbreak. in Washington state. For example, in response to that particular case, the Food and Drug Administration guideline for the internal cooking temperature of hamburgers was raised from 140 degrees to 155 degrees (and later 160 degrees).&quot;It doesn&apos;t sound like a big deal, but for a fast-food restaurant, it&apos;s an enormous deal.&quot;

I sat for a few hours in the Atlanta airport last night during a thunder storm so had some time to finish up my PowerPoint for my speech in a few weeks in London before the Royal Society for Public Health. Here is the PowerPoint - there will be two added videos - which one to use ?:
