I&apos;ve been to enough weddings to know one thing: I don&apos;t want to sit down and eat a three-course meal for five hours. I just don&apos;t.

Call me crazy, but I can&apos;t help but think it&apos;s an egregious error to spend a fortune on food that you can&apos;t guarantee every guest will like. Case in point: A few weeks ago, at a very lovely wedding, I had to choose between salmon and veal. I hate them both. My other option? A plate of steamed vegetables. No thanks -- I&apos;m off the Kate Moss diet these days. (Actually, I&apos;ve never really been on it, but you get my drift.)

Anyway, I digress. After hoarding loads of sliders, sushi rolls and chicken satay sticks, I was stuffed to the gills with four courses to go. Four courses?! Are you kidding me?!?

The Bridal Association of America cites that the average catering bill in America tops out at about $12,790 -- including food, drinks and cake cutting. The price of just hors d&apos;ourves? Around $30-$70 per guest. Maybe that&apos;s not including an open bar, but I do know one thing for sure: Your wedding guests are not interested in stuffing their faces at a ridiculous expense to you (and likely, your folks).

Every time I&apos;ve attended a wedding, I&apos;ve been ridiculously full (see sliders above) and then have been expected to work the dance floor &apos;til after midnight. When I&apos;m done eating, do you know what I usually wanna do? Sit down and relax. For a while. (Or at least the recommended half hour before going swimming.) What I don&apos;t want is to sit down intermittently for a salad, palate cleanser, main course and cake before I head out and grab midnight munchies being offered en route to my car (or hotel room).

Bottom line: Don&apos;t waste your money. Give guests what they want instead -- a yummy plethora of both light and hearty snacks served progressively throughout the night. Not only will this save you a bundle on catering, but it&apos;ll also please your guests and open up your budget for an open bar, an extra honeymoon treat (overnight snorkeling catamaran, anyone?) or even that designer gown you&apos;ve been lusting after since before you were engaged.

The progressive cocktail party is genius in concept: Start with simple, refreshing bites like a ramekin filled with a microgreens salad or a fresh bite of ceviche. Later in the night -- while the guests are boozing and dancing -- pass around more hearty dishes, like a heaping spoonful of lobster mac &apos;n cheese or mini pulled pork sandwiches. Your guests will remain on their feet, dance to the incredible band (or DJ) you shelled out for and enjoy the food -- without a dollar going to waste.

Although salmon or veal can pique the tastebuds of many finicky eaters, I had to pass. And you should pass, too. The progressive snacks, that is.

View All Favorites Recency  |  Popularity AllysonDivaCommeter 6 Fans 09:14 AM on 11/07/2011 While I agree that many weddings are overdone and do not enjoy the dinner portion of the typical wedding, neither would I enjoy, I do not think most people want &quot;a yummy plethora of light and healthy snacks&quot;!!! A mini pulled pork sandwich or a spoonful of lobster mac and cheese doesn&apos;t cut it either.

I don&apos;t mind going home a little stuffed after I just sat thru a boring ceremony and had to endure their idiotic toasts, dances, dull relatives and loud music.

The most successful events I have seen have started with the cocktail hour (the yummy plethora) and continued with an ample, interesting buffet so there is something for everyone (so no one goes home hungry) and no one is pinned down for hours.

&quot;in the middle lies virtue&quot; as the saying goes.

 Anne Jensen 11 Fans 04:55 PM on 10/27/2011 Glad someone finally said it! Agree with all the other comments, but also, I get bored sitting with the same seven people for a couple hours.

 EverybodyKnows 9 Fans   04:41 PM on 10/25/2011 Could not agree more and try to tell every bride that I can this bitter truth - you are wasting a lot of money on that sit down dinner. This is a party where people are supposed to mingle and have fun. How can I have fun if I keep having to return to my assigned seat for yet another course that is probably cold from being among the last tables served??

Heavy hot and cold appetizers throughout and an open bar ensures fun and a better total bill!

I really don&apos;t like the &quot;assigned seating&quot; thing at all.

If you don&apos;t assign tables you will inevitably have tables filled to the brim and others entirely empty. Imagine being an out-of-town guest of the couple and knowing no one else. Creating a thoughtful table chart is the kind thing to do for your guests.

 jlobyxmas 0 Fans 10:31 AM on 10/25/2011 I completely agree. We had cocktail hour before our ceremony, which guests could bring with them to sip during our ceremony. Then we had appetizers, open bar and cake for our reception. NO ONE left early, everyone stayed to the bitter end dancing and socializing, and many of the guests commented on how they&apos;ve been to more expensive weddings but never to a better wedding. Sit down dinners kill the mood and can be so boring. Keep the party moving...biggest party of your life! jlobyxmas: I completely agree.
