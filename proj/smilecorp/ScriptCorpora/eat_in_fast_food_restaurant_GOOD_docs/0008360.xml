 EA Sports MMA won&apos;t be sold in Denmark because of energy drink law 

by Griffin McElroy on Aug 27th 2010 5:30PM
 39 Let&apos;s play a quick game of &quot;which of these two things is the craziest thing you&apos;ve ever heard?&quot; So, there&apos;s this Scandinavian law which prohibits any form of marketing for energy drinks, which EA Sports MMA (with its energy drink-branded fighter shorts and environments) would flagrantly violate. That&apos;s weird, right? Here&apos;s what&apos;s weirder: EA Sports has decided to cancel the game&apos;s release in the region outright to preserve the game&apos;s authenticity.

So, which is more bizarre? The fact that fans of dudefights living in Denmark won&apos;t be able to get their EA Sports MMA fix due to energy drink pants ? Or the fact that EA Sports refuses to change the energy drink pants into Taco Bell pants because it would ruin the authenticity of the MMA experience? We&apos;re leaning towards the latter.

 Let&apos;s be honest, it&apos;s an obvious decision. Altering the game for such a small market would probably cost EA more money than the potential profit. Also, the game&apos;s probably partially sponsored by the brand.

Well if you live in Europe you can get this game from your neighbors and EA saves money and time. Certain laws are kinda ridiculous. Reply

not ilegal just ilegal to advertise, Ithink theres a similar law regarding cigarettes over here in the UK Reply

 Joystiq could use a staff member that understands MMA. These energy drink items in the game come in the way of &quot;sponsors&quot;, and thus lead to funds.

 Wow that&apos;s stupid, WE ALL hate advertising and when i play a game i don&apos;t play it to stare at silly advertisements, They should just patch it to show something else.


Monster Energy drink FTW!

 Uhm, I&apos;m going for the former. That law is ridiculous. And if you can&apos;t see the real reason why EA isn&apos;t publishing, you may be an idiot. It sure as hell isn&apos;t for authenticity.

 just remove the shorts completely and i will buy!

 Really? Energy drinks? THAT&apos;S what you choose to ban advertisements for?

Not overindulgent pharmaceutical drugs or alcohol? But energy drinks are what society should not be exposed to? 
Posted: Aug 28th 2010 6:55AM REBDK said 

 
 @Lerkero
Well, it&apos;s not exactly the only the thats banned in Denmark, genius. Reply 
Posted: Aug 28th 2010 10:19AM Lerkero said 

 
 @REBDK
Where in my post does it say that energy drinks are the only thing I assume to be banned? I just think it&apos;s ridiculous that energy drinks are something to be concerned about on that level. Its an over-caffeinated beverage just like coffee and many soda brands. Why would that be banned?

&quot;It&apos;s okay for two men to beat each other unconscious in a cage, but I&apos;ll be damned if they tell people to buy an energy drink while doing it.&quot; Reply

 Video game companies complain that they&apos;re losing sales because of things like &quot;used game sales,&quot; and then they do something like this. *shakes head in disgust* Do they even want sales? 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 7:17PM TB said 

 
 @Mouthsmasher look at the size of denmark. why would they make a special version of the game for such a small populations. i doubt the costs associated with altering the game would be worth the trouble Reply

 @Mouthsmasher
the game company DID nothing. it&apos;s the government that is banning the game. Reply

 @Mouthsmasher
This is Denmark, not the U.S. or any other huge country. The cost to change the game would probably be far more the the profit from sales in Denmark. Reply 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 6:05PM Anticrawl said 

 
 It has nothing to do with either -_-. Clearly it&apos;s because Rockstar is supplying some pretty beefy advertisement funds for development. Probably more than could be made up if they dropped all the energy drink related stuff and sold in Denmark.

 @Sally
It&apos;s a Mexican fast food restaurant and I don&apos;t know. 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 6:24PM mrmobius said 

 
 Well maybe EA is gambling that they&apos;ll make more net profit by letting those gamers import from surrounding countries (Denmark isn&apos;t that big, and I wonder how online retailers will get around it anyway, so can either cross the border, or try an online retailer) than by taking the expense to alter the game code. I&apos;m sure Denmark isn&apos;t a massive market anyway. 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 6:35PM Faceless Troll said 

 
 @KirbyCommando Calling Taco Bell a Mexican restaurant is like calling McDonald&apos;s a steakhouse. 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 7:10PM SeaKnigge said 

 
 I&apos;m going with the former. 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 10:57PM x2Jiggy said 

 
 @SeaKnigge I agree with you. In every Strikeforce fight the center of the cage is filled with Rockstar advertising. Obviously Rockstar are popping down some serious coin to be a sponsor therefore EA can&apos;t just scrap them from the game because of a local law in a small market. Reply 
Posted: Aug 27th 2010 7:13PM TB said 

 
 def. the former. why should EA have to alter thier game for one country thats the size of frickin west virginia!! That would be stupid

 Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

Oh... nevermind. That was just some Rockstar stink I burped up.

 I don&apos;t get it. We have a lot of advertisements for energy drink (Red Bull, Burn, etc.) on the TV here in Denmark. What&apos;s the difference, between advertisements in games and TV? 
Posted: Aug 29th 2010 10:28AM choplifta said 

 
 yeah here in denmark the public space is filled with adds for energy drinks... other EA titles are filled with the same kind of adds like the skate series... this ban is not logic at all 
Posted: Aug 29th 2010 10:29AM choplifta said 

 
 rockstar energy drink is not even for sale here 
Posted: Aug 30th 2010 6:14AM DaveGeorge said 

 
 Don&apos;t know about &quot;Scandinavian law&quot;? I&apos;ve seen Red Bull commercials on TV here in Sweden. But then again, there recently was a new law prohibiting anyone under 18 from buying energy drinks. So maybe it really is a Scandinavian law and not just Danish. Anyhow, it&apos;s not a big problem since most scandinavian webshops aren&apos;t limited to nordic releases.
