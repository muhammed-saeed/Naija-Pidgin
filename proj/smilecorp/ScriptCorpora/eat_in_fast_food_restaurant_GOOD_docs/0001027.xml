Whether working as a server, cashier or restaurant manager, excellent math skills are paramount. Nothing angers a customer more than an overcharge or being short-changed when it&apos;s time to pay the bill. Being able to calculate the bill accurately and provide the correct change for the customer plays a tremendous part in keeping the customer happy.

Excellent written and verbal communication skills are necessary for most any position within a restaurant. Hosts are normally the first point of contact for a customer and can make or break a customer&apos;s first impression of the establishment. Everyone else, from servers to managers must also have excellent reading, writing and communication skills to represent the restaurant in a professional manner that leaves the customer with positive feelings.

Team Players

From those who clear the table, to the servers who bring the meals, to the manager overseeing the restaurant, all employees share common goals. These are the success of the restaurant and the happiness of the customers. Therefore, being able to work independently, as well as a part of a team is an essential skill in the restaurant industry. Supporting each other in the face of challenging situations lends strength to the group as a whole, which contributes to the restaurant&apos;s success.

Cooking Abilities
 Good cooking skills are a must. bruschetta image by deusebi from Fotolia.com 
Whether working as a short order cook, the head chef, a server, or the manager, the ability to cook is helpful to the success of any restaurant employee. Even if cooking is not in the employee&apos;s job description, there may be a time when the kitchen is short-staffed or the restaurant exceptionally busy and the employee must help in the kitchen. Good cooking skills and the ability to follow a recipe are essential.

Ability to Multi-task
 The ability to multi-task is crucial. table image by papydiesel from Fotolia.com 
During a normal shift, a server may go from having one table to cover to having 10 tables. The ability to work on many issues at once in an organized manner is essential to ensuring customers feel properly served and leave with a feeling of satisfaction. Working as a manager or cook automatically requires the need to multi-task, as handling multiple matters at once is a constant part of the job.
