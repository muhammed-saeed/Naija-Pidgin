 I recently read an article that contained a quote from someone in the movie industry about how it isn&apos;t currently worthwhile, or a priority, to make movies for a female audience/from a female perspective/ something along those lines. I have tried to find the associated article, but searching&quot;movie industry women sexism&quot;isn&apos;t very successful. I think I may have read the article at Jezebel. I may have even found it here. But I totally can&apos;t find it now. Help!

 I&apos;m in a band, and we&apos;re being courted by a fairly senior guy in the music industry. He&apos;s suggesting that rather than signing ourselves away to a major, we fund the first 18 months (so album recording, tour, publicity etc) we get funding from venture capitalists. Does anyone have any experience with this, or have any links for further reading on this? The music industry can be an unforgiving environment, and I want to know as much as possible independently to our potential manager...

 I&apos;m doing reference vocals for a couple of team songwriters who have recently been signed under a music DJ who works for a major record label. The tracks are good, these guys know their pop music, however they have no money to offer me at the moment. The only things they can offer me is free studio time, access to their songwriters, some music tracks and connections in getting my music to the right people. When I get paid depends if their boss likes the vocals or if an artist picks up the song. Is this a common tactic among new songwriters when they cannot pay their vocalists? How can I make sure I&apos;m getting the best end of this deal or should I walk away?

 I&apos;m about to begin work at a medical device company (as a paralegal) and would like an introductory book on the subject. I&apos;ve scoured Amazon, but haven&apos;t found anything that&apos;s a general overview, with chapters on history, business climate, FDA and regulatory issues, litigation -- just a smattering of everything, with perhaps emphasis on legal / regulatory. Most books are more specialized. Or are there websites or white papers along these lines? Recommendations, please!
