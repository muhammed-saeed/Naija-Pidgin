 Finding the Best Hamburgers in Oklahoma City - Continued 

The Great OKC Burger Hunt

 (Continued from Page 3) Let&apos;s face it; there&apos;s not really a lot of difference in some hamburgers, not like there is pizza, for example. Generally, the variety comes in the toppings and not the basic style. So during this burger hunt, I began to really praise the distinctive, not just in the types of things the restaurant could throw on there but how well they could do the basics. So I began to look down on the places that were just ordinary in that regard. The next leg of my burger search had me going through several that I would consider somewhat less than unique.

Another popular recommendation in this category was Freddy&apos;s Frozen Custard . This fast food-style chain restaurant is based in Wichita, Kansas and has locations in 7 states. It boasts a &quot;steakburger&quot; made from tenderized lean steak, something a little different in my burger hunt.

Just like a fast food restaurant, Freddy&apos;s got my order wrong, even after repeating it multiple times. The burgers themselves have fairly thin patties, not very dense, but do possess some nice flavor. The buttered bun and meat taste reminded me of other places I liked more, such as Ron&apos;s, and I wasn&apos;t all that impressed with the extra-thin, seasoned french fries.

 Pros: 
 Good tasting &quot;steakburgers&quot; Quick and easy fast-food experience
 Cons: 
 Service left something to be desired. Very little cheese and thin patty. Get the double if you&apos;re hungry.
 Verdict: Freddy&apos;s is by no means a bad hamburger. In fact, it would rank above many, if not all, fast food spots, particularly in its taste. But in the end, I don&apos;t expect that to be near enough to get it into my top 10. As for the chain spots, Red Robin&apos;s variety gives it a much better chance.

Another that fit this description for me was Around the Corner in Edmond, a recommendation from a number of readers. The place isn&apos;t open for dinner, so I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was quite busy, the &quot;old restaurant&quot; feel to the interior with newspaper clippings on the wall and knick-knacks around. I hoped I was in for a real treat, an original family-style burger. Unfortunately, it just didn&apos;t rise beyond the ordinary for me.

The meat itself is reminiscent of the pre-formed, frozen patties you can get at the store. It wasn&apos;t overly flavorful nor was it as hot as I would&apos;ve liked, the cheese not quite melted in some spots. I sampled a couple of burgers actually, loving the amount of bacon they put on the bacon cheeseburger but not feeling the same about the large supply of somewhat soft onions on the onion burger. And while I&apos;m not reviewing french fries, of course, I sometimes feel it necessary to mention particularly notable ones. Here, they seem, like the burgers, prepackaged and fairly flavorless.

 Pros: 
 Good amount of toppings Old-style family restaurant atmosphere
 Cons: 
 Non-distinct meat patties and fries Not a fan of the softer onions
 Verdict: There was much to choose from on the Around the Corner menu, and the place intrigued me. I&apos;ll no doubt return to try some of the other dishes. As for the burgers, though, I have to disagree with the readers who recommended them. I found them to be quite less than unique.
