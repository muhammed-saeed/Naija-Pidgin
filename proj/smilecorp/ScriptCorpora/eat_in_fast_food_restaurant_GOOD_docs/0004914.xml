 July 5, 2012 P.F. Chang&apos;s China Bistro (Omaha) Mobile review by Courtney ( 6 reviews ) I ordered the veggie lettuce wraps and the lunch buddah&apos;s feast, a veggie sir fry with tofu and rice, and it comes with a salad. The appetizer took 15 minutes when there were 4 other tables (this place is corporate there&apos;s no way the kitchen was understaffed). My entree came out before my salad and the stir fry had 3 tiny pieces of tofu. Never again. June 29, 2012 Twisted Cork Bistro Mobile review by john ( 15 reviews ) I should eat here more. Fun flavors. Unique beers. Great service. June 28, 2012 Joe&apos;s Crab Shack NO JOE&apos;S !!! by Jerry ( 1 review ) Joe&apos;s steam pot -
The only good part of my adventure to Joe&apos;s Crab Shack in Omaha NE was the service from my waitress. Everything from the bad attitude bartender, the orange floaties in my Bud Light draw, my $7 Crown Royal and seven(not a tall or a double) to the $23 Crab pot that didn&apos;t come close to filling me up. For $5 more i could have, and should have, gone to Red Lobster for their Ultimate Feast and walked out of there stuffed. This experience burned me to the point of never wanting to return to Joe&apos;s and to also let all my friends and family know of my&quot;adventure&quot;to this place.
