	<description>Low Fat Fast Food Data shown from National Fast Food Chains including Subway, Arbys ... You can add mustard or any number of their ...</description>
	<body>
		Arby&apos;s 
 has plenty to eat that is lower in fat and 
 calories, but you will have to be selective 
 and make sure to tell your server to cut 
 some of the condiments.

The Deli Sandwiches are a good example. 
 Without the mayo or sauce and without the 
 cheese, the chicken and turkey sandwiches 
 are very acceptable.

 You 
 can add mustard or any number of their sauces 
 that are low fat or even their Ranch Dressing 
 that is fat free.

Other good choices are their Lite Menu items. 
 Just watch condiments you add. All around 
 this is not bad for fast food. Just know 
 ahead of time items that are acceptable 
 for your dietary needs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 The 
 following is a representation of fast food nutrition 
 data from some national chains. Data was gathered 
 from each chain&apos;s website. The listings will give 
 you an idea of what fast food with a lower fat content 
 may be available from other restaurants in your 
 area. We are not listing all items, just the items 
 that are under 10 grams of fat. As you can see, 
 there is not a whole lot out there. 

 Condiments 
 usually have been included in the listings so you 
 may substitute or delete these items from the total 
 count. Cheese, bacon and regular mayonnaise have 
 been included separately in some instances. When 
 you start adding on these items, it is easy to see 
 how fast your fat grams, calories and cholesterol 
 can escalate. Please remember, portions are small 
 on some items like pizza. 

 Fast food IS NOT A HEALTHY WAY TO EAT and should 
 never be used as a regular means of sustenance. 
 If at all possible find a more healthy alternative. Be careful, most or all of the items served are 
 also excessively high in sodium and in added sugar. 
 If you are on a low sodium diet or a low sugar diet, 
 be extra aware of these counts. Your 
 best choices USUALLY will be dry salads (with NO 
 added cheese, bacon or dressing unless the dressing 
 is in a packet and labeled as low fat or fat free) 
 and grilled chicken items - and remember watch that 
 sodium. 

 If 
 you really love your kids, take the time to educate 
 them that a steady diet of this stuff can kill them 
 as well as contribute to the epidemic of obesity 
 that faces children today. Parents need to be aware 
 that this stuff is just as deadly as cigarettes 
 and drugs, possibly more so. Don&apos;t you find it shocking 
 that we are seeing a wave of children who are suffering 
 from high blood pressure, who have not even gotten 
 out of grade school? It is understandable when you 
 note that the food choices offered in most public 
 schools today are nothing more than . . . FAST FOOD 
 laden with fat, sodium and sugar!
