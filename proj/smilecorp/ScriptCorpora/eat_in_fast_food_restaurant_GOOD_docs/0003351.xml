 A review on a post on Legal from My E-commerce blog. 

July 8, 2009 at 00:25 ( week 6 )

Last Sunday, I had looked through a post on Legal from My E-Commerce blog which topic is “ online beauty product fraud ” and now I want share my review on it for all of you. 

Along with the development of internet, online purchase becomes more popularization in today. Online purchase indeed provides many benefits for us, people can conveniently, not pressure to buy the things as well as able to compare products price and features when purchase via online.

However, since many cases of online purchase fraud burst out and many people become the victims of online fraud, the reliability and security for online purchase become the biggest problem and the confident of people toward the online purchase also become less and less.

According to this post mentioned that there are at least 66 people in Malaysia had been got into this fraud and the products that they purchased were skincare products in a website, called “ BigPussyCat ”. Among of these victims, has one victim state that he was induced by the price which was cheaper than other off the shelf. Indeed, buying through online can really enjoy the preferential price because the sellers not need to bear high cost to sell, but sometimes that actually is a swindle ! 

Purchase via online normally will need to bear some degree of risk that is may be the actual product received is not same with the sample which had shown in the website, so much as not receive anything although already paid for it just like this online purchase fraud.

Besides, due to most of online buyers are tend to young people group, so cause them become the high percentage of the victims of online purchase fraud and their hard earned  money also due to this fraud flashy disappear. In addition, isn’t only the online buyers are the victims for the online purchase fraud? Not, the online seller also got the impact due to these “black sheep”. 

Thus, how to protect yourself so that you will not be the next victim?

 To be careful when you receive a too-good-to-be-true offer , such as an expensive product that sold at a cheap price for you. Buy goods and services from trusted sources . Send the money to those you are trust. Check the term and condition before make payment. Examine the feedback on the seller. 

Lastly, contact to the police immediately if you think you are being in fraud.

 Citizen’s Adoption Strategies 

 Nowadays, the world become more and more advances, in order to make right decision and avoid falling behind, government must identify and resolve the different issues that have arisen from the transaction period during which traditional and e-government co-exist. The ease of use, compatibility, and trustworthiness are significant predictors of citizens’ intention to use e-services and that perceived reactive advantage, perceived image, perceived compatibility, perceived usefulness, and relative advantage are significant elements of e-government adoption. Besides, the government should guide and control the transformation of government into e-government rather than just focusing in the introduction of ICTs. Meanwhile, the use of ICT to strengthen the involvement of citizens and businesses at the same time the public decision must be progress.

 Mobile Payment in Malaysia: Its Potential and Customer adoption Strategies 

July 6, 2009 at 00:25 ( week 5 )

From Wikipedia website, mobile payment is the collection of money from a consumer via a mobile device such as their mobile phone, SmartPhone, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or other such device. It also referred to as mobile web payment or WAP billing. The mobile payment can be used to purchase any number of digital goods and physical goods. With that, consumers no longer need to bring any cash or credit card while travelling, they just need to use their hand phone as their credit card to make the payments. It is more convenient for consumers especially in this fast growing market. Digital goods are like follows: ring tones, games, wallpaper for mobile phone and the booking cinema ticket and air ticket. Digi, Maxis, Hotlink, Celcom, Visa Wave Payment and Maybank are some of the example which also launch the mobile payment systems. Other example such as using the Hong Leong Mobile Credit Card of each transaction will be rewarded with instant cash rebate and the cash rebates accumulated can be used to make purchases at any “Mobile Money” retail outlet.

Mobile payment is more convenient for consumers especially in this fast growing market. The largest credit card payment system is visa which launches a universal system and signed with mobile giants. Mobile giant like Nokia launches this service in Nokia handset which allows customers to remote payment, person-to-person payments, and contact fewer payments. Mobile network operators (MNOs) have played an important role in pushing the technology necessary for m-payments. MNOs are approaching m-payments strategically, in their bid to retain customers and develop wider sources of revenue from lines of business which can be strongly complementary. Fixed-mobile convergence is one manifestation of this, as it gives telecom operators an opportunity to unify their payments platforms on an internet protocol basis and offer discounts or loyalty points on m-payments as part of bundled service.

The types of mobile payment can be as follow:

 Mobile banking(m-banking) Mobile wallet solution that store credit or debit card information on a SIM chip Pay-as-you go or contactless card technologies Text messaging systems that can facilitate or enables payments 

 Mobile banking 

-          Similar to Internet banking in that it provides a fast and convenient way of performing common banking transactions. The services offered include among others, balance inquiry, bill payment, funds transfer, mobile prepaid reload and service request. To enjoy the benefits of mobile banking, all you need is a mobile phone that is equipped with the features required by your bank that provides this service. All mobile banking transactions are secured to ensure that users’information could not be stolen. However, users should also practice precaution, which includes not leaving your mobile phone that is linked to your account unattended to; keeping your PIN confidential; and never reply to any SMS claiming to be from your bank or asking for your banking details. Currently, there are 10 banking institutions offering a wide range of mobile banking services in Malaysia.

 Mobile wallet (mobile money) -          is a designed by Mobile Money International Sdn Bhd in PIN-based Mobile Payment Solution to address the limitations and bottlenecks created by cash, cheques and credit cards. It unlocks the power of the mobile phone to make payments, allowing registered users to pay for goods and services at anytime, anywhere using only a mobile phone coupled with a 6-digit security PIN (Personal Identification Number) through SMS (Short Messaging Service). This gives the freedom to shoppers to buy products online and pay the merchant using his/her mobile phone without being physically present at the store.

 Contactless card technologies 

-          In which the chip communicates (at data rates of 106 to 848 kbit/s) with the card reader through RFID induction technology. These cards required only close proximity to an antenna to complete the transaction. They are often used when transaction must be processed quickly or hands-free, like on mass transit systems, where smart cards can be used without even removing them from a wallet. (e.g. Hong Kong’s Octopus card, South Korea’s T-money(bus, Subway, Taxi), Mebourne’s myki, London’s Oyster card)

 The potentials of mobile payment in Malaysia 

-          No need to carry out a lot of money when going out buy something or make a huge amount transaction.

-          It should be a convenient, speed, simplicity and safety ways for the consumer to build up for the consumer to use the mobile payment.

-          It also increased a lot of new mobile device users.

 Phishing: Examples and its prevention methods. 

June 27, 2009 at 00:25 ( week 4 )

 When you receive an email state that “verify your account”, be careful! You probably receive a phishing email. 

 What is phishing? 

 Phishing is an internet scam and it also can be pronounced as “fishing” that is like to throw out the bait to catch the user’s sensitive information such as credit card and security numbers, user IDs and password. Normally it is conducted by the email and instant messages. The phishing technique was come out in 1987 and the first recorded use was in 1996. 

 The examples of phishing technique are social engineering, link manipulation, filter evasion, website forgery and phone phishing. 

 ♣ Social engineering- It is one of the examples for phishing. Initially, the phisher will send a message which look like urgent and let the people immediately response it without thinking. 

 ♣ Link manipulation- Phisher places a link in the email which will take you to a website that you are familiar with, but actually you are in the phishers website. 

 ♣ Filter evasion- Phisher try to used the images substitute text and make it harder for the anti-phishing to detect it. 

 ♣ Website forgery-Phisher alters the address bar by closing the original address bar or opening a new one with the legitimate URL, it is difficult to detect without the specialist knowledge. 

 ♣ Phone phishing- Send a message that give a phone number which is own by phishing to the users and when the user call for the number, the phisher will immediately require user’s account number and pin. 

 The examples of phishing: 

 Example 1(a): Phishing email 

 

 Example 1(b) Phishing Website 

 

 Usually the phishing email (example 1(a)) will state that they can’t verify the users’  information and require the users click the URL that they provide link to other webpage (example 1(b)) which look like official but actually is phisher’s webpage for the user to enter their account information, besides that the users will easy fall in this trap when they see the sentence in the email which look like urgent, such as this email mentioned that if you don’t do this within 48hours, your account will unable to use, this will made the user immediately to click the link to see what happen. 

 

 Example 2: 

 The PayPal phishing email: 

 

 The earliest target of phishing is PayPal and there was an email to the users from PayPal state that the user’s account had been attempted to login by foreign IP address and pretend for the security alert as the excuse cause the user immediately click the link which had been provided in the email to confirm their account but actually the link will bring the users to the website which had been well-connected by the phisher.

Keep your firewall turned on to prevent the hackers who are trying to crash your computer and reject unwanted file and updated anti-virus software and anti-spyware technology regularly. Keeping the operating system updates (like Window and Linux) because the system can provide free software which can help to “patch” the hole that the phisher could exploit it.
