With today&apos;s hectic lifestyles, time-saving products are increasingly in demand. Perhaps one of the most obvious examples is fast food. The rate of growth in consumer expenditures on fast food has led most other segments of the food-away-from-home market for much of the last two decades. Since 1982, the amount consumers spent at fast food outlets grew at an annual rate of 6.8 percent (through 1997), compared with 4.7 percent growth in table service restaurant expenditures. The proportion of away-from-home food expenditures on fast food increased from 29.3 to 34.2 percent between 1982 and 1997, while the restaurant proportion decreased from 41 to 35.7 percent (Clauson).

At roughly $109.5 billion in 1997, fast food sales are approaching the amount spent at table service restaurants ($114.3 billion in 1997, including tips), despite fast food&apos;s much lower average cost per meal. Between 1990 and 1997, fast food prices rose only an average of about 2 percent per year, according to the Consumer Reports on Eating Share Trends (CREST) data, implying increased consumption caused the majority of expenditure growth.

Demand for Convenience Drives Expenditures

People want quick and convenient meals; they do not want to spend a lot of time preparing meals, traveling to pick up meals, or waiting for meals in restaurants. As a result, consumers rely on fast food. Knowing this, fast food providers are coming up with new ways to market their products that save time for consumers. For example, McDonald&apos;s currently has outlets inside nearly 700 (out of 2,374) Wal-Mart stores across the United States, and almost 200 outlets in Chevron and Amoco service stations. These arrangements are becoming more common in the fast food industry. Consumers can combine meal-time with time engaged in other activities, such as shopping, work, or travel. This idea shapes the growth strategies of most firms in the industry - strategies that can be characterized by this passage from the 1994 McDonald&apos;s Annual Report (The Annual):
 
McDonald&apos;s wants to have a site wherever people live, work, shop, play, or gather. Our Convenience Strategy is to monitor the changing lifestyles of consumers and intercept them at every turn. As we expand customer convenience, we gain market share.

The number of fast food and restaurant outlets in the United States has risen steadily over the past 25 years (fig. 1). Although the official 1997 United States Census count has not yet been released, it is expected that, for the first time, the number of fast food establishments has surpassed the number of table service restaurants. The rapid rate at which the fast food industry continues to add outlets is as much a reflection of consumer demand for convenience as it is a reflection of demand for fast food itself. Expanding the number of outlets increases accessibility, thus making it more convenient for consumers to purchase fast food. Especially in recent years, much of the expansion has been in the form of &quot;satellite&quot; outlets, similar to the McDonald&apos;s outlets mentioned above. These tend to be smaller in size, with little or no seating capacity, and are often in nontraditional locations, such as office buildings, department stores, airports, and gasoline stations; locations chosen specifically to maximize convenience and consumer accessibility. The 1992 Census of Retail Trade reports that roughly 23 percent of all fast food establishments do not have seating for on-premise dining, catering instead exclusively to consumers who &quot;eat on the run.&quot;

Unique Characteristics of Fast Food

Rising incomes, longer workdays, and a growing tendency for both spouses to hold full-time jobs are widely credited for the rise in away-from-home expenditures of all types, but fast food especially benefits from these trends. The fast food industry focuses heavily on rapid consumer turnover, speed of service, and take-out sales. Aside from obvious menu differences, fast food is less expensive than table service restaurant meals, has a larger lunchtime clientele, and is sold by firms that are predominantly franchised-which provides consistency in terms of product quality and menu offerings (table 1). Dollar sales per fast food outlet nearly match sales per full-service restaurant, despite higher meal prices and greater seating capacity at restaurants.

CREST data report that off-premise traffic accounted for just over 64 percent of all fast food sales in 1997, a figure which has been increasing slowly, but steadily, for some time. In 1990, just over 61 percent of fast food sales were for off-premise consumption. The dominant form of off-premise dining in the foodservice industry is carryout, but the drive-thru, a concept that Wendy&apos;s introduced in 1974, is especially important in fast food. Company records show that about 60 percent of the sales at Burger King and 54 percent at McDonald&apos;s are made at the drive-thru.

In the fast food pizza segment, delivery dominates, with firms like Dominos, Papa Johns, and many independents focusing almost exclusively on delivery sales. Pizza Hut began delivery service in 1986, and today 34 percent of the units are devoted exclusively to delivery (offering no on-premise dining capacity). Systemwide, off-premise dining accounts for almost 60 percent of Pizza Hut&apos;s sales, and 63 percent of all establishments offer delivery service. Table 2 reports the percentage of off-premise sales for some of the largest firms in the industry.

Increasing Competition from Supermarkets

Most fast food chains emphasize convenience and low prices by offering a narrow range of menu items, which are usually based around &quot;hand-held&quot; foods. However, firms like Boston Market, Koo Koo Roo, and Kenny Roger&apos;s Roasters are blurring the lines between fast food, casual dining, and supermarket foodservice by expanding menus to include fully prepared, multi-course meals for eat-in or carry-out. These firms promote a &quot;home-cooked&quot; image by offering entrees such as ham, meatloaf, roast beef, and baked chicken, along with numerous vegetable choices. This type of fare, dubbed Home Meal Replacements (HMR&apos;s), is intended to eliminate the need to cook at home by providing a wide variety of higher quality foods that are as convenient and affordable as fast food.

Many supermarkets are capitalizing on the popularity of HMR&apos;s by increasing the quality, variety, and promotion of their own HMR offerings. Ronald Larson provides a detailed overview of this market. Supermarket HMR&apos;s are often designed to be easily reheated in the oven or the microwave at home, and can be stored for several days in the refrigerator without significant reductions in quality. This provides a certain advantage over most traditional fast food offerings, which are usually intended for immediate consumption. The widespread adoption of microwave ovens by United States households (now in nearly 90 percent of homes) contributes to the convenience of HMR&apos;s for takeout.

Estimates of 1997 sales of prepared meals and components at supermarkets vary widely, ranging [TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 1 OMITTED] from just under $7 billion to about $14 billion (see &quot;Grocery Industry Courts Time-Pressed Consumers with Home Meal Replacements,&quot; this issue). By comparison, the entire sales of the varied-menu/casual-dining segment (Applebee&apos;s, Chili&apos;s, TGI Fridays, etc.) was $20 billion in 1997 (Paul). Though supermarkets tend not to be as conveniently located as most fast food outlets, consumers clearly enjoy the quality and variety of many of their prepared meal offerings. Plus, the Food Marketing Institute reports that consumers average 2.2 trips to the grocery store per week, giving them ample opportunity to regularly purchase HMR&apos;s. These could become a major competitor to traditional fast food.

Growth in Fast Food Affects Many Agricultural Industries

Food and drink purchases by the restaurant and fast food industries have increased considerably over the past 25 years . The growth in fast food expenditures is reflected in the food and beverage purchases by this industry. The limited menu aspect of most of the major chains means that their growth can have an enormous effect on selected segments of the agricultural marketing system. For example, Pizza Hut uses approximately 2.5 percent of all the milk produced each year (over 3.2 billion pounds) to meet its annual cheese requirements. When it introduced its Stuffed Crust Pizza in 1995, Pizza Hut required approximately 17.5 million pounds of string cheese, almost 50 percent of the total United States production at that time. McDonald&apos;s 1996 beef usage exceeded 644 million pounds, and potato usage was about 1.35 billion pounds, approximately 2.5 and 3.2 percent of total United States production, respectively.
