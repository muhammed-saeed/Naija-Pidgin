Normal for an 11 year old to still drink out out of a baby bottle? Favorited ( undo ) Following ( undo ) 11% Normal 15  Comments 
 My friend&apos;s cousin is 11 and he still drinks out of the baby bottle. We both think it&apos;s weird, but his Mother (her aunt) is against disallowing him as she says it upsets and aggrivates him. At school, he goes to the nurse and drinks/eats there because the school doesn&apos;t feel it&apos;s right for him to be embarrassed by his mother&apos;s tendencies. (I know this because my neighbor is the assistant principal).

Is it normal? If you&apos;re wondering, the kid is slightly babyish still, but he doesn&apos;t have any sort of mental problem.

Reply 1 1 pooniefoonie 3 months, 1 week ago | pl She needs to let him grow up, he can&apos;t go to the nurses room to drink his whole life. If she doesn&apos;t stop it now, he is going to have problems later in life. It probably a comfort thing. Comment Hidden ( show ) Report We&apos;ll look into it, thanks! Reply 1 1 Add A Comment
