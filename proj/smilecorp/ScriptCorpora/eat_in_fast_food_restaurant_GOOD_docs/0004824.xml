Working hard doesnt work for thousands of NE Ohioans
 Sunday, September 5, 2004 By Christopher Montgomery, Bill Lubinger And Dave Davis Plain Dealer Reporters 
Corrections and clarifications: The following published correction appeared on September 8, 2004:A story on the working poor published Sunday on Page One misidentified George Zeller, senior researcher for the Council for Economic Opportunities in Greater Cleveland.
A sign at the entrance to the Forestbrook housing development off Ohio 82 in Broadview Heights alerts you that its the final opportunity to build. There are only six half-acre lots left. The spacious stone-and-brick homes start at $379,000.
Less than a mile to the west, at Seneca Broadview Hills Apartments, squat, boxy brick buildings line potholed streets. Children ride bikes and play along the apartments outside walls, marked with scrawled obscenities and black water stains spilling down from clogged gutters.
The rent here is $500 or $600 a month. Many residents are struggling to pay, even though they have jobs.
The news last month that Cleveland ranks No. 1 in big-city poverty was hardly shocking for a city that for years has been shedding jobs and losing population. Nor is it particularly surprising that eight years after federal welfare reform pushed millions into the nations work force, many of Clevelands poor work full time but are stuck below the poverty line.
But the problem of the working poor families below the poverty line even with at least one person employed full time extends beyond Clevelands borders, even into prosperous suburbs like Broadview Heights. And its getting worse.
A Plain Dealer analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data shows that the number of people living in working-poor households in the seven-county region rose 31 percent, to 152,589, between 1990 and 2000. More than half of them live outside Cleveland.
With the economy and the fortunes of the American worker playing a big role in the presidential race, some argue that the whole notion of the working poor is flawed. They say persistent, low-wage employment is uncommon and that census figures on the subject are misleading. Others argue that low-wage, low-benefit jobs are on the rise and are a trap for the least employable members of society, leaving them constantly on the edge of financial ruin.
Theres just something incredibly morally wrong when a person goes out and works 40 hours a week and cant support his family, said Phil Cole, executive director of the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies, a statewide social-service network.
Lack of education hurts more than ever
Going back to 1970, there were 94,847 people in the region in working-poor households. Their number rose to 116,272, in 1990 and then shot up to almost 153,000 in 2000. Thats an increase of 61 percent in 30 years.
The state, however, out paced Northeast Ohio in the growth of people in working poor households, the newspaper found. Their ranks swelled by 67 percent, from 370,744 in 1970 to 619,846 in 2000. The nation, meanwhile, only saw a 32 percent increase in the working poor, a jump from 13.8 million to 18.2 million people in the 30-year period.
Given that the 2000 data was gathered at the height of the bull market, its likely the ranks of working-poor households in the region have swelled during the downturn. Thousands more workers are above the poverty line but still have trouble paying the bills.
The poverty line fluctuates from $8,825 for a single senior citizen to $18,660 for a family of four with two children and up to almost $41,000 for a household of nine or more.
For many low-wage earners, financial struggles are often magnified by their own poor choices. Social scientists suggest the situation has gotten worse.
In 1940s Cleveland, when a kid left high school and either chose not to attend college or couldnt afford it, he had a decent chance of landing a well-paying job at an auto plant or steel mill.
The person who makes that same decision now is condemning themselves to working in a fast-food restaurant or some other low-wage job, said Peter Meiksins, a Cleveland State University sociology professor.
Its a high-stakes game where somebody who makes a poor choice is likely to pay heavily for it much more heavily than they would have in the past.
In 2000, there were scores of working-poor families in high-rent locales that seem isolated from big-city ills, including 73 in Willoughby, 35 in Sheffield Lake, 32 in Solon, 29 in Aurora, 25 in Broadview Heights, 16 in Hudson and 15 in Orange.
The Seneca Broadview Hills Apartments are often called the citys ghetto by apartment residents themselves. Some are below the poverty line; some are above it but still receive government assistance of one form or another.
Among the residents are Pedro Montanez and Arlene Olmeda, a common-law couple who have been together for 10 years and have three children. Montanez was raised on Clevelands East Side. She was born in Puerto Rico.
Montanez, 28, has worked as a welder at Pacione Ornamental Iron in North Royalton for five years. Olmeda, 24, hasnt worked since March 2003. He didnt want to disclose how much he makes, but he said the family is above the poverty line of almost $22,000.
Their children two daughters, ages 7 and 8, and a 4-month-old son are on Medicaid, and the girls receive school-lunch discounts. Montanez and Olmeda dont have health insurance.
Thank God we never get sick, Olmeda said.
Its not uncommon for Montanez to work 15-hour days. After working an eight-hour shift in North Royalton, hell often do yard work and other repair projects for people in the area.
Still, even with his hard work, Montanez said its becoming more difficult to cover his familys costs. Sometimes things will be good for two or three months, he said, and then it will get a little bit harder.
Olmeda has worked in low-paying jobs at a supermarket, fast-food chain and nail salon. She is looking for a new job, but said shes having a hard time finding an employer willing to work around her schedule with the kids.
Montanez and Olmeda, neither of whom have a college degree, were trying to save up for a down payment on a house. But Olmeda said theyve put that on hold for a while because of a number of unexpected costs this year, including the death of Montanezs father.
No matter how much [Montanez] makes, its never enough, Olmeda said.
Single mothers common in working-poor homes
Kym Johnson lives across the parking lot from Montanez and Olmeda
She is a single mother since divorcing last summer. She shares a two-bedroom apartment at Seneca with her four children, who range in age from 6 months to 8 years. Johnson makes $25,000 a year as a receptionist in the pediatric unit at the Cleveland Clinic, which puts her above the poverty line for a family of five.
Her situation is common. In 2000, 45 percent of the working-poor households in the region were headed by single mothers.
Johnson is covered by the Clinics health plan, but she said she couldnt afford coverage for the children. They receive no-cost health benefits through the federal Healthy Start program, a boon, considering that her 6-year-old son is autistic and requires extra attention. The children also receive school-lunch discounts.
Johnson gets the most help from her mother, Dian Nemeth, a retired teacher who lives in Parma Heights, who pays for some of the familys groceries and other bills.
Nemeth is also a certified day-care provider and receives several hundred dollars a month from the county to watch the children.
Despite all of the assistance, Johnson said its a struggle to get by and virtually impossible to build up a nest egg.
I have to worry about the here and now and try to make ends meet, said Johnson, 33. Every time I get some savings, something always comes up.
In many ways, Nemeth and Johnson are a study in contrasts. Nemeth worked for 30 years in the Cleveland public school system and has a state-funded pension and health benefits. Johnson, who has a bachelors degree in criminal justice from Kent State University, has moved through a number of jobs, including stints as a family services coordinator for Head Start in Cuyahoga County and as a patrol officer for Case Western Reserve University.
By changing jobs so often, Johnson has been unable to store up any seniority or move into higher-level positions. That has her mother worried.
When its [Johnsons] time to retire, I wonder what its going to be like for her, Nemeth said.
But some dont buy into the argument that more full-time workers are slipping into poverty.
Professor says numbers are greatly exaggerated
Brad Schiller, an American University economics professor, thought hed find more working poor than he did when he began studying the issue 30 years ago.
But the numbers are grossly exaggerated, he said, because the Census doesnt actually track the number of people who work full time and at what hourly rate.
Census employment data reflects a cross-section of workers, not the same people and how their wages may have changed from one year to the next.
Most people dont stay in low-wage jobs, Schiller said. Most workers increase their wages either by changing jobs within the same company or by taking a job for higher pay with another firm. Only a minority of workers trapped in low-wage jobs dont have skills or a network to change jobs, he said.
I dont want to suggest there is no permanent low-wage labor, he said, but its the exception, not the norm.
The poverty threshold was developed in the 1960s and based on a so-called market basket of food a subsistence diet when the biggest concern among the poor was hunger.
The same threshold is still used, inflated for the Consumer Price Index.
Claudia Coulton, co-director of the Center on Urban Poverty&amp;Social Change at Case Western Reserve University, believes the threshold is too low because food makes up a smaller share of the typical familys expenses, mainly because housing and utilities cost so much more now.
On the other hand, income used to measure poverty doesnt count such government benefits as the earned income tax credit, food stamps, Medicaid or rent subsidy if the family lives in public housing.
You could argue about this all day, CSUs Meiksins said about whether the threshold is too high or too low.
The debate: Benefits or better wages
Suggestions for improving the plight of the working poor center on wages and health care both contested politically for years.
(SEE CORRECTION NOTE) George Zimmer, senior researcher for the Council of Economic Opportunities in Greater Cleveland, believes the minimum wage should be indexed to inflation, as is done with Social Security benefits.
Otherwise, minimum wage which currently stands at $5.15 per hour actually declines as inflation rises. Today, the $5.15 from 1997, when the minimum wage was last increased, is worth $4.36.
Meiksins believes working families would most benefit from some form of universal health insurance because a lack of health benefits is the biggest strain on low-wage earners especially those with children.
Thats the dilemma facing Tammy Calaway, a restaurant server in Twinsburg who doesnt have health benefits. She earns $200 to $300 a week for about 30 hours of work, and said she wants to work 36 hours, which is considered full time, for the health insurance.
Calaway, 40, pays every day for the mistakes shes made and tries to figure out how shes going to get ahead. She quit school in 10th grade, is divorced and had two children 16 and 5 with different fathers.
The three of them live in an apartment where most of the rent is paid by the government. The younger child is in publicly funded day care.
Calaway has regrets. She also has ambition, although where that takes her probably isnt far.
I wouldnt mind being in the health-care industry, helping people, she said. I dont know how I would do that. It would cost a fortune to go back to school, I would assume.
And taking care of my kids is a full-time job right there. Thats the best job I have.
