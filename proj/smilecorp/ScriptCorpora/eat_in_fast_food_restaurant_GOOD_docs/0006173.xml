New Chinese Restaurant 39th St near 5th Ave
 
Just picked up a very good take out lunch from Asia Culture, a new Chinese restaurant on the south side of 39th Street between 5th Ave and Madison.

They have 23 lunch specials for $6.45 (including tax), with choice of soup, plus salad, plus brown or white rice. I got the chicken with bok choy and it was really very good. It looks like a nice place to sit down for a meal too.

they need to improve their slow service, but I think that will change with experience.

It&apos;s a nice additional choice for lunch in this neighborhood.

I passed that the other day and was wondering about it. I&apos;ll have to give it a try now.
Thanks!
