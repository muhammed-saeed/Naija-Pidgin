 You! Add Photos&amp;Videos According to a report published in the British Medical Journal, calorie listings on restaurant menus do in fact change customer buying habits. Yet, when the results are examined more closely, the impact seems to be pretty minimal.

The purpose of the study, which was jointly funded by the City of New York and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was to examine the impact of the 2008 New York City law requiring restaurant chains to prominently display calorie information .

Researchers surveyed lunchtime crowds at 11 fast-food restaurant chains and compared 7,300 receipts from the year before the law took effect with nearly 8,500 from the nine months after it was implemented.

Though the authors of the report see the results as positive, evidence that the law is making a difference seems pretty slim.

According to the researchers, one in six changes their order when confronted with calorie counts on menus.

Yet, overall calorie consumption for the thousands of people tracked did not change.

The customers of only three of the restaurant chains studied were seen to make significant modifications.

On average, McDonald&apos;s customers bought 44 fewer calories, Au Bon Pain customers bought 80 fewer calories, and KFC customers bought 59 fewer calories.

However, seven restaurant chains saw little change in their customers&apos; purchases and one, Subway , actually saw customers purchase more calories on average after the law was implemented.

Earlier this year, another study concluded that New York City&apos;s label law had little impact on the food children chose to order.

Together, these studies seem to show that calorie listings on menus don&apos;t change customer buying habits all that much.

But, what about you? Do calorie counts on menus lead you to change your order? +18

 La August 29, 2011 16:43:51 No, never I don&apos;t look at them. reply mg&apos;s haven~POTL~PWCM~JLA August 08, 2011 03:47:26 No, never Hell no if i eat food the right way i wont look like a cow. i mean too much pasta and a sedintary person wont mixed NOt enough motion is made by muscles and the build of stored fat wont go anywhere. A skimpy salad wont help a body builder either Its all in what kind of energy giving foods a person needs to eat and how they intend to use them that matters If i bothered to look at that id never ear anything for fear that i might eat too much and truly mess up my metabolism and organs altogether. reply Ang74 August 02, 2011 15:56:47 Well, sometimes +1 It does for me sometimes. Especially when you get to see just how many calories are in there! And it varies from place to place. I don&apos;t know how some restaurants can create a baked potato that has twice as many calories as a homemade one, but they do. reply Angie August 02, 2011 15:08:04 Well, sometimes +1 Depends if I just ran a 9 miler do I want to engorge myself in grease and fat...sometmes yes I do bc thats why I work out SO I can enjoy life offerings but there are times that voice says, &apos;&apos;you do all that hard work, so keep it off and eat a salad!!!&quot;&apos;. reply Crazy Feet August 02, 2011 12:14:56 (edited) Well, sometimes I figure im paying more money to eat out so i minds well have what i want,esp.when i could have cooked it at home in a clean kitchen,flavor it to my Precise taste,pay maybe 1/3 the price less........... I think i would be bigger if I ate out a lot but i don&apos;t. reply dani August 02, 2011 11:16:20 No, never I eat what I feel like eating, and If anything I&apos;m underweight. If you exercise and eat a balanced diet you can afford to have a reasonably &apos;high&apos; calorie treat now and then! reply some idiot who thinks he kn... August 02, 2011 08:14:40 Yes, always It&apos;s a habit worth living once you&apos;ve been on it for awhile. I could do it for the rest of my life, really. reply heather.anime August 02, 2011 07:20:50 No, never when i eat out i never bother to look at how many calories there are lolz im too busy having fun with the people i am with to think about how many calories there are in what i am eating anyways reply Dana August 02, 2011 06:49:45 (edited) Yes, always I know it is a pain, but adding the calorie count and also the carb count would be a huge help for many. My daughter is a diabetic and we live by carb counts on everything she eats... and it would be fabulous to have them all added up for us. But, I know this is not convenient for others... just would be nice for the diabetics and also serious dieters. :)

We carry a little book called the &quot;Calorie King&quot; and it covers most fast food restaurants, and some sit down places too, plus about every imaginable food you would eat. This is a huge help for us. Has calories and carbs listed. reply Mikayla August 02, 2011 06:15:18 Well, sometimes it just depends i don&apos;t really look at the calories i just look at the food&amp;decide if it looks healthy or not. reply Cthebookworm August 02, 2011 05:49:49 Well, sometimes Sometimes reply cybernestical August 02, 2011 04:05:34 No, never 
 reply Kari August 02, 2011 03:42:33 Well, sometimes +1 Yes, usually. If something that looks good is 1,000 calories, but something else that looks good is 500 calories, of course I&apos;m going to go with the lower calorie meal. My health and my appearance is important to me. Sometimes, there&apos;s no much of an option, though. I remember going to a Chinese restaurant in Japan with my husband. They had the calorie counts for every single dish on the menu, which was nice, but the lowest calorie count was about 850 calories. I was just shocked that every single thing had so many calories. I think the highest was about 1,500. So, in that case, I didn&apos;t really have much of a decent option. I think my order was around 900 calories, unfortunately. reply carrotcat August 02, 2011 03:35:38 Well, sometimes Sometimes i see 1,000 calories and I start to feel nasty. reply lcky9 August 02, 2011 03:19:30 No, never enough said reply Azrael-In GOD we trust August 02, 2011 01:24:34 Well, sometimes Most of the time, but I usually order a small menu. If I eat at a restaurant, I eat about 1/3 of the meal and get the rest to go for the next day.
McDonald&apos;s lists all their products and calories on the back of their placemats, which I think is nice. I folded one and keep it in my purse for future reference. reply Allilias August 02, 2011 00:26:24 No, never never has never will reply Keith August 01, 2011 23:18:22 No, never I just had a greek dog and greek fries smothered with cheese. At my age it&apos;s better than sex, and at my age I don&apos;t do either every day reply Anna E August 01, 2011 23:14:52 No, never The vast majority of my diet is healthy so I don&apos;t worry about the odd meal with an overabundance of calories. reply NicolineWeirdo-chanKnuth August 01, 2011 22:52:40 No, never When I finally do eat out, I don&apos;t give a flying Hippogriff about how many calories there&apos;s in my food. I&apos;m hungry, and I&apos;ll eat. It&apos;s just a matter of remembering to order that sideline salad to go with the grease. o3o reply hill. August 01, 2011 21:32:35 Yes, always i always look at calories! reply Boris Badinov August 01, 2011 21:31:11 No, never It would give you some math to do while getting through the line. I enjoy Subway and have a couple of favorites. I don&apos;t see this having much impact. reply Crabby August 01, 2011 20:02:34 No, never I&apos;m not fat so I don&apos;t pay attention to that stuff.... plus I just don&apos;t care. reply Xerxes August 01, 2011 19:51:24 Well, sometimes I used to eat Starbucks banana nut bread for breakfast cos I assumed it was healthy and lo-cal, but then when Starbucks was required by the State of NY to post calories, I realized that the banana nut bread had about 600 calories while a bagel with cream cheese has just 300, so I switched. Yes, I do often check the calories, and sometimes I change my order based on the calories - not always, but sometimes. reply Ben August 01, 2011 18:42:02 No, never You know if something is good or bad for you. You don&apos;t need a chart to tell you if a particular food is okay to eat. Brains are cool. Use them. reply Xerxes to Ben August 01, 2011 19:53:54 +2 So from just using pure brain power you can tell that a slice of banana nut bread has twice the calories of a bagel with cream cheese? Somehow I doubt it. People DONT know if something is good or bad for you - sure SOME things one can tell, other things one can&apos;t tell. Information is always useful, and calorie information provides useful information that is not readily apparent. reply Paul August 01, 2011 17:49:46 (edited) Well, sometimes Would make me think twice if there were loads of calories in something compared to the rest on the menu. reply tmr30 August 01, 2011 17:43:41 Well, sometimes Most of the times :D reply Emily August 01, 2011 17:15:52 Well, sometimes +1 I want to eat healthy and reduce the calories. But high calorie foods taste so much better! reply Paul to Emily August 01, 2011 17:50:49 (edited) Everything bad for you tastes nice.........typical! :( reply Emily to Paul March 09, 2012 21:13:17 If I think about it; it makes sense evolutionarily. Humans were beasts of feast and famine- stocking up before long periods (a day or more) of starvation. So, if you had to survive and hunt for food after a single large meal, you&apos;d choose high calorie, and lots of it. Leading to the current predicament; high calorie tastes goooooooood. It&apos;s evolution. And we need minimum 1 million years to evolve as a species. So, we&apos;re stuck for now. (This was from WHEN? I really don&apos;t pay attention!) reply Abbra Kadaver August 01, 2011 17:08:23 Well, sometimes +1 I generally look for the ones with the highest calories knowing that 90% of the time they will have the best flavor.

Non fat? What&apos;s that?

 reply Gosia Pyrek August 01, 2011 17:05:03 No, never i dont even look at the calorie counts :D reply moviebuff August 01, 2011 17:03:47 Yes, always Iam shocked at how many calories certain things have. It makes you think what are you putting in your body. reply Little Fawn August 01, 2011 17:03:29 No, never I don&apos;t care about calories. I&apos;ve got a super high metabolism and don&apos;t get fat no matter what I eat, so it&apos;s not like I gotta watch my diet or nuthin&apos;. reply Kigan August 01, 2011 16:35:46 (edited) No, never +1 I usually know what they are before I order. I take that and other nutritional info to make an educated decision on how what I&apos;m ordering will impact my health.

A little responsibility for myself has gone a very long way. reply KeithL August 01, 2011 16:03:46 (edited) Well, sometimes +1 There are occasions when I&apos;m in the mood to just eat something horrible and seeing the nutritional information isn&apos;t going to deter me. But on MOST occasions, I try to choose something that isn&apos;t outrageous in caloric and fat content. I&apos;m a big guy by nature and it&apos;s always been a struggle for me. I have no choice but to eat right or become obese. I sniff a Whopper and gain 5 pounds. reply merlinskiss August 01, 2011 15:39:25 Well, sometimes +1 We eat healthy and do watch what we order. Having said that, we also do not deprive ourselves of a splurge. The trick is to live a balanced life and that is a lifestyle choice. My simple philosophy is &quot;To much of a good thing can be bad but to much of a bad thing certainly is!&quot; I break that rule for lobster, crab, oysters, clams... I think you get the idea... ;-) reply Bramblestarofsunclan August 01, 2011 15:33:07 Yes, always +1 it helps a little bit reply Cathy Cook August 01, 2011 14:55:51 Well, sometimes +1 Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I like to eat healthy. reply
