 The Best Low Carb Salads at Fast Food Restaurants 
 Nov 20, 2009 | By Judy Bruen 
If you are counting your carbs, most fast food restaurants provide low carbohydrate options on their menus. There are many salads with less than 30 g of carbs per serving for you to choose from at different restaurants. Make sure to pay attention to dressing and serving size; both can significantly increase carbohydrate intake. While most low carb diets recommend between 60 and 90 g of carbohydrates daily, dietitians and health experts recommend consuming no less than 100 g to 150 g per day. Carbohydrates fuel your body and provide energy for exercise.

The Premium Southwest Salad without Chicken, the Premium Bacon Ranch Salad with Crispy Chicken and the Premium Caesar Salad with Crispy Chicken each contain 20 g of carbohydrates. The Bacon Ranch Salad with Grilled Chicken and the Premium Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken contain 12 g of carbs. The Premium Southwest Salad with Grilled Chicken contains 30 g, the Premium Bacon Ranch Salad without Chicken contains 10 g and a side salad contains 4 g of carbs.

Subway

Subway offers many salads that contain very low amounts of carbohydrates. The Ham Salad, Subway Club Salad, Turkey Breast Salad and the Turkey Breast and Ham Salad each contain 12 g of carbohydrates.

Fat Free Italian Dressing contains 7 g while Ranch Dressing contains 3 g of carbohydrates.
 
Arby&apos;s
