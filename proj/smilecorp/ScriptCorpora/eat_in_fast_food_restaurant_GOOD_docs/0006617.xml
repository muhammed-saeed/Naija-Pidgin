Whenever I&apos;m in Sacramento I love coming to this Wal-Mart Super Center because: it&apos;s right next to the freeway, convenient, LOTS of parking, lots of cashiers&amp;it&apos;s not so busy.

The only problem I had was yesterday was at Customer Service. The Asian lady crossed off the wrong on my receipt and she said the salami wasn&apos;t on my receipt when I just purchased my items less than 15 mins ago! The cashier had to enter the amount and the Asian lady said &quot;She shouldn&apos;t have done it that way&quot; like OK do I work for you guys? I don&apos;t really care.. Just finish my return! Other than that, I will come back for my future purchases.

Just to start this review, I would like to thank the person who flagged my last one.  ;)

Anyways, I can&apos;t stand walmart, ya the prices are good, but when I have to deal with the people that go there, the staff that work there and the amount of people that go there, I would much rather give Target my business.

NOTE:  NEVER go there on the 1st of the 15th of the month.....

Yes, I&apos;m yelping a Walmart. I never thought this day would come, but omg what a bunch of idiots.
Went in to make copies of 2 keys. After 30 minutes I get two keys, one of which is 1/4 inch longer than my original. The dude says, &quot;ya, it doesn&apos;t match exactly, but you should take it home and try it anyway,&quot;....after he rushes me to pay first. Then he couldn&apos;t get the receipt machine to work to give me a receipt so I could return if necessary. Eventually I was so tired I just left...and when I got home, the other key didn&apos;t work either. Suh-weet.

Now here&apos;s a Walmart that&apos;s a cut above the rest!  Do I impress that easily?  I think not!  This store is massive and for good reason.  It&apos;s a department store, grocery, deli, pharmacy, gardening, hardware, optometry, customer service, financial, beauty salon, fast food restaurant, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;m leaving out a lot more!  Now you might say that most Walmarts have the same conveniences, but this place is more expansive than your average store with the same low prices, plus there is plenty of spacious parking.
I don&apos;t get to shop here as often, because it&apos;s out of my way, but when I&apos;m in the neighborhood, we always end up here.  I especially appreciate that they have a larger array of crafts, cake decorating and baking supplies.
It&apos;s always a pleasure to shop at this Walmart!

I love this Walmart so much better than the one in Natomas! This one has friendly staff and no one makes an issue about couponers.  We also never have a problem with crowds because we go early in the morning.

I&apos;d say Walmarts are all pretty much the same. Big, cheap prices, same crowd, and crazy lines at the cash register. Only thing I like about this Walmart in particular? Probably that it&apos;s not too far from me, other than that nothing really special.

A little piece of my soul dies each time I shop at Walmart.

I try not to shop here but where else am I going to shop at when I need something at 1 AM. What haven&apos;t you ever gone on a late night cleaning binge?

Speaking of shopping at 1AM, why in the heck is the dang parking lot full at 1AM? I&apos;m not trying to be funny, it&apos;s a real question! The economy is supposed to be in the tank yet Walmart&apos;s parking lot is always packed! My other question is why are there always families with children shopping at 1AM? Seriously CPS where are you when we need you?

This particular Walmart is a Super Walmart. Self titled I should mention. It means it has groceries. Walmart is supposed to be less expensive but for what I usually buy I find the same prices or sometimes better at the West Sacramento Raley&apos;s Supermarket. Plus Raley&apos;s has happy helpful employees! (...and Raley&apos;s sells Go Girl Energy Drinks, Walmart does not!)

I&apos;m not going to bad mouth Walmart anymore, instead I am going to just suggest that they treat their employees better so that they treat their customers better, or at least smile! (And possibly consider carrying my favorite drink!)

I will say that of all the Walmarts that I have been too this particular Walmart is by far the cleanest. It&apos;s actually even cleaner than the Roseville/Rocklin Walmart which is shocking if you judge the two by the neighborhoods they service.

Ugh, I shop at Walmart from time to time but I don&apos;t recommend it.

However everyone has different tastes and expectations, Walmart didn&apos;t end up offering the experience I hoped for but that doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t for you. I recommend trying them and making your own informed decision. Think and decide for yourself, don&apos;t mindlessly follow the crowd.

Thank you @SacramentoMarko

I hate going to Walmart alone. Even with my giant pink keychain pepperspray I cannot shake the feeling that someone is going to jump me for my milk and chips purchase. I think all the creepy guys come here to find their next baby mama who will support them with their current child support money.

Example, I went to Walmart with my home girl one night:

Guy chilling in his car in the parking lot: &quot;Hey girl! How are you doing?&quot;
Me: &quot;Fine, thanks.&quot;
Guy: &quot;Nice night we are having huh?&quot;
Me: &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s great.&quot;
*Gets in car quickly*
Homegirl: &quot;He&apos;s hella trying to holler!&quot;
Me: &quot;Ew. He&apos;s not even cute.&quot;
Homegirl: &quot;He&apos;s in a Mercedes tho..&quot;
Me: &quot;He&apos;s in a Walmart parking lot. He probably broke into that car.&quot;

Rodeo, CA

With how outrageous the prices are at grocery stores lately (extreme couponing is looking less and less crazy..!!), going to Walmart is really a good way to buy groceries for anyone trying to stick to a budget.

But as big as this Walmart is, why are the baking ingredients I want to buy ALWAYS out of stock when I get there after work?!  One day after a really stressful day at work, I was hit with the urge to bake a huge batch of chewy ginger cookies, and all I needed was one simple bottle of molasses.  I searched the baking aisle and found nothing.  Then I headed to the aisle where they store their pancake mixes, and there, next to all the rows of syrup, I found an empty gap where the molasses should&apos;ve been happily sitting.

So I went ahead and asked one of the employees if they had any more available.  All I got in return was a blank stare that evolved into a near-Snape-like sneer which made me feel like I was a poor Hufflepuff who had turned in a Potions paper 5 minutes late.  He then sighed out a robotic response of how they only re-stock things at night, and so right now, they&apos;re sold out of molasses and to come back tomorrow.

MAJOR sad!panda face at you, sir! Other employees had at least attempted to look for an item just in case I hadn&apos;t been searching properly in the right aisle, but this guy just stood there and made me feel like I was interrupting Very-Important-Business. There is a major difference in a how a customer can feel if you at least TRY to help out.

I&apos;ve also had sad!panda moments when I&apos;ve looked for the following, only to see empty spots on the shelves: cake flour, active yeast, pure vanilla extract (this one being sold-out made sense at the time since it was Thanksgiving week...but all the more reason to keep it in stock!) and almond flour. ALMOND FLOUR!! How many people are out there making french macarons?! Really?!

However, I DO realize that what I tend to look for are things that AREN&apos;T generally bought on a daily basis,  and I should be happy that they carry these items at all, but it still is disappointing to see an empty shelf staring back at you.

On the plus side, they do have different kinds of lovely King Arthur flours readily available and an extensive Wilton section for anybody who loves to bake and decorate.

The one thing that REALLY and TRULY irks me are the solicitators (and sometimes, transients) that bother customers in the parking lot.  I&apos;m not talking about in front of the entrances to the store, but those trying to sell you things or ask for money NEAR YOUR CAR!  I don&apos;t know how much Walmart can do about this, but it&apos;s happened the last few times I&apos;ve gone shopping there.  Since I don&apos;t generally get to go shopping until the evening after work, it makes me really uncomfortable, especially because I go alone. It&apos;s the main reason why I take my business to the Target in Natomas instead during the work week.

My wife needs a liver transplant so we usually shop in the middle of the night to avoid the posability of her getting bumped or injured. We were shopping on December 23/24 at 2 AM, one of the guys with the pallet jacks was not looking were he was going, bumped my wifes cart and slammed the cart into her liver. The assistant manager came over with a blank look on his face, did not understand the ramifications of what had happened and said that he would talk to the stock people of being more careful. Is that really enough? They need to be more careful and aware.

I like this Wal-Mart because it doesn&apos;t have unbelievably slow lines like the one in Florin. In addition, I like this lay out at Wal-Mart. I usually go to this one because it&apos;s a lot nicer and there are a lot  more items in stock. Unfortunately though, I was looking for an emergency first aid kit, and they were all out.

I hate to give a positive review to a Walmart, because I generally do not support the store&apos;s policies. But I have to hand it to the auto center because I was just blown away by their quality, efficiency, and, of course, pricing.
I went in to get my tire patched and they took care of me right away for $10 (actually, pretty standard) but they did not try and sell me a bunch of unnecessary crap or try and convince me that I needed all new tires. May, at the counter, was very helpful and answered all my questions and I left feeling surprised how easy and simple it all was.

It&apos;s the god of all Walmarts! This one is a huge super center complete with an entire grocery store inside! It&apos;s your on stop shop when you need to buy anything and everything. They&apos;re open 24 hours a day which is awesome.  Anytime I&apos;ve needed to grab something they&apos;ve had it except for one thing; they do not have a fabric department! I&apos;m used to other Walmart stores having them and when I was in need for some fabric for a project I was currently working on, they didn&apos;t have it!

Even though they lack a fabric department, this store has pretty much everything else you could ask for.  Spaghetti strap shirts for $5? Heck yes! Just be sure to remove the Miley Cyrus brand so nobody knows.

Err WalMart! I really hate that I bother. I need oil changes and tired rotation quite frequently, and every time I come to you for service you DISAPPOINT me! Well, today was no exception, except this time I didn&apos;t even get serviced. I pulled in, behind a line of three cars.... waited.... waited.... cleaned out my car.... waited..... nothing! The two guys working on cars didn&apos;t acknowledge my presence and didn&apos;t even shout at me to go find someone inside. I know better... but I have windshield wiper blades to exchange and decided I&apos;ll kill two birds with one stone. Didn&apos;t work out. I&apos;ve given WalMart chance after chance because I can entertain myself by venturing over to IKEA since they take TWO HOURS to do an oil change and tire rotation; but no more! I&apos;m not even going to bother; especially since they&apos;re not acknowledging paying customer&apos;s anyway!

That&apos;s my rant. Thanks for listening :)

I have been to many Walmart&apos;s throughout Sacramento as they seem to be a staple in my friend&apos;s weekend errands and this is the best one I have been to - both in selection and customer service.  Their produce section is pretty expansive and there are a ton of healthy food options (fresh and frozen) to choose from.  Of course, good or bad, the prices can&apos;t be beat! The checkout lines can also be pretty long, but they do tend to move fast, and if anything, waiting is a great opportunity for people watching! :) The biggest con I would have for this store is that there are always people outside trying to get you to sign something or give money for something (most things that can&apos;t be verified as a legit organization) and that gets kind of annoying,,,

Wow! I&apos;ve never seen such a big Walmart before in my life. So I&apos;m from OC but I come down to visit the area because the BF moved up here recently. He needed to buy some last minute items and EVERYTHING he needed was at this location.
They have everything but the kitchen sink! I was surprised to see how clean and organized everything was. I wouldn&apos;t mind spending my weekend nights here.

OK, STOP. Before you pass my review up and de-favorite me or WHATEVER, read my damn review. I know it&apos;s long. But give a bitch a chance.

I think I am finally willing to publicly advocate WalMart. Before you groan, consider my frame of reference as a single, unemployed female. You must also consider that I take anti-anxiety medication, as needed, so the little things that bother most of you don&apos;t touch me. I don&apos;t care about hearing people yelling in English, Spanish, or Russian. I don&apos;t care about waiting in line while some lady maxxes out 3 credit cards in one go. I don&apos;t care about the people making out in the ear plug aisle. And I also don&apos;t care about the people in the food section that would rather hit my cart than say &quot;excuse me.&quot; I go to WalMart comfortably numb, people. I am hugely agoraphobic. I could not go here au naturel.

The logic is simple: Whatever you happen to be looking for, it&apos;s more than likely 33 percent cheaper here than it is everywhere else, including everyone&apos;s beloved bourgeois-Walmart, Target. For the short record, I have to take medicine to go to Target too.

I often hear people wax philosophically about WalMart dominance and how WalMart ruins small businesses. To this, I say, &quot;business is business and love is bullshit.&quot; Please save this argument for someone who is an idiot. To buy Vlasic pickles at Davy&apos;s food market for 4$, because you love Davy so much, rather than buying Vlasic pickles at WalMart for 3$ is a proclamation to all of humanity that you are lost (unless you own a decent part of Davy&apos;s market.) This goes for any and all products WalMart sells. For example, some of my favorites are 24 count Vicks Dayquil, Big Sexy Hair Shampoo, Frigo string cheese; I could go on. If you are paying 20$-30$ more per major shopping trip to protest the possibility that WalMart might take Davy over, you are doing it the wrong way and you are hurting yourself.

To be clear, say you don&apos;t go to WalMart because you can&apos;t stand the ghetto factor and/or it&apos;s far away. Or say you just hate WalMart for no particular (especially economic) reason. This review isn&apos;t talking to you. This is solely for the &quot;Anti-Walmart&quot; people that bitch about small business survival and Walmart&apos;s role in failing businesses.

All of you &quot;Anti-Walmart&quot; folk need to be writing to Vlasic, Vicks, Big Sexy Hair, Frigo, Kraft, Proctor and Gamble, Michelin and every other major manufacturer that offers products at WalMart. Complain about the deals they&apos;re giving WalMart and not Davy. I think that their answer to your complaint should move you to not only boycott WalMart, but also the manufacturers that supply WalMart. That is assuming, of course, that you have a backbone.

All I am saying is that there are 2 parts to every sale agreement: an offer and a purchase. Every sale therefore contains 2 decisions: One to sell and one to buy. Without a meeting of the minds, you have either extortion or theft. Everyone gets in a tizzy about WalMart buying, but I rarely hear people complain about the major manufacturers selling.

The next time you complain about the &quot;Big WalMart Takeover,&quot; make sure you complain about the manufacturers that facilitate the &quot;Big WalMart Takeover&quot; as well so you don&apos;t look like you get all of your viewpoints from music lyrics.

Do you brush your teeth with an Oral B toothbrush? Do you use Aquafresh, Colgate or Crest toothpaste? Do you rinse with Listerine mouthwash? I hate to be the one to inform you that you are, then, a part of the problem too.

Aside from all this, minus one star for ambiance, or lack of. Plus I am hugely weary of buying meat, produce, or plant life here (or anywhere, for that matter.)

I hate Wal-Mart and I avoid this place at all costs...but I needed an oil change today and heard they were cheap. I thought the trip would be a quick in/out with the oil change and I would be gone..boy was I wrong!

I am not a fan of having to get my oil changed and I typically avoid doing it at all cost..this might be why I was about 10,000 since my last oil change and I needed to get it done before I drive to LA this week.

I pull up and park since there are no signs saying you should pull into the bay. So park and go in. Wait in line for about 10 minutes before the lady working acknowledges me. She tells me to go and pull into the bay and wait for the guys outside to help me.

Go outside..pull car up by the bay. Wait about 5 minutes before one of the guys tells me that I need to go inside and have the lady help me.

So go back inside and get back in line. The same people who were in front of me are still waiting. All they wanted was to change 2 tires and they have the spare tires in the trunk. It took a 1/2 an hour for the workers to figure out if they could change the tire.

After a 1/2 hour of waiting in line it is finally my turn (only 1 person in front of me but it was a 1/2 wait). I tell the guy I would like an oil change and he starts to enter my information into the computer. Mind you this person did not know how to use a computer and was typing with one finger. It took him 30 minutes to take down my information then told me that there will be an 1 1/2 hour until my car would be done. They would call me when it was done. I was the only car waiting for an oil change so by the time he told me this I was less than pleased.

So wander around Wal-Mart for an hour while waiting. End up buying a magazine and a dog toy. End up waiting in line for 20 minutes since there is only 4 registers open. When I go to pay the guy ringing me up said I could not pay for my oil change up there even though the stub they gave me back at the oil change place said you could pay at any register. So I pay for my stuff and went and sat at the bench in the oil change area till they call me.

My car is finally ready after an hour and fifteen minutes. I go to pay and my card will not work. They have to call someone from upfront to fix it. It takes about 10 minutes for her to come and she could not get my card to work. She finally takes me over to sporting goods and my card works just fine. I was finally able to pay and leave. The manager who had to come and try to help me with my card told me I should have payed when I was upfront with my other things. I did tell her that he told me he could not ring me up and I had to pay back here. She did tell me that is not true and he should have let me pay upfront. It would be extremely helpful if employees who worked here knew what was going on.

All in all I ended up wasting over two hours here for something that should only take about 20 minutes. I should have not been cheap...Next time I am just going to go to Jiffy Lube and not waste my time at this place. What a joke!

Just another reason to hate Wal-mar t with a passion!

I hate WalMart.  Seriously.  I can count on one finger the number of things that I&apos;ve personally purchased at WalMart (why don&apos;t we make it my middle finger while we&apos;re at it).

But my husband swears that they have the best deal on tires, so when we woke up this morning to find his car had a flat, we drove over to WalMart to get it fixed.  While we were there he decided to get his oil changed (long overdue).

While we were waiting I walked around the store and was reminded why I never, ever come to WalMart.  This particular location is massive, but seemed almost entirely void of stuff I&apos;d want to take home.  The floor models of the furniture they have were already breaking.  I felt up some of their organic cotton sheets that I could have sworn were polyester.  How do they make organic cotton feel like plastic?  And after fifteen minutes or so of wandering I got a massive headache (weird lighting?  chemicals drifting off their products?  Who knows).

But, they get two stars because my husband got his car tire fixed, an oil change, a new bike tire tube, a tire pump, and some nails* all for under $60.

*Doesn&apos;t this just sound like a recipe for more hole in tire disasters?

Being clubbed over the head and dragged into an establishment against my own free will, only to awaken to the thin, cold steel grid of a shopping cart happens at least once a week. For me, at least. The culprit?

My mother. Also known as &quot;Big Edie.&quot; Is anyone getting this Grey Gardens reference?

When I finally regained consciousness and raised my head to a blurred vision of shadows, I realized I was in a warehouse. But, not just any warehouse, I could tell from the scent of pod-people I was in a Wal-Mart. Little did I know, it was a fucking SUPER Wal-Mart.

In a state of feral cat panic, struggling to catch my breath, my arms flinging in every direction...I tried to lift myself and my big derriere out of the Cadillac Coupe De&apos;Ville sized shopping cart. Just then, I was immobilized and surprised by the shock I had received from the shock collar. My mother casually still browsing the aisles as she gripped the remote-control padlocked to her wrist. I was stuck.

For some reason, I couldn&apos;t help but feeling as if I was in a scene of &quot;Idiocracy,&quot; and at any moment Maya Rudolph was going to use the payphone in the corner and ask for, &quot;Upgrayde.&quot; This place had everything, clothes, food, bakery, pharmacy, check cashing, liquor store, housewares...next  year...hospital.

A full on hospital with plastic surgery and amputations, and all available in their self-checkout line. (Automated voice) &quot;For amputation, please press 2. For elephant tranqualizers, please press 1 now. Now, place your amputated limb on the bagging scale. Please place your amputated limb on the bagging scale. Please place your amputated limb on the bagging scale. Please wait, customer service will be right with you.&quot;

When I made the joke, my mother said very seriously, &quot;Be careful what you wish for. I heard the owners of Wal-Mart and the founders of Kaiser Hospital are tightly knitted and looking to merge. You might just get a hospital in here afterall.&quot; She would know, she worked at Kaiser for a long time. But, if that was her idea of a joke, I was not laughing.

I just cried , covered myself with a baby blanket off the Clearance rack and went into a fetal position inside of my Cadillac Cart.

Things I hate about Walmart:

1) Shoddy craftsmanship. Everything is identical and poorly made. Buying it makes me feel like a poverty stricken drone.

2) Masses of ghetto people, especially if you make the mistake of going on a Saturday.

3) The so-called nice greeter lady who checks your receipt before you can leave the store. I don&apos;t enjoy being made to feel like a thief when I shop!

4) The moronic staff. I waited for a half hour while a staff member went to go check on a certain product for me. I finally spotted him on a computer and ran over only to be told, &quot;I couldn&apos;t find you!&quot; I never left the homewares section, buddy! Are you blind?!

All of this, added on to the fact that Walmart destroys the small business and creates a homogenous, cookie cutter society.

If you must go there (as I had to in order to buy a Christmas present for a family member that was only sold at Walmart), I will say that the West Sac one is less ghetto than most others I have been to. And that&apos;s the only good thing I&apos;ll ever say about this institution.

This Walmart has an auto center where you can get an oil change and also has everything else under the sun including groceries and foodstuffs. Granted, it is Walmart, so there will be ghetto people but that&apos;s half the fun, take pictures and put them on People of Walmart. One stop shopping. Customer service is sub-par at best, but good deals as is the custom at Walmart. I&apos;ve had mixed results with their produce, it can be cheap but sometimes it sucks badly, roll the dice and you may get lucky though.

&quot;Amerrrrica, Amerrrrica, God shed his grace on theeeee! And crown thy good, with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.&quot;

As a flaming liberal, I know I&apos;m not supposed to go to Wal-Mart. I know this and understand completely the pros and cons of big-box stores. But everyone&apos;s a hypocrite - so go jump off a cliff vegans. Sorry, j/k. Just go shop at Nugget, OK? I don&apos;t need the lecture. There&apos;s these things that occur every decade or so called &quot;recessions&quot; and we&apos;re in one right now.
What happens is, collectively, everyone stops spending money because some rich fatcat on the East Coast thinks it&apos;s funny to throw a few trillion dollars on the roullete table and put it all on black. When they lose, the rest of us do too. Such is life. Frown face. :(
What ultimately ends up happening is everyone gets paid less money and you can&apos;t spend as much as you used to.
This is where Wal-Mart comes in!
This store tries to sell almost everything cheaper than its competitors.

Now here&apos;s the catch! If you hate people, well then this is not the store for you. Because a ton of people shop here and they are in the store all the time. Lots of them. Many of them are poor. And this society judges poor people pretty badly. The assumption is they are stupid or irresponsible. But you know what else is irresponsible and stupid? Judging people before you get to know them. Suck on that one elitist!
I grocery shop here because it&apos;s a SuperCenter. They have everything every other grocery store has but it&apos;s cheaper.
So sue me when I&apos;m richer for trying to save a dime and some time, but I&apos;ll hopefully be joining the vegans at Nugget by then.

If I ever needed to have a baby in secrecy, this would definitely be the Wal-Mart to do it in.

It&apos;s open 24 hours, has a grocery section in addition to the regular stuff, and has huge aisles.

&quot;MUST GO TO WAL-MART!!!!&quot; * zombie face! *

Ever watched the South Park episode on Wal-Mart?!?!?  If you haven&apos;t, you should!!!  It&apos;s exactly how they described it.  A one-stop shopping store where the &quot;incredible bargains&quot; are addicting!!!!!!  HAHAHAH

Wal-Mart is fun.  I used to go two times a day.  Used to, but not so much anymore for &quot;personal reasons.&quot;  LOL.

Where else can you get food/supplies for cheap especially at 3am?!?!?  Two words.   Wal-Mart Supercenter!

I try not to think about the fact that I am actually in Walmart when I go in here, but sometimes my budget doesn&apos;t allow me to buy everything at Safeway or Target. So hello Walmart, how is it going.

When I come to Walmart though, I make it a point to search for things that are &quot;Made in America&quot; (yes folks, it DOES exist at Walmart) but sometimes I can&apos;t find everything made in America that I need.

Good place for produce, not sure where it comes from, but overall it&apos;s pretty fresh. Tomatoes are a good price. Lettuce and everything else is pretty decent too. The sheer size of this place can be a bit overwhelming, and pretty soon you have spent 4 hours trying to decide on a toaster oven.

I haven&apos;t been here in a few months (budget hasn&apos;t been thhaattt tight) but I might go, pick up some necessities and then hoof it to Ikea for some swedish meatballs.

3 stars for not being the grimey-scum-of-the-earth title that other Walmart stores deserve.

Please do not contribute to the demise of all that is good and right in the world by shopping at this Wal-Mart or any Wal-Mart for that matter. The $5.00 or $15.00 you save at the check sand today costs American&apos;s millions in lost jobs tomorrow. Buy fresh. Buy local. Buy American.

 http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/… 

As for the review: I&apos;ll just copy the same plan somebody else wrote over and over and over and over again, act like it is ground breaking and a service to the community just like Wal-Mart does. Oh and I&apos;ll even throw in no health care for free with the review!

Driving over the bridge used to be such a rush seeing the big blue box IKEA store, now I&apos;m annoyed that they allowed a Wal-Mart in such close proximity to such a progressive place that stands for the exact opposite of  their ethics.
I do mildly appreciate that the outside is less ghetto and there isn&apos;t a mc donald&apos;s in side, though this probably is because they were pressured to do it this way.

i went inside and the place is huge and has everything under the sun. it was busy, but less crowded than the natomas location. i still felt dirty afterwards and was afraid i might have touched products with unsafe levels of lead. I went to IKEA to purify my soul and wash my hands.

I am biased as I still have never shopped at a Wal-mart and never will.

A Special thanks goes to Drew T. for supporting content used in this review, even tho I didn&apos;t ask you if I could use it (I felt it was fitting by not asking considering the nature of the review (you also conveyed my sentiments precisely. Thanks!)).

OPEN A FRIGGIN REGISTER ALREADY!!!!

Yes, this place is huge.  But does that really matter since there is never enough registers open?  I have tried to buy frozen food and after standing in a line that goes back into the clothing section its melted and practically wasted by the time I am able to pay for it.

I have nothing against wal-mart but whoever is running this store needs to come to the front once in a while!!!

A little more than average Wal Mart! In fact, the biggest Wal Mart on the West Coast-claimed by a worker there.

I was quite impressed at the size and structure of this place. They carry the usual items plus groceries as well! The fact that it was new, made the place clean, organized, and even parking wasn&apos;t a problem. Unlike other 24 hour Wal Mart locations, visiting late at night didn&apos;t require having to walk over people or lost items on the floor.

Oooh what a fancy Wal Mart! It was a pleasure for once walking out of Wal Mart not feeling scummy  :)

Oil Change Review

I usually come to this Walmart for my oil changes only because I&apos;ve been coming here for a while now and the men in that department know exactly what sort of oil change I&apos;m looking for (the $26.00 oil change please).

This location is so big that it usually takes me just a good thirty minutes to walk from one end to the other.  I have to confess that although the clientele does differ greatly from the Target crowd, I don&apos;t feel that perturbed to realize that it does exist here over the bridge.

This super center hosts a supermarket in addition to their garden center and oil change/tire center.  Usually my oil changes take under thirty minutes or so and I&apos;m able to waste it by also keeping a cap on the number of much cheaper items to purchase on my way back to the tire department.  In addition, they utilize the loudspeaker to notify oil change patrons that their car is ready.

I just had one done today and think I&apos;m ready to drive back to SF tomorrow knowing that my oil has been changed.

The Wal-Mart superstore in West Sacramento is where I come to do my grocery shopping.  I usually try to come on a weekday as opposed to a weekend as it can be quite the zoo of people at times and God knows I do not have the patience for slow peeps who hog the grocery aisles.

I find their prices to be more than competitive.  I can get a whole lot more for $100 bucks here then at Raley&apos;s, Bel Air or Safeway even with Safeway&apos;s club card.

I also like that I can pick up makeup, shampoo, toothpaste, etc.  I have noticed that makeup here is usually a few bucks less then Target, Ulta or CVS.

One thing I have noticed is that the cashiers are slow as molasses, but with that said I will still make the trek out here for the groceries.

Yeah, I said it, I love Walmart.

I mean really, other than whores, what dont they have here that you need? And hell, they probably have some of those too.

I love getting my oil changed and taking care of the shopping. The oil change here is a straight $30, and I love avoiding Jiffy Lube at all costs. And BTW, to Ms. Emily below, the reason they couldnt ring you up at the front register is that your car wasnt done yet. Until the car is done, and they know how much to charge you (sometime you need extra oil and that costs $$$), it wont ring up.

To the strict anti-Walmart person, you will hate this place. But to those that have had bad expriences elsewhere, this is probably the nicest Walmart you will ever go in. Clean, well lit, and for the most part they have stuff in stock. And the prices are a solid 40% cheaper than any other grocery store. Yes, the employees are sub-human mutants, but you get that everywhere. If you want beautiful employees that will kiss you ass, look you in the eye, and speak understandable English, dont come here. Go to Nugget and pay 50% more for groceries. This is Walmart, dont expect it to be what it isnt.

If you go on a Sunday, the lines will be a mile long, with hardly any registers open. The place is 24 hours, so try to go late at night / early in the morning.

To be honest, no matter where it s located I love Walmart. I love the website http://peopleofwalmart.c… ....Its a laugh riot!!!!!

BUT....of all the Walmarts I have been to, I really must say the West Sac location es mi favorita. I could get lost for hours in there and buy the whole store.

I especially love their grocery section! Everything is priced so low and I even like the wal mart brand, Great Value. Due to the oh so low prices,I am able to spend 40 bucks and have enough food to feed myself and maybe make a few dinners for friends for 2 to 3 weeks!

I also recently got my oil changed there and the mechanics were very friendly and let me know what things I need to have fixed in the future, but were not urgent now.
