 By: wendyjeffers@msn.com   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrapbook cup holder and bag I love this tool. I order 8 of them. I am preparing to start a community workshop group and gathering this up to have available for use. I first saw something like the one I bought at a Creative Memories Scrap Book day. Creative memories I was told use to sell these. They do not any more. I have never seen these before and they are wonderful. I am not sure why local stores do not carry them. I think they are as essential as some of the tools we use for keeping organized and having a place for your drink when working. I opened one of them and clamped it to my kitchen table to see how it works. It is very sturdy. I hghly recommend it to anyone. I had a really hard time finding one. I also noticed that they are on back order now. I am really glad I got my 8 when I did. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: bujgirl   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-MaBob is fantastic I love this. I now have no fear of spilling my drink on my work. I primarily bought this product as a drink holder because I have had so many near misses and drink &apos;rings&apos; on my work when I&apos;ve placed either hot or cold drinks on the table (condensation and paper do not mix!). Also, because the trash bag is now off the table too, it allows me to only have my &apos;useable&apos; items on there. It gives me extra room to spread my layout and embellishments.

 By: Leness4316   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-Ma-Bob is Great!!! This had to be designed by someone who either does or knows someone who does scrapbooking. It totally avoids any chance of spilling any drinks and ruining your project and at the same time gives you a place to throw out any paper scraps while working. This is great to take on crop nights!!!! I even found someone who is creating a custom color bag instead of the bag that comes with it!!! Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: lsboedi   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Must Have for Scrapbookers A freind of mine had one of these at a weekend crop we attended last year and I had to have one! It&apos;s easy to assemble, stores easily if you take the bag and holder off and fits into my supply bag so I always have it. I don&apos;t worry about water rings on my photos or paper because everything is out of the way, giving me more room to spread things out! Love it! Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: Castle Scrapper   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Genius little invention! I ordered this item because it was on sale with a few reservations that it wouldn&apos;t be large enough for me. I was wrong! The scrap holder will hold a lot more trash than you think! It is also so much easier to dump your trash into a container at table level as opposed to bending down to a trash can in the floor. It&apos;s a fantastic addition to my scrap table.

 By: retiredtchr08   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Wonderful Tool for Retreats Creative Memories had a similar item but they no longer carry it. I believe I got the better end of the deal with the Scrap-MaBob. It works great, and although I haven&apos;t tried it, I think it will hold other trash bags as well as the one it came with. I WOULD recommend this to a friend and in fact I bought one for her! Comes at a very reasonable price too. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: scrappersusan   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-Mabob I love this item. I won one last fall at a scrapbook retreat. It is gerat. It keeps my glass away from my project.

My best friend has a birthday coming up in May. We are going to another retreat and she needed one. My sister makes jewlry/bows and some scrabooking. She saw mine and loved it. Well she has a birthday in May, so she gets one too. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: SongbirdVB   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars I love this! The Scrap-MaBob drink holder is fabulous. The drink holder portion is big enough to hold a large glass (think super-sized soda at a fast food restaurant) and deep enough that I don&apos;t worry about tipping. And having the trash bag right at the table has made cleanup go a lot faster. This is one of those purchases I&apos;m VERY glad I made! Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: nanascraper   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars GREAT I just received my MaBob and I love it. I have tried for several months to buy one and they are so popular they sell fast. I like the idea I can remove the trash holder if I&apos;m not at a crop, it fit perfect on my table and I will recommend the MaBob to all my friends.
I rate it more than 5 stars actually.

 By: lindasue156   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars a MUST have tool!! I am a quilter who saw someone at a retreat with this item..It is AWESOME&amp;for any crafter!! anyone who wants to prevent spills&amp;keep scraps off your work table can use this. I would suggest buying several - one at your work table, one to take to classes/retreats&amp;one next to your chair. this is also a great gift. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: tucker009-crafts   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars The Wonderful Scrap-MaBob I love the scrap-MaBob. It&apos;s nice to have something to drink right at hand without any accident ready to happen. The little trash bag will come in so handy away from home so I can be neat&amp;clean where ever I craft. I bought one for a friend in England too. I will be taking it to her when I visit in June. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: bsktqueen   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-MaBob is a hit I would recommend this to any scrapbooker. The trash can holds allot, very handy when you are working. The cup holder holds a very large drink and you never have to worry about spilling it on your work. I gave them to my sister&apos;s for Christmas and they LOVED them!! Must have for any scrapbooker!!

 By: dmknab   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-mabob This is by far the best add-on I have ever purchased. I use it for quilting and attach it to my sewing cabinet. I place my Brooklyn Revolver on the part that holds the cup and can cut my quilt squares quickly and have no mess. Love it. I bought 3 , one for me and 2 for friends.

 By: wienermom   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars YES, YES, YES This was definitely worth the money and a great NEED to have for scrapbooking or any type of crafting. Keeps the beverages away from your work and you have the handy trash receptacle. I&apos;ve been looking for something like this for ages and stumbled across this. GREAT BUY.

 By: PAMPORRED   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars SCRAP-MABOB I LOVE IT. NOW THERE IS NO FEAR THAT I WILL SPILL MY DRINK ON THE TABLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL MY SCRAPBOOK FRIENDS. I LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE CM SIDEKICK. THE ONLY DOWNFALL IS THAT I WAITED FOR 2 MONTHS FOR IT TO BE IN STOCK. (SO GRAB THEM WHILE YOU CAN.)

I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars scrap-mabob Every scrapbooker should own one of these, great to clip on table edge(and its fits most every tabel I have tried) holds a large 32 oz. drink and the trash bag is large enough too.

 By: broughboys   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Great product! This product is very similar to one that used to be sold by another company but is no longer available. I am happy to have found this product as I wanted one of these for some time. They are essential, in my opinion, to any cropper to protect your photo projects. Report review as inappropriate

 By: scraping_mom   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   4 / 5 stars Scrap MaBob It is wonderful to have a place to put a drink in and away from your layout. I had one beopre and used it all the time. i am glad to be able to find another source for them. I am sure others have run into the same problem..
The olny thing I am disappointed in is that the opening for a cup is on the far right. On my work table and computer table I have a pull out tray that doesn&apos;t allow me to put in on the left. With it on the right it make it hard to reach the handle.
If there was a bar opening on both sides it fould easier for everyone to use
The bag is so easy to empty. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: dgardnermd   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   4 / 5 stars Scrapmabob is awesome The Scrap-MaBob arrived while I was out of town. My husband was home to receive it and it was a pleasant surprise for me when I arrived back home to find it waiting for me. I actually got to use it this past weekend at a crop. I sat my Starbucks Venti Iced Soy Chai Latte in the cup holder and as I scrapped, dropped my scraps in the trash bag. It was great! I could keep everything neat and not spill my drink. It comes apart very easily for emptying once full also. I love it and will use it at home and at crops. Great product. I recommend it highly.

 By: MscrapsCTMH   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   4 / 5 stars Good tool to have This tool is very handy. It securely clamps (via screw) to your table/workspace. The trash bag is larger than anticipated and great to have nearby. (To make trash collecting easier, I put a small plastic bag inside the black canvas trash bag. This works great.)

There is a little bit of assembly required, but it was a snap. Now there is no fear of spilling a beverage and my trash bag is always handy. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: cforrester   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   4 / 5 stars Glad to have one! I am very much enjoying this addition to my scrap room. The trash can is deep and of sturdy material. I also like that the drink holder is high enough to prevent spills from the Diet Coke can that&apos;s always in there. :) Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: segannasmom   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   4 / 5 stars Scrap-Ma-Bob Perfect for keeping your drink safe at crops, the only thing worse than spilling on your own layout is to spill on someone else&apos;s! Trash bag is too small, I replace it with a larger bag. Very handy! Report review as inappropriate

 By: i_scrapAlot   What&apos;s this? I recommend this product   3 / 5 stars No spills and gather your scraps. Okay my final item in my recent shopping spree with Scrapbook.com... who isn&apos;t always worried about spilling a drink on beautiful layouts or paper for that matter....Look no more because here is your answer and the best part is that it has a little litter bag....(spell that a few times). What would make this a 5 star itme would be to smooth out the metal it is sharp on the bottom and can snag your clothes...the other think is it would be great to have the bag lined in plastic for longer wear and tear...not to mentioned cleaner...it may not hold a lot of trash but it would be nice for placing scraps that you may want to keep for a later date. Thanks Scrapbook.com for always having wonderful discounts and products to purchased...and for outstanding service. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: DYnWV I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Handy Dandy I just love this design! The cup holder is big enough to hold my extra large drive thru drinks and my large coffee mugs. I love that it has &apos;handle&apos; slots on both sides, making it easy to place your mug no matter if you&apos;re left or right handed as well as where you may have to place the holder due to where you are scrapping.
The garbage bag is large enough to hold several projects worth of scrap pieces and it is really easy to remove and reattach to empty.
It does take a little time to screw the clamp into place but really, that&apos;s the only downside! Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: wyolass I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Hard to find if you don&apos;t know the name of the unit This drink holder and trash bag are just the greatest and the most convenient for anyone working in crafts, using the computer or just working at a desk or table. I bought one for my Mother, my daughter and myself and if others want them I will refer them to Scrapbook.com.
The pricing surprised me also. WalMart priced a like one at $5 more over this price plus freight, so I really feel that I got a great deal for a great product.
Thankyou Scrapbook.com, I&apos;ll be back!

 By: Mo_N_Jo I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Awesome tool I bought one of these about 8 yrs ago when another company made it. I loved it and it was accidentally broken. I&apos;ve been looking for another one. I miss it. It was so handy and I was able/willing to clean up as I scrapped. Plus, I loved having my drink holder right there but off the table. I want to get two at least but it is never in stock. I think I&apos;ve been waiting at least 6 months for it. Please get them back in stock and keep them. Please!

 By: Cricutgirlg I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-MaBob-Drink Holder and Trash Bag I love being able to keep my scrap table free of wet liquids. People stop me all the time to ask where I got this tool from. Everyone wants one. I can even use a plastic grocery store bag as my garbage bag. So no waste. Because its larger than most drink holders, I can drink from a big drinking bottle. Love it so much that I own 4 of these and will buy another. I use them for friends when they come over.

 By: hawksmet I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars LOVE IT!!! I got a Scrap-MaBob for Christmas last yr. I use it everyday either in my scrapbook room or my office! I love the fact it keeps beverages off the table/desk when I&apos;m working, especially in my home office! I&apos;m so afraid of ruining my laptop with a spilled drink!

I also use the attached wastebasket! It hold much more than expected! It&apos;s a great product! I highly recommend it! Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: tsolorio I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Awesome drink holder I love this product. I am so glad this store sells them! I have been looking for these for sometime. I have used them in the past at scrapbooking retreats but had a hard time finding them. I just completed my scrapbooking room and now have a place to put my drink. Thanks again.

 By: kamyer9305 I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Awesome tool! I LOVE this thing - the trash bin is pretty good size and it&apos;s so convenient to have your drink and trash off the table, but close and accessible. Creative Memories used to have this, but I missed out on it, so I was excited to find one!! Report review as inappropriate

 By: Maggie55 I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Scrap-MaBob-Drink Holder and Trash Bag I really like this product. I have searched many stores and online sites and did not find any. This one surpasses the ones I have seen being used by others at the different crops I have been to. Report review as inappropriate 
 
   
 By: Scrapper_Char I recommend this product   5 / 5 stars Sturdy and Well Made! This is a great cup and trash can holder. The trash can is large enough for a few sittings worth of trash. The cup holder can hold a big 32oz cup with a handle. I highly recommend this. Report review as inappropriate
