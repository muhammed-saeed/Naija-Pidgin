 HEATING OIL 
 LOCK? (updated 06/04/12) It&apos;s getting darned close to short 
 term low...if the Euro implodes, then prices could drop all the way to 
 $60/bbl...I&apos;d think about&quot;laddering&quot;or prepaying 50% here... 
 NATURAL GAS? (updated 06/25/12) No doubt we&apos;ve either hit a 
 bottom and/or now have support for the price. The 50DMA is 
 ascending slightly. Which means your hedges and/or locks should be 
 in place.

 07/09/12: Lost a week of data 
 due to a death in the family. 

 06/4/12: Timing is everything. Look at the prepay offer below and then look at today&apos;s cash price. It&apos;s a shame they couldn&apos;t buy options and then lock the prices as they 
 drop. 

 05/21/12:  Pipeline 
 Petroleum is out with their 2012 prepay for heating oil...$3.57 for a 
 minimum of 350 gallons. 

 05/14/12:  Busy beaver Jarod 
 from Hess did an analysis of all of my minor accounts. I switched 
 everything that was firm UGI to NT for $5/mcf. If nothing else, at 
 least they&apos;re all on one page! Why now? Take a look at the 
 $/mmbtu chart...see the price crossing over the moving average? First in a longgggggg time......! 

 04/30/12:  Sayonaro Sunoco...the 
 company was sold to Energy Transfer Partners. 

 Is the bottom in for gas prices??? I doubt it, but traders love to look for those bounces and pile on 
 expecting price to retrace its downward movement. The problem 
 remains a lot of supply and no demand. 

 04/11/12: &quot; Another 
 flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody 
 wants to do maintenance.&quot;  Kurt Vonnegut 

 04/10/12:  Here&apos;s a story that is keeping me from locking down any more gas at these 
 prices... 

 04/02/12:  What does that 
 wholesale number ($26.10) above tell you? Correct! Natural 
 gas is now the base load fuel while coal is getting displaced. I 
 can&apos;t recall seeing this occur in the last 15 years. 

 03/12/12:  Decisions, 
 decisions...do I lock the remaining 20% + NT +DS or do I ride it 
 out? All I can say for certain is that power = gas and power is 5 
 cents/kwhr! Can our energy budget go to zero?!  

 02/27/12:  Thar she blows! 6 oil just blew through the 2008 high. Meanwhile, back in reality, 
 gas continues to bounce around at $2.77! Despite all of the 
 political rhetoric regurgitated by the pundits, I think we&apos;re back to 
 good old supply and demand. There really IS a global worldwide 
 recovery under way, no matter how small, and demand is rising in Asia, 
 Europe is freezing, and the Soviets are thirsty. Here&apos;s a link to 
 a decent article: www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-real-reason-gasoline-prices-have-been-surging-in-the-us-2012-2 

 Brain teaser #2: why do rising 
 gasoline prices always get met with saber rattling? What don&apos;t we 
 understand about the fact that we import 66% of our oil? Even my 
 sole source vendors have at least one alternate. Cheap USA oil is 
 NOT a global goal. This is NOT a USA issue. I think it&apos;s 
 great that Detroit was at the brink of extinction and survived...now why 
 can&apos;t we build something to compete with the Prius C? The 4x4 that 
 gets 35mpg will sell like hotcakes. 

 02/20/12:  Brain teaser: why is gasoline getting close to $4/gallon with oil at $100/bbl when the 
 last time this occurred oil was at $147/bbl??? Look at the #6 oil 
 price chart (link above). Record highs. But this is 
 happening at $100/bbl, not $150? 

 01/23/12: (Snooze you loose 
 alert)  Howard Weil notes, in response to weak 
 natural gas prices , CHK has announced swift and deliberate actions 
 that are healthy for the overall natural gas market and prudent for the 
 Co. Initially, CHK plans to immediately curtail 0.5 Bcf/d of dry gas 
 production, with the potential to increase to 1.0 Bcf/d if conditions 
 warrant. As a result of these actions, CHK now expects production 
 declines in the Barnett and Haynesville, which will likely lead to flat 
 or lower natural gas production in the U.S. in 2012. Firm views the 
 decisions discussed above as a positive for CHK and the natural gas 
 industry. It also expects more producers to be reducing dry gas rig 
 count through 2012 as low natural gas prices persist. 

 01/04/412:  I just analyzed the 
 2011&quot;heatmap&quot;of all LMP prices over 24x7x365...THERE WERE ONLY 9 DAYS 
 WHERE PRICE&gt;10 CENTS...Jan 1x, Mar 1x, May 1x, Jun 3x, Jul 2x. The average real time price for the year was 4.61 cpk. We paid 50% 
 over the RT price. This is exactly what was predicted. How 
 do you&quot;beat&quot;this market? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible. 9/365 days scattered across 5 months? Geez, I would have had to 
 buy contracts for 5 months. No, I think we need to plow into the 
 day-ahead market with some kind of limit protection. 

 12/21/11: (Ugh)  FBR Capital says on first read, they do 
 not see any major modifications to the final Utility Air Toxics Rule &apos;s 
 methodology, limits, or timing. As a result, they reiterate their view 
 that the rule is very strict and will result in significant coal 
 retirements . Firm expects the profile of a compliant unit to remain 
 largely the same, typically sporting a scrubber and fabric filter. This 
 means that a full suite of equipment is one of the paths to compliance 
 with all three silos of this Final Air Toxics rule. They are 
 maintaining their view that the most likely outcome is 50 GW of coal 
 retirements by 2016 .  T4 comment: without replacement 
 units on the drawing board, what do you think will happen to wholesale 
 power prices? I can&apos;t argue for mercury, but I can argue for 
 SOMETHING to replace the coal-fired generation. 

 12/12/11:  IRAN MP SAYS MILITARY TO PRACTICE CLOSING STRAIT OF 
 HORMUZ TO SHIPPING; IRANIAN MILITARY DECLINES TO COMMENT - RTRS 

 And then they retract the story! And we 
 wonder why oil prices are unstable? 

 12/05/11:  Iran, drones, 
 threats, Syria, ... More MENA issues goosing the market yet again.  

 11/14/11:  The IRAN issues 
 seem to be goosing the oil market right now because the Euro-zone is 
 imploding, not expanding. 

 The Pennsylvania Public Utility 
 Commission voted 5-0 to issue a Tentative Order, for public comment, 
 containing proposed interim guidelines to accelerate the switching 
 process for electric customers. Currently, switching to an electric 
 generation supplier (EGS) or even switching between competitive 
 suppliers can take between 16 and 45 days due to the various regulations 
 and company procedures that are in place. The procedures are designed to 
 protect customers from slamming or unwanted switching. However, the 
 delays in switching are seen by consumers as a lost savings opportunity 
 and can lead to customer frustration, the PUC said. The goal of the 
 proposed guidelines is to shorten the time frame needed for a customer 
 to switch electric generation suppliers while providing necessary 
 customer protections. The changes include elimination of the 10-day 
 waiting period that is initiated when the electric distribution company 
 (EDC) sends a letter confirming a change in EGS to the customer; and 
 substitution of an account transfer letter for the confirmation letter 
 sent by the EDC to the customer. 

 11/07/11:  If you&apos;re looking at 
 the $/mmBTU graph, remember that natural gas is now trading the Dec 
 contract and basis has jumped. Here&apos;s a classic for those of you 
 who participate in demand management...we caught a load of crap because 
 we didn&apos;t reduce load for a PJM emergency last week...of course we were 
 NOT connected to the grid due to loss of both 69KV lines! Guess 
 they need to asterisk that one... 

 11/1/11:  History in the 
 making...no power at Lehigh since Saturday at 1:06p...one campus has 
 never been without steam since 1960! 

 09/26/11:  Last Monday&apos;s 
 meeting had some fairly timely advice, no? One week later, 
 precious metals (including copper) are tumbling, oil broke, and the US$ 
 got stronger. Patience. 

 09/09/11:  Anybody read about 
 the Southern CA power outage that affected 4 MILLION people? One 
 worker. One substation. One maintenance task. But hey, 
 deregulation is good for all, right? This stuff NEVER happened 
 when DOUGs (Dumb Old Utility Guys) were in charge. 

 09/07/11:  Finally someone prints what many feel about the whole green movement. .. 

 08/29/11:  There will be a brief 
 30-minute T4 meeting on 9/19 @ Muhlenberg, prior to LVAIC Facilities 
 Directors meeting. 

 08/09/11:  Take a look at the $/mmBTU 
 graph...I think we&apos;re going to flatten those lines back to 2009 
 levels...and how about natural gas?! Under $4 last week...this 
 should make a serious dent in electricity prices moving forward. 

 08/02/11:  Take a look at that 
 July 11 LMP that just went up...LOWER than last year despite record 
 temps and demand! 

 07/27/11: From a German study: &quot; Solar panels only achieve their maximum capacity in the 
 laboratory and at optimal exposure to the sun (1,000 watts per square 
 meter), an ideal angle of incidence (48.2 degrees) and a standardized 
 module temperature (25 degrees Celsius, or 77 degrees Fahrenheit). Such 
 values are rare outside the laboratory. All photovoltaic systems are 
 inactive at night, and they also generate little electricity on winter 
 days.&quot; 

 07/17/11: Whoa! Why did 
 the Cal12 basis just jump by 8 cents after sitting at 63 cents for 
 months??? That&apos;s a 12.6% increase... 

 06/27/11:  I was on vacation 
 last week...WOW! Take a look at what happens when countries set 
 out to break the backs of speculators! But no, the market is 
 efficient, right? There is no speculation, right? See you on 
 Wednesday at STEPS. 

 06/13/11:  The WTI-Brent spread is trading over $20 
 this morning as WTI prices pull back to trade near $98, while Brent 
 prices trade toward the $120 level. Brent crude oil is sourced from the 
 North Sea and is used as the benchmark future for prices in Europe. WTI 
 crude oil is the underlying commodity for the NYMEX futures contract and 
 is the benchmark for crude oil trade in the US.

The spread, which traded to a record $20.93 earlier this morning, highlights the difference in fundamental views between Europe and the US . 
 Brent prices are currently being driven by forecasts for higher demand 
 in the back half of this year, OPEC&apos;s inaction at its most recent 
 meeting and some premium for geopolitical risks. There are also reports 
 of production problems in North Sea oil fields.

While WTI appears to have some geopolitical risk priced in, high stocks 
 in Cushing, questions about demand, and comments out of Saudi Arabia 
 implying the country will hike output to whatever the market needs, have 
 all weighed on WTI prices. 

 06/09/11: Wow! One would 
 think that the sky is falling based on all of the Energy Connect 
 alerts...guess what? Price month-to-date is 6 cents average. Last night we saw one hour at 0.46 cents. That is not a misprint! 

 05/16/11:  Patience pays 
 off. I&apos;ve quoted natural gas every month since last October and 
 just pulled the trigger on a one year deal at the lowest price in the 
 last nine months. I&apos;m still not convinced that gas has bottomed, 
 but it has been sitting there on that 50-day moving average which is as 
 good as it&apos;s going to get for the short term. $5.40 for the year. 

 05/05/11:  Cinco de Mayo. BINGO. So there&apos;s no manipulation in commodity prices, eh? And our supply/demand curve just shifted in one day to cause a $10/bbl 
 DROP in crude? No. Read my note below. 

 04/11/11: This commodity move, 
 including oil, is eerily similar to May 2008. My gut feeling is 
 that something will come of the blue (interest rate hike? End QE?) 
 to burst the bubble very quickly. If you look at the oil 
 storage charts, we are literally drowning in oil. The&quot;Fukushima 
 bubble&quot;in gas is also starting to deflate. 

 03/28/11:  My Spidey sense is 
 tingling...take a look at the natural gas price vs. the moving average 
 on the $/mmBTU graph (above). This might be the week to lay out a 
 hedge on gas prices... 

 The big PPLICA meeting is tomorrow. Time to see how our PUC complaint is progressing. 

 03/17/11:  Here is a TEPCO presentation on the 
 spent fuel storage at Fukushima . Remember when we discussed&quot;Black Swan&quot;events? Who had spent fuel on the radar? At 
 least the Japanese had begun to consider the implications by moving 
 toward a dry cask system. I&apos;m sure money prevented the full-scale 
 implementation of the strategy. Editorial: if you watch TV 
 to get your information, you are not informed. I caught a few 
 programs last night and they all had some kind of&quot;spin&quot;behind the 
 talking heads. Bottom line: the Japanese knew the risk and 
 were in the process of building off-site storage using dry casks. The disaster hit before they completed the job. The accident 
 happened...now it&apos;s time to deal with it, protect citizens, clean up, 
 learn from the mistakes, and move on. Eliminating nuclear power is 
 not the solution. We&apos;re spending untold billions on protection 
 from terrorists, yet most of us realize that eventually someone will 
 succeed. Unless we give up on electricity, we need something to 
 create steam to turn the turbines and only a fool believes that a single 
 fuel source is the answer as we all know what happens to a monopoly. 

 03/14/11:  NIMBY fear vs. a US 
 energy strategy? The rush to once again condemn nuclear without a 
 gathering of facts is foolhardy. Comparing Japan to Chernobyl is 
 ludicrous. One country had a 9.0 earthquake and (so far) no 
 meltdown. Folks who don&apos;t understand the technology and shout down 
 nukes offer what as an alternative? Clean coal is decades 
 away...if that&apos;s where we&apos;re headed, OK. But guess what? Deregulation has essentially destroyed any hope of large central 
 stations in the US. We&apos;re in trouble if we rely on this 4-yr D v R 
 game. 

 03/07/11:  And so it shall be, 
 that without any intelligent energy strategy, the USA is doomed to the 
 prophets of wealth: FBR Capital&apos;s analysis suggests a favorable 
 U.S. legal framework for exporting LNG through existing 
 terminals. However, they note the inherent legal risk and powerful 
 political opposition to widescale exports that could stall efforts to 
 build significant export capacity in the future. Broadly, they note that 
 there
is substantial policy risk to exporting LNG, including&quot;NIMBY&quot;objections that helped delay construction of import projects in 2000s, 
 as well as opposition from powerful industrial consumers of electricity 
 and natural gas. However, their reading suggests that proposals to add 
 export capacity to existing import terminals are largely free from the 
 significant challenges that face green fields development, and they 
 detect little coordinated opposition from energy consumers or 
 environmentalists at this time. 

 02/28/11:  Boom! There 
 goes the old $100/bbl limit! Now it remains to be seen if this is 
 the beginning of the end for sane oil prices or a geo-political goosing 
 until Libya gets settled. Oil has no impact on our budget other 
 than motor fuel. Natural gas drives our heating (and electric) 
 prices. As noted above, last July was as good as it got in terms 
 of lock. It would have made sense and was noted. 

 Interesting anomaly on the #6 oil 
 chart...see how Hess prices have exceeded the historical $100/bbl line? This might be a little price fixing...but who is there to stop them? There is no real competition. 

 02/25/11:  Interesting story in 
 this month&apos;s Mechanical Engineering that supports my theory of 
 early adopter failure. New research indicates that vertical-axis 
 wind turbines spaced four diameters apart had power densities 
 10-15x those of&quot;standard&quot;wind farms! And these turbines were 
 only 10 meters tall...that&apos;s a heckuva lot smaller than the behemoths 
 we&apos;re used to seeing. 

 02/21/11:  It looks as if 
 every event in the Middle East is poised to jack oil futures. Interesting divergence between&quot;benchmark&quot;WTI prices and London. As you can see on the oil chart, #6 is acting as if we&apos;re already past 
 $100/bbl. Gas continues to drift down toward my buy point. 

 02/14/11:  I don&apos;t want to 
 start any conspiracy theories, but isn&apos;t it funny how Hess is 
 simultaneously goosing the #6 oil price while recalling natural gas? Crude prices have been dropping while #6 continues upward...  

 02/07/11:  I&apos;m targeting 
 April as my short term buy point for FY12 natural gas. I believe 
 this cold weather will pass and we&apos;re going to hit a lull headed into 
 hurricane season. 

 02/03/11:  Just returned from AHR Show in Las Vegas. Travel was dicey on Tuesday...OK late last 
 night. Global warming? Vegas was 28F on Tues night! But the Europeans have it down...increased water mass means more 
 moisture in the air for bigger storms? I have to think about that 
 one. The presentation is ready. Guess we just need to pick a 
 sunny day to meet. The nat gas price drop is due to the fact that 
 we&apos;re trading the March contract now and basis is way down. 

 01/24/11:   Just returned 
 from St. Martin. It&apos;s 0 F here. It was 80F there. Ugh. First item on my desk...PPL bill...$200,000 billing error. Day 7 
 of a Hess/UGI gas recall...we&apos;re committed to 10 days max...hope they 
 planned it right. Nice little positive surprise on oil inventories 
 last week. Note how heating oil is now priced cheaper into the 
 future. I still don&apos;t like the spike in the natural gas basis 
 numbers. 

 This is an early warning on the 
 presentation next week. Ordinarily I have handouts, but the date 
 change clashes with my return from the AHR show in Las Vegas and I may 
 have to stick with Powerpoint and then follow-up with the file if you 
 want/need it. We&apos;ll see what develops over the week. 

 01/10/11:  Uh-oh, the Alaska 
 pipeline has shut down. Let&apos;s see how this affects the $100/bbl 
 target that is so clearly where we&apos;re headed very soon. 

 01/03/11:  Things to do in 2011: file formal complaint against PPL with PUC. Check. Watch 
 commodity prices soar. Check. Return call from Matt Connor 
 (3p, day before holiday)...not done. 

 Three days and a total of less than 
 24 hours of time skewed the average power price for the month of 
 December. In other words, 4% of the time resulted in a solid 1 cpk 
 cost increase over average. Who manages the outage schedule on PJM? Another unintended consequence of deregulation. 

 Oil inventory update...we&apos;re 4% 
 higher than last year and 8% above the seasonal five-year average! Hello Mr. Tax Cut Extension, meet Mr. Gas Tax. Our&quot;savings&quot;just 
 flow right back out of the budget into oil company profits. Unless 
 you don&apos;t drive? But that point is moot because oil plays a role 
 in getting nearly every product we consume to our homes. 

 12/26/10:  Nice little XMAS 
 surprise from PPL...they&apos;re trying to extort an&quot;undercollection fee&quot;for real time pricing in 2011. The call to the lawyers has already 
 been placed...but it is a holiday week. Crude continues to destroy 
 US GDP as it marches toward $100 despite plentiful supply. We&apos;re 
 getting squeezed by speculators again as hot money is chasing paper that 
 will never be converted into physical. 

 Depressing read by Paul Krugman in 
 today&apos;s NY Times that implies commodity prices are rising due to demand 
 from the rest of the world while the US remains mired in a recession. His economist perspective coins the term&quot;finite resources&quot;. 

 12/20/10:  Whoa! Tetco Jan 
 basis now $3.15! And the Cal12 basis just leaped higher by a 
 dramatic amount... 

 FBR Capital believes that current 
 operating margins are insufficient to incent the required level of shale 
 gas investment needed to balance the market beyond 2011. As such, firm 
 says either cost structure needs to adjust materially lower or natural 
 gas prices need to go higher for margins to become investable. As They 
 do not see an abatement of service costs in the near future, they 
 believe natural gas price increases will have to provide the margin 
 improvement. Therefore, they are raising their 2H11 forward natural gas 
 price forecast to $5.50/Mcf from $4.50/Mcf. 

 Plus, I just read a news clip that 
 said Carl Icahn now owns 5.8% of Chesapeake Energy. Here we go 
 again...Wall Street is in the house. 

 12/15/10:  Note the 4 cent 
 jump in Cal 12 basis...that&apos;s a 9% move in one week! These are the 
 little&quot;hidden&quot;fees that really cause inflation. 

 12/06/10:  Don&apos;t look now, 
 but oil is testing long-time resistance at $90/bbl. It&apos;s not a 
 supply issue... I&apos;m wrestling with the gas market and whether or 
 not to use this $5 price point as a hedge. As for fuel oil, there 
 is NO futures premium, which means we don&apos;t have nor anticipate any 
 storage/supply issues. 

 12/02/10:  Nearly all of the 
 year-over-year change in November LMP was driven by a few HOURS of high 
 pricing during the 11/15-11/18 time period. This was probably an 
 early maintenance outage constraining supply while weather didn&apos;t 
 cooperate. Betcha December comes in lower... 

 11/29/10:  It&apos;s to time to 
 review your choices for RS service in PPL territory. If you check 
 out the OCA website, it looks like Dominion is in the lead for low cost 
 offer...maybe 10% below last year&apos;s low price.  

 In case you haven&apos;t noticed, the 
 natural gas price has established a short-term floor. If you take 
 a look at the $/mmBTU chart, you&apos;ll note that we&apos;ve broken over the 
 moving average where price is now ABOVE the trend. This is the 
 indicator that says lock if you&apos;re so inclined. 

 11/08/10:  QE2. Ugh. As the dollar gets hammered, commodities (ie hard assets) spike up. Given the Fed&apos;s preoccupation with inflation, this is exactly what we&apos;re 
 going to get as pump prices will soon cross $3/gallon. This has 
 nothing to do with supply. 

 Here&apos;s a good story about how the cost of green projects continues to scuttle them...I 
 especially like some of the comments regarding nuclear. 

 11/01/10:  That big jump in 
 NG-spot is due to the fact that we&apos;re now looking at the December 
 contract and the basis jumps accordingly. 

 10/26/10:  Beware Joe Whitaker 
 of EnergySavingsNow...uber-salesman. He comes on site with a 0.25 
 HP demo motor and black box...I use a kwhr meter to prove he&apos;s 
 wrong...then it&apos;s a push from the home office...then we show the papers 
 detailing the scam...then it&apos;s more talk... Here&apos;s the problem: if the black box is so good, and there is a guarantee on the savings, 
 then why do I have to pay $3000 up front for the&quot;survey&quot;? I have 
 a bunch of white papers from EPRI and Eaton describing the scam. If this guy were selling cars, you&apos;d be hooked. Power factor 
 improvement does not help you in PPL service territory. 

 10/25/10:  Lot&apos;s of cross 
 currents on the PPL rate increase/decrease...big whoop! Single 
 digit percentage changes after the 30+% increase amounts to rounding 
 error. And let&apos;s not forget that the capacity charge is set to 
 decrease while the T&amp;D charges increase. 

 10/18/10: (Not so sure about 
 this one)  Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell has stepped in to block 
 the merger of Allegheny Energy with Ohio-based FirstEnergy by directing 
 the state Department of Environmental Protection to file a brief with 
 the Public Utility Commission opposing the deal. In a statement, the 
 governor said,“This merger would be a great deal for Wall Street and 
 Ohio, but terrible for Pennsylvania&apos;s workers and consumers.”He added 
 that the merger would reduce electricity competition, increase electric 
 rates and cost the state nearly 1,000 jobs.  (Reduce 
 competition? In what way? Or are we still clinging to the&quot;shopping concept&quot;?) 

 10/13/10:  The EIA has released it monthly Short Term 
 energy outlook; says it sees 2010 world oil demand up 2.1% vs 2009, sees 
 2011 world oil demand up 1.6% vs 2010.  

 Lots of press for Google on the undersea 
 wind power cable for the Mid-Atlantic. It&apos;s a feel-good project, 
 but out of the&quot;planned&quot;capacity of 6000 MW, they&apos;re starting with 1500 
 MW, which is less than the output of PPL&apos;s Martins Creek plant right up 
 the road on the Delaware. I guess we have to start somewhere.... 

 10/05/10:  Huge sales pitch from 
 Liberty Power...they started with are you paying over 8.7 cents and when 
 pressed claimed they could offer below 5 cents! They would never 
 veer from the script and could not distinguish between LMP and total 
 cost to consumer. I believe this is coming from PPL EU with 
 respect to kicking us out of LP4 HPS. 

 10/04/10:  Yikes! One 
 bullish storage report and it&apos;s off to the races on oil prices! 

 We just received a notice from PPL that they can&apos;t be bothered with 
 Hourly Pricing Service (ie real time) if your&quot;capacity obligation tag&quot;is less than 500 kilowatts! Thanks PA PUC...I see you&apos;re going to 
 force&quot;shopping&quot;no matter what it takes. 

 09/22/10: Let&apos;s examine how a 
 major airline is hedged:  AMR Corp disclosed updated fuel 
 forecast and heding positions...Co disclosed that its Fuel Hedge 
 Position for 3Q10 is 44% hedged with an average cap of $2.37 ($89 crude 
 equivalent) with 43% subject to a floor of $1.80 ($65 crude equivalent) 
 and for 2010 is 38% hedged with an average cap of $2.42 ($91 crude 
 equivalent) with 37% subject to a floor of $1.83 ($66 crude equivalent).  Notice how they&apos;re not 100%? 

 09/07/10: Mathematical 
 gymnastics...April thru August 2010 cooling degree days = 970 (vs. 599 
 for 2009). That means it&apos;s 62% warmer than last year. This 
 might correlate with the Aug10 over Aug09 LMP prices, but July blew 
 everyone out of the water. 

 08/29/10:  Here we go 
 again...51 days of summer 10 have had highs over 90F! And then we 
 follow up with a little fringe-hurricane? 

 08/19/10:  (From GDF Suez 
 newsletter)  

 Warning signs this summer easily can be interpreted as indicating 
 that prices for electricity, natural gas and coal could soon head 
 higher. Spot market prices for coal have been steadily increasing for 
 many months. In July, near-term prices for natural gas also began to 
 increase significantly in late July. As a result, an increasingly large 
 gap has developed between the current price of the front-month natural 
 gas futures contract and that from last year, when natural gas prices 
 were at rock-bottom levels. 
 Just as significantly, natural gas price volatility has been rising 
 significantly since March 2010. This upswing in price volatility raises 
 a red flag, since increased volatility often is an advance indicator of 
 burgeoning price spikes. Additionally, electricity demand began to 
 increase recently, even on a weather-adjusted basis. Electricity demand, 
 however, still is far below peak levels in earlier years. S ince 
 reserve margins remain ample, increased demand for electricity is not 
 likely to push prices significantly higher if fuel costs start to level 
 off. (which is kind of in line with my thoughts at the moment) 
 08/16/10: We finally broke the 
 PPL failure to bill us logjam...turns out they changed our meters and 
 their system crashed. Nobody told anybody that bills weren&apos;t being 
 generated! World class utility, eh? 

 08/05/10: Everything you need 
 to know about PPL&apos;s earnings release:  PPL&apos;s supply business saw 
 earnings soar amid&quot;significantly&quot;higher pricing , though 
 operation and maintenance costs and depreciation rose. Its U.K. and 
 Pennsylvania utility businesses saw operating profit drop about 17% and 
 20%, respectively. 

 Once and again, deregulation 
 helped who? The consumer? No way, no how. It&apos;s all 
 about business and profits, or the transfer of capital from us to them. 

 08/02/10:  Here we go again 
 with prices surging as the annual&quot;hurricane approaching&quot;news gets 
 rehashed.  

 And there it is! July. The 
 long-predicted summer spike came and went as the PJM cranked up air 
 conditioners. All I can say is if that&apos;s it, then so be it. 1 out of 12 isn&apos;t too bad. And August is starting out pretty good. What&apos;s really irking me is that E+ was running an alternate pricing 
 strategy for us and EU actually demanded $106 for our data! This 
 from the gang that can&apos;t get a bill out in less than 90 days. 

 07/19/10:  FY11 invoices are 
 out. Once again, there are economies of scale that result in a 
 lower year-over-year charge. Refining my economic comment below, I 
 think we&apos;re in the second year of a 5-7 year credit shakeout. Given how the consumer keeps the economy humming, I think there are only 
 so many iPads and iPhones to sell after which housing and debt repayment 
 are eating up what&apos;s left of discretionary funds. It&apos;s hot, but 
 low gas prices have kept power prices in check. 

 07/05/10:  As a contrarian, 
 I have to say that publishing a Robert Prechter interview in the Sunday 
 NY Times is probably a good thing as this guy is so bearish you might as 
 well sell everything you own, put it all into gold, and go live in a 
 cave! Too bad they don&apos;t take gold at Sams Club... I&apos;m still 
 leaning toward the&quot;lost decade&quot;model of Japan. 

 06/28/10:  Interesting 
 little news article 
 from a GDF Suez newsletter . It seems as if some State PUCs 
 didn&apos;t get the&quot;smart grid is the future&quot;memo! 

 06/23/10: I&apos;m absolutely amazed 
 at how&quot;unstressed&quot;the PJM grid remains in the face of this heat wave. $44.64 average for June through this AM. 

 06/22/10:  I saw the documentary&quot;GasLand&quot;on HBO last night. Wow. Eye opening. I urge 
 you to Google it and do a little research on&quot;fracing&quot;. The whole 
 Marcellus Shale find might not be as great as it has been laid out if 
 rural drinking water is at risk. If nothing else, excluding these 
 drillers from the Clean Water Act is shady. 

 06/21/10: Goodbye LFD...Hello 
 3-yr DSO of $1.37! 

 06/07/10:  Let’s discuss some of the mechanics behind 
 the hedge on gas that I just made. Short term prices broke through a 2 
 month base. But that’s not the whole story…long term prices have 
 actually been DROPPING in the face of this move! Hence the“risk 
 premium”of holding longer dated futures has dropped. In the end. I’m 
 right at my $7 target with non-interruptible supply. And if the market 
 goes nuts in the winter, I can sell some of that back and burn the $1 
 oil in my tanks. 

 05/20/10: LEED.  Please read this article . Somebody finally published what our VPs didn&apos;t want to hear... 

 05/17/10:  This gas hedge 
 has taken longer than what I wanted. First I locked my basis. Then I adjusted buy-limits for 80% volume. Now I&apos;m waiting for 
 confirmation. 

 05/03/10:  Thursday&apos;s 
 numbers were bearish and I&apos;ve adjusted my buy-limit order to $5.80. 

 04/26/10:  Looks like 
 Thursday&apos;s storage numbers are do or die for my gas hedge plans. The spot price is attacking the 50-day moving average and we&apos;ve had two 
 serious upward price spurts since 4/1. If the storage numbers are 
 bullish, I&apos;m going to hedge 80% of my forward load for 18 months. I&apos;ve missed the absolute bottom, but there are serious savings against 
 budget on paper. $1 million is still one million dollars. 

 04/19/10:  Bad news for 
 Lafayette and Lehigh...Sunoco is exiting the #6 oil business. This 
 leaves Hess as practically a sole source choice for the heavy stuff 
 because everyone else in this area is a reseller. On the natural 
 gas trade, we&apos;re once again at a critical juncture. Take a look at 
 the $/MMBTU graph (link above). Do you see how the natural gas 
 price is once again threatening to break through the moving average? I&apos;m ready to hedge some risk, especially if the price continues to show 
 strength in the face of poor fundamentals. 

 04/16/10:  Reuters reports that traders are looking to ship 
 surplus U.S. distillate stocks such as diesel and gas oil across the 
 Atlantic this spring as refiners boost runs faster than their 
 European counterparts. While Europe typically imports gas oil -known 
 often as heating oil- and the motor fuel diesel from the United States, 
 exports stopped in early 2010 and even flowed in reverse this winter as 
 the severe cold weather boosted demand in the U.S. east coast heating 
 hub. But since then, U.S. demand 
 has faded with the onset of milder weather, boosting stocks and 
 making the arbitrage play for these products profitable again. Several 
 oil trading companies are now looking for mid-range vessels to load with 
 gas oil from the U.S. Gulf to Europe, trade sources said. The diesel 
 arbitrage is also open and traders can make a profit of $15 a metric ton 
 from shipping the motor fuel from the U.S. Gulf to Rotterdam, Reuters 
 calculations show. A key factor behind the reopening of the arbitrage is 
 higher U.S. run rates as refiners return from spring maintenance. T4: welcome to the new world economy...in the past, prices would drop due to 
 excess supply... 

 04/14/10:  WSJ reports the OPEC maintained a cautious 
 view about world oil demand and gave no indication it might pump more 
 crude to quell the recent rise in oil prices... Since last year, most 
 OPEC ministers have had an informal preference for prices to trade 
 between $70 and $80 a barrel, a level seen as helpful for promoting 
 energy investment but without hitting consumer pockets too hard. So far 
 this month, however, prices—although off an 18-month peak hit last 
 week—have closed between $84 and $86 a barrel. But OPEC said it isn&apos;t 
 convinced those prices will persist for a variety of reasons, including 
 excess quantities of unused crude globally. It also isn&apos;t as optimistic 
 about demand as others. In the monthly oil -market report, the group 
 said it expects global crude consumption this year to grow 900,000 
 barrels a day, unchanged from its report last month, but representing 
 just half the growth level seen by some other oil analysts. Echoing that 
 restrained outlook, the group said it thinks world demand for OPEC 
 oil will come in at just 28.8 million barrels a day, a downward revision 
 of 135,000 barrels a day from its March forecast. 

 04/9/10:  WSJ reports a bitter political dispute between 
 this city&apos;s elected leaders and its powerful municipal utility threatens to push the city into insolvency as early as next month. Los 
 Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel warned this week that the city&apos;s 
 general fund could run out of money and fall $10 million into the red by 
 May 5 unless the Los Angeles Department of Water&amp;Power transfers a 
 planned $73.5 million payment it has so far said it would withhold. 
 Without the payment, the city would need to dip into its reserve fund, 
 leaving that contingency dangerously low in the event of other 
 emergencies. The Los Angeles utility, the nation&apos;s largest municipal 
 utility, said it wasn&apos;t making the payment because the city council 
 earlier this month failed to approve 
 substantial increases in electricity rates . Utility officials say they need 
 those higher rates to help cover the costs of investing in renewable 
 energy , such as wind and solar, that are mandated by state and 
 municipal laws.    T4: this illustrates a problem generated by&quot;feel good&quot;legislation without 
 regard for cost. 

 04/06/10: Highlights from the just released pro-cyclical 
 report out of the EIA: 

 EIA&apos;s projections for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil 
 spot prices have changed very little over the last five Outlooks even as spot crude oil prices continue to fluctuate on a daily 
 basis. EIA expects WTI prices to average above $81 per barrel this 
 summer, slightly less than $81 per barrel for 2010 as a whole, and 
 $85 per barrel by the fourth quarter of 2011. EIA expects the Henry 
 Hub natural gas spot price to average $4.44 per million Btu (MMBtu) 
 this year , a $0.49-per-MMBtu increase over the 2009 average, 
 but a significant downward revision from the $5.17 per MMBtu 
 projected in last month&apos;s Outlook . The price outlook is 
 lower primarily because of an average 2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) 
 upward revision to the 2010 domestic natural gas production 
 forecast. The annual average 
 residential electricity price changes only slightly over the 
 forecast period, averaging 11.5 cents per kilowatthour (kWh) in both 
 2009 and 2010 and then rising to 11.7 cents per kWh in 2011 . OECD Petroleum Inventories .  EIA 
 estimates that commercial oil inventories held in the Organization 
 for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries stood at 
 2.67 billion barrels at the end of the first quarter of 2010.  This 
 level is equivalent to about 58 days of forward cover, and 
 is about 69 million barrels more than the previous 5-year average 
 for the corresponding time of year. Although OECD oil inventories 
 are still projected to remain at the upper end of the historical 
 range over the forecast period, they are falling as a result of 
 higher oil consumption and OPEC production restraint. 

 04/05/10:  WSJ reports the Energy Department is preparing 
 to make sweeping revisions to its U.S. natural-gas production data after 
 finding it has been overstating output, raising new questions about the 
 government&apos;s collection of energy information. The monthly 
 gas-production data, known as the 914 report, is used by the industry 
 and analysts as a guide for everything from making capital investments 
 to predicting future natural-gas prices and stock recommendations. But 
 the Energy Information Administration, the statistical unit of the 
 Energy Department, has uncovered a fundamental problem in the way it 
 collects the data from producers across the country--it surveys only 
 large producers and extrapolates its findings across the industry. That 
 means it doesn&apos;t reflect swings in production from hundreds of smaller 
 producers. The EIA plans to change its methodology this month, resulting 
 in&quot;significant&quot;downward revisions in some areas, according to Gary 
 Long, the acting director of the 914 form, who led the review. 

 Sorry for the lost week of data...I attended an 
 energy auditing refresher at UW-Madison. I&apos;m intrigued by the gap 
 up in gas prices based on Thursday&apos;s storage report. One (holiday) 
 week&apos;s data point does not a trend make. It&apos;s refreshing to look 
 behind the curtains at a behemoth like UWM and see how a goliath 
 operates. Suffice it to say that we&apos;re doing pretty good.  

 Gotta love those LMP numbers as reported above, eh? Have I 
 mentioned to anyone that PPL HAS NOT BILLED US 
 (LP5) SINCE JANUARY!  They keep calling to explain and I 
 keep responding that they had 10 years to prepare! Nice job 
 boys. And how about the little distribution rate increase kiss? 

 03/26/10:  More data for you to consume...I started a new 
 row (see above) to track PPL&apos;s real-time prices for the new MP1 (old 
 LP4) rate. 

 03/23/10: California dreamin&apos;?:  PG&amp;E asked the 
 California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for permission to 
 change its system of residential electric rates next year. PG&amp;E proposes 
 to replace the 5 tiered rate system with 3 tiers. Customers in Tier 5 currently 
 pay almost $0.50 per kWh , compared to $0.119 for Tier 1 (baseline) usage . Under PG&amp;E&apos;s new 
 proposal, the top rate that 
 customers would pay -- in Tier 3 would be $0.298 per kWh . In its 
 new proposal, which would take effect next year, PG&amp;E would make several 
 other changes in its residential rates: In 2011, the baseline level of 
 usage in Tier 1 would be reduced from 60% to 55% of average use in each 
 climate zone. Some customers would see bills increase, while others 
 would see a reduction in rates at the highest tiers.-- Customers would 
 pay a flat monthly fee of $3.00 (or $2.40 for CARE customers) to cover 
 fixed costs of service.  The CHEAPEST power in Cali is 11.9 
 cents/kwhr! And residential rates will top out at 30 cents!! No wonder people are fleeing in droves!!! Hey, let&apos;s not forget 
 who started the whole deregulation trend. 

 03/19/10:  WSJ reports the U.S. government faces 
 shortcomings in producing its oil-inventory data, according to internal 
 Department of Energy documents, casting doubt on figures that affect 
 the production and prices of the world&apos;s most important industrial 
 commodity . The documents, obtained through a Freedom of Information 
 Act request, expose several errors in the Energy Information Agency&apos;s weekly oil report , 
 including one in September that was large enough to cause a jump in oil 
 prices, and a litany of problems with its data collection, including the 
 use of ancient technology and out-of-date methodology, that make it 
 nearly impossible for staff to detect errors. A weak security system 
 also leaves the data open to being hacked or leaked, the documents show. 
 Moreover, problems with EIA data underscore the hazards of depending on companies or other cos to self-report data . 
 Internal emails and a report from a consulting firm prepared in 
 September describe a process at the EIA that served the oil world well 
 in 1983, the first year that oil futures traded, but hasn&apos;t kept up as 
 the inventory data have become more influential and the nation&apos;s oil 
 infrastructure has become more complex . Which is why I haven&apos;t 
 relied on EIA data for years... 

 03/18/10: Natural gas...how low do we go? Another 
 bearish storage report this AM with 70F temps through the weekend. Meanwhile, the producers are tripping over each other to keep the income 
 flowing. I&apos;ve delayed any forward procurement yet again as this 
 market continues to plummet. 

 03/17/10:  AP reports the Saudi oil minister says OPEC 
 will keep output levels unchanged later today because the market is 
 enjoying&quot;good demand, reliable supply, beautiful prices.&quot;Ali Naimi 
 spoke ahead of a formal decision by oil ministers of The Organization of 
 the Petroleum Exporting Countries. He says that in light of the oil 
 market&apos;s current conditions there is no reason to increase or decrease 
 output. 

 03/15/10: LOOK AT THOSE CAL11 GAS FUTURES...THIS NUMBER 
 INCLUDES BASIS. Like I said, under $7 delivered? Party like 
 it&apos;s 1999! 

 03/11/10:  Here&apos;s a lengthy article on the current natural gas market that seems to 
 reinforce my theory on pricing. I&apos;ve just begun to solicit quotes 
 for 80% of my future supply, but this time I&apos;m using 3/6/9/12 month 
 terms. All of this theory on pricing is moot if the weather throws 
 a monkey wrench into the Gulf. 

 03/08/10:  If I can switch to LFD and lock down CY11 gas for 
 $7 @ the burnertip, I&apos;m a happy camper. It&apos;s clear that I&apos;ll be 
 under $7 in CY10. Remember, it&apos;s actual vs. budget. We put 
 in for a 0 increase and that makes the Budget Office happy. This 
 feels like a blowoff bottom week. The futures will NOT sell off as 
 hard as the spot month contract. 

 03/05/10:  “We’d love to tell you that solar power is as 
 economic as fossil fuels, but the reality is that it is not,”Lewis Hay 
 III, FPL’s chairman and chief executive, said on a recent tour of the 
 plant.“We have got to figure out ways to get costs down. As we saw with 
 wind power, a lot has to do with scale.”Good  story about challenges faced 
 by utilities. 

 03/04/10:  NATURAL GAS...Bull, bear, pig time. We&apos;re within a few % of a good buy point. Sooner or later the 
 geniuses on CNBC will start spewing the H word. (as in hurricane). I&apos;m still fence sitting with respect to power given how good we&apos;re 
 doing.... 

 03/01/10:  T4 is back from Saint Martin. Ugh. But 
 gas had a good (for us) week...down over 5%! No need for anything 
 other than propane in the islands for cooking. Power is good old 
 diesel gensets. Just saw my first LP4 bill...7.7 cents/kwhr. Heck, that&apos;s CHEAPER than before!!! 

 02/19/10:  T4 will be away next week and data updates 
 will resume on 3/1/10. 

 02/04/10:  Take a look at this story . Deregulation started in 
 California and now some out there have had enough! Of course the 
 utility is pissed! Events are coming full circle. Once we 
 get a bunch of little munis, then it will be time to reform fully 
 regulated utilities! 

 02/01/10:  We had a nice little spike in the LMP in January. Two Arctic blasts will do that to a winter peaking utility. So 
 what? Prices spiked to their highest when nobody was home on 
 campus. This cold stuff will be gone in 28 days and thoughts will 
 soon turn to Spring.  

 (we talked about this last week) WSJ reports the huge 
 floating stockpile of crude oil kept on tankers amid a global supply 
 glut is showing signs of shrinking, as traders struggle to make profits from the 
 once highly lucrative storage 
 play . The volume being stored at sea has nearly halved from a 
 peak of about 90 million barrels in April last year , according to 
 ship broker ICAP, and are expected to fall even further. Some analysts 
 have seized on the contraction as evidence that world oil balances are 
 tightening and the surplus that built up during the recession, when 
 energy demand in industrialized countries plummeted, is eroding. Crude 
 stocks both onshore and offshore have fallen from their peak in the 
 second quarter of last year, and land-based inventories in Japan, U.S. and Europe are now back to the 
 middle of their five-year range . Analysts expect them to continue 
 to shrink this year, and J.P. Morgan has even spoken of the risks of 
 a price spike . But the move to sell stored offshore oil means one 
 group of energy speculators don&apos;t anticipate such a spike in prices 
 anytime soon. One reason may be that appetite for oil in industrialized 
 countries, which plummeted during the recession, remains depressed. 
 Demand in the U.S. shrank 2% in the last four weeks from a year earlier 
 and supply is still plentiful. Moreover, spare capacity in oil-producing 
 countries remains high. 

 (Dr. Doom speaks...) Boston Globe reports Nouriel 
 Roubini, the New York University professor who anticipated the financial 
 crisis, said yesterday that the US growth outlook remains&quot;very 
 dismal.&apos;&apos; Speaking at the World Economic Forum&apos;s annual meeting, Roubini 
 underscored concern that measures to rescue banks and fight the 
 recession may be withdrawn too soon. Of a Commerce Department report 
 that showed economic expansion of 5.7% in the fourth quarter, Roubini 
 said,&quot;I think we are in trouble.&apos;&apos; More than half of the growth was 
 related to a replenishing of depleted inventories, he said, and 
 consumption was reliant on monetary and fiscal stimulus. As these forces 
 ebb, the rate will slow to 1.5% in the second half of 2010, he 
 predicted. He said that while the world&apos;s largest economy would not 
 relapse into recession, US unemployment will rise from the current 10% 
 amid mediocre growth.&quot;It&apos;s going to feel like a recession even if 
 technically we&apos;re not going to be in a recession,&apos;&apos; he said. 

 01/28/10:  “Isn’t it funny when you walk into an 
 investment firm, and you see all of the financial advisors watching 
 CNBC—that gives me the same feeling of confidence I would have if I 
 walked into the Mayo Clinic or Sloan Kettering and all of the doctors 
 were watching the TV soap opera General Hospital,”said a bond manager 
 friend. (from Mad Hedge Fund Trader!)  It&apos;s entertainment, not 
 real news. Do you think Goldman Sachs insider trades are reported 
 there? 

 &quot;He sees natural gas (UNG) retesting the old lows at $2.40.&quot; See:  www.madhedgefundtrader.com 

 01/26/10:  WSJ reports U.S. natural-gas prices, beset by 
 excess supply, tepid demand and mostly mild weather over the past year, 
 may be pressured even lower this spring if the winter heating season 
 ends with an excess of gas in underground storage. Utilities, marketers 
 and producers of natural gas stockpile the fuel during the fall and 
 spring when demand for gas for heating and power for cooling is muted. 
 Gas is typically withdrawn during the winter heating season, which the 
 Department of Energy defines as the period from Oct. 1 to March 31. But 
 if moderate temperatures leave an unusually high volume of gas in 
 storage by the end of March, contractual obligations and physical 
 constraints could force the companies contracting for storage to send 
 gas to market, driving prices lower. &quot;The effect on price could be 
 pretty substantial and would send a very strong signal to the market,&quot; said Jack Weixel, a director of energy analysis for Bentek Energy. 

 01/14/10:  Reuters reports the top U.S. futures market 
 regulator moved on Thursday to limit the role of big traders in once 
 high-flying energy markets, unveiling proposals to put a hard cap on the 
 size of positions that dealers can hold but offering a limited exemption 
 for big financial hedgers. The long awaited proposals, part of the Obama 
 administration&apos;s push to overhaul financial markets, will apply to the 
 four most-traded energy contracts on the two major exchanges. But it 
 remains to be seen if the limits -- which it said would affect only the 
 10 biggest position holders if implemented today -- are sufficient to 
 satisfy lawmakers who have clamored for regulatory action since oil 
 prices surged to a record $147 in 2008. The Commodity Futures Trading 
 Commission&apos;s proposals, subject to a 90-day period of public comment 
 before approval, would give it the power to limit big trader positions 
 based on a percentage of futures and options open interest across all 
 contract months on both the New York Mercantile Exchange and the 
 IntercontinentalExchange. While more rigid, the limits did not appear 
 strenuous compared to the exchange&apos;s own guidelines: A CFTC official 
 said that if the rules were applied today, for example, the limit for 
 NYMEX crude oil contracts across all months would be 98,100 contracts. 
 The NYMEX&apos;s own so-called&quot;accountability levels&quot;, which were frequently 
 exceeded, is 20,000 contracts across all months.   

  Reuters reports Pennsylvania Gov Rendell says to propose natgas wellhead tax that 
 would become effective July 1. Rendell says natgas industry does not 
 need to be&quot;nurtured&quot;any longer. Says says natgas co&apos;s will seek 5,200 
 marcellus shale well permits.  Hey Ed, maybe you should work on 
 some of those legacy obligations before taxing every last inch of PA?       

 01/11/10:  So far, the 2010 game plan is going as 
 expected...now it&apos;s Chinese demand goosing oil prices while the gas 
 bulls get slaughtered by reality. I fear that the unwinding of the 
 credit crisis has released the good old animal spirits in the 
 speculators who are once again aiming for that $100/bbl target. Fortunately we have 0 need for oil and we&apos;re in the cash market on gas. 

 01/05/10: JP Morgan reduces its 2010 gas price assumption to 
 $4.74/Mcf from $6.50; their long term (2013 and beyond) natural gas 
 price assumption goes to $6.80 from   
$7.50. Firm thinks the re-start of U.S. domestic production growth and an increase in LNG imports are both supply-related problems. 

 01/04/10:  Happy New Year! And welcome to 
 deregulation. Yup, the Dec LMP rose a tad...it was (and remains) 
 cold and PPL is a winter peaker, hence we see some price movement. But if this is as bad as it gets...? 

 Natty got whacked last week. All of those bulls can&apos;t overcome 
 the fact that more and more supply is coming on board in the USA. This AM, Chesapeake (a big driller) announced that production is 
 expected to rise in 2010 and beyond. 

 I&apos;ve grown tired of beating my head against the wall with PPL EU 
 trying to get details on the hourly pricing service. Looks like I 
 have to wait for our first bill in mid January to figure it out. 

 12/28/09:  Wow! I&apos;m reminded of&quot;irrational 
 exhuberance&quot;already! Gas and oil are ramping because the CNBC guy 
 said it&apos;s cold outside! And one Nigerian whacko has already 
 reignited a war in the Middle East! IMHO, we&apos;re back to the usual&quot;Santa Claus rally&quot;. Gas (via the UNG) has become THE hot stock on 
 the Street. When everyone is pumping...I&apos;d be a little cautious. Nevertheless, gas is at a very important resistance level. Which 
 means electric futures are at a very important point. It&apos;s really 
 intriguing to hear that some are cashing out gold and moving back to 
 commodities. 

 Take a look at the 6 oil pricing on the MMBTU chart...clearly this 
 commodity isn&apos;t flying out of the tanks. 

 Slamming 101. I received a notice from PPL EU that one of my 
 big accounts had been switched. So I call them (PPL) and GOT NO 
 HELP. Oh you have to call the supplier! Well golly gee whiz, 
 if I get switched without my approval and you won&apos;t intervene, isn&apos;t 
 that a problem??? 

 12/14/09:  Defecate or Get Off the John time for natural 
 gas... 

 Love the Morning Call&apos;s push to make everyone aware that we&apos;re 17 
 days away from the end of regulation. Two whole suppliers offer an 
 alternative to residentials and maybe two more cherry pickers are 
 waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, PPL HAS NOT YET RELEASED THE 
 INFORMATION ON REAL TIME PRICES THAT WAS DUE 11/20/09! 

 Why didn&apos;t Allentown publish the price they&apos;re paying for electricity 
 as part of their new contract? Wouldn&apos;t that help with 
 competition? 

 12/10/09: Cap and Trade vs. Carbon Tax: (from 
 madhedgefundtrader) I can tell you right now that cap and trade is 
 going to win the political battle over a carbon tax, hands down. Don’t 
 waste a nanosecond of your time even thinking about it. Obama doesn’t 
 wants to be tarred with pushing yet another new tax, and Wall Street is 
 gearing up to make a fortune in the new trading vehicle. Europe has 
 already adopted the system, and a Paris based exchange called Bluenext, 
 partnered with NYSE Euronext, trades Certified Emission Reduction 
 credits (CERS’s). Some 4-6 million CER’s trade each day worth $50-$75 
 million. After peaking last year at€30, CER’s crashed to€7.5 in 
 February and then bounced to€13.14 today. They are traded in 1,000 unit 
 lots, and are backed up with far month futures contracts. Check out 
 their cool website by clicking here. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have already set up trading operations in the instrument. The EC 
 government grants CER’s to green companies, which then sell them to big 
 polluters, which must buy them to expand their business. The true costs are passed on to 
 consumers . The system contributed to a 3.8% reduction in CO2 
 emissions in Europe last year. The current world market for carbon 
 credits is $126 billion, but if the US joins the system, that will jump 
 by $1 trillion. I was involved in the creation of the Japanese equity 
 warrant market in the early eighties, and I can tell you from experience 
 that new, poorly understood markets with spreads wide enough to drive a 
 truck through are a license to 
 print money for the early players. Perhaps there is hope after 
 all for the legions of traders, market makers, brokers and analysts left 
 unemployed by last year’s collapse.     

 12/09/09:  WSJ reports the head of the co, the biggest 
 emitter of carbon dioxide in the U.S., said advances in technology would allow the company to eliminate the 
 emissions from its coal-fired power plants by 2025 . Mike Morris, 
 chief executive of Ohio-based AEP, said his company&apos;s early experience 
 with a carbon capture and storage project at its Mountaineer power plant 
 in West Virginia had exceeded expectations . As a result, he 
 believes AEP will be able to retire 25% of its coal-burning power plants 
 and install advanced carbon-capture equipment on the remaining 75%. That 
 optimism represents a significant change for an influential executive 
 who, in the past, has been skeptical about the industry&apos;s ability to 
 capture and store carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas, in a 
 cost-effective manner.&quot;This still is an extremely expensive 
 undertaking, but the answer is near at hand,&quot;said Mr. Morris in an 
 interview. 

 12/08/09: Well look at this one:  Barclays Capital 
 notes after Monday&apos;s close, Pepco Holdings announced their intention to wind down their retail 
 supply business , signaling the end of 2009&apos;s on-going saga. The 
 business is expected to remain profitable as the contracts wind down 
 (~50% of the backlog will roll off by the end of &apos;10, with ~21% of the 
 backlog remaining at the end of &apos;11). Firm&apos;s previous ests incorporated 
 minimal contributions from retail supply, and as a result its ests and 
 price target of $17 are unchanged. Firm views Pepco&apos;s exit of the 
 retail business as a longer-term positive for the co and removes one 
 overhang for the stock. Near-term firm likes the decreasing collateral 
 requirements and liquidity benefits that will occur as the contracts 
 roll off.  RETAIL COMPETITION JUST ISN&apos;T PROFITABLE FOR WALL 
 STREET!!! 

 12/07/09:  1.3 million residential customers in the the 
 PPL territory and it comes to two alternatives! Direct Energy or 
 Dominion...to keep your rate increase at 20% instead of 30%. And 
 Dominion says no more than 35000 customers!  Yeah, 
 competition is alive and well in PA for the residential consumer. And why are the C&amp;I folks forced to call the used car salesmen (oops, I 
 mean electric suppliers) to get&quot;quotes&quot;? Why oh why can&apos;t these 
 numbers be publicly posted like prices at the gas station??? 

 Reuters.com reports oil prices are not reflecting 
 fundamentals , the United Arab Emirates oil minister said, 
 while his Qatari counterpart said there will be no output increase at 
 OPEC&apos;s meeting later this month.&quot;It&apos;s very interesting because we 
 are seeing very high stocks, very high inventories on the seas and yet 
 the price is quite comfortable,&quot;UAE Oil Minister Mohammed l-Hamli said, 
 adding the market was a little oversupplied . Qatar Oil Minister 
 Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said OPEC will not change its production 
 target when the group meets later this month.  T4: oil prices ARE 
 reflecting a weak US $. 

 11/30/09:  That big move in spot natural gas price is due 
 to TETCO basis moving to its winter level, not a big spike in the price 
 of the underlying commodity. 

 11/10/09:  WSJ reports the International Energy Agency 
 said a new global deal to limit 
 carbon emissions , if reached in coming months, could sharply curtail the growth in oil consumption in the years ahead as alternative 
 energy resources and efficiency measures are tapped. Global crude demand 
 may grow by justroughly 6 million barrels a day from current levels to a 
 total of around 91 million barrels a day by 2030 if a major agreement to 
 cut greenhouse gas emissions is signed and implemented by nations, the 
 Paris-based agency said in its annual World Energy Outlook. Without any 
 new climate change deal and developments in nonoil transport technology 
 like electric vehicles, global oil demand by 2030 is expected rise to 
 105 million barrels a day, which represents a downward revision of 1 
 million barrels a day from the IEA&apos;s forecast a year ago... The agency 
 said global oil consumption over the next five years is now expected to 
 grow to just 88 million barrels a day from current demand of 85 million 
 barrels a day. The projection is far below the 94 million barrels a day 
 the IEA forecast a year ago for total demand in 2015.&quot;This [downward 
 revision] is a result of the financial crisis and demand policies that 
 developed nations are putting into place,&quot;said IEA Chief Economist 
 Fatih Birol. 

 11/02/09:  Happy Monday! I&apos;ve decided to change the 
 LMP reporting somewhat. Instead of&quot;grossing up&quot;the numbers, I&apos;m 
 just printing straightforward averages. Then you can do the math 
 from there. The PPL E+ RT vig is due to be reported in less 
 than 3 weeks. 

 I wouldn&apos;t read too much into the natural gas price upward move on 
 the $/mmBTU chart. It&apos;s simply seasonal adjustment due to higher 
 TETCO basis.  

 10/26/09:  Take a look at the $/MMBTU chart. See 
 that anectodal $100/bbl marker line? That&apos;s a very powerful 
 resistance point. The #2 and #4 are getting real close. And 
 nat gas is getting pounded lower (as predicted) this AM. I think 
 the action last week is toppy. Sooner or later we&apos;re going to get 
 our budget ducks in a row and this endless $ drop will change direction. If you want to talk UGI DS negotiation, I&apos;m available online. Lots 
 more on this to follow in Jan at our meeting. 

 10/14/09:  Chesapeake Energy raised FY09 natural gas 
 production guidance to 815-825 bcf, up from 805-815 bcf. This 
 in the face of record storage? There are a lot of mixed signals coming 
 out of this large producer, but this is interesting:  The co 
 said the industry&apos;s cost curve is shifting rapidly and its very 
 important to understand . Up until five years ago, most E&amp;P companies 
 in the U.S. owned an asset base that was more or less the same as 
 everyone else&apos;s -- not true anymore and has significant implications! &quot;Shale haves&quot;will have very low risk F&amp;D costs&lt;$2.00/mcfe for 
 decades to come (and decreasing over time as efficiencies 
 increase and shale gas reservoir knowledge improves) while &quot;shale 
 have-nots&quot;will have F&amp;D costs&gt;$3.00/mcfe and increasing over time as most drilling will be increased-density, rate-acceleration wells in 
 existing fields rather than new discoveries.  And then they 
 spill the usual nonsense:  while U.S. natural gas prices are 
 soft today and there are strong indications that market forces will 
 create a strong natural gas price recovery in 2010 and 2011. Dramatically reduced rig counts and accelerating decline curves will 
 lead to sharply lower supply in 2010 and 1H2011 . First year U.S. 
 decline rates are&gt;25%, i.e.&gt;15 bcf/day. The co says, following a 
 natural lag from completion and well connection work, U.S. natural 
 gas production is likely to decline by 2-3 bcf/day YOY, or ~4%, by 
 year-end 2009 and rapidly fall to by 5-6 bcf/day YOY, or ~10% by 
 early summer 2010.  Of course they expect prices to rise! Their stock options are tied to it! 

 10/13/09: WSJ reports a new proposal to build a transmission 
 link to connect the nation&apos;s three major electricity grids -- Eastern, 
 Western and Texas -- is generating interest among energy policy makers 
 because of its potential to accelerate development of renewable energy. 
 The project, called the Tres Amigas&quot;superstation,&quot;to be built at 
 Clovis, N.M., would bring a major change to the U.S. electricity 
 infrastructure by improving connectivity. For example, power produced in 
 Phoenix at this point can&apos;t be shipped to Dallas. The lack of 
 interconnectivity is becoming a larger problem as the nation adds more 
 solar and wind energy to its supply. Much of that power is produced in 
 remote areas and needs to travel to distant population centers, which is 
 problematic under the current setup. Greater connectivity among the 
 grids could open up the market for some renewable-energy developments 
 because the electricity could be sold across a wider region or moved to 
 where it is most needed . 

 10/09/09:  Life is tough, but it&apos;s tougher when you&apos;re stupid.   John 
 Wayne     Sorry, but that&apos;s what came to mind when I read some of the lame online 
 comments to the Morning Call&apos;s PPL electric rate increase story. Sheeple just don&apos;t get it. Or how about wfmz.com? The 
 increase will only be 30%, not 35% as predicted? OMG! Thanks PPL. We&apos;re glad it&apos;s not as bad as predicted. 

 As for the rest of us, please refer to 
 your PPL LMP graph and note the placement of the POLR (assumed) line. Pretty close to reality, eh?! 

 10/06/09: T. Boone Pickens on CNBC says oil will average $80 
 per barrel next year. Hmmm... Followed by:  The EIA 
 released its monthly short term energy and winter fuels outlook; US oil demand expected to drop 1.7% 
 in Q4 compared to year earlier and natural gas inventories are 
 expected to set a new record high at the end of this year&apos;s 
 injection season, reaching more than 3.8 trillion cubic feet.  Duh! Yet I&apos;m still amazed how the media pundits rally around UNG 
 on an expectation of higher gas prices. See banner quote 
 above...when money has nowhere to go... 

 10/05/09:  Interesting data on natural gas. The 
 near month price has moved up significantly but the calendar 2010 price 
 hasn&apos;t moved one red cent. 

 10/03/09: Wow! They just don&apos;t get it, do they? The Morning Call runs a front page piece that might as well have been written 
 by a marketer. Big users pool together in&quot;HOPE&quot;for better 
 prices. Um, where does it state that anyone has been successful? Join the crowd or risk getting run over? What about the whole crux 
 of the problem? In other words, real time prices? I really 
 learned a lot from that story! Not. I don&apos;t know if its a 
 conspiracy or what, but just how does the larger group help you when 
 nobody even looks at your load profile? Is this the way we should 
 procure a commodity as vital as electricity? Thanks PA Legislature 
 for your help in repealing this idiotic law. Welcome to the 
 jungle. 

 09/21/09: The&quot;fast money&quot;crowd is ready to declare a bottom 
 in gas and goose the prices higher. Leveraged NG ETFs have surged 
 to record volumes. Does any of this sound familiar? Does the 
 name&quot;Amaranth&quot;spring to mind? They tried to corner the gas 
 market in 2006 and it took them down.  

 09/10/09:  The Wall 
 Street Journal reports the International Energy Agency Thursday revised 
 up its forecast for world oil demand for the third consecutive month, 
 citing stronger-than-expected economic growth in developing Asian 
 economies and North America. Global oil demand in both 2009 and 2010 is 
 now expected to be 500,000 barrels a day higher than the organization&apos;s 
 August estimate, at 84.4 mln barrels a day and 85.7 mln barrels a day 
 respectively, the IEA said. Despite the increase, projected oil 
 consumption this year will still be down 2.2%, or 1.9 mln barrels, 
 compared with last year, reflecting the still weak economy.&quot;Economic 
 prognoses from the OECD and IMF are being revised higher, while baseline 
 oil demand in the U.S., China and other Asia appears to be running 
 stronger than preliminary estimates suggested,&quot;the Paris-based 
 organization said in its monthly report. Crude-oil prices rose almost 
 $1 to more than $72 a barrel immediately after the release of the IEA 
 figures, which came hours after OPEC decided to keep its oil output 
 unchanged at a meeting in Vienna. 

 09/09/09:  Reuters.com reports OPEC ministers were all but certain to leave output 
 targets unchanged at a meeting late on Wednesday after the top exporter 
 Saudi Arabia said there was no need for action. So far, none of the 12 
 OPEC members has stated any need to cut production as prices above $71 a 
 barrel and signs of a strengthening world economy have shifted the focus 
 away from high inventory levels and still sluggish fuel demand. &quot;With 
 the price ranging between $68 and $73, what else do you want? The price, 
 everybody likes, consumers and producers,&quot; Saudi Arabian Oil 
 Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters when asked if OPEC needed to change 
 its output policy. OPEC could still ask members to comply more closely 
 to existing output curbs, which would amount to an unofficial supply 
 cut, although 100 percent discipline is regarded as impossible. In a 
 statement to the Saudi-owned al-Hayat published on Wednesday, Naimi 
 made even clearer he did not expect the Organization of the Petroleum 
 Exporting Countries to cut supply officially .&quot;The Saudi Oil 
 Minister Ali Al-Naimi expects -- in a statement to al-Hayat in Vienna -- 
 that the OPEC meeting, which takes place this evening in Vienna will not 
 amend the oil production level,&quot;the newspaper said. 

 09/03/09: Gas.. t oday&apos;s 
 reported 65 BCF injection was on the low end of expectations. The market 
 appears however to be much more focused on the 3,323 BCF in storage than 
 on the 2 or 3 BCF miss this week. In the end we are down 17% so far this week and ended today at the lowest level 
 since March 2002. Price action this week suggest that whatever 
 investor enthusiasm was left for nat gas has run out of patience with 
 that trade.  See my 8/06/09 comment! 

 08/31/09: (Duh) WSJ reports consumers looking to take advantage of a sharp drop in 
 U.S. power prices ( in 
 other words, either you&apos;re locked into a contract or you&apos;re in the big, 
 bad real-time market) increasingly are turning to new suppliers. The economic downturn, 
 combined with a boom in natural-gas output, has   driven 
 wholesale electricity prices sharply lower in the past year, inspiring 
 an increasing number of recession-strapped households to shop around for 
 cheaper rates.   &quot;All of a 
 sudden, we&apos;re in a situation where we have competition working,&quot;said 
 Ohio Consumers&apos; Counsel Janine Migden-Ostrander, who represents 
 residential ratepayers on regulatory matters. To be sure,   the 
 outright number of households switching to retail electricity provider 
 remains small . In Connecticut, Maryland and Ohio, the overwhelming 
 majority of people still get power through long-established local 
 utilities. Shopping for suppliers is much more common among big 
 commercial and industrial businesses. For now, electricity rates offered 
 through many utilities are higher than wholesale market conditions would 
 seem to dictate. Wholesale prices plunged 40% in the first half of the 
 year in the market that comprises 13 states located in the mid-Atlantic, 
 Midwest and Southeast regions. On Friday, the benchmark electricity 
 contract for this region fell $2.06 to settle at $31.38 a megawatt-hour. 
 Rates offered through the utilities are steadier since they reflect 
 average prices over several years. 

 Getting pressured on the LEED front? Read this ! 

 08/25/09:  Interesting op-ed taking the other side of the&quot;peak oil&quot;argument. Keywords: investor, Simmons.  He has an agenda. 

 08/24/09: We finally broke into 
 the $2.xx area on natural gas! You&apos;re watching history in the 
 making. The spread between gas&amp;oil is approaching historical 
 levels. I locked my NT gas at $6.95 and I&apos;m riding the market on 
 my DS gas (60,000 mcf). My main concern at this point is the UGI 
 negotiation on my IS meters. 

 08/12/09:  WSJ reports slack demand for electricity across the U.S. is leading to 
 some of the sharpest reductions in power prices in recent years, 
 offering a break for consumers and businesses who just a year ago were 
 getting crunched by massive electricity bills.   On 
 Friday, the nation&apos;s largest wholesale power market serving parts of 13 
 states east of the Rockies is expected to report that electricity demand 
 fell 4.4% in the first half of the year . That helped to push down 
 spot market prices by 40% during the first half of this year. Wholesale 
 electricity -- power furnished to utilities and other big energy users 
 -- cost an average of $40 a megawatt hour in the region, down from 
 $66.40 a year earlier. The price declines in this market, which extends 
 from Delaware to Michigan, come on top of a 2.7% drop in energy use in 
 2008 over 2007. The falloff in demand represents a reversal of what has been one of the steadiest trends in business. For decades, 
 the utility sector could rely on a gradual increase in electricity 
 demand . In 45 of the past 58 years, year-over-year growth 
 exceeded 2%. In fact, there only have been five years since 1950 in 
 which electricity demand has dropped in absolute terms. But   this 
 year is shaping up to have the sharpest falloff in more than half a 
 century,   and coming on 
 top of declines in 2008, could be the first period of consecutive annual 
 declines since at least 1950. Dramatic price reductions don&apos;t immediately mean lower power bills for 
 all consumers. That&apos;s because many customers pay prices based on long-term contracts . 
 But lower prices will have a softening effect over time. (Stocks 
 mentioned: AEP, SO) 

 08/06/09: This is the single 
 biggest $ vs. reality fight on Wall Street today:  Natural gas 
 inventory showed a build of 66 bcf, analysts were expecting a build of 
 61 bcf, ranging from a build of 54 bcf to a build of 63 bcf. Big 
 money is chasing the UNG hoping to see it rise...reality says we have 
 too much gas in storage and nobody is using it. 

 Let&apos;s see what happens:  The Federal Trade Commission today issued a Final Rule that will prohibit market manipulation in 
 the petroleum industry. The Rule will prohibit fraud or deceit in 
 wholesale petroleum markets, and omissions of material information that 
 are likely to distort petroleum markets. The FTC&apos;s approval of the Rule 
 concludes a proceeding that incorporated several rounds of public 
 comment. The Final Rule will become effective on November 4, 2009 . 
 The Commission issued this Rule under the Energy Independence and 
 Security Act of 2007, pursuant to a provision included by Senator Maria 
 Cantwell of Washington State.&quot; This 
 new Rule will allow us to crack down on fraud and manipulation that can 
 drive up prices at the pump ,&quot;said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz.&quot; We 
 will police the oil markets -- and if we find companies that are manipulating the markets, we will 
 go after them&quot;... Specifically, the Final Rule prohibits any person, 
 directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude 
 oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from a) knowingly 
 engaging in any act, practice, or course of business -- including making 
 any untrue statement of material fact -- that operates or would operate 
 as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or b) intentionally failing to 
 state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement 
 made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or 
 is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. Anyone 
 violating the Rule faces civil penalties of up to $1 million per 
 violation per day, in addition to any relief available to the Commission 
 under the FTC Act. 

 08/04/09: Cracks in the armor?  PPL reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.32 per share,   $0.08   worse 
 than   the First 
 Call consensus of $0.40; revenues rose 65.0% year/year to $1.67 bln vs the $1.69 bln 
 consensus. Co   reaffirms 
 guidance   for FY09, sees 
 EPS of $1.60-1.90 vs. $1.82 consensus. Co lowered   guidance   for 
 FY10, sees EPS of $3.10-3.50 vs. $3.65 consensus. The company had 
 previously expected 2010 earnings to be at the low end of the prior 
 forecasted range of $3.60 to $4.20 per share. 

 08/03/09: Take a look at the 
 latest rotary rig count report . This is NOT good for oil price 
 relief... 

 How about that divergence between gas 
 and oil?! I can&apos;t remember seeing anything like this for this long 
 in many moons. I still believe the entire world is watching and 
 waiting for that flat line (ie gas futures) to move one way or the 
 other...it&apos;s an important tell, but a watched pot won&apos;t boil! Patience. 

 07/31/09: Important blurb from 
 refiner:  Oppenheimer notes that Valero senior mgmt yesterday held a dinner 
 meeting with 10 analysts in NYC, which was very informative, but 
 unfortunately painted a grim 
 picture for the state of the refining industry , especially in the 
 US, where demand may have peaked and excess capacity is likely to be 
 exacerbated by the start-up of Marathon&apos;s $4.5 bln ungraded refinery. 
 Given the weak demand due to rising unemployment and rising gasoline 
 inventories, the firm believes that  high 
 gasoline margins are caused by financial speculators, not strong market 
 fundamentals. In addition, the firm believes that only a strong 
 economic rebound to boost weak demand can restore the industry&apos;s 
 financial health. The firm also notes that VLO expects losses in the 
 next two quarters. 

 NT GAS NEWS: I 
 have 3 quotes for the NT accounts and Hess is low at $7/mcf average for 
 1 year forward... 

 Important blurb about 
 PECO/Exelon:  Chicago Tribune reports coming up empty in three consecutive buyout 
 attempts won&apos;t stop John Rowe from trying again, the Exelon Corp. chief 
 executive promised.&quot;My own investors want me to say on a Bible that I 
 won&apos;t look for a while,&quot;Rowe said. But he won&apos;t take the pledge:&quot;We&apos;ll 
 keep looking for something we can do,&quot;he said.&quot; The 
 industry needs consolidation. &quot;Meeting with the Chicago Tribune 
 editorial board, Rowe defended his decision to go hostile in the recent 
 bid for NRG Energy Inc., which he abandoned July 21 after losing a 
 shareholder vote... The failed takeover attempt, following previous 
 unsuccessful runs at Illinois Power and Public Service Enterprise Group, 
 has left Exelon with iffy growth prospects.&quot;We&apos;re not stuck with no 
 growth,&quot;Rowe said.&quot;We&apos;re stuck with uncertain growth.&quot; The utility company could 
 benefit dramatically from favorable market forces, such as higher power 
 prices. A rally in natural gas prices also would help by raising costs 
 for competitors. And eventually, Rowe said, the low carbon 
 footprint of Exelon&apos;s nuclear fleet will pay big dividends. Absent an 
 acquisition, however, the growth opportunities under Rowe&apos;s control are 
 relatively small.  Remember, what&apos;s good for the utility is bad for consumers... 

 07/30/09:  FT reports the FSA has called a special meeting with major oil 
 companies, banks, hedge funds and oil brokers to review regulation in 
 the oil and commodity market. The meeting, scheduled for August 5, comes 
 as US regulators have said that they intend to clamp down on financial 
 flows into the oil and other commodities markets. The Commodity Futures 
 Trading Commission is currently holding hearings about possible changes 
 to position limits. The meeting organized by the FSA follows an episode of rogue 
 trading earlier this month at PVM, the London-based oil 
 brokerage, which triggered 
 losses of $10 mln for the company and pushed oil prices to their highest 
 level this year at $73.50 a barrel. Industry   executives 
 said the London meeting was unlikely to result in significant new 
 initiatives, but added that the gathering would discuss&quot;whether the 
 current arrangements [in the oil market] remain appropriate &quot;. They 
 said the FSA appeared to be taking a&quot;proactive&quot;role following scrutiny 
 in the US about the role of investors in oil and other commodities 
 prices. The FSA confirmed the meeting, describing it as part of its&quot;regular process of engagement with market participants in these 
 markets&quot;. It added:&quot;The FSA, HM Treasury and representatives from the 
 oil industry (banks, oil producers, brokers and hedge funds) will be 
 meeting next week to discuss market efficiency and transparency.&quot; 

 It&apos;s just business, 
 right?  PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT), which buys distressed home 
 loans and is run by several former Countrywide Financial executives, 
 prices its 16 mln share (down from 20 mln shares) IPO at $20. PMT is a 
 newly-formed specialty finance company (REIT) that will invest primarily 
 in residential mortgage loans, a substantial portion of which may be 
 distressed and acquired at discounts to their unpaid principal balances. 

 07/28/09:  WSJ reports the CFTC plans to issue a report next month suggesting speculators played a 
 significant role in driving wild swings in oil prices -- a 
 reversal of an earlier CFTC position that augurs intensifying scrutiny 
 on investors. In a contentious report last year, the main U.S. 
 futures-market regulator pinned oil-price swings primarily on supply and 
 demand. But that analysis was based on&quot;deeply flawed data,&quot;Bart 
 Chilton, one of four CFTC commissioners, said in an interview Monday. 
 The CFTC&apos;s new review, due to be released in August, adds fuel to a 
 growing debate over financial investors who bet on the direction of 
 commodities prices by buying contracts tied to indexes. These 
 speculators have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts 
 that were once dominated by producers and consumers who sought to hedge 
 against oil-market volatility. The review also reflects shifting 
 political winds. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, appointed by President 
 Barack Obama, the CFTC is departing from the more hands-off approach it 
 took under its previous head, a George W. Bush appointee.   The 
 agency is widely expected to adopt new rules to limit the amount of 
 investments in commodities by big institutions betting on their 
 direction purely for financial gain. 

 07/27/09: Slow news weekend for 
 the Morning Call?  Let&apos;s start with the point/counterpoint 
 op-ed ...using Pittsburgh as an example is the end of the 
 opinion...ever hear of the term&quot;congestion&quot;? And let&apos;s face 
 reality...we aren&apos;t shopping for power...we&apos;re shopping for a 
 counterparty who is hedging their risk (ie. bet) with your money. If we were really shopping for power, we&apos;d be knocking on the door of 
 PPL at Martins Creek, or Susquehanna, or Brunner Island, or Montour. Nice to finally see a politician espouse the fact that PPL generates for 
 less than 2 cents/kwhr...though he&apos;s not using the true cost of system 
 production over one year, which is a little higher. At least 
 someone is finally laying out the facts. 

 And how about the full page SEF ad ?! This could be summed up as: Wah, wah, wah...they&apos;re cutting us out 
 of the loop...(note stomping feet)...we&apos;ve been playing this game since 
 1996 and we don&apos;t want to go away. This is what happens when 
 legacy money gets caught up in a bureaucracy. You can&apos;t blame 
 PPL...they don&apos;t write the laws...it&apos;s the PA Legislature, stupid! 

 Head Fake (defined) ...the action 
 in the oil market! The price broke the 50 day MA and looked to be 
 coming down...and WHAM! I guess this is somewhat of a bad 
 news/good news story since the price is speculatively inflated on the 
 back of expected good economic news...remember, markets are a 
 forward-looking discount mechanism. 

 Cash 
 for clunkers &lt;--- everything you need to know. Click thru to 
 the links. My 97 Taurus didn&apos;t make the cut! 21mpg vs. 18 to 
 get the deal. 

 07/20/09:  Well that didn&apos;t 
 last long, did it?! The fuel markets seem to be following the Wall 
 Street&quot;recovery is just around the corner&quot;band. Fundamentals 
 haven&apos;t changed, but good economic news lifts everything equally. Except gas! We&apos;re pushing the limits of storage. 

 07/09/09:  Pretty powerful 
 break of the 50 day moving average on oil prices! The techies will 
 tell you that it looks like a head&amp;shoulders top. Could it be 
 some tough talk out of DC scaring the speculators? Or has Goldman 
 left the trade??? If they upgrade oil and/or the drillers then you 
 know why! 

 Remember what I said about Canadian gas 
 at our meeting?  Exxon Mobil unveils big Canadian natural gas field - WSJ   

 07/03/09: Anybody see this story ?  There is a lot of bad blood between the munis and PPL, hence the 
 deal with AEP .  But we learn two things...Morgan Stanley 
 will write paper thru 2015 and the average cost increase already 
 realized is 60% . Can you see why the Lisa Boscola plan 
 and/or rate caps are politically difficult? These folks could be 
 stuck with above-market rates for years! The reason some pay 
 higher numbers is LP4 v. LP5. Hey Perkasie! Did anyone stop 
 and ask why your rates are higher today and will DECREASE in the 
 extended years?  

 06/29/09:  FBR Capital 
 believes that the Waxman-Markey climate change bill, which the House 
 passed ion Friday, is likely to become law in 1H10, which should be 
 viewed as favorable to low-emissions nuclear and renewable generation, 
 transmission construction, and energy-efficiency technologies. They 
 believe the bill is negative for oil refiners and poses a longer-term 
 risk for coal and electricity demand. Higher gasoline prices also tend 
 to favor more fuel-efficient foreign automobile manufacturers over U.S. 
 competitors. They note under the bill, greenhouse gas emissions 
 allowances are projected to cost $13 per metric ton CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) in &apos;15 and between $16 
 and $28/tCO2e in &apos;20. They note the bill seeks to reduce U.S. GHG emissions 17% below &apos;05 levels by &apos;20 
 and 83% below &apos;05 levels by &apos;50 , using a market-based approach 
 that establishes an absolute cap on the emissions from certain large 
 entities known as&quot;covered sources.&quot;They note GHG emitters will be 
 required to hold permits. 

 06/25/09: Attention Bruce Ferretti!  This story on 
 Goldman Sachs should be mandatory reading. 

 06/23/09:  &quot;Fear fades 
 when facts are faced.&quot; - Frank Tyger 

 06/18/09: (Good for Wall Street 
 / Bad for us)  Yesterday, Exelon announced it was awarded 17 
 month and 29 month residential full requirements contracts in PECO 
 Energy&apos;s default service procurement for approximately $100-$102/MWh, which was above expectations . Barclays said the results are a 
 positive for Exelon and also Allegheny Energy and PPL Corp who have 
 auctions in Pennsylvania.  This is ridiculous since Exelon is 
 a huge nuclear player. Gee, think someone other than the embedded 
 supplier would win? Competition has failed! Competition has 
 failed! Competition has failed! 

 06/17/09:  The Wall Street 
 Journal reports four power companies are expected to split $18.5 bln in 
 federal financing to build the next generation of nuclear reactors.   UniStar 
 Nuclear Energy, NRG Energy (NRG), Scana (SCG) and Southern Co. (SO) are 
 expected to share a set of loan guarantees to be awarded by the Energy 
 Dept. The guarantees would enable the companies to start building the 
 reactors as early as 2011, with the plants likely to come online by 2015 
 or 2016. The four companies have already selected sites for their 
 reactors and are at the front of the pack to receive licenses to build 
 and operate them from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The government 
 has yet to formally announce its picks, but interviews with Energy 
 Department and NRC staff members, as well as officials at energy 
 companies and reactor vendors, have identified the likely winners. 
 Seventeen companies applied for $122 bln of federal loan guarantees for 
 21 proposed reactors. In creating their short list, federal officials 
 sought companies with strong development teams and plans that could be 
 implemented quickly. They also wanted a mix of traditional utilities (Scana 
 and Southern) and newer&quot;merchant&quot;generators (NRG, UniStar) that sell 
 electricity at unregulated prices. 

 House Republicans introduced energy 
 legislation calling for a hundred new nuclear power plants to be built 
 in the next two decades . The bill would not set mandatory 
 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or for producing 
 electricity from renewable sources. 

 06/12/09:  Reuters reports 
 oil demand is still shrinking as the world economy contracts, OPEC said 
 on Friday, but the worst appears to be over for the oil market and 
 stocks should be moving back toward more normal levels by the end of the 
 year. OPEC cut again its forecast for world oil consumption this year, 
 seeing a year-on-year fall of 1.62 mln barrels per day to 83.8 mln bpd, 
 and it said its own output rose slightly in May. &quot;The worst appears to be behind 
 us,&quot;OPEC said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. &quot;Inventories 
 appear to have peaked,&quot;it said, adding that seasonal demand should 
 support a gradual decline in oil stocks, which have been near record 
 levels. OPEC said its oil output, excluding Iraq, rose to 25.90 mln bpd 
 in May, up from 25.78 mln bpd in April. The market is a 
 discounting mechanism...it told you this stuff months ago... 

 06/11/09: (A source rarely, if 
 ever correct)  Earlier today, the IEA raised its demand 
 forecast for the first time since August of last year as the agency 
 believes the recession is starting to bottom out. Forecast global oil 
 demand is adjusted up 120 kb/d for 2009 following stronger-than-expected 
 1Q09 OECD data. Global oil demand is projected at 83.3 mb/d, -2.9% or -2.5 mb/d compared with 2008 . 
 Forecast global 2Q09 crude runs are raised 0.2 mb/d to 71.3 mb/d, as a 
 result of higher April preliminary data in OECD countries, reports of high crude runs in China and marginally stronger global demand. But 3Q09 crude runs are forecast 
 at 72.8 mb/d, representing an annual decline of 1.2 mb/d... July crude 
 oil ($72.03 +$0.70) used this report and some modest weakness in the 
 dollar to trade to its best levels at $72.30 in electronic trade this 
 morning. It has pulled back from its highs but remains around the $72 
 mark. All in all, that&apos;s not a huge global cut in demand. And 
 with oil priced at the margin, I&apos;m still concerned with how fragile this 
 market remains. 

 06/01/09:  Take a look at 
 the the $/mmBTU chart. Oil clearly above resistance, but look at 
 those natural gas numbers! No oomph whatsoever. Fundamentals 
 matter. 

 05/26/09: Spoiler Alert!  Take a look at the winter gas prices...the spot market is in the 
 toilet, but TETCO basis is quietly moving higher. In other words, 
 the locks we did are looking pretty good. The short term price has 
 broken below the moving average, which is bearish...I can&apos;t see how the 
 $2 gas story will gain traction. I think it&apos;s more likely that 
 we&apos;re in a bottoming mode whereby prices actually flatten...this is good 
 for us, good for power, bad for producers. 

 05/18/09: Wow! Bad for 
 Wall Street / Good for Main Street:  Credit Suisse discusses the regulated utilities and power companies, 
 noting that after some confusion with an early, incorrect issuance, PJM 
 posted results for the &apos;12 / &apos;13 capacity auction (RPM) with a big 
 disappointment for the Western RTO zone ($16.46 /MW day vs $110.00 for 
 11/12 and a whisper of $90-120) and modest positives for some 
 constrained areas. They say the drop in RTO capacity prices appears to 
 reflect administrative changes to the 12/13 auction that they still need 
 to better understand and in total had a big impact on the calculated 
 reserve margins that set capacity prices along the RPM pricing curve.  T4: disappointment for the Street = good news for the consumer. These are huge numbers. We&apos;re being played... 

 05/14/09:  The Wall Street 
 Journal reports the International Energy Agency Thursday said the steep fall in global oil 
 consumption may be nearing its trough , but cautioned that any 
 recovery in demand for crude oil is still many months away and will be 
 sluggish. In its widely watched monthly oil report, the agency made a 
 relatively small downward revision of 200,000 barrels a day to its 
 outlook for 2009 global oil demand -- and half of that was driven by 
 changes to historical data.&quot;We do expect a tapering off in the demand 
 contraction, but we are still left with a very big drop in demand and, 
 in our view, recovery really doesn&apos;t start to take root until 2010,&quot;said David Fyfe, editor of the report. World demand for crude oil this 
 year is expected to contract by 2.6 mln barrels a day, or 3%, to 83.2 
 million barrels a day, said the IEA, which acts as an adviser to the 
 world&apos;s biggest energy consuming nations, including the U.S. The IEA&apos;s demand forecast would 
 represent the biggest contraction in around 25 years and is among the 
 most pessimistic in the industry.   T4: the IEA 
 track record is horrible. 

 05/11/09: Bad.  Soleil 
 upgrades PPL to Buy from Hold and raises their tgt to $43 from $32 as PA regulation is now looking more favorable and the stock 
 is a deregulated play on rapidly rising forward power prices.  (Remember, electricity is fuel at the margin and that fuel is gas). 

 05/08/09: Nailed it!  Energy commodities continued their recent strong performance this 
 session. Natural gas rose significantly and closed at $4.29 per 
 contract, up 4.7%. The natural gas contracts have ended the session 
 higher everyday so far this month; they are now up over 27% over that 
 time period. See my earlier comments!!! UNG rocking!!! Thanks Morning Call! Once again, you are the ultimate contrarian 
 indicator. 

 05/04/09: I&apos;m real close to 
 calling the bottom in natural gas.. .it&apos;s funny how some analysts are 
 so lost in their numbers world that they can&apos;t see the basics behind 
 some industries. For example, there is another pundit by the name 
 of Schork who prints how natural gas is the only fundamentally rational 
 market out there. Well Stephen, that&apos;s nice, but how does it help 
 your readers? Do you not lock oil because it&apos;s irrational? Or do you ignore the gas bottom? 

 Here&apos;s from Chesapeake&apos;s conference 
 call: Co believes North American gas production will be in 
 freefall in the Winter 2009, which should set the stage for a turnaround 
 in gas prices. Co says it was 
 too high at $13 last year and $3.50 is too low now . Thinks 
 rebound will overshoot on the upside, just as it has overshot on the 
 downside . Says they will be 
 prepared to hedge 2-3 years into this price strength ... It makes 
 sense to curtail volumes at current prices. Co says operating drilling 
 rigs are down 40% from peak operations in Aug of &apos;08... Co says it has 
 built up gas pipeline inventories due to ramped up production last yr... 
 Co says it realized hedging gains in Q1 of $519 mln all from Jan-March 
 contracts, and unrealized mark-to-market gains of $700 mln; co will have 
 added $930 mln to the rev stream in FY09 vs if they left their original 
 hedging positions unchanged. Co
has 60-65% of FY10 hedging volumes in 1H10... Co is purchasing acreage 
 at values that are extremely valuable... Co says it appears the economy 
 is in the process of bottoming, thinks it will settle by 1Q10, 2010 will 
 be a lot better than 2009... 

 T4 Reminder: Our goal is to do 
 the opposite of Chesapeake! Our goal is to hedge NOW, at low 
 levels. 

 04/30/09:  Deregulation has failed in Connecticut. 

 Anybody else sit through that webinar 
 that wasn&apos;t yesterday? How can a large Fortune 500 ute like PPL 
 look so lame? I guess it goes hand-in-hand with a response they 
 submitted to one of my questions: can you model the real time 
 electric market using current data? Nope. Can&apos;t do it. That is very scary. 

 04/22/09:  You heard it here 
 first...I&apos;m beginning to wonder if OPEC has one more cut up their 
 sleeves? I think they want to see $60-$75/bbl prices...and it 
 would actually help long-term with exploration&amp;production...today&apos;s 
 numbers seem to indicate that we&apos;re still swimming in crude oil...good 
 for short term prices, but bad for the recovery effort. 

 Before someone tries 
 to sell you on solar, think about this:  Exelon (EXC) and SPWRA announced an agreement to develop the nation&apos;s largest urban solar power plant at a former industrial site on Chicago&apos;s South Side. The 10-megawatt solar 
 photovoltaic facility is scheduled for completion by the end of this 
 year. The $60 mln project 
 is contingent upon Exelon receiving a federal loan guarantee under the 
 recently passed federal stimulus legislation formally known as the 
 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which includes provisions for 
 investment in green jobs and emissions reduction. Exelon is seeking a loan guarantee for up to 80% of the project cost from the U.S. 
 Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program Office. FWIW, Lehigh 
 is a 15MW peaker. 

 04/21/09: The US stock market 
 is bipolar:  Reuters.com reports the Treasury still has about $134.6 billion 
 available in its coffers from last fall&apos;s bank bailout package and that 
 should be enough for it to avoid asking Congress for more money, 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on.&quot;We have the resources to 
 move forward implementing all aspects of our Financial Stability Plan,&quot;Geithner said in a letter to the panel overseeing the bailout. Geithner 
 said there was still about $109.6 billion available from the $700 
 billion rescue package passed last year and expects to get at least an 
 additional $25 billion back, bringing the total to $134.6 billion.  You don&apos;t sell off in the face of good news...you can lock down your oil&amp;gas cost for the next 12-24 months at 6-year lows...stress test 
 results are due soon...stabilization = a win. 

 04/16/09: Here we go:  Chesapeake announced it has elected to curtail approximately 400 million 
 cubic feet (mmcf) per day of its gross natural gas production due to 
 continued low wellhead prices. The reduction includes the 200 mmcf per 
 day curtailment of natural gas production previously announced on March 
 2, 2009. Chesapeake has resumed 7,000 barrels per day of oil production 
 from previously curtailed oil wells. The company&apos;s 400 mmcf per day 
 curtailment represents approximately 13% of Chesapeake&apos;s current gross 
 operated natural gas production capacity.  The American version of OPEC! You knew it was coming. Now 
 watch and see what a storm will do to prices... 

 04/13/09:  Anecdotally 
 speaking, when the Morning Call finally prints a story noting low 
 natural gas prices, as they did this past weekend, then it&apos;s usually 
 close to a bottom. Two weeks to hurricane season... 

 There is a lot of pain in the biodiesel 
 world...Forbes is running a story in their latest issue about folks who 
 are heavily invested in turning $2.70 soybean oil into $1.50 
 diesel...anybody notice the bankruptcy filing for Aventine? They 
 were an early player in the ethanol world. It&apos;s all about politics 
 and subsidies. 

 04/09/09:  As good as it gets? Natural gas is trading at 6 YEAR LOWS today! Storage is above the 
 5-yr average. Yet I just did a check on Jan/Feb 2010 to see if 
 there were savings if sold my winter oil...NADA! Winter numbers 
 remain strong and there are no discounts on basis. A speculator 
 might go long something like the UNG on the expectation that a Gulf 
 hurricane would spike near term prices.  Might... 

 Here&apos;s another 
 look at biodiesel, one year after the oil price peak. 

 04/08/09:  Comment from 
 today&apos;s NY Times about a town who bought muni bonds from an investment 
 bank:   “We decided we needed advice from someone who was not trying to sell us 
 something,”Mayor Linda Elam said.  A little reminder from T4 about the firewall between consultants and 
 sales. 

   I like this 
 approach to the carbon tax problem . I tend to agree that&quot;cap&amp;trade&quot;is a messy derivative. Tom Friedman seems to be the only 
 sane guy writing a national column on this issue. 

 I often debate whether or not to publish 
 commentary from Matt Simmons, the peak oil theorist. Nevertheless, here is a blurb from an investment 
 site . There are key points such as&quot;price is set at the 
 margin&quot;and Mexico&apos;s output is declining. I tend to think along 
 the lines of&quot;short term optimist, long term scared&quot;. 

 04/3/09:  Before you start 
 popping champagne corks over PPL&apos;s latest rate increase projection of&quot;only&quot;30% for 2010, let&apos;s remember that the RS and GS rates in 2010 are 
 blended from six separate solicitations...natural gas prices are near 
 historically low levels right now and this is keeping a lid on prices. For 2010... 

 03/26/09:  WSJ 
 reports the slowdown in investment in oil and gas production could lop 
 off nearly eight million barrels a day of future oil supply growth, 
 setting the stage for another big crude price surge in years to come, 
 according to a new study. The global credit crisis and falling oil 
 prices have squeezed oil companies&apos; finances and forced many to 
 cut capital spending and postpone projects. That could have big 
 implications for supply when the global recession ends and demand for 
 energy recovers, the report by Cambridge Energy Research 
 Associates says. CERA projected last summer, before the economic crisis 
 set in, that world oil production capacity would rise to 109 million 
 barrels a day by 2014 from the current 94.5 million barrels a day. It 
 now says 7.6 million barrels a day -- or slightly more than half 
 of that increase -- is&quot;at risk&quot;due to project deferrals or 
 cancellations. The report says that reduction in capacity is a&quot;potentially powerful and long-lasting aftershock&quot;following the 
 oil-price slide of 2008, when within a few months crude fell from a 
 record high of $147 a barrel.  T4 concurs...I&apos;ve mentioned this 
 a few times in the past... 

 03/25/09:  FWIW, we stumbled 
 upon an alternate supplier of&quot;B-tane&quot;, the waste oil alternative to 
 diesel...Nick Borrelli, Darling International, 972-717-5520. They&apos;re based in Newark and currently quote $1.50/gallon. 

 03/24/09:  While the talking 
 heads blather on about climate neutrality, carbon offsets, and stimulus, 
 here is where the engineers are 
 focusing .  I repeat once again...UGI is the single 
 greatest impediment to cost savings and carbon reduction in the Lehigh 
 Valley. If we had master billing statements at NYMEX + delivery 
 (like some of have from the good old days), then we&apos;d get rid of all 
 heating oil and convert everything to high efficiency gas boilers.  

 Here&apos;s another tidbit courtesy of Dan 
 Holohan... small 
 wind turbines in the UK ...Turns out you actually need wind to make a 
 wind turbine turn, regardless of size! And nearby buildings have a 
 way of blocking the wind! Who knew?! 

 03/23/09:  Blink and you 
 missed it! Note the impressive move off the bottom for #6 oil. And gas turned on a dime after it hit $3.xx. I&apos;ve seen this type 
 of action before (latest was Sep 06) and it usually marks a short term 
 bottom. 

 03/16/09: Draw your own 
 conclusions: OPEC did not make additional cuts in Vienna. So 
 the traders (short term brain) immediately force down the price of crude 
 on the assumption that inventory will rise. But what if OPEC 
 recognizes the huge lag time from well shutdown to restart and is trying 
 to prevent another&quot;superspike&quot;?  Saudi Arabia&apos;s oil minister said Monday that petroleum-producing 
 countries need a price of at least $60 a barrel to bring more energy 
 resources on the market. Plus there are rumblings that Russia will 
 soon join OPEC. Stay tuned! 

 Conflicting 
 stories on the PPL front.   There is a story in Harrisburg 
 that House Democratic 
 leaders are introducing a bill that would prevent power companies from raising rates more than 15 percent per year on 
 homeowners and small businesses after the caps expire. Of course, 
 this doesn&apos;t help those of us with LP4 and LP5 accounts, but it&apos;s on the 
 radar. And on Wall Street, analysts seem to be focusing on&quot;cap&amp;trade&quot;and the potential effects on earnings power. So I 
 dunno...maybe it&apos;s an attack on two fronts? 

 Here&apos;s 
 another story from my&quot;beating a dead horse&quot;folder. Moody&apos;s, S&amp;P, 
 Fitch, D&amp;B, et al. They&apos;re complicit in this mess. As the 
 author points out, their revenue is derived from the very bonds they 
 rate. This reminds me of the old real estate appraiser/bank 
 relationship. 

 03/13/09:  As if we didn&apos;t 
 have enough stuff to think about, here is the annual commentary from China . In 
 Wall Street terms, they&apos;re kind of like a senior subordinate debt holder 
 of USA Inc. Their actions could affect the bond market, which 
 affects the value of the $, which affects our energy prices. Yikes! Another brick in the wall... 

 03/11/09:  What does one 
 TRILLION dollars look like? 

 03/09/09:  Crude 
 oil ($47.54 +$2.02) is rallying today, with session highs at $48.54, and 
 is once again in striking 
 distance of the $50 mar k. Today&apos;s move to the upside, which has 
 put crude back at levels last seen in late Jan (when it was headed in 
 the opposite direction), is being partially fueled by speculation that 
 OPEC will once again slash output when it meets in Vienna on March 15. 
 Estimates currently range anywhere between a cut of 500K-1000K bdp. As 
 the week progresses, expect more OPEC members to opine about what they 
 believe is necessary to help stabilize the market. However, while some, 
 if not most, of this commentary will make headlines, very few other than 
 Saudi Arabia (OPEC&apos;s largest producer) will make much difference. 

   If only we could 
 store natural gas! But this is what happens to the price when 
 demand disappears. 

 Fascinating read:  The Ascent of 
 Money by Niall Ferguson. We&apos;re but a blip on the 400+ years of 
 stock bubbles/collapses... 

 03/07/09:  I&apos;m postulating 
 that the recent crude oil price rise is partially due to the Chinese 
 stimulus plan ($586B) that was recently announced. It&apos;s probably 
 why crude is rising in the face of low natural gas and heating oil 
 prices. The market seems to be pricing in increased global demand 
 with reduced supplies. Let&apos;s not forget that there is another OPEC 
 meeting on 3/15...if they cut again, then $60/bbl will probably be the 
 next stop. Of course, this might be the last cut...unless we can&apos;t 
 get this bank crisis resolved. $2.5T IS a lot of money and with 
 another 15% cut in housing prices expected, this number will probably 
 end up at $3 trillion. Yikes! 

 03/06/09: Deja vu:  WSJ reports a large participant has emerged in the oil market in recent 
 months, controlling nearly a fifth of the most-active oil-futures 
 contracts, and roiling trading in the market. The exchange-traded fund 
 U.S. Oil Fund LP has expanded from a $7 million ETF just three years ago 
 to $3.8 billion, drawing the attention of regulators and making it 
 harder for the fund to keep up with oil prices. U.S. Oil&apos;s size has 
 prevented it from tracking the price of oil. While crude has lost 2.2% 
 in 2009, the fund has declined 20%. The fund is designed to track oil&apos;s 
 daily percentage move. Since the fund is so big, it is unable to switch 
 in and out of contracts, a process known as&quot;rolling,&quot;without moving 
 markets and giving speculators an opportunity to make bets on those 
 moves. It is adding to the costs of U.S. Oil&apos;s roll and raising concerns 
 among regulators that traders may be manipulating prices. 

 03/05/09:  The Street has 
 not reacted kindly to being told that all is well in the land of PPL. Stock crossed under $24 this AM....that&apos;s down from a high of $54 not 
 that long ago...yes, it&apos;s a bear market...but if the earnings stream and 
 dividend are secure, then why are they getting hammered?  

 This is funny:  http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=220252&amp;title=cnbc-gives-financial-advice  Sad but true. Buy, buy, buy! 

 03/02/09:  PPL went ahead 
 and chucked a finger at the Street by raising their dividend while 
 cutting heads! It&apos;s a poker game where they just raised their bet 
 that deregulation cannot be stopped...(see 2/20 comment below). 

 Could the oil traders be gambling that 
 the economy recovers somewhat by 2010? Everybody from OPEC on down 
 through the local gas drillers are cutting production...it&apos;s not as if 
 we have tons of spare capacity sitting out there...one big storm and 
 we&apos;re off to the races. 

 02/23/09:  The AFP reports that Algeria&apos;s minister for energy and mines said on 
 Sunday that Opec will probably decide on more cutbacks in oil production 
 in a bid to prevent further price drops, Algeria&apos;s APS news agency 
 reported. &apos;It is very likely that Opec will decide on March 15 to reduce 
 production again to stabilise prices that are going down,&apos; said Chakib 
 Khelil, referring to the oil cartel&apos;s next meeting in Vienna, according 
 to APS. The minister said the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
 Countries&apos; decision to reduce production by 4.4 million barrels per day 
 in September had prevented oil prices from plummeting even further. &apos;If 
 Opec had not taken the decision to reduce in September, October and 
 December, we would not be at 40 dollars a barrel (bpd), but probably at 
 20 dollars,&apos; he said. Mr Khelil 
 warned that very low oil prices could shrink investment in the sector, 
 creating an insufficient supply to meet demand when it picks up in the 
 next two to three years.( see 
 2/10/09 comment below ). 

 02/20/09: Stimulus Update (via 
 IDEA):  IDEA was actively advocating for appropriation of $1.5 
 Billion for Section 471 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) for funding 
 district energy/CHP projects in the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
 Act (‘The Stimulus Bill”). 

 On Wednesday, Feb 11, we were quite 
 disappointed to learn the Section 471 provision was apparently zeroed 
 out during overnight conference committee negotiations, even though the 
 Section 471 language was approved in both the House and the Senate 
 versions of the Stimulus Bill. It is rare for a provision with support 
 in both houses to be impacted during conference, but this was a unique 
 bill with many competing interests and an urgent timetable. Attendees at 
 the Wednesday luncheon at the Campus Conference, after learning of this 
 status change, initiated hundreds of phone calls to their 
 Representatives and Senators seeking support for Section 471. (T4-real subtle.) 

 IDEA remains committed to finding 
 support for the dozens of“shovel-ready projects”that can create 
 quality jobs, reduce energy costs, cut greenhouse gas emissions and 
 transform American energy infrastructure–the primary objectives of the 
 Stimulus Bill. The district energy industry is poised and ready to help 
 stimulate economic recovery across the country. IDEA will be seeking 
 incremental funding through DOE and will keep members posted as we 
 advance our interests in Washington DC in the weeks ahead. 

 T4 politically incorrect comment: a whole world of good could be accomplished if we got rid of negotiated 
 delivery rates for natural gas with UGI, aggregated all campus meters, 
 put an end to deregulation by agreeing to cap our electrical 
 consumption/demand, and upgraded heating oil boilers/furnaces with high 
 efficiency gas units. Shovel ready indeed. Then maybe UGI 
 and PPL could change their focus from profits and try working on things 
 like service upgrades, right-of-way maintenance, and gas leaks. When was the last time UGI came around and offered to upgrade your mains 
 to prevent low pressure trips in winter? Or PPL offered a second, 
 alternate, back-up feeder to ensure reliability? But hey, those 
 items aren&apos;t&quot;green&quot;...but they would create jobs and ultimately improve 
 efficiency. Think about it...if Lehigh, for example, concentrated 
 all critical research in one building, and I knew how much gas would 
 cost us for delivery, we could initiate the opposite of&quot;snow days&quot;in 
 summer when power is scarce (and costly), close campus, and run a 
 generator on NG to get through the peak. Sacrifice? Yes. But then we wouldn&apos;t be at the mercy of exponential power price hikes 
 and we could draw natural gas when the system is barely used. 

 Uh-oh... PPL is 
 showing up all over the place on lists of companies whose dividend is in 
 trouble due to levered cash flow problems...as you were warned, their 
 price is based on EXPECTATIONS of 2010. Want to see a political 
 battle? If Wall Street senses that deregulation is at risk, this 
 stock will crash 50% AND the divy is gone. On the other hand, that 
 dividend going to the shareholders comes out of our pockets. 
 
 Contango 101:  March oil futures contracts expired and 
 the spread between the March and April contracts contracted to a normal 
 level after seeing a big spread over the past week. Notably, the spread 
 between the front month and year-out contracts has narrowed as well, 
 diminishing the magnitude of the recent phenomenon that some had been 
 calling&quot; super contango .&quot; We know that spot mkt oil prices 
 have plunged, but the futures for oil delivery a year out were trading 
 $20 higher earlier this month. Now, the spread has settled back down to 
 ~$12, which represents a more reasonable level. This situation of higher 
 future prices relative to spot (current) prices is referred to as&quot;contango&quot;in the futures markets. To a certain extent, contango is a normal 
 condition in the commodity markets because one has to account for the 
 price of interest foregone and storage costs (i.e. if you buy a barrel 
 of oil today and want to hold it for a year, you will have to pay 
 storage costs). However, the situation in the crude oil markets earlier 
 this month is being referred to by some as&quot;super contango,&quot;where the 
 prices for forward prices are much higher than what they are for current 
 contracts... Looking at the current situation for crude oil, front month 
 (Mar) crude oil future prices are at ~$39, while prices a year out (Feb 
 2010) are now at ~$51. The current price difference between the front 
 month contract and the future contract is estimated to be more inline 
 with carrying costs (roughly $1 per barrel/per month) than it was 
 previously. The extreme spread seen within the past month promoted 
 hoarding, as there was an incentive to buy the front month contract and 
 selling the contract a year out and storing the oil with plans to 
 deliver it once the contract comes due. As a result, companies are 
 storing oil in storage tanks, underground pipelines and even offshore on 
 oil tankers (this type of arbitrage is not available to just anyone, it 
 is only available to the large majors or an investor with a large amount 
 of capital). That helped push day rates on tankers higher as more and 
 more tankers have been used to store the oil offshore to offset some of 
 the pricing pressure because of the reduced transportation demand due to 
 a global recession. Most believe that the higher degree of oil contango 
 resulted from some combination of: a supply glut in the current time 
 period, the increased cost of financing into the future and investor 
 expectations that demand will contract soon... The March 2009 contract, 
 which expires tomorrow, is currently at ~$39, the April 2009 contract 
 (which will become the new front month contract) is currently at ~$40. 
 The February 2010 contract is at ~$51 and the March 2010 contract is at 
 ~$52.

 02/19/09: A politician finally 
 sees the light:  WSJ reports a Republican California state legislator on Thursday morning 
 backed a plan to close the 
 state&apos;s $42 billion budget deficit through steep cuts and new taxes. If other legislators vote as expected, he would provide the final vote 
 needed to approve the budget, signaling the end of a 15-week partisan 
 conflict that has battered an already-crippled state economy. State Sen. 
 Abel Maldonado, who had voted against the budget Wednesday morning, 
 changed his vote to an&quot;aye&quot;on the plan after state leaders met his 
 demands that certain state-government reforms be added to the proposal 
 and that the plan be stripped of a gas-tax increase. The budget was 
 headed toward passage early Thursday morning, as the legislature began 
 approving some of the 30 bills that make up the proposal.  Hey, where are the tax cuts? Now let&apos;s move on to the bank 
 problem... 

 02/11/09:  WSJ reports the International Energy Agency lopped 570,000 barrels a day 
 off its 2009 world oil consumption forecast due to frail global economic 
 activity and warned that trade protectionism could further dent energy 
 consumption. In its latest downward demand revision, the IEA forecast 
 world oil consumption to slow to 84.7 million barrels a day, 
 representing a drop of one million barrels a day, or 1.1%, from 2008 and 
 the biggest annual drop in 27 years Economic recession in the U.S. and 
 many other developed nations is expected to rollback world oil 
 consumption to 2006 levels, the agency said in its widely watched 
 monthly oil market report. In another sign of how weak demand is, total 
 crude oil consumption in the U.S., the world&apos;s biggest consumer, is 
 expected to fall to 1998 levels. U.S. consumption is projected at 19 
 million barrels a day, a 2.9% drop from last year when demand fell by 
 more than 5%.&quot;We seem to be on a downward escalator we can&apos;t get off 
 of. Until we see a bottoming out and a degree of stability on the 
 financial and economic side, energy market weakness is going be with us 
 for some time,&quot;said David Fyfe, editor of the IEA report. 

 02/10/09: Better them than 
 you... NY 
 Times reports that PSE&amp;G (NJ Ute) said it would unveil a five-year, 
 one-of-a-kind plan on Tuesday to install solar panels on 200,000 utility 
 poles in its service territory. The project, which the utility must 
 first present to state regulators for approval, would also include 
 putting solar panels on schools and municipal buildings, low-income 
 housing and areas like closed garbage dumps. The utility expects to 
 spend $773 million on the project, which it said would generate 120 
 megawatts of electricity, one-third of which should come from the panels 
 on utility poles. That amounts to barely 1% of the power consumed in the 
 state, but is about 7% of the state&apos;s goal of power generated from 
 renewable energy sources by 2020. By then, 22.5% of the state&apos;s 
 electricity is supposed to come from renewable sources, according to New 
 Jersey&apos;s energy master plan.  Remember, 
 the PUC will require PPL to supply some green power anyway, so let them 
 pay for it and spread the cost around. 

 Remember The 
 Sting? Deja vu... The 
 WSJ reports that the members of 
 the OPEC have collectively postponed 35 oil-drilling projects in 
 various stages of development -a sign that the group&apos;s members are 
 starting to feel the financial pain of low crude prices. Until now, 
 nearly all of the global oil industry&apos;s drilling projects canceled or 
 delayed in past months have been in non-OPEC countries, including the 
 U.S. and Canada, where high-cost developments such as extracting oil 
 from tar sands were put on the back burner as economic incentives and 
 financing dried up. But with crude prices below $50 a barrel in recent 
 months, even the world&apos;s cheapest-to-produce hydrocarbons are taking a 
 hit. The delayed drilling projects have been shelved for an indefinite 
 period, said OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla Salem el-Badri.&quot;These 
 projects are on hold ... and will continue to be until the price 
 recovers,&quot;he said. It isn&apos;t clear exactly how much production capacity 
 the 35 projects had been expected to add, said Mr. Badri, adding the 
 distribution of the postponements was across OPEC members, which had 
 planned to deliver 150 projects over the next decade. 

 02/09/09:  Reuters reports that OPEC is willing to cut oil output further at a 
 meeting in March , the group&apos;s secretary-general said on Monday, adding 
 he would like to see full compliance with existing curbs first. Abdullah 
 al-Badri also told reporters in a briefing that OPEC&apos;s compliance with 
 existing oil supply curbs of 4.2 mln barrels per day was about 80%, 
 based on preliminary data, higher than some estimates.&quot;If we think we 
 still need more action, I&apos;m sure the conference will take more action to 
 stabilize the market,&quot;Badri said, referring to OPEC&apos;s meeting to set 
 supply policy on March 15. Asked whether a new cut in OPEC output was 
 needed to bolster prices, the secretary general said the existing 
 cutbacks were&quot;a huge amount.&quot;  

 02/07/09:  Let&apos;s not crack 
 the champagne just yet based on PPL&apos;s latest news release regarding 
 lower projected rates next year...I think they&apos;ve timed it to counter 
 the misery of more layoffs. Remember, the blended rate is ONLY in 
 2010 and ONLY affects RS, GS1, and GS3. What about 2011? 

 Two audits of Energy Star, a 
 program to conserve electricity used in consumer goods, have found that 
 energy-savings estimates are not completely verifiable . Marketing! 

 02/05/09: The stock market is 
 the engine of growth and the banks supply the oil...currently the engine 
 has seized...been there, done that. It will take time and money to 
 get it running again.  I overheard a comment at the Joe Perella 
 lecture yesterday: Republicans are the party of tax cuts and&quot;No&quot;. Sadly, I&apos;m beginning to think that&apos;s the truth. The music has 
 stopped, the party is over, yet nobody wants to clean up the mess...some 
 folks want to keep the party going into the next day...in the end, it 
 has to stop because we need to get back to work. This one has been 
 a doozy and we&apos;re going to need a pallet of those industrial-sized trash 
 bags! 

 02/04/09: PPL:  Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.46 per share,   in-line   with 
 the First Call consensus of $0.46; revenues rose 56.6% year/year to 
 $2.51 bln. Co   reaffirms 
 guidance   for FY09, sees 
 EPS of $1.60-1.90 vs. $1.86 consensus.  PPL 
 continues to forecast 2010 earnings of $3.60 to $4.20 per share.   Let&apos;s do the the math...that&apos;s a 125% increase FY10-over-FY09!  And the source of this wonderful 2x in earnings? You and me, of 
 course. 

 02/03/09: Rule #3 has been 
 added! See above. 

 01/29/09: Fuzzy Logic 101:  Roubini thinks banks ultimately are $3.6 trillion in the hole with 
 $1.2 trillion of capital on board today...and TARP I was worth $350 
 billion...yet somehow it&apos;s OK to keep doling out&quot;bonuses&quot;to the tune 
 of $18.4 billion? Dear Wall Street, you took the USA to the brink 
 of depression by trading phony paper back and forth in your own little 
 Ponzi scheme...why are you still employed? This is like that Coors 
 Light commercial...replace&quot;playoffs?&quot;with&quot;bonuses?&quot; 

 01/28/09: Lo and behold, we 
 have a stimulus plan!  Again quoting the esteemed Sgt. Phil 
 Esterhaus from Hill Street Blues: &quot;Let&apos;s be careful out there.&quot; None of this stimulus nonsense addresses the fact that banks probably 
 have $3 trillion in losses on their balance sheets while the total 
 capitalization of all banks is $1.2 trillion. There is no simple 
 fix to the liquidity (or leverage) crisis we&apos;re living. Spending 
 money just for the sake of spending money is not a solution. Let&apos;s 
 focus on the basics and remain committed to paybacks, efficiency, and 
 basics. Congrats to Cedar Crest and Muhlenberg...patience pays 
 off. Your gas buys are at or very near a long term bottom. I&apos;m preparing myself for the onslaught of vendors hawking all sorts of 
 grant-related stuff that may or may not do anything to support our 
 mission. It&apos;s sure to be a minefield. 

 01/19/09: Note the addition to 
 the banner above...T4 Rules.  Those two simple axioms could 
 save you a bundle of $. Because even yours truly is not immune to 
 market forces. I have a&quot;test account&quot;for some NT meters that I 
 forgot about and it automatically renewed. Not a lot of money, but 
 I didn&apos;t want to continue and now I&apos;m stuck for another year due to the 
 automatic renewal. You have to be vigilant about your contract 
 termination dates AND the automatic renewal clauses. 

 01/13/09: Wow! Can you 
 say blank check?  Honeywell announces that it has received an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite 
 Quantity (IDIQ) Energy Savings Performance Contract from the 
 Department of Energy. The contract allows them to implement up to $5 bln 
 of energy-efficiency, renewable-energy and water-conservation projects 
 at federally owned buildings and facilities, nationally and 
 internationally, over the next 10 years.  Corporate home run? 

 The Guardian reports that Saudi Arabia plans to go beyond OPEC&apos;s deepest ever single 
 cut in supply as the world&apos;s top oil exporter looks to halt a slide that 
 has lopped over $110 off the oil price since July. The kingdom will pump 
 below its OPEC target in February and is prepared to go further still to 
 bring a market battered by falling demand and a global recession back to 
 balance, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters on Tuesday.&quot;We will 
 do what it takes to bring it back to balance,&quot;he said on arrival in 
 India for an energy conference. The Saudi supply target was 8.05 million 
 barrels per day (bpd), a little under 10 percent of global output, after 
 the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to 
 its biggest ever cut in December.&quot;It will be lower,&quot;Naimi said of 
 February output. The kingdom was currently pumping around 8 million bpd, 
 he added. Strict Saudi discipline has so far failed to boost oil prices, 
 which were below $37 a barrel on Tuesday, less than half the $75 price 
 which Saudi King Abdullah has named as fair. Naimi declined to comment 
 on whether the move was taken in anticipation of a further cut in output 
 by OPEC. 

 01/12/09: Deja vu:  Reuters.com reports top exporter Saudi Arabia plans to cut oil output by 
 up to 300,000 barrels per day below its agreed OPEC target -- a 
 pro-active step to prop up a collapsing market, industry sources said. 
 OPEC&apos;s most influential member has lowered supply this month to 8 
 million bpd, meeting its target under OPEC&apos;s pact to reduce overall 
 production by a record amount from Jan. 1. But strict Saudi discipline 
 has failed to boost oil prices -- which at close to $40 are far from the 
 $75 a barrel named by Saudi King Abdullah as a fair price. So Riyadh is 
 prepared, from February, to go beyond what is required by OPEC, the 
 sources said.&quot;We&apos;ve been told Saudi Arabia will cut to about 7.7 
 million in February,&quot;said a senior oil executive.&quot;They want to prevent 
 a huge stock build up and a further decline in the oil price.&quot;  

 Booyah! Anybody 
 catch 60 Minutes last night?  It&apos;s as if they read my 
 newsletter and did a video story on it!!! Executive summary: speculation that speculation was/is behind the huge move in oil prices 
 last year. Here&apos;s a neat little rebuttal from Seeking 
 Alpha.  I tend to agree that you can&apos;t blame speculators for 
 the entire move. But you can and should blame them for igniting 
 the fire. We all know what happened to house prices when banks 
 sought unending profits. See banner comment at top of page.  

 01/08/09: Saudis make steep 
 delivery cut to refiners from Jan 1, according to trader - DJ   I think it&apos;s tragic that bears are talking down the price of crude 
 while ignoring the fact that steep discounts discourage new production 
 and/or drilling. I fear we&apos;re setting up a trap for $200+ oil when 
 this recession ends. I read Ferdinand Pecora &apos;s book detailing the 
 abuses from the 1929 crash and we&apos;ve learned nothing in the last 80 
 years...history really has repeated itself. The good news is that 
 purging and re-regulation aren&apos;t the death knell for capitalism. If you really want an eye-opener, read Joseph De La Vega&apos;s Confusion 
 de Confusiones . The abuses we&apos;ve seen on Wall Street are 
 nearly the same ones seen by Amsterdam in the late 1600s. Yes, 325 
 years ago, speculators, shorts, trickery, inside information, ... about 
 the only thing different from now and then is par...in the old days, 
 stock was quoted as a percent above or below the par price. 

 01/06/09:  So much for the 
 talking heads and $25 oil! 6 oil prices have moved $0.25 in two 
 weeks. 

 01/02/09: Happy New Year!  Blink and you missed the lows in the oil market. This also 
 happened a few years ago...trade is very thin over the holidays and it&apos;s 
 a good time to lock down prices. From the great minds think alike 
 file: here are a set ( 1 &amp; 2 ) of op-eds from yesterday&apos;s 
 NY Times. Lots of text, but one conclusion reached by the author 
 is the same as something I&apos;ve been harping on for some time...the 
 ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody&apos;s, et al) are complicit in this financial 
 mess. Who polices the police? 

 I had CNBC on in the background over the 
 holidays as I built a bathroom...oh my! How can anyone listen to 
 this dribble? Every move in the commodities markets is met with 
 instant bull/bear talking head dribble...we&apos;re going to $25!...we&apos;ll 
 never break $75 again...doomsday...back to normal... Here&apos;s the 
 bottom line: it&apos;s a good time to lock down prices for 2009. Period. And it&apos;s a good time to think about 2010, especially with 
 PPL looming. Didya see how fast oil zoomed off the bottom? 

 12/29/08:  Natural gas 
 moving average is working like a charm...see how they can&apos;t move it down 
 despite the oil carnage? The pipeline companies are not subject to 
 market forces and act like a brake to falling prices...they just 
 increase their tolls. 

 12/24/08: Is this it? Are 
 we all just played by market manipulation?  WSJ reports federal investigators trying to pinpoint what is behind gyrations in the 
 price of oil in the past year and a half are scrutinizing a series of 
 moves by Dutch-Swiss oil trader Vitol Group. Enforcement 
 attorneys at the CFTC are dissecting trades of a single oil trader at a six-person hedge fund in Houston run by Vitol in an attempt 
 to size up the influence of those trades, if any, on the market. His 
 trading contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where the world 
 oil benchmark trades, at one point in July constituted 11% of all 
 crude-oil bets outstanding on Nymex around the time oil was reaching 
 unforeseen heights. The investigators also are looking at Vitol&apos;s use of 
 oil tankers for floating storage as part of a broader inquiry into 
 so-called physical oil trading and its impact on the futures markets. 
 Physical trading involves the actual commodity, rather than futures 
 contracts. Vitol is the largest independent physical oil trader in the 
 world. There hasn&apos;t been any accusation that any Vitol trades in 
 question were improper, and it isn&apos;t clear where the CFTC&apos;s multifaceted 
 inquiry into the forces behind oil&apos;s recent volatility will lead. The 
 agency is questioning numerous players. 

 12/22/08:  Chart reading 
 101...look at the&quot;squish&quot;on those natural gas numbers. They&apos;re 
 trying to push it down, but the trend is flat. Also known in the 
 trade as&quot;support&quot;. It&apos;s darn near close to a bottom per the 
 trend. Oil? As you know, the current month contract is 
 grabbing all of the press headlines...but look at the Sunoco and Hess 
 quotes...they&apos;re not collapsing like the prompt price...once again, we 
 want oil to go UP, if only because it&apos;s a forward indicator of the 
 health of the overall economy. I cannot remember the last time 
 crude traded BELOW #6 oil in absolute terms. Another first for 
 2008. 

 12/19/08: Here&apos;s the definition 
 of contango: Jan crude oil, which expires today at the close 
 of pit trade, is seeing continued weakness this morning, and has set 
 lows at $33.44 ; currently off $2.33 to $33.89; Feb crude , 
 which will will become the new front month, is seeing modest pressure 
 this morning but not experiencing the sell off that the Jan contract is. 
 It has given back its overnight gains and is currently unchanged at $41.67 . 

 12/17/08:  They&apos;re cutting! They&apos;re not cutting! It&apos;s too much! It&apos;s not enough! Bullish! Bearish! I&apos;m guessing the headline number of 4.2 
 Mbpd is out there to compensate for the&quot;cheaters&quot;. All I know for 
 certain is that drilling costs haven&apos;t collapsed and the inventory 
 numbers aren&apos;t THAT impressive. Futures are climbing while prompt 
 (or current) stalls...this would be great news if we all had massive 
 storage tanks on site to build cheap inventory. Reality is a whole 
 different ballgame. 

 12/15/08:  AP reports that Kuwait&apos;s oil minister says   OPEC 
 is&quot;undoubtedly inclined&quot;to cut production in its upcoming meeting   in 
 Algeria to shore up oil prices. But Mohammed al-Eleim said Monday that 
 any decision at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&apos; Dec. 
 17 Oran, Algeria, meeting would balance the need for a cut with its 
 impact on the ailing world economy and producer nations&apos; need for 
 revenue to fund development projects. Two earlier cuts by the 13-nation 
 group have failed to stem plummeting crude prices, which are currently 
 about 65% below a mid-July record of almost $150 per barrel. Al-Eleim, 
 speaking to reporters before leaving for Algeria, declined to say how 
 deep a cut should be implemented. 

 12/12/08:  Talking head 
 banality: Goldman Sachs sees crude at $30, but if OPEC cuts 
 production, we could easily trade through $50...What would you do?  Where is the common sense? And this from a business channel... 

 Another sign of 
 the times... symbolic 
 wind turbine projects get cancelled . As I&apos;ve said, they never 
 made sense in the first place. See red headline above!!! 

 Here&apos;s a fascinating look at the guts of GM:  http://www.media.gm.com/manufacturing/handbook/index.html  The 
 media exploits that $73/hr figure without providing a distinction 
 between wages and total cost. Like the rest of America, what are 
 they supposed to do? Just whack the pension plan? 

 Up, down, left, right? Every Wall Street firm is out with their 
 latest prognostications. Who cares any longer? We&apos;re here to 
 watch the trends and look for turning points. We lurched upwards 
 from that $40 mark and we have OPEC on board on 12/17. I think 
 we&apos;ve set the short term bottom.  

 12/11/08:  Overnight, the 
 IEA issued its monthly report which predicted that world oil demand will contract 
 for the first time in 25 years due to the weakening in worldwide 
 economic activity. Specifically, the report said they expect global oil 
 demand in 2008 to slide by 0.2%, or 200,000 barrels a day, to 85.8 mln 
 barrels a day. The report went on to say that while the agency expects 2009 to 
 be lethargic, demand will grow by 0.5% or ~400K bpd YoY . It also 
 raised its projection for demand growth by ~100K bpd from Nov. There 
 were also some bullish commentary from the world&apos;s biggest exporter of 
 crude oil, Saudi Arabia, which said it pumped ~8.49 mln bpd in Nov. This 
 was less than analysts were 
 expecting, but inline with OPEC&apos;s target . ( What have I been 
 saying? ) Crude has set highs at $45.98 and is currently pulling back 
 from those highs. 

 12/08/08:  Let the good 
 times roll! I warned about buying too early...and we bought too 
 early. Oh well. A bird in the hand... Going back to 
 what was said at our last meeting, I wouldn&apos;t fight the trend. Common sense indicates that the run up was too far/too fast. I 
 think this dive is overdone on the backside. I especially love how 
 the pundits now think that OPEC&apos;s meeting on 12/17 won&apos;t have any 
 affect...we&apos;ll see. Let&apos;s not forget that oil is in contango...if 
 you wanted to lock 2009, the premium is 25%; the premium for 2010 is 
 50%. So the market is eyeing this price action with suspicion. 

 Note the gas vs. oil anomaly...basis on 
 TETCO is smokin&apos; right now. NYMEX might be in the tank, but ABE 
 and eastern PA don&apos;t see the benefit. 

 $50 to $40 in 2 days! Yeah, I knew 
 that was coming. If you&apos;re keeping score, that means oil lost 20% 
 of it&apos;s value in 2 days. 2 days. 20%. And our budgets 
 move at what, 2% per year? There&apos;s an awful lot o money getting 
 made on the short trade. Just as the longs were squeezing shorts, 
 now the shorts are printing dough...this leads me to believe they&apos;ve 
 pressed their bets too hard and the snapback will be brutal. 

 12/05/08: WOW! Take a 
 look at this chart of crude oil 
 prices . I guess an optimist would simply state that $30/bbl is 
 next because that&apos;s the inflation-adjusted price based on 1991&apos;s lows. But this ignores the FACT that easy oil supplies have been depleted and 
 deepwater drilling extraction is way more expensive than land-based 
 alternatives. I think we&apos;re lulling ourselves back into a sense 
 that the spike was all BS and happy days are here again. 

 It&apos;s hard to get 
 excited about falling energy prices with headlines like this one:   November 
 nonfarm payrolls plunged 533,000 (consensus -335,000). The October 
 number was revised lower to -320,000 from an originally reported 
 -240,000 while the September number was revised lower to -403,000 from 
 -284,000.   Cumulatively, then, 1.28 million jobs have been lost in the last three months alone.  The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.5%, hourly earnings 
 increased 0.4%, and the average workweek dipped to 33.5 hours from 33.6 
 hours. The latter is further evidence that hiring activity isn&apos;t going 
 to pick up soon. There is no sugar-coating this data. It is bad news 
 that will weigh heavily on consumer sentiment and will serve to increase 
 concerns about the depth and length of the current slowdown.  

 These 
 are the worst of times for all of the energy savings initiatives 
 recently started...paybacks are getting stretched. The only silver 
 lining (if you can call it that) might be that your budgets are now 
 adequate to handle the electric price increase.   

 12/04/08:  I cannot believe that the same firms telling us that $200 oil was 
 imminent (a mere 6 months ago) are now out on the stump telling everyone 
 how the downtrend will continue and LOWER prices are coming. It&apos;s 
 all a game of momentum and they can&apos;t seem to read a chart. OPEC 
 might only control 40% of the market, but if and when they act, it will 
 be felt.  

 Crude oil sets fresh lows at $45.12; currently off $1.60 to $45.19; how 
 ironic is it that we&apos;re sitting at this level as the automakers plead 
 for their lives? As much as I love low oil prices, the reality 
 remains that exploration and production budgets, as well as alternative 
 energy projects, are getting cut to the bone. OPEC will cut on 
 12/17 while we get lured back to the drug. The low prices do 
 nothing to encourage conservation and/or alternatives, thus prolonging 
 the inevitable. 

 12/01/08:  Remember my 
 comment about moving averages? It&apos;s time to watch closely and see 
 if we break upwards and hold. If we do, that&apos;s a clear signal to 
 lock down some of your future supply. 

 11/26/08:  Gas exploded to 
 the upside today on bearish storage numbers. I think I was clear 
 last week that the bottom was/is near. 

 11/24/08:  The 6 oil to 
 natural gas split is getting ever more pronounced...this is where a 
 market player would be switching to oil.  It&apos;s also saying 
 something about the price of natural gas in that it&apos;s rallying in this 
 horrible market . If you want price certainty for next year, a lock 
 of 50-75% would be prudent here. Remember, there is economic 
 catastrophe and there is cost of production...we can&apos;t get below COP for 
 an extended time or the demand destruction will fall victim to lack of 
 supply. 

 11/21/08: Yeah!  WSJ reports an unexpected drop in U.S. electricity consumption has 
 utility companies worried that the trend isn&apos;t a byproduct of the 
 economic downturn, and could reflect a permanent shift in consumption 
 that will require sweeping change in their industry. Numbers are 
 trickling in from several large utilities that show shrinking power use 
 by households and businesses in pockets across the country. Utilities 
 have long counted on sales growth of 1% to 2% annually in the U.S., and 
 they created complex operating and expansion plans to meet the needs of 
 a growing population.   The 
 data are early and incomplete, but if the trend persists, it could 
 ripple through companies&apos; earnings and compel major changes in the way 
 utilities run their businesses.   Utilities 
 are expected to invest $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion by 2030 to modernize 
 their electric systems and meet future needs, according to an 
 industry-funded study by the Brattle Group. However, if   electricity 
 demand is flat or even declining, utilities must either make significant 
 adjustments to their investment plans or run the risk of building too 
 much capacity . That could end up burdening customers and shareholders with 
 needless expenses. To be sure, electricity use fluctuates with the 
 economy and population trends. But what has executives stumped is that 
 recent shifts appear larger than others seen previously, and they can&apos;t 
 easily be explained by weather fluctuations. They have also penetrated 
 the most stable group of consumers -- households. 

 11/20/08:  Good meeting 
 yesterday! Now, holy crap! Where does it end? Dec. 
 Crude Oil (which expires today) closed down $4.62 at its session lows of 
 $49.00, the lowest levels since May 2005. The new front month 
 contract, crude for January delivery, closed at session lows of $51.20 
 -$2.90. Natural gas fell 42.3 cents to $6.32, heating oil closed down 8.38 cents to $1.6759 (i.e. maybe $1.89 delivered ). 

 11/14/08:  Moral hazard 
 101...do you let GM, et al fail? Especially with every Tom, Dick 
 and Harry now asking for TARP $? There is a little voice in my 
 head saying that Goldman Sachs, the oh-so-sophisticated money grubbers, 
 should go down to end this mess. Dunno, but it turns my stomach to 
 watch the latest AIG sales meeting in Phoenix while they cry that they 
 need even more $ to stabilize. 

 11/13/08:  You know things 
 are tough when commentators start pulling out chart patterns from 
 1929-32 to discuss market strategies. 
 
 WTI Dec was up about $1 
 ahead of the EIA release. The Reuters survey had called for a build 
 of 1.2MM bbls in crude, build of 800K bbls in gasoline and build of 
 300K in distillates. The numbers came in bearish with larger than expected builds in the products. 
 Although the numbers were bullish for crude, demand 
 destruction is still what participants are talking about and 
 crude sold off. Crude imports were down 469K bbls while refinery 
 utilization was down 0.7% to 84.6%. As of this writing, crude prompt 
 is unchanged on the day. 
 11/12/08:  Dec crude oil 
 ($58.73 -$0.60) made a new 20 month low this morning, touching $57.70 in 
 electronic trade, expanding on yesterday&apos;s move below the $60 mark. 
 Crude oil is now off over $89 from its all time high at $147.27 set back 
 in early July. Concerns about slowing demand were exacerbated this 
 morning when the World Bank revised growth forecasts for developing 
 economies caused in part by tumult in the markets and sluggish exports. 
 Note that weekly inventory data will be released tomorrow due to 
 yesterday&apos;s Veteran&apos;s Day holiday. 

 11/11/08 : NOTE the T4 ALERT FOR DONE DEAL...The $60 crude break hit limit orders 
 that were preset. Our VP chose to lock down FY10 budget at savings&gt;$1M. It is what it is.  

 11/10/08:  Still researching to see if they&apos;re 
 the&quot;only&quot;utility implementing AEPS.  We&apos;ll discuss this at 
 our meeting. 

 Off-topic:  &quot;In one of the latest what-were-you-thinking moves, the Federal Reserve 
 just announced it has hired Michael Alix as a bank regulation advisor. 
 Who the heck is Michael Alix, you ask? He is the former chief risk 
 officer at Bear Stearns, a company that thought risk-management was an 
 oxymoron. Essentially, he is the guy that allowed Bear Stearns to get so 
 over-leveraged, it collapsed under its own weight. Now, he is an advisor 
 for the Federal Reserve. At the very least, he can tell us what not to 
 do. Frankly, I believe the Fed’s hiring of one of the executives at the 
 center of today’s market fiasco proves that the“good-old boy”system 
 remains alive and well in Washington. It is a disgrace.&quot; from Today&apos;s Financial News! 

 Thinking outside 
 the box has become a cliche, but this article regarding a national 
 electrical grid makes a lot of sense. 

 Who else is tired of these breakfast 
 meetings to discuss the&quot;possible&quot;30% rate increase? I had a 
 student stand up and state that he thought the projected increase in 
 2010 would be less than 35%&quot;because that&apos;s what the paper said.&quot; The PPL train will hit a mountain when reality comes home next year. 

 11/07/08:   Power 
 users tell PUC state&apos;s electricity markets are broken.  Nice of 
 the paper to bury this little tidbit deep in the bowels. 

 Here&apos;s a neat little summary of the tax credits available to individuals who might choose to become 
 mini-LEEDers. 

 11/04/08:  Dollar falls most against Euro since currency&apos;s 1999 debut; dollar 
 declines 2.6% to 1.2974 per euro - Bloomberg 

 PPL:  Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.45 per share,   $0.15   worse 
 than   the First 
 Call consensus of $0.60. Co issues   downside 
 guidance   for FY08, 
 sees EPS of $2.00-$2.05 (vs. $2.29 consensus), this is revised from 
 their prior range of $2.17-$2.27. Co issues   downside 
 guidance   for FY09, 
 sees EPS of $1.60-$1.90 vs. $2.17 consensus. &quot;Many of the pressures that 
 affected our results in 2008 also are expected to continue into 2009, 
 including ongoing cost pressures, fixed generation prices in 
 Pennsylvania and higher financing costs... During the third quarter of 
 2008, we saw unprecedented levels of volatility in the energy 
 commodities market, a rapid decline in the capital devoted to energy 
 markets by a range of market participants and a substantial drop in 
 wholesale electricity prices. As a consequence, we experienced 
 unrealized losses in certain of our energy positions that, along with 
 extended outages at two of our large coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania, 
 resulted in third-quarter energy margins that are much lower than a year 
 ago.&quot; PPL continues to forecast very strong earnings growth for 2010 with a new forecast range of $3.60 to $4.20 per share. This new range is 
 down from the prior 2010 forecast range of $4.00 to $4.60 per share.  Now&apos;s the time to cloud their crystal ball...hell no, deregulation must 
 go! 

 &quot;While forward energy prices have declined 
 from earlier in the year, we remain extremely well positioned for 2010 
 and beyond because we sold 
 forward a significant portion of our available power at the higher 
 prices and have fuel contracts in place that are significantly 
 below current market prices,&quot;said Miller, chairman and chief executive, 
 in a press release.  Thanks Jim. Nice job gouging the 
 consumers. Good for Wall Street, bad for Main Street. 

 11/03/08: Here&apos;s a little 
 reality check worth 30 minutes of your time:   www.iousathemovie.com 

 FT reports the credit crisis has cut off much-needed financing for the 
 US power sector, which equity investors have abandoned en masse, setting 
 the stage for a string of mergers or bankruptcy filings. In the past 
 month, two potential mergers have been announced: Warren Buffett bid on 
 Constellation Energy and Exelon offered to take over NRG Energy. 
 Analysts say   Reliant 
 Energy, Dynegy, Calpine, AES and Mirant are likely to be next on the 
 list, with investors betting against them in both credit and equity 
 markets.   This is similar 
 to the situation these companies found themselves in after Enron, when 
 the US&apos;s biggest unregulated 
 energy trader collapsed in 2001, taking with it confidence in the 
 entire sector. NRG and Mirant eventually sought bankruptcy protection. 
 The others shed valuable assets and restructured to remain afloat.&quot;This 
 feels like 2001-2002 all over again,&apos;&apos; said Mark Williams, professor of 
 finance and economics at Boston University.&quot;It&apos;s an environment exactly 
 like what followed Enron; investors have lost confidence and the equity 
 and debt markets have priced this in.&apos;&apos; 

 I&apos;ve decoded the 
 AICUP sales pitch on electricity. It&apos;s pretty simple...using the 
 PUC&quot;flashcuts&quot;as a guide for prices, timing is everything. That&apos;s it. WHEN you commit to an electricity contact matters. Just as WHEN you commit to a natural gas buy matters. 

 Anybody notice how gas and #6 oil are 
 nearly equal again?  

 10/29/08:  The FT reports output from the 
 world&apos;s oilfields is declining faster than previously thought, the first 
 authoritative public study of the biggest fields shows . Without 
 extra investment to raise production, the natural annual rate of output 
 decline is 9.1%, the International Energy Agency says in its annual 
 report, the World Energy Outlook, a draft of which has been obtained by 
 the Financial Times. The findings suggest the world will struggle to 
 produce enough oil to make up for steep declines in existing fields, 
 such as those in the North Sea, Russia and Alaska, and meet long-term 
 demand. The effort will become even more acute as prices fall and 
 investment decisions are delayed. The IEA, the oil watchdog, forecasts 
 that China, India and other developing countries&apos; demand will require 
 investments of $360bn each year until 2030. The agency says even with investment, the annual 
 rate of output decline is 6.4 per cent. The decline will not 
 necessarily be felt in the next few years because demand is slowing 
 down, but with the expected slowdown in investment the eventual effect 
 will be magnified, oil executives say. 

 10/24/08:  Dec crude ($63.66 
 -$4.18) is trading lower this morning by over 6%, following news that OPEC announced it will cut 
 production by 1.5 mln bpd, which was in line with expectations. 
 In its statement, OPEC said that&quot;...oil prices have witnessed a 
 dramatic collapse -unprecedented in speed and magnitude- falling to 
 levels which may put at jeopardy many existing oil projects and lead to 
 the cancellation or delay of others, possibly resulting in a medium-term 
 supply shortage.&quot;The cartel left open the possibility of another 
 meeting before its December meeting. Crude saw a very modest reaction to 
 the news, which is not very surprising as a cut of ~1 mln bpd was a 
 already priced into the mkt. It 
 made lows at $63.05, a level not seen since June 2007 , and 
 remains very close to those lows in current trade. 

 10/22/08: WOW!   Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 3182K (consensus is a build of 
 2650K); gasoline inventories had a build of 
 2709K (consensus is a build of 2700K); distillate inventories had a build of 2156K (consensus is a build of 
 300K).  Bearish. OPEC is going to cut at least 1M bpd.  Crude oil sees muted reaction to DOE data showing larger than expected 
 inventory builds... Crude now -4.12 at 68.08.  Down $4 is muted??? 

 10/21/08: B-tane just reared 
 it&apos;s head...here&apos;s my response to Rex:  You&apos;ve got 
 to get ahead of the curve...#6 is selling for $1.40 today, yet that is 
 still far too expensive compared to natural gas at $7.33/mmBTU to the 
 city gate. We&apos;re locked on gas through Jun 09...it&apos;s greener than B-TANE 
 and significantly cheaper. I asked you to lock 1 MG @ $1.90 when oil 
 crossed $100/bbl but you declined.  This is a game of timing and 
 forward-looking projections, hence the futures market. I need price 
 transparency, just like the banks. There needs to be a method of price 
 discovery and future cost stability to burn the volumes we need. Clearly we&apos;re working toward that goal. 

 10/20/08:  OPEC President 
 Khelil says non-OPEC oil producers should contribute output cuts of 
 their own to help stabilize price - Reuters  Seriously? Are things that bad in Dubai? Can&apos;t pay for the indoor ski slopes? Remember...OPEC is about 40% of the market. 

   Terrific story in 
 the Sunday NY Times magazine about oil prices . It revists a 
 lot of turf that we&apos;ve covered in our meetings. One 
 caveat...Sequoia is an incubator company for Silicon Valley 
 companies...they also have a vested interest in alternative energy. But let&apos;s not lose sight of the ball...we still import 66% of what we 
 consume. 

 10/16/08:  Crude closed off 
 $4.65 to $69.85, natural gas gained 18.3 cents to $6.775, heating oil ended off 13.77 cents to 
 $2.0528. . 

 OPEC says reschedules extraordinary meeting to Oct 24 in Vienna - 
 Reuters 

 DOE Inventories: Crude and gasoline show much larger than expected builds for second straight week : Dept of Energy reports that   crude 
 oil   inventories had a 
 build of 5611K (consensus is a build of 2600K); gasoline   inventories 
 had a build of 6973K (consensus is a build of 3000K);   distillate   inventories 
 had a draw of 453K (consensus is a build of 500K).  Bearish. 

  10/13/08: WOW.  DJ reports Goldman Sachs now 
 sees oil prices declining to $65/barrel in 1Q as demand declines 
 due to global slowdown.&quot;The cyclical downturn will last at least 
 through the first half of 2009, with sustained improvement in global GDP 
 the key to the cycle&apos;s turning back up.&quot; In May, Goldman predicted oil prices would either stay above $100 for a long 
 period or would&quot;super-spike&quot;to $200 next year before falling sharply. (Remember, they had a vested interest). They now see the average price of oil next year at $75/barrel.   All of this from the&quot;best of the best&quot;? I can do better...buy low 
 and budget correctly. 

 10/10/08:  WSJ reports the Treasury and Federal Reserve need to target the right 
 problem - a lack of capital that has eroded confidence in the banking 
 system. To do that, the government needs to inject capital directly into 
 banks. Consider that $700 billion, the size of the TARP program, is 
 equal to only about 6% of U.S. commercial bank assets. That isn&apos;t going 
 to make a dent. That same $700 billion is equal to 58% of commercial 
 bank equity. Injecting capital alone isn&apos;t enough.   The 
 government also needs to force banks to recognize losses they have so 
 far ignored, require banks to provide fuller disclosure of holdings, 
 push banks to lend to one another again, euthanize weaker banks while 
 helping strong banks get stronger, guarantee deposits and backstop a 
 portion of bank credit . Above all, the government needs to tell 
 banks that they have to take part in a systemic solution. The time for 
 negotiation by banks is over. Yet such a draconian approach should also 
 include market-based solutions. The strong should be encouraged to use 
 markets to get stronger, in some cases in conjunction with government 
 support. The Fed could do this by insisting on higher capital ratios, 
 for example, and then give banks a brief period to get there on their 
 own. If a bank can&apos;t, it would have to accept government help.  Roubini&apos;s solution from Day 1.. . 

 WSJ reports big oil-producing countries 
 are showing signs of distress as the global credit crunch and falling 
 crude prices begin to squeeze government budgets and delay projects. 
 Fears that the boom days are fading appear strongest in Iran and 
 Venezuela, whose governments have come to rely on oil prices to prop up 
 otherwise shaky economies. Both countries this week led a chorus within 
 the Organization of Petroleum 
 Exporting Countries calling for an emergency meeting of the cartel, now 
 set for Nov. 18 , to weigh a production cut. The global 
 economic crisis is eating into oil demand , 
 particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and helping drive down crude 
 prices. Some forecasters said that despite a strong thirst for oil in 
 Asia and the Middle East, global oil consumption could flatten out next 
 year, potentially ending nearly a decade of steady demand growth. Oil 
 exporters have racked up cash surpluses as prices soared to historic 
 highs. But government spending also has soared within OPEC and among 
 other big producers such as Russia, based in part on the expectation 
 that oil prices would remain high. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE 
 BALL...COMPLACENCY WILL NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT WE IMPORT 66% OF OUR 
 OIL. DEMAND REDUCTION DRIVES DOWN PRICES...Period. 

 10/09/08:  OK, I&apos;m going to 
 put it out there...since we&apos;re so busy socializing losses and/or 
 nationalizing mortgages and banks, who wants to bet that the electricity 
 deregulation train is finally due to hit a speed bump? Free 
 markets don&apos;t police themselves...back to the regulated monopoly? 

 WSJ reports banks are beating a hasty retreat from the physical oil and 
 fuel markets, as the credit 
 crisis cuts financial institutions out of a once-promising line of 
 business. Over the last month, confidence in the banking sector 
 has been badly shaken, with several failures, a rash of forced mergers 
 and expectations of even more government support. In some energy 
 markets, banks are being kept at arm&apos;s length by oil companies and 
 refineries that are wary of not being paid should a counterparty join 
 the list of failed banks. Some large oil companies have issued internal 
 memos forbidding their traders worldwide from dealing with Morgan 
 Stanley (MS) and Merrill Lynch (MER), two of the more active banks in 
 physical commodities.&quot;They are reducing their exposure,&quot;said one 
 broker of physical oil on the Gulf Coast, who is not cleared to speak to 
 the media and requested anonymity.&quot;And they really don&apos;t have a choice 
 because the traders are not trading with them.&quot;  Remember how I said 33% of the price was speculation??? 

 UGI just reared their 
 ugly head. It took a massive amount of hemming and hawing to get 
 them at $1.30 on my delivery charge. Whew! Take a look at 
 the chart on the left...the potential damage could have been as bad as 
 $4.76. NEVER EVER TELL KIERNAN THAT YOU&apos;VE ALREADY PURCHASED YOUR 
 FUEL IN ADVANCE OR YOU HAVE NO LEVERAGE!!! 10% for delivery isn&apos;t 
 ideal, but it beats the $3.75 DS fee. 

 10/08/08: Dept of Energy reports that   crude 
 oil   inventories had a 
 build of 8123K (consensus is a build of 2200K);   gasoline   inventories 
 had a build of 7175K (consensus is a build of 1500K);   distillate   inventories 
 had a draw of 489K (consensus is a draw of 900K).  BEARISH. Huge inventory build... 

 I&apos;d 
 like to note that I recommended to Mike Brewer that he not prepay for 
 heating oil at this time. This is an unprecedented credit crisis 
 and clearly the recession is here. The price trend is DOWN and you 
 follow the trend. Keep in mind that heating oil was offered at 
 $2.44 a mere 52 weeks ago. This is the reason behind the $3 gallon 
 data point immediately to the left at the bottom of the $/mmBTU chart. Support is broken and the $100 mark should be resistance for 
 quite some time. This is also why I&apos;ve never recommended more than 
 a 50% lock. 

 I&apos;d 
 also like to note that we (Lehigh) have 90% of our main gas locked down 
 for FY09; the 10% at market is keeping us well under budget. I DID 
 NOT lock the NDS account and elected to float at market...this is paying 
 off. And I just sealed the NT accounts.  

 I&apos;m 
 watching FY10 very closely and I might nail Jul-Dec09 to hedge storm 
 risk.  

 10/07/08:  Steelmakers weighing output cut size before prices fall below 
 breakeven price - WSJ    Inflation? We don&apos;t see no stinkin&apos; inflation...we&apos;re going from inflation to 
 deflation faster than any time I can remember... 

 10/06/08:  Crude ended lower 
 by $5.74 to $88.14, nat gas fell 52.9 cents to $6.829, heating oil 
 closed off 17.68 cents to $2.4852 and RBOB gasoline finished down
16.07 cents to $2.0676. Good news on energy because it&apos;s 
 predicting that nobody will be buying anything in the upcoming months. The unemployed don&apos;t need to fill up their tanks. Enough is enough 
 already. 

 Nov crude ($89.60 -$4.28) set a 
 new 8 month low this morning as it touched $88.89 in electronic 
 trade (Feb 8 was the last time crude saw the $89 mark) on unremitting 
 concerns that the ongoing financial crisis will continue to stymie 
 demand. Also pushing crude lower is the ongoing rally in the dollar 
 against the euro, which is now at 13 month highs. Worth mentioning is 
 that the OPEC President said 
 today that crude will continue to fall into next year and that there are 
 risks that could move it down to around $60 pbl. Not surprising was the 
 fact that OPEC plans to take the &apos;appropriate measures&apos; at the next 
 meeting (scheduled for Dec 17) to stabilize the market. 

 T4 
 Market Update: Note how the natural gas prices are clearly in a 
 bottoming mode. I see 6 oil in a free fall to test that $1.70 
 area. If you prepaid 50% of your heating oil, it&apos;s a good time to 
 fill your tanks with market-priced oil. While lower prices are 
 great for our budgets, it&apos;s a moot point if the financial markets 
 collapse. The best quote I&apos;ve heard is&quot;We want a percolate up 
 economy, not a trickle down.&quot; Clearly we&apos;re seeing the unwinding 
 of all things speculative...which again leads me to the natural gas 
 charts...the price seems to be near a bottom. My indicators are 
 very close to calling oil a buy, but indicators can fail when markets 
 are in a crisis mode. Nevertheless, watch this $88 level 
 carefully. The stock market is grossly oversold and due for a 
 bounce. The $1 million question is whether the bounce establishes 
 support or is a set-up for another leg down to Dow 8000. Some 
 pundits think the entire decade&apos;s gains are at risk...as if the Bush 
 presidency is to be wiped out (Note the DOW is already lower than 
 1/20/01). Personally I think the Fed is out of bullets and I&apos;m 
 looking for signs of stability. Watching the national debt cross 
 the $10 trillion mark isn&apos;t good news. On the other hand, the 
 doom&amp;gloom is thicker than any crisis I can recall (87, LTCM, S&amp;L, 
 dot-com bust). When all hope is lost it&apos;s usually a time to buy. 

 10/03/08:   A 
 well-researched piece that effectively describes another root of the 
 current credit crisis . Mandatory reading! 

 10/02/08:   PPL&apos;s 
 latest press release.  Is it possible that consumers can&apos;t do 
 simple math? Folks, my current generation cost is 4.7 cents/kwhr. How in the world can a procurement of 11.194 cent power (11.194 / 4.7 = 
 2.38 or 238%) result in an average increase of 38 percent??? New 
 math? Fuzzy logic? 66% of the way to the 2010 deregulation 
 punch and nobody seems to understand what is coming in 2011. Now I 
 know how Dr. Doom felt before the bank meltdown. 

 Natural gas inventory saw a build of 87 bcf to 3110 bcf, analysts were 
 expecting a build of 73 bcf, ranging from a build of 50 bcf to a build 
 of 85 bcf. Bullish for school budgets! I&apos;m already sniffing 
 around the first six months of FY10. These gas prices aren&apos;t 
 headed to zero.  

 10/01/08:  How I wish this were the other way around:  UGI Corp announces UGI Utilities Acquires PPL Gas Utilities form $268 
 mln plus capital . 

 Reuters.com reports legislation extending tax credits for the solar, 
 wind and biodiesel industries gained new life on Wednesday as U.S. 
 Senate leaders said they plan to 
 attach the tax bill to a $700 billion economic rescue package. The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday night on this modified version 
 of the bailout package which failed to pass the House of Representatives 
 earlier this week. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said 
 with the addition of the tax incentives, the bill will help average 
 Americans, as well as Wall Street.&quot;Senators and Representatives can now 
 know that a &apos;yes&apos; vote on the financial rescue plan is now a vote to 
 rescue America&apos;s working families from this financial crisis, with the 
 right tax relief at just the right time,&quot;Baucus said in a statement... 
 In addition to the renewable energy tax breaks, the Senate bill included 
 tax incentives for other businesses and a one-year fix to the 
 Alternative Minimum Tax so millions of Americans will not be subject to 
 higher income taxes.  This is sleazy... 

 Dept of Energy reports that   crude 
 oil   inventories had a  build of 4278K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 2750K);   gasoline   inventories 
 had a build of 901K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 2050K);   distillate   inventories 
 had a draw of 2359K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 1500K). Bearish for 
 (most) prices! ---&gt; Crude 
 ticks lower, setting new lows at $97.10. Note...massive 
 deleveraging, credit crisis, a recession, and we&apos;re still holding around 
 the $100 level. We cannot take our eye off the ball...we need to 
 increase taxes, pay down debt, stabilize the housing market (which 
 stabilizes the banks)  AND still cut oil consumption. Nobody said it would be easy! 

 09/29/08:  This bailout ( the 
 original plan ) is 
 wrong. The problem is capital (or lack thereof) on a bank&apos;s 
 balance sheet. And purchasing bad mortgage securities does nothing 
 to alter cash flow expected from homeowners. Privatizing gains 
 while socializing losses does nothing to help the USA. See www.rgemonitor.com for someone 
 who has been right all along and be sure to read some of the non-whacko 
 comments on the blog. Goldman has the largest amount of $ 
 speculating in commodities TODAY...of course Hank doesn&apos;t want to see 
 Goldman go down... Most banks have a problem with about 5% of 
 their mortgages...if you understand leverage and accounting, that 5% is 
 causing insolvency. Put the capital on the asset side of the 
 balance sheet and restore cash flow!!! 

 09/26/08:  T4&apos;s root of the crisis repost 
 from Bloomberg.  S&amp;P, Moody&apos;s, et al were along for the ride 
 and their late downgrades are now exacerbating the problem.  &quot;The fund manager borrowed 45 x investors&apos; equity...&quot;!!!  And you wonder why we have problems? 

 09/25/08:  The market seems 
 to think that today&apos;s gas injection numbers (51 bcf vs. 61 bcf expected) 
 are very bearish. I think it reflects some hurricane residual. I&apos;d say they&apos;re a net neutral. We have plenty of gas in storage 
 and the storm season is nearly over. 

 09/24/08:  Dept 
 of Energy reports that   crude 
 oil   inventories had a  draw of 1520K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 2500K );   gasoline   inventories 
 had a draw of 5895K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 3600K);   distillate   inventories 
 had a draw of 4176K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 1500K).  Moderately bullish, not great numbers. 

 Here&apos;s 
 a good editorial summing up the Crisis of &apos;08.  We need leaders 
 and it will take a realistic view of what needs to happen. We 
 cannot spend our way out of this hole and the fact that we&apos;re bleeding 
 $1 billion/day to keep Iraqis in their own homes is appalling. It&apos;s clear to the energy guy that a strong dollar is the result of a 
 good budget and a strong dollar might help R&amp;D to reduce consumption, 
 which helps the USA in the long term.  Who wants to bet that our oh-so-smart pols won&apos;t heed the advice of 
 someone who lived this problem?  End of editorial. 

 WSJ: T. Boone Pickens would get better marks as a policy advocate and author 
 than an energy investor. The 
 80-year-old Texas oil magnate has bankrolled a massive public campaign 
 for improved U.S. energy independence . But the downturn in energy 
 has blindsided the industry veteran, leaving one of his hedge funds that 
 focuses on energy stocks down almost 30% through August. A smaller 
 commodity-focused fund is down 84%. All in, the funds have lost around 
 $1 billion this year, a figure that includes $270 million of personal 
 losses.&quot;It&apos;s my toughest run in 10 years,&quot;said Mr. Pickens, a former 
 geologist who earned billions by building an oil company and investing 
 in energy.&quot;We missed the turn in the market, there&apos;s nothing fun about 
 it.&quot;  Remember 
 my comments about talking your book??? He has a vested interest in 
 higher prices... 

 House Democrats will allow a quarter-century ban on drilling for oil 
 off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to expire next week.   Appropriations 
 Committee Chairman David Obey is telling reporters that language 
 continuing the moratorium will be omitted this year from a spending bill 
 to keep the government in operating funds after Congress recesses for 
 the election. Republicans have made lifting the ban a key campaign after 
 gasoline prices soared beyond $4 a gallon this summer and public opinion 
 turned in favor of more drilling. President Bush lifted an executive ban 
 on offshore drilling in July. The Interior Department estimates there 
 are 18 billion barrels of recoverable oil beneath coastal waters now 
 off-limits.  Political 
 grandstanding...won&apos;t help crude prices, especially if OPEC cuts 
 production. 

 09/22/08:  Pickens says oil will return to $150/bbl next year - DJ;   Crude oil trades to new 2-month high of $130 per barrel!!!  &quot; When 
 money has nowhere to go...(see header above) Bail out the banks and 
 it&apos;s back to business as usual. 

   Interesting story from another peak oil 
 theorist. 

 Take a quick look at the $/mmBTU 
 graph...it sure looks as if we&apos;ve bottomed...the demand numbers every 
 Wed/Thu will tell the tale from this point forward, especially with the 
 demise of the $ rally due to the credit crisis. 

 09/19/08: You knew this was 
 coming...Crude rallies to new session highs at $105.25 minutes ahead of 
 the close; currently up $6.65 to $104.53. 

 NY Times reports ignoring a presidential veto threat, the House on 
 Thursday approved measures aimed at curbing speculation in oil and other 
 commodity markets. It said federal regulators did not have the tools or 
 manpower to track trading abuses. The bill, passed by a 283-to-133 vote 
 and sent to the Senate, is aimed at certain hedge fund and large 
 institutional investors as well as electronic trading through overseas 
 entities that avoid United States government scrutiny. It would give the 
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority for more staff and for 
 limiting the stake traders hold in certain markets. It also would 
 require new reporting and other limits on traders. 

 Oppenheimer says that despite the recent correction, firm believes oil 
 prices are still inflated and are not supported by true market 
 fundamentals, which continue to deteriorate on a bleaker economic 
 outlook in the wake of the global financial crisis. Firm believes the 
 gyration in oil prices in the last few days is caused by investors&apos; 
 flight to commodities as a safer alternative to the plummeting financial 
 markets. ( See 
 the header above! ). Firm thinks the demise of the large investment banks will significantly 
 curb market appetite for high-risk investments like commodity futures 
 and further deflate the oil bubble, which they helped create. Firm does 
 not rule out a sharp decline in oil prices in the event that the two 
 remaining large investment banks are acquired by commercial banks 
 operating under stricter rules. Their demise will end excessive 
 speculation, which could burst the oil bubble.  Bubble? What bubble?! As I said in the past, a lot of those 
 oil price forecasts were issued by firms with a vested interest in 
 seeing prices higher. 

 09/18/08: U . S. House passes, sends Senate, bill to put position limits on 
 oil futures, White House opposes - Reuters; no surprise there, eh? 

 G oldman&apos;s 
 Murti cuts crude oil price forecasts - DJ (see 8/20/08 comment 
 below); it only took a meltdown of everything financial to burn the 
 speculators... 

 Natural gas inventory saw a build of 67 bcf to 2972 bcf, analysts were expecting a build of 63 bcf, 
 ranging from a build of 40 bcf to a build of 70 bcf.  Bearish! 

 Oil as good as it gets? Here&apos;s my indicator chart . Grossly 
 oversold and bouncing back hard.  Is it Fall of 2006 or are 
 we heading right back up? I think we stabilize, but chances of 
 further price erosion seem slim. 

 Crude continues its rally in electronic trade this 
 morning, moving above the $100 mark to set highs at $102.24 ; 
 currently up $4.33 to $101.52. I maintain that the speculation is 
 gone and we&apos;re back to supply/demand...and the $ is back in the toilet. 

 09/17/08:  Crude oil 
 accelerates to the upside, now +5.21 at 96.36 ... the oil storage numbers 
 aren&apos;t good. .. 

 Accountants are 
 exacerbating this problem...S&amp;P, Moody&apos;s, Fitch, AMBest, etc. They 
 need a muzzle. Each and every downgrade in credit quality, however 
 subjective, forces banks to raise capital that is not there. Bankruptcy forces asset sales at depressed prices. 

 Let&apos;s not ignore this 
 data:  Dept of Energy reports that   crude 
 oil   inventories had a  draw of 6328K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 3500K);   gasoline   inventories 
 had a draw  of 
 3308K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 3500K);   distillate   inventories 
 had a draw of 835K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 1900K). We&apos;re wiping out 
 the speculators, as predicted, but that was only ~33% of the price hike.  Supply and demand still matter. 

 Here&apos;s a nice little story that reflects my comments of 9/12/08 . I keep reading Nouriel 
 Roubini&apos;s (Dr. Doom) blog and while he keeps writing how bad things 
 are (and will get) he never offers a solution. Add to that some 
 comments today that credit spreads might be manipulated to force even 
 more fear and it&apos;s clear that just as oil was overpriced at $145, the 
 financial meltdown has gone too far, too fast. JMHO. 

 WSJ reports evaporating access to credit and fears of an economic 
 washout are taking a toll on oil prices, forcing speculators using borrowed money out of the market . Lehman Brothers&apos; sudden 
 bankruptcy filing and Merrill Lynch&apos;s pending sale to Bank of America 
 suggest big banks may be less willing or able to absorb debt to boost 
 trading positions, with implications for the inherently leveraged 
 oil-futures markets. Analysts believe that could have a ripple effect on 
 other speculative investors in the market. Widespread liquidation of 
 futures contracts compounded fears of faltering oil demand in 
 knocking oil down near $90 a barrel on Tuesday before rebounding to 
 settle at $91.15 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Some traders faced 
 margin calls, or demands for more cash collateral, in other asset 
 classes, market participants said... The duress suggests investment 
 banks&apos; own proprietary commodities trading could decline as banks think 
 twice about how much debt they take on to fund risky positions. Banks&apos; 
 risk aversion could also drive their clients out of the oil market, 
 which could continue to weigh on prices.  Speculators goosed prices. Q.E.D. 

 09/16/08: If you want to see what a rumor can accomplish, take a look at the 
 stock of of Constellation Energy Group (CEG), a utility similar to PPL. It&apos;s crazy out there when a utility can be nearly wiped out in one day 
 with just fear and misinformation. 

 Oct 
 crude ($91.88 -$3.83) continues its sell off this morning, trading as 
 low at $90.91 , 
 on continued concern that the tumult in the financial markets will 
 weaken demand. This is the lowest level that crude has traded at since 
 early Feb, now off over 37% from its all time highs, and is down close to $10 over the past 
 two sessions ... Worth noting is that OPEC released its monthly 
 oil market report this morning, in which it revised downward its 2008 
 world oil demand growth by 0.9 mln bpd to average 86.8 mln bpd. 

 09/15/08: I have a real problem 
 with this&quot;instant answer&quot;nonsense from CNBC... Oppenheimer 
 analyst Meredith Whitney on CNBC says U.S. house prices are the 
 underlying problem, and futures prices indicate a peak to trough decline 
 of ~33% (she believes it will be north of 40-45%). She notes that WB 
 assumes peak to trough decline of only 21%, with 60% of their exposure 
 in California. She notes that Citigroup only assumes a 23% peak to 
 trough decline.  It took 10 years for my house value in 1988 to lose 10%. Suddenly 
 it&apos;s cut everything in half or be crucified by the ratings agencies 
 (S&amp;P, Moody&apos;s). Maybe it&apos;s time to regulate the ratings agencies 
 and let this play out? 

 The good news is 
 crude trading at $96 with a full-blown insurgent uprising in Nigeria. The bad news is crude trading at $96 as the US banking system implodes. This is a recessionary signal. Now we need to figure out how bad 
 it will get. If we take a look at our charts, it&apos;s clear gas is in 
 a bottoming mode. 6 oil can fall further, but it&apos;s hard to imagine 
 a case where it beats gas...nothing is impossible, but it would be an 
 extraordinary move. We need to remember that a good part of the 
 world already hates us and the ultimate irony is our continuing to send 
 petrodollars abroad as our own economy falters. But hey, who needs 
 regulation? Deregulate investment banks, deregulate electricity, 
 deregulate everything, right? Let the markets decide...? 

 09/12/08:  This whining 
 is getting old ... General 
 Motors&apos; Wagoner says&quot;huge commitment&quot;of capital spending needed to 
 meet U.S. fuel efficiency mandates - Reuters; and the alternative is what? As he sits in front of Congress 
 asking for $50Billion. 

 FT reports that new steps to curb speculation in commodity markets have 
 been launched by US regulators in response to growing pressure from 
 Washington lawmakers. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main 
 regulator of commodity markets, told the US Congress on Thursday it was 
 imposing&quot;enhanced control&quot;on dealing by Wall Street banks and forcing 
 them to publish new data on their positions. The CFTC&apos;s measures will 
 focus on swaps -private contracts between investment banks and clients 
 such as hedge funds or airlines that provide an exposure to commodity 
 prices without investing directly in futures. The swap market is mostly 
 unregulated, which some lawmakers in Washington have described as a 
 loophole for speculators and blamed for high oil prices. Swap dealers 
 also receive exemptions for speculative positions limits that apply to 
 other speculators in the commodities markets. The CFTC admitted in a 
 report that there was a&quot;a need for greater transparency in the manner 
 and amount of trading that occurs trough swap dealers&quot;.... However, the 
 CFTC report released on Thursday insisted that financial investors did 
 not appear to be behind the rise in commodity prices in the past year, 
 noting that while oil prices had risen, investors in the $200bn 
 commodities indices industry lowered their exposure. Speculators cannot 
 hold more than a certain amount of commodities futures in regulated 
 markets, such as the Nymex where oil is traded but by entering into swap 
 agreements they could circumnavigate those limits. 

 09/11/08:  Natural gas 
 inventory saw a build of 58 bcf to 2905 bcf, analysts were expecting a 
 build of 55 bcf, ranging from a build of 45 bcf to a build of 69 bcf.   Crude 
 makes new session lows at $100.25 ; currently off $2.33 to 
 $100.25.  There&apos;s plenty of gas in storage...back to reality 
 with prices. 

 Politicians don&apos;t 
 get it.  Here&apos;s the latest from Rendell . Ed, we don&apos;t want to extend 
 rate caps, we want to get rid of LMP and use actual cost of system 
 generation + 12%. PA labor and talent built a low cost utility and 
 we want PA taxpayers to get some benefit from the nuclear and coal base 
 load.  Note how this author has finally moved off the 30% BS 
 from PPL and finally printed&quot;40, 50, or even 60%&quot;...no kidding. Word is spreading... 

 09/10/08:  George Soros on Oil . &quot; In 
 the absence of alternative sources, the price of oil is liable to rise 
 indefinitely. Only if we are willing to live with higher prices in order 
 to develop alternative fuels can we hope to see an eventual reversal in 
 the long-term uptrend in oil prices. In contrast to oil and other fossil 
 fuels whose costs of production are bound to rise, the alternative fuels 
 will become cheaper as we discover cheaper and more efficient 
 technologies to exploit them, and will eventually bring down the price 
 of fossil fuels as well.&quot; 

 Lots of news and cross currents on the wires.   OPEC 
 has stated that they now feel $90 - $100/bbl is their target and 
 they are backing this with a call for a 500,000 bpd production cut.  Then we get this:  Dept of Energy reports that   crude 
 oil   inventories had a 
 draw of 5828K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 3500K);   gasoline   inventories 
 had a draw of 6462K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 4500K);   distillate   inventories 
 had a draw of 1252K (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 2100K). Which should be slightly bullish (bad) for prices.  Then your humble prognosticator is vindicated:  WSJ reports as crude-oil prices sink back toward $100 a barrel, dueling 
 reports soon will be released weighing in on whether, and how much, 
 investors are to blame for the gyrations in oil prices. Washington 
 lawmakers and a money manager, stepping up an attack on commodities 
 investors, will unveil a report Wednesday that they say shows 
 speculators are to blame for this year&apos;s rise and fall in oil prices, 
 which have swung by some 50%. Several Democratic senators intend to use 
 the findings to bolster an energy bill, which includes measures to scale 
 back how institutions can invest in index funds that track commodities 
 markets. These institutions now hold $220 billion in commodities, up 
 from $13 billion in 2003, according to the report, co-authored by 
 hedge-fund manager Michael Masters.  Then:   Crude 
 makes new session lows at $101.87; currently off $1.20 to $102.06. 

 It seems clear that the speculative bubble is burst and we&apos;re back to 
 supply/demand fundamentals. Please see the red header above! Given the depth and pain of this bear market, could we actually see a 
 50% retracement to $70? Anything is possible. One should 
 note that natural gas is still the attractive choice at $100/bbl and it 
 would take a move to this level (i.e. $70) to make 6 oil attractive 
 again.  Could it happen? Why not? The world is 
 deleveraging and facing a global recession...anything is possible when 
 the bears are loose. Seen your retirement account lately? 

 09/09/08:  Barring a global conflict that could cause serious supply disruptions, 
 Oppenheimer   expects 
 average oil prices in 2009 to be much lower than 2008&apos;s . However, 
 they say higher oil prices could stagnate economic growth, deepen 
 growing U.S. budget and trade deficits, and raise inflation and 
 unemployment. Not a good start for a new administration, and every 
 effort must be made to lower oil prices and reduce dependence on 
 imported oil says the firm. While the Republican energy policy is 
 focused more on increased supply and nuclear power generation, the 
 Democrats are more focused on energy conservation, improving the 
 environment, and taxing big oils. Increased domestic drilling, in the 
 firm&apos;s opinion, is not the answer to the U.S. addiction to imported oil. 
 Neither is taxing big oils. They believe that both presidential 
 candidates must explain their energy policies to the voters, not in 
 sound bites, but in more detail and must be held accountable once they 
 are in office. The firm expects   oil 
 industry consolidation would accelerate under a Republican 
 administration . 

 Here comes my $100 target!   Minutes 
 ahead of the open of pit trade, crude makes new session lows at $103.85; 
 currently off $2.45 to $103.89.

 $300/Barrel 
 Oil Is Coming - Barron&apos;s Interview 

 Good is bad?  The GSE rescue is goosing 
 the stock market and sending the bears back to the woods (today). We never got a chance to break $100. Remember, if the economy 
 recovers, and banks recover, then demand will logically follow and we&apos;re 
 right back in the old supply/demand fundamentals market. And then 
 we&apos;ll have OPEC mulling supply cuts...and I read something over the 
 weekend where Venezuela was invited to join the cartel. Anybody 
 who thinks Alaska will solve our energy problem is walking around in the 
 dark. A little more supply is fine, but it must be coupled with 
 demand destruction. 

 09/04/08: Big picture stuff: Pimco&apos;s Bill Gross appears in an interview on 
 CNBC saying there is no bull market anywhere; says there is no bull 
 market in bonds, stocks, real estate or in commodities because the 
 global market is experiencing deleveraging. Gross says most asset 
 classes are down right now, about 10% over the past 12 months, which is 
 close to depressionary levels.  Wow. Doom&amp;gloom sells.

 Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a draw of 1898K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 
 450K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 1037K (Bloomberg 
 consensus is a draw of 1300K); distillate inventories had a draw 
 of 413K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 1000K). Natural gas 
 inventory saw a build of 90 bcf to 2847 bcf, analysts were expecting a 
 build of 90 bcf, ranging from a build of 84 bcf to a build of 99 bcf.  What&apos;s the proper term...ambivalent?  Heating oil charts are bad if you expect lower prices... 

 09/02/08:  Boone Pickens, on CNBC, says he doesn&apos;t think 
 crude will go below $100; believes OPEC will cut production to defend 
 oil prices at their Sept 9 meeting.   

 So Gustav was a bust for oil&amp;gas prices. But what about Ike? And Josephine...they&apos;re lined up! No matter...there is serious 
 selling off happening as I type. Storage charts will be late due 
 to the holiday this week, but they WILL be interesting.  Crude hit a 4-month low of 
 $105.46 earlier this morning, its lowest level since Apr 9. 
 Separately, the dollar is much 
 stronger against the other major currencies this morning, hitting 
 a 6-month high against the euro and a fresh 2-year high against the 
 pound. 

 08/28/08:  Natural gas inventory saw a build of 102 bcf to 2757 bcf, analysts were 
 expecting a build of 84 bcf, ranging from a build of 78 bcf to a build 
 of 93 bcf.  BEARISH... 

 08/27/08:  Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a  draw of 177K (Bloomberg 
 consensus is a build of 1100K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 1179K (Bloomberg consensus is a 
 draw of 2450K); distillate inventories had a build of 57K (Bloomberg consensus is a 
 build of 600K).   Neutral at best... 

 (slightly off topic) Compare this story:  WSJ reports executives at Detroit&apos;s Big Three auto makers are 
 considering making a more public push to lawmakers in the near future as 
 they seek about $50 billion in low-cost loans that would greatly 
 overhaul their product portfolios, people familiar with the matter said. 
 Top executives at GM, F and Chrysler -- each racking up significant 
 losses as industry sales decline -- will likely wait until after Labor 
 Day, following this summer&apos;s political conventions, to travel to 
 Washington for meetings on the loans, these people said. They are 
 expected to soon give a more concrete figure to Washington in terms of 
 what size of a loan package is needed, they said. The forthcoming 
 meetings could include discussions with Congressional leaders and 
 potentially the Federal Reserve, these people said.  Against 
 this one:   Honda. 

 Here&apos;s a 
 great reality check on wind vs. the existing power grid.  It&apos;s 
 a sad state of affairs when deregulation taps our budgets to move $ to 
 shareholders while ignoring the grid. Banks got greedy with 
 mortgages and CDOs...will the utilities follow and sink under the weight 
 of this BS? 

 08/26/08:  It looks like our long-awaited Gulf hurricane 
 is on its way... Gustav 
 is headed right for the oil&amp;gas rigs . Who cares? We&apos;re 
 hedged!!! 

 Daily Telegraph reports leading oil producer Kuwait expects to raise 
 production by about half a million barrels a day in early 2009 , 
 in a bid to take a larger share of the world&apos;s growing demand for oil. 
 The Opec member currently produces just over 2.5 mln barrels daily, 
 according to Saad al-Shuwaib, chief executive of state oil firm Kuwait 
 Petroleum. Mr al-Shuwaib said KPC was on course to meet its long-term 
 capacity target of 4 mln barrels in 2020, despite political hurdles, 
 spiraling costs and a tight market. Among the plans to increase capacity 
 is Project Kuwait, a scheme to boost oil output from its northern 
 fields, which was introduced years ago but never made it through 
 parliament due to the involvement of foreign co. 

 Here&apos;s a novel idea:  compressed air from wind turbines to be released when we need the power ...hmmmm... 

 08/25/08:  OPEC likely to keep oil output unchanged at 
 Sept meeting, price still high according to OPEC source - Reuters   Can you imagine what would happen if they cut output??? We seem 
 to be in balance today. But it&apos;s a precarious position... 

 Here&apos;s a little support for my ZERO OIL initiative. Gas is not oil. Period. 

 08/21/08: (Nasty little reversal)  Oct crude 
 finished higher by $5.62 to $121.18, Sept natural gas settled up 18.5 
 cents to $8.257, Sept heating oil ended higher by 14.04 cents to $3.3039 
 and Sept RBOB closed up 12.87 cents to $3.039. 

 Gas isn&apos;t oil... Natural gas inventory saw a 
 build of 88 bcf to 2655 bcf, analysts were expecting a build of 84 bcf, 
 ranging from a build of 65 bcf to a build of 92 bcf.   In the East Region , stocks were 54 bcf above the 5-yr avg following net 
 injections of 67 bcf. ..fairly bearish for pricing...the follow the 
 oil guys might get burned...  

 (Attn Moravian/Lafayette)  WSJ reports heating-oil prices have dropped 
 to their lowest levels in months , but there are signs that tight 
 supplies could keep winter heating bills high even if crude prices 
 continue to tumble. Refiners have plenty of spare capacity. But because 
 of low profit margins, they have been reluctant to ramp up production, 
 running their plants at 85.7% of capacity last week compared with 91.6% 
 during the same period last year. Kevin Rooney, who heads the Oil Heat 
 Institute of Long Island, an association of heating-oil suppliers, said 
 current supplies can easily last until October or November, when he 
 expects refineries to step up production. But with heating-oil prices 
 falling, wholesalers and distributors may be reluctant to keep large 
 supplies. And limited supply 
 would drive up prices if, for example, the winter is colder than 
 expected or because of unexpected refinery outages. 

 T4 HEATING OIL BUY ALERT 
 ISSUED THIS AM...check your email. 

 08/20/08: Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 9390K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 
 1000K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 6202K (Bloomberg 
 consensus is a draw of 3000K); distillate inventories had a build 
 of 481K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 1000K).  Bearish. Crude down a quick dollar in past 2 min, making session lows at 
 $113.20; now off $1.03 to $113.50.  So much for the Goldman 
 pump. Fundamentals matter. 

 Goldman Sachs reiterates $149 oil price forecast - CNBC  ---&gt;Crude oil gains ~2 pts in past hour before pulling back from pre-mkt 
 high of 116.87 .. amazing how they can move the 
 market...fundamentals? Nah, it was on TV! Now think about 
 yesterday as they whispered to their traders that this prediction would 
 be broadcast today...that&apos;s how you make a ton of $$$. 

 NY Times reports in a plan that would drastically remake 
 New York City&apos;s skyline and shores, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is 
 seeking to put wind turbines on the city&apos;s bridges and skyscrapers and 
 in its waters as part of a wide-ranging push to develop renewable 
 energy. The plan, while still in its early stages, appears to be the 
 boldest environmental proposal to date from the mayor, who has made 
 energy efficiency a cornerstone of his administration. Mr. Bloomberg 
 said he would ask private companies and investors to study how windmills 
 can be built across the city, with the aim of weaning it off the 
 nation&apos;s overtaxed power grid, which has produced several crippling 
 blackouts in New York over the last decade. Mr. Bloomberg did not 
 specify which skyscrapers and bridges would be candidates for windmills, 
 and city officials would need to work with property owners to identify 
 the buildings that would best be able to hold the equipment. But aides 
 said that for offshore locations, the city was eyeing the generally 
 windy coast off Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island for turbines that could 
 generate 10 percent of the city&apos;s electricity needs within 10 years. 

 WSJ reports when U.S. futures regulators recently reclassified one of 
 the largest traders in the oil market as a speculator, they didn&apos;t 
 identify the co. But people familiar with the matter now say the co 
 whose activities helped change perceptions about the escalating pace of 
 oil speculation is Vitol Group, a large commodity-trading company with 
 headquarters in Europe. Though less well-known in the U.S., the co is 
 one of the biggest players in the oil mkt, linking buyers and sellers of 
 physical crude oil and refined products. It has interests in storage 
 terminals and oil exploration around the world and sold a large refinery 
 in Canada in 2006. In July, by changing the classification of a large 
 oil trader from a commercial to a&quot;noncommercial&quot;trader, the CFTC 
 showed that noncommercial speculators represented half or more of all 
 bets outstanding on the crude-oil benchmark traded at the New York 
 Mercantile Exchange, up from about 38% before the restatement. Combining 
 these noncommercial traders with another category of financial investors 
 brings the percentage of speculators in the oil market to far more than 
 half of all trading... It isn&apos;t clear why the CFTC decided that the 
 large oil trader&apos;s activities weren&apos;t primarily commercial in nature. No 
 longer owning the refinery could affect Vitol&apos;s ability to classify 
 certain trades as commercial activities. 

 08/18/08:  Are we there yet? Crude continues to be 
 oversold, but if we cross our fingers we might still get below that 
 magic $100 line.  Here&apos;s the 
 latest chart .  

 Anybody catch the fluff 
 piece in the Morning Call regarding the PUC&apos;s take on future electricity 
 prices ? &quot; Neither 
 scenario reflects the reality of PPL&apos;s wholesale energy costs.&quot;  It&apos;s really unbelievable...they cling to this 35% increase nonsense 
 while businesses (such as yourself) already know that 80% is more 
 likely. And what about 2011? That&apos;s been my point all 
 along...yeah, we get a blended rate in 2010...what about 2011? How 
 silly is this story? Of course the rates change by the day...they 
 change by the minute! It&apos;s the average, stupid! Why can&apos;t 
 they get that concept across? 

 08/14/08:  Reuters.com reports Texas oil billionaire T. 
 Boone Pickens said crude prices may soon fall as low as $110 a barrel 
 amid falling gasoline demand, but should not sink below $100 because the 
 United States depends heavily on oil imports. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll drop below 
 $100,&quot;Pickens told Reuters in a telephone interview .&quot;I would 
 say $110 is where it might go, something like that.&quot;  I said it 
 first! How come I&apos;m not on Reuters?! 

 Natural gas inventory saw a build of 50 bcf to 
 2567 bcf, analysts were expecting a build of 52 bcf, ranging from a 
 build of 47 bcf to a build of 63 bcf.  Seems right on track to 
 me...neutral. 

 Here&apos;s another chart that doesn&apos;t help with lower oil price predictions. 

 July CPI y/y +5.6% vs +5.1% consensus; not 
 sure why this is such a surprise? 

 08/13/08:  Crude rose $2.91 to $115.92, natural gas ended 
 higher by 15.2 cents to $8.482, heating oil finished up 5.07 cents to 
 $3.129 and RBOB gasoline closed higher by 8.43 cents to $2.9275.   One 
 day reversal? Tomorrow will tell the tale. 

 Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a draw of 316K (Bloomberg 
 consensus is a build of 300K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 6394K  (Bloomberg 
 consensus is a draw of 2150K); distillate inventories had a  draw of 1759K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 
 1950K).   Not the best case scenario...as I said, start 
 ticking down at the gas pump and start ticking up consumption is the 
 trend... 

 FWIW, have fun with this link:    www.closethegapopenthetap.com   I agree with some of their 
 logic, but the results might not be as expected. Ignoring the 
 rhetoric, we import 66%...66%...66%. No matter how you cut it, the 
 US is the ultimate consumer and we need to wean ourselves from the tap. 

 Thomas Friedman has become the de facto energy 
 cop for the USA.  Check out his latest story.  We all know that solar and wind 
 work, but they&apos;re not cost competitive. And we all know that 
 farmers and a host of other industries are subsidized. Would you 
 give up 0.01% of your salary if the money went to alternative energy? I&apos;m afraid that each downtick in crude prices will push this issue 
 farther from the radar of the sheeple. Why am I afraid? Because despite a 20-year history that shows energy increasing at 15% 
 +/- 5% per year, our VP chose 10% as our forward projection and felt 
 that was still too high. Those that don&apos;t learn from history are 
 doomed to repeat? 

 08/12/08:  Sept crude ($113.45 -$1.00) is modestly lower 
 this morning with easing tensions between Russia/Georgia and continued strength in the dollar . 
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a ceasefire in the conflict 
 with Georgia, thus ending the 5 day fracas over South Ossetia. The dollar (currently at 
 $1.4899/euro) is stronger again, continuing its recent gains to the best 
 levels since late Feb . Crude is now off about $34 (or 23%) from 
 its all time high.  Remember the SX3? Supply, speculation, 
 $. The oil stool has 3 legs and the market sharks are now nibbling 
 at the $. The spec leg has already been whittled down. 

 08/11/08:  The (not a bubble?) commodity bubble has 
 burst. While everyone seems to think it&apos;s back to the good old 
 days, I&apos;d say it&apos;s time to revisit moving averages and 
 support/resistance levels.  Can oil get back under $100/bbl? Yes. Can it get back to $70? I doubt it.  All you need 
 to do is look at the editorial cartoons showing SUV drivers joyously 
 circling the pump. Remember, OPEC is a cartel. They can cut 
 production just as quickly as they raise it. Once the money is 
 flowing in, it&apos;s tough to accept less. Personally I think the 
 markets are pricing in a stronger US $ based on the election. Plus 
 they&apos;re a little upset with the hardline stance of the European Central 
 Bank.  

 I Mfested with an old friend who honestly believes that the new Repub 
 political mantra of&quot;drill, drill, drill&quot;is the reason prices are 
 coming down. It&apos;s tough to explain the reality of the production 
 charts and the import numbers. Nobody wants to hear it...we can 
 drill our way out!  This is not a Rep/Dem issue...it&apos;s going 
 to take a UNITED effort to overcome.  Check out this story.  We can&apos;t solve this problem without 
 sacrifice; i.e. it&apos;s going to cost something.  

 WSJ reports as major oil cos search for more 
 oil to meet growing global demand, U.S. natural-gas companies face 
 the opposite problem: what to do with all the gas they soon will be 
 producing. U.S. natural-gas production is soaring, thanks to high 
 energy prices and new technologies that have unlocked reserves 
 considered too difficult or expensive to tap in earlier eras. Production 
 is up 8% this year, according to government data, and the growth is 
 expected to continue as companies drill thousands of wells in Texas, 
 Louisiana and Oklahoma, and look at massive new reserves in Appalachia 
 and Canada. Demand is growing, too, but more slowly. Total U.S. 
 natural-gas consumption is up 5.5% this year through May, spurred 
 largely by a gradual shift from coal power plants to cleaner-burning 
 gas-fired ones. Consumption actually fell slightly between 2003 and 
 2006. As some analysts have 
 begun to toss around terms like&quot;gas glut,&quot; natural-gas futures 
 have tumbled 9.2% in the past two weeks, and they have brought 
 producers&apos; stocks down with them. Shares of large natural-gas producers 
 CHK, XTO and EOG are all down 30% or more from their recent highs in 
 late June and early July. 

 08/08/08: Venezuela Energy Minister Ramirez says oil price 
 fluctuations due to speculation, would consider reduction in oil 
 production - Bloomberg. 

 Lehman 
 Brothers says oil prices to fall in Q4 and Q1 next year; Lehman says oil 
 has peaked for next few years - Bloomberg  It&apos;s 
 pretty easy to make this call now with the price in retreat. Where 
 were they at $145? 

 Crude makes new session lows 
 at $115.75; now off $4.22 to $115.81. 
 
 Euro extends declines vs dollar and yen, falls the 
 most against the dollar since June 2004 - Bloomberg 

 08/07/08:  Natural gas inventory saw a build of 56 bcf to 
 2517 bcf, analysts were expecting a build of 62 bcf, ranging from a 
 build of 51 bcf to a build of 65 bcf. Inventories are now 353 bcf&lt;2007 and 6 bcf&lt;5 yr average. In other words, we&apos;re near 
 neutral with supply and demand in balance, hence the pricing structure 
 we&apos;re currently enjoying. I&apos;m seriously thinking about going 
 longer on the hedge...if we expect 10% annual escalation and I can hold 
 the line at zero...why not? Hope for a deeper recession and more 
 demand destruction? 

 I was asked to provide a 10 year guess on energy 
 cost escalations. It sounds impossible, but my response is simply 
 15% +/- 5%. This provides a range of pricing that has worked over 
 the last 20 years. Use your scientific calculator&apos;s y to the x 
 button and plug in various scenarios. Natural gas is up 223% over 
 the last 5 years, which works out to about 20% CAGR. 

 08/06/08:  Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 1614K (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 
 200K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 4344K (Bloomberg 
 consensus was a draw of 1500K); distillate inventories had 
 a build of 2841K (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 2000K).  Who is doing all of that driving??? 

 08/05/08:  It&apos;s a 
 done deal for Lehigh...all of my limits were hit this AM and I&apos;ve erased 
 the FY09 projected $1M deficit and now have a $100K surplus. My 
 average gas cost is $8.98 and my averaged basis is $1.50. Hess 
 trigger desk is very efficient. Bring on the Gulf storms! 

 Here&apos;s a timely editorial regarding energy efficiency and conservation . 

 Sept crude 
 ($118.80 -$2.59) is trading well below the $120 mark this morning, with 
 session lows at $118 (levels not seen since early May). Traders 
 continue to believe that Tropical Storm Edouard will not damage 
 operations in the Gulf of Mexico or Texas as the storm is now forecast 
 to have only has about a 25% of reaching hurricane wind speeds, 
 according to the National Hurricane Center. It is expected to hit the 
 Texas coast by midday today. With diminishing concerns about the storm, 
 it appears traders attention will once again turn to weaker demand. 
 Crude oil is close to $30 off its all time high of $147.90, set back on 
 July 11. 

 08/04/08:  CNBC discusses sell-off in energy 
 complex; says there is talk of a large hedge fund blowing up due to 
 incorrect position in nat gas.. .oh wait, there&apos;s no speculation in 
 these markets, right? So why does it matter?! Yeah right. 

 My November gas was filled this 
 AM : 30,000 @ $9.18. This is risk management 101. Remember, my goal is on to under budget. The long end of the curve 
 isn&apos;t coming in just yet...patience. 

 Mr. Market sure thinks lower 
 energy prices are coming...big names in gas and oil can&apos;t rally and 
 continue to be sold off. My thought of $100/bbl as a the bottom 
 might not be that far-fetched...either way, use limit orders and be 
 patient. We&apos;ve not seen a bottom yet... Crude continues to 
 fall fast as it is now off $4.70 to $120.46.  Reminder...gas is in 
 a buying position, not oil. 

 Happy Monday. Gas continues 
 to appear oversold. Can it go lower? I hope so! My limit 
 orders are lower. Oil is still marching to the&quot;geopolitical&quot;band. 

 07/31/08:  Crude declined $2.55 on the session to $124.22, natural gas fell 12.9 cents to $9.119, heating oil 
 closed lower by 7.83 cents to $3.442. 

 Natural gas inventory saw a build 
 of 65 bcf to 2461 bcf, analysts were expecting a build of 70 bcf, 
 ranging from a build of 59 bcf to a build of 80 bcf. Working gas 
 in storage was 2,461 Bcf as of Friday, July 25, 2008, according to EIA 
 estimates. This represents a net increase of 65 Bcf from the previous 
 week. Stocks were 357 Bcf less than last yr at this time and 12 Bcf 
 below the 5-yr avg of 2,473 Bcf. In the East 
 Region , stocks were 5 Bcf above the 5-yr avg following net 
 injections of 55 Bcf. Stocks in the Producing Region were 12 Bcf 
 below the 5-yr avg of 764 Bcf no net change in stock levels. Stocks in 
 the West Region were 5 Bcf below the 5-yr avg after a net 
 addition of 10 Bcf. At 2,461 Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-yr 
 historical range.  THIS IS A NET NEUTRAL REPORT IMHO...the 
 problem (or perception) is the lurking unnamed hurricane...if the 
 weather cooperates, we&apos;re headed lower... 

 Tesoro (a big refiner) says that 
 the market environment for petroleum products remains volatile and demand for gasoline continues to run at rates below a year ago . 

 07/30/08:  Let&apos;s be careful...2/3 of the oil 
 report was bearish while gasoline consumption suddenly moved 
 up...amazing how nat gas just follows it higher?! One day does not 
 a trend make... 

 (Analysts WRONG) Dept of Energy reports 
 that crude oil inventories had a draw of 81K (Bloomberg consensus 
 is a draw of 1300K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 
 3525K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 350K); distillate inventories had a build of 2396K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 
 2050K). 66% BEARISH, 33% BULLISH...tiny drop in pump prices and 
 people starting driving again???  Crude oil chops back and forth 
 following mixed DOE inventory data; crude is now rising after initially 
 making a session low... crude is now -0.39 at 
 121.80 . 

 (BEFORE) Petroleum inventory data is due out today at 
 10:35 E . T . According to the Bloomberg survey, analysts 
 believe that crude oil inventories had a draw of 1300K during the 
 week ending July 25 (last year crude saw a draw of 6497K); expectations 
 range from a draw of 2750K barrels to a build of 1500K barrels (11 out 
 of 11 analysts expect a draw); prior 4 week avg is a draw of 1607K... 
 Analysts believe gasoline inventories  had a build of 350K (last 
 year gas saw a build of 586K); expectations range from a draw of 1500K 
 to a build of 1400K (8 out of 12 analysts expect a build, and 1 analyst 
 is unchanged); prior 4 week avg is a build of 2082K barrels... Analysts 
 believe distillate fuel inventories had a build of 2050K (last 
 year distillates saw a build of 2889K); expectations range from a build 
 of 800K to a build of 2700K; (12 out of 12 analysts expect a build); 
 prior 4 week avg is a build of 2172K barrels. 

 T4 NATURAL GAS BUY ALERT ISSUED 
 THIS AM...check your email. 

 07/29/08:  Crude is now -2.53 at 122.23. The dollar is gaining against other major 
 currencies (now at $1.56/Euro and at 108.12Yen/dollar). Tomorrow @ 10:30A is make or break for the oil market... 

 07/28/08:  Here&apos;s an interesting summary of current diesel/gasoline 
 gallon equivalent prices . Not hard to see T Boone&apos;s nat gas 
 vehicle vision... 

 I&apos;m this close ( ) to a natural gas buy, maybe 50% of 
 our vols thru next June and EVERYBODY is on vacation...which is why it&apos;s 
 a good time to make the deal. 

 07/24/08: BEARISH!  Natural gas 
 inventory saw a build of 84 bcf to 2396 bcf, analysts were expecting a 
 build of 80 bcf, ranging from a build of 70 bcf to a build of 85 bcf. 

   Interesting commentary on T 
 Boone&apos;s latest campaign.  Ignoring the political BS, there is 
 no way to drill our way out of the hole. Period. UNLESS 
 demand evaporates. 

 07/23/08:  Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a draw of 1558K (Bloomberg consensus is a 
 draw of 600K); gasoline inventories had a build of 2847K  (Bloomberg consensus is a  build 
 of 200K ); distillate inventories had a b uild 
 of 2419 K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 2500K).  Hang 
 in there...we&apos;re going to test $122 soon... 

 Why you shouldn&apos;t listen to talking heads...CNBC 
 commentator...&quot; it&apos;s amazing that oil is trading down as Dolly is 
 upgraded to a category 2 hurricane &quot;...umm, maybe because it isn&apos;t 
 headed for the Gulf rigs? Fundamentals do matter. Maybe 
 because they&apos;ve been pumping energy stocks for so long? 

 07/22/08: Oil investor Pickens says oil could 
 reach $300/bbl within 10 yrs if U.S. doesn&apos;t reduce dependence on 
 imports - Reuters    It&apos;s about 
 consumption, stupid! Any policy that fails to address demand 
 reduction and/or conservation is doomed to failure. - T4 

 Crude drops sharply, making lows at 
 $127.36; currently off $3.27 to $127.77. Break $122 and NG&lt; $9 are the buy points...I&apos;m prepared to lock down 80% of my needs for 
 FY09... 

 07/21/08:  I&apos;m on vacation this week, but 
 I&apos;m still actively monitoring the markets and awaiting some updated 
 price quotes. Let&apos;s see if we can hit my $122 target on 
 crude...those moving average breaks on the charts are a good 
 signal...we&apos;re 50% of the way to a buy signal...I&apos;m not yet calling it a 
 strong buy....it&apos;s a time to be ready and think about a lock. 

 Crude continues to sell off from session highs at 
 $132.05, coming all the way back to just above unchanged; currently 
 higher by 10 cents to $128.98; Wow. All of this in the face of a 
 potential Gulf storm! 

 07/17/08:  Crude ended lower by $5.01 to $129.59 , natural gas 
 closed off by 84.8 cents to $ 10.55 , 
 heating oil settled down 9.24 cents to $3.748. 

 Natural gas inventory saw a build of 104 bcf to 2312 bcf, analysts were 
 expecting a build of 88 bcf, ranging from a build of 70 bcf to a build 
 of 95 bcf.  Yea! Bearish for prices... soon it will be 
 time to think about a budget commitment for the winter ...Natural gas 
 continues its plunge, making lows at $10.66; now off 74.1 cents to 
 $10.657. 

 07/16/08:  Crude ended the session lower by 
 $4.26 to $134.48 , natural 
 gas settled off 7.7 cents to $11.40 , heating oil closed off 8 cents to $3.839 . Patience. The uptrend has broken...let&apos;s see what happens at $122/bbl. 

 DOE Inventories: Large builds across 
 the board, well above expectations; Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 
 2952K (Bloomberg consensus was draw of 
 2200K); gasoline inventories had a build of 2472K (Bloomberg consensus was draw of 
 800K); distillate inventories had a  build of 3189K (Bloomberg consensus was build of 2000K).  Crude 
 falls sharply on bearish data, setting a new monthly low at $133.30; 
 currently down $5.25 to $133.49. 

 07/15/08: Where are the media trumpets?  Crude ended the session lower by $6.61 to $138.57, natural gas settled 
 down 49.4 cents to $11.465, heating oil closed off by 14.89 cents to 
 $3.916 (i.e. $4.12 delivered). Impressive in the face of this 
 headline:  Libya announced 
 that it will cut oil production 100,000 barrels a day this week due to pipeline maintenance (note that Libya has commented about cutting 
 production due to the fact that they believed the market was 
 oversupplied). 

 Here&apos;s the Fed statement:  Oil Price Comment: Our best judgment is that this surge in 
 prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying 
 demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets; decline in the 
 foreign exchange value of the dollar has also contributed somewhat ( huh?) to the increase in 
 oil prices; concern that has been raised is that financial speculation 
 has added markedly to upward pressures on oil prices.  You 
 already knew this...fear sells...sooner or later $ will flow from energy 
 (where demand is soon to die) to financials, where value is lurking. 

 Uh-oh... Bernanke says surge in 
 oil prices driven predominantly by strong demand, tight supply; Hey Ben, 
 what about the deficit and the comment below?   It&apos;s not as if US 
 growth is fueling our demand.  Bernanke says Fed worried 
 commodity prices may continue to rise, posing key risk to inflation 
 forecast.  Ya think? 

 In Commodities , the dollar 
 is much weaker against the other major currencies, notably setting a new all-time low of 
 1.6038 against the euro, and that is pushing Aug crude oil 
 ($146/13 +0.95) back near its record high ($147.27)... As I 
 mentioned at the LVAIC meeting, we&apos;re toast until/unless the banks are 
 healthy, and this crisis is rapidly turning into a self-fulfilling 
 prophecy whereby the brokers keep telling us how they (the banks) all 
 need more money while their assets are worthless. We can&apos;t have a 
 market that is all energy, all the time (though we do). Freddie 
 and Fannie could need a $trillion bailout...except we already spent that 
 dough in Iraq...and yet some pols say no new taxes??? 

 07/14/08:  I trust everyone noted the 
 week-over-week declines in natural gas ? That&apos;s a beautiful break below the moving average. Now if we don&apos;t 
 get any big Gulf storms... 

 Boo-hoo...the oil tankers are crying this morning that 
 demand is way down and their profits are set to slip...demand 
 destruction is affecting nearly everything EXCEPT the price of 
 oil...because the $ is still weak... 

 07/10/08: N oting the spike in crude oil 
 into the close, a series of newspaper stories came out stating that the 
 head of OPEC warned against an attack on Iran. For example, the Intl 
 Herald Tribune reports that:&quot; The head of the Organization of 
 Petroleum Exporting Countries warned Thursday that oil prices would see 
 an &apos;unlimited&apos; increase in the case of a military conflict involving 
 Iran , because the group&apos;s members would be unable to make up the 
 lost production.&quot;We really cannot replace Iran&apos;s production - it&apos;s not 
 feasible to replace it,&quot;Abdalla Salem El-Badri, the OPEC secretary 
 general, said during an interview. Iran , the second-largest 
 producing country in OPEC, after Saudi Arabia, produces about 4 million barrels of oil a day out of the daily worldwide 
 production of close to 87 million barrels . The country has been 
 locked in a lengthy dispute with Western countries over its nuclear 
 ambitions. In recent weeks, the price of oil has risen higher on 
 speculation that Israel could be preparing to attack Iranian nuclear 
 facilities. The saber-rattling intensified this week with missile tests 
 by Iran. That has further shaken oil markets because of concerns that 
 any conflict with Iran could disrupt oil shipments from the Gulf 
 region.&quot; 

 WSJ reports legislators 
 scrambling to respond to rising food and energy prices are questioning a 
 stalwart feature of those commodities&apos; futures markets: low margin 
 requirements. Margin, in effect the good-faith deposit that exchanges 
 and brokers require investors to put up to maintain a position, has 
 traditionally been low in futures markets, 5% to 8% for commodities and 
 just a bit higher for stock and bond futures. But with oil and food 
 prices soaring this year, legislators are considering proposals to push 
 up margin requirements on speculators in an effort to drive them out. 
 One idea, for example, from Sen. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.), suggests 
 raising margins to 25% for any energy traders that aren&apos;t commercial 
 producers or purchasers. The change is one of several to 
 commodities-markets regulation under consideration at a three-day 
 hearing this week before the House agricultural committee. 

 07/09/08: Forget the BS headlines and focus on 
 this:  U.S. crude oil imports averaged 9.5 mln bpd, down 621K w/w ; over the last four 
 weeks, motor gasoline demand has averaged 9.3 mln bpd, down by 2.1% y/y ; Distillate fuel 
 demand has averaged about 4.2 mln bpd over the last four weeks, up by 1.3% y/y ; Jet fuel demand is 2.2% lower over the last four weeks y/y .  This 
 trend needs to continue...I think the distillate is hoarding...Iran is a 
 wild card... 

 Here&apos;s a good 
 story that mimics a lot of what we discussed at the last LVAIC 
 meeting. 

 Here&apos;s another reality 
 check on alternative energy . As we discussed at our last 
 meeting, it&apos;s not just buy a windmill or install solar, it&apos;s WHERE you 
 do it. Sure they work; but some places are much better than 
 others. Why would you invest $millions in a wind turbine if the 
 wind doesn&apos;t blow? Or the sun doesn&apos;t shine? I don&apos;t see 
 that many geothermal plants on the drawing boards for the ABE area?! 

 07/08/08:  Boone Pickens discusses potential 
 scenarios for oil; says he&apos;ll stick with $150 tgt on oil. Says demand 
 coming down should bring things into better balance. Believes we could 
 have $200/$300 oil if something happened in Iran, but oil could get back 
 down to $100 in next two years.  This time I tend to 
 agree...demand destruction combined with a stronger $ will help... 

 One day does not a trend make, but the energy short ETF 
 (DUG) exploded upwards yesterday and there was some carnage in the 
 oil/gas stocks. If the brokers start hawking BUY signals today 
 then it might be time for a correction. T Boone the contrarian? 

 07/07/08: Ugh. Take a look at this table . Draw your own 
 conclusions. Big money is swimming in this pool and won&apos;t take 
 kindly to uninvited guests. 

 So it&apos;s not speculation?  The WSJ reports oil&apos;s historic ascent from $100 to nearly $150 a barrel in just six months is lending weight to a far grimmer prediction: Crude could reach $200 a barrel 
 by the end of the year . Oil at that price would wreak deeper 
 havoc on the world&apos;s airlines and automobile industries. In the U.S., $200 crude would push the price 
 of gasoline to well over $6 a gallon, causing commuters to alter 
 their driving habits more sharply than they have already, while putting 
 extreme strains on large sectors of the U.S. economy. In Washington, 
 deepening fears that oil prices will shoot still higher have stoked talk 
 in Congress and within the Bush administration of using one of the last 
 remaining cudgels to try to reverse the price rise: a sharp and 
 sustained release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
 Oil&apos;s seemingly unstoppable rise has also scared off some of the very 
 financial players that would otherwise temper the market. Oil producers who would normally 
 lock in high prices by hedging on the futures market have now backed 
 off, assuming that prices will continue to rise . A release of 2 
 mln barrels a day for long as a month, analysts say, could make a sharp 
 impact on prices, in part because the barrels would be sold at auction, 
 thus allowing buyers to set the oil&apos;s value.  Please review the 
 oil storage charts...this is a financial crisis, not a supply crisis. 

 AP reports the price for a barrel of oil shed more $2 
 Monday with the dollar gaining 
 strength , but traders watched for a further weakening of the 
 greenback and renewed Mideast tensions. 

 The WSJ reports The House Agriculture Committee will 
 host hearings examining whether the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
 has a strong-enough grip on the fast-growing, $5 trln futures market for 
 oil and other commodities or needs other tools. It also will examine how 
 that market is affected by the $9 trln&quot;over-the-counter&quot;market that 
 has mushroomed outside CFTC regulation. The committee has asked 
 lawmakers to outline competing bills that could significantly reshape 
 the commodities markets. In addition to calling for the collection of 
 more-detailed trading data, some measures seek to ban pension funds 
 from commodities; sharply increase the collateral required to make a 
 trade; or limit the size of some investors&apos; trades... Economists 
 warn of serious unintended consequences if Congress drives away 
 speculators. Without as many traders, for example, energy companies 
 might have a harder time locking in prices for future oil production and 
 may curtail exploration. 

 07/03/08:  Coal stocks are crashing and all 
 of those little spec plays that I mentioned at the LVAIC meeting are 
 also crashing this AM...and the brokers are tripping all over themselves 
 reiterating BUY...remember what I said? When the Street is pumping 
 to retail, it&apos;s nearly over...if you&apos;re feeling lucky, buy BP&lt;$60...it 
 pays better then a CD and will appreciate with inflation. 

 Here&apos;s a reason to further jack up nat gas prices: inventory saw a build of 85 bcf to 2118 bcf; analysts were expecting a 
 build of 89 bcf, ranging from a build of 73 bcf to a build of 93 bcf. Above the middle of the expected range? Not good enough. BUY BUY 
 BUY!!! Or not? I see some carnage in the energy stocks this 
 AM...a lot of technical breakdowns...the next 5 days will tell if it&apos;s 
 the real deal or a&quot;buy the dip&quot;. 

 07/02/08: Looks like the coal price bubble just 
 broke this AM... In addition to a big drop in South African coal 
 prices, European coal prices declined the most in several years. 
 According to Bloomberg, European coal prices saw their biggest 
 decline in three years , with fuel for delivery to Amsterdam, 
 Rotterdam or Antwerp with settlement next year retreating $22.50, or 
 10%, to $195/metric ton. That would be the biggest drop since Mar 
 2005 . One day = biggest decline in 3 years! 

 07/01/08:  Minutes ago, OPEC Secretary 
 General Abdalla El-Badri appeared on CNBC and said he thinks the 
 high prices in oil come from the US dollar and speculators. Says 
 that there is no shortage of oil in the market . They are 
 producing more than they should. Says storage stocks are within the 5 
 yr average . They have about 3 mln barrels of excess capacity this 
 year, so they don&apos;t see any shortage whatsoever in the market. Believes 
 that everyone is panicking. Says that there is not enough capacity for 
 heavy crude refining and that&apos;s a problem. Says that increased production 
 is irrelevant if there&apos;s no one to buy the oil.    PLEASE SCROLL DOWN AND READ MY 6/11/08 COMMENT! 

 And then we get 
 the usual geopolitical wild card:  ABC News reports that Sr 
 Pentagon officials are concerned that Israel could carry out an attack 
 on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities before the end of the year, an action that 
 would have enormous security and economic repercussions for the United 
 States and the rest of the world. A senior defense official told ABC 
 News there is an&quot;increasing likelihood&quot;that Israel will carry out such 
 an attack, a move that likely would prompt Iranian retaliation against, 
 not just Israel, but against the United States as well. The official 
 identified two&quot;red lines&quot;that could trigger an Israeli offensive. The 
 first is tied to when Iran&apos;s Natanz nuclear facility produces enough 
 highly enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon. According to the 
 latest U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments, that is likely to 
 happen sometime in 2009, and could happen by the end of this year. The 
 second red line is connected to when Iran acquires the SA-20 air defense 
 system it is buying from Russia. The Israelis may want to strike before 
 that system -which would make an attack much more difficult- is put in 
 place. Some Pentagon officials also worry that Israel may be determined 
 to attack before a new U.S. president, who may be less supportive, is 
 sworn in next January. 

 06/30/08: FWIW...here&apos;s what happens when a 
 regulated utility asks for a rate increase:  The Public 
 Utilities Commission of Nevada approves an increase in electric rates 
 for co&apos;s Sierra Pacific Power Company. The increase, effective July 1, 
 2008, is the result of the company&apos;s mandatory rate case filing made 
 every three years . The general rate increase granted by the Public 
 Utilities Commission of Nevada allows the co to recover costs associated 
 with investments in new transmission and distribution lines, substation 
 and equipment improvements, labor and a return to the company&apos;s 
 shareholders. The Public 
 Utilities Commission of Nevada established an overall rate of return 
 for the company of 8.41% and a return on equity of 10.6% . The 
 overall revenue increase to the co is $87 mln. Boo-hoo, Wall 
 Street isn&apos;t happy... 

 The&quot;tape&quot;this AM is painted 
 with brokerage houses tripping over themselves to upgrade the stocks of 
 anybody and everybody related to energy. Of course none of this 
 was happening in February 08, so take it with a grain of salt. Usually once they start pumping to retail investors, it&apos;s the end of the 
 game (a/k/a distribution). As I said at our meeting, we&apos;re 
 spinning our wheels if the banks aren&apos;t healthy. There will be no 
 global demand increase if the US doesn&apos;t pump money into the economy. 

 06/25/08:  Here&apos;s a chart of the EUR/$ that I 
 mentioned yesterday. Oil, in US $ terms, is actually the 
 equivalent of maybe $88/bbl to them. This is one reason you hear 
 the Saudis and others claim not to see a problem.  

   I always listen to folks from the Midwest...a lot of the Wall Street 
 hyperbole is left out and you get a realistic impression from someone 
 also managing energy costs. 

 PPL Corp added to the Short-term Buy 
 List at UBS ; like I said yesterday, they&apos;re set to fleece PA and 
 book record profits if nothing changes... 

 06/24/08: Paulson says supply-demand key 
 factors behind oil prices, need more output. Trzesniowski says 
 supply-demand key factors behind oil prices, need more conservation. 

 Where does it end?  WSJ 
 reports U.S. coal producers have been largely unable to meet growing 
 demand because of a lengthy permitting process, lack of capital 
 investment and a shortage of skilled miners, which will keep supplies 
 tight and prices high. The underlying industrywide issues are compounded 
 by severe floods in the Midwest, which have stranded barges full of coal 
 and submerged railcars used to haul coal. It isn&apos;t clear what impact 
 those interruptions will have on supplies and prices. Paul Forward, a 
 coal analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus, expects demand for coal in the 
 U.S. to outstrip supply this year by 15 mln tons, in large part because 
 of the increase in exports , which shot up 49% through April compared 
 with last year. Constraints to production also played a role in the 
 growing shortfall, he said.&quot;Despite the strong margins that coal cos 
 are seeing, the supply response has so far been limited,&quot;said Mr. 
 Forward.&quot;I think it&apos;s probably a couple years worth of time where these 
 markets stay tight.&quot;Up to 40 million tons of potential and anticipated 
 coal production is being held back because of delays in obtaining 
 environmental permits and new safety regulations, estimates David Khani, 
 director of research at FBR Capital Markets. 

 06/23/08: Great minds think alike?  Barron&apos;s reports it&apos;s perilous to call the top in a booming market, but 
 the price of oil may be peaking in the current range of $130 to $140 a 
 barrel. In the next decade, oil indeed may hit $200 a barrel. But prices 
 could fall to $100 a barrel by the end of this year if Saudi Arabia 
 makes good on its pledge to increase production; global demand eases; 
 the Federal Reserve begins lifting short-term interest rates; the dollar 
 rallies, and investors stop pouring money into the oil market. China 
 raised prices on retail gasoline and diesel fuel by 18% Thursday, in a 
 move that is expected to curb demand. It&apos;s tough to know how much of the 
 surge in crude-oil prices -- up 40% just this year -- reflects 
 fundamental supply and demand, and how much is due to other factors, 
 including the dollar, commodity speculation and interest from 
 institutional investors. Like some others, we suspect the run-up was 
 fueled by more than economics. 

 WSJ reports natural-gas prices, up 74% since the year 
 began, could be headed higher amid predictions of an unusually hot 
 summer in parts of the nation. If those forecasts play out, 
 air-conditioner use will rise -- and with it, demand for electricity 
 production fueled by natural gas, possibly driving futures prices to 
 records. In Washington and Saudi Arabia, where world leaders gathered 
 during the weekend to discuss high energy prices, much of the focus was 
 on the price of oil, which remains near its highest closing on record. 
 Natural-gas prices have been soaring despite increased domestic 
 production... &quot; We could see $15 gas this summer. All the elements are 
 there ,&quot;said Jefferies analyst Subash Chandra. Experts attribute 
 high oil prices to a blend of factors: foreign turmoil, increased 
 speculation, industrialization in India and China, and the weak dollar. 
 Explaining the rise in natural-gas prices is relatively simple: It&apos;s the 
 weather... The long-term outlook for U.S. natural-gas prices is less 
 clear. Demand for natural gas for power generation is rising as 
 utilities look for a cleaner alternative to coal. But supply is rising 
 as well, thanks to a drilling boom driven by higher prices. U.S. 
 natural-gas production was up 7.7% in March compared to the previous 
 year, according to the Energy Information Administration. 

 06/20/08: Today it&apos;s the old&quot;geo-political&quot;goose: July crude ($134.92 +$2.99), which expires today, is 
 trading higher this morning on the heals of a report that Israel carried 
 out a major military exercise earlier this month that American officials 
 say appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack on Iran&apos;s 
 nuclear facilities. Several American officials said the Israeli exercise 
 appeared to be an effort to develop the military&apos;s capacity to carry out 
 long-range strikes and to demonstrate the seriousness with which Israel 
 views Iran&apos;s nuclear program. Also helping lift oil higher are reports 
 out of Nigeria that oil workers at Chevron&apos;s Nigerian unit plan a 
 disruption starting June 23 after talks with mgmt failed to resolve a 
 labor dispute. Expect a volatile day in the crude market with today&apos;s 
 expiration of the July contract as well as traders eyeing this weekend&apos;s 
 Jeddah meeting. The spread to August is currently -$0.67. SSDD. 

 06/19/08: Saudi Arabia says to increase daily 
 oil output by 200,000 barrels . 

 The National Development and Reform Commission of China 
 just sent notice of its decision to raise gasoline, diesel and jet 
 fuel price by 1000, 1000 and 1500/RMB per ton, separately, starting Jun 
 20th. Also, electricity prices will increase 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour 
 beginning on July 1st . The increase does not include consumer retail 
 electricity price and electricity used by agriculture and fertilizer 
 producers. Also, this round of price increases does not include liquid 
 gas and natural gas. The NDRC said they are aware of soaring crude oil 
 prices and the consequentially deepened price gap between that and the 
 price of oil in China. To relieve the pain caused by the price 
 increase to domestic consumers and curb inflation, they will take 
 supporting measures simultaneously, such as to subsidize certain 
 industries including agriculture, fishery, forestry and public 
 transportation. The NDRC also decided to control steam coal prices from 
 now until Dec 31st, 2008 . During this period, the coal production 
 companies cannot raise the price higher than the settlement price on 
 June 19th, 2008. 

 You can&apos;t ignore the big $:   DJ 
 is reporting Goldman Sachs 
 continues its bullish-on-oil campaign, raising view of oil 
 services sector to attractive from neutral and increasing targets for 
 services companies by average 12%. Firm expects&quot;a prolonged period of 
 double-digit earnings growth through 2011, driven by accelerating rig 
 count growth, rising land and offshore dayrates and service intensity.&quot;Drilling activity trends also are slightly better than expected in some 
 markets, Goldman says, lending confidence to 2Q earnings and potential 
 upside in 2H; record cash flow should also drive consolidation and 
 buybacks. 

 06/17/08: Only here, in the USA, could our tax 
 policy be so skewed: Senate blocks tax breaks for wind and solar 
 energy - Bloomberg. Germany, Spain, Italy, Korea, France, ... 
 solar is going gangbusters . God forbid we forsake some 
 precious tax dollars for something that cuts our dependence on power 
 plants. Bloomberg reports the Senate Republicans for the second 
 time in a week blocked a tax measure to renew dozens of tax breaks, 
 including a business research credit and incentives to develop wind, 
 solar and other renewable energy sources. Republicans objected that the 
 legislation would boost other taxes to avoid increasing the federal 
 deficit. The 52-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate 
 to move forward on the legislation. The vote was a repeat of one taken 
 June 10 and continues the debate over whether Congress should approve 
 popular business tax cuts even if they add to the deficit.  Stupid is as stupid does.  

  Is he talking up his position?  Reuters.com reports world crude oil production has topped out at 85 mln 
 barrels per day even as demand keeps climbing, helping to drive a 
 stunning surge in prices, billionaire oil investor T. Boone Pickens 
 said.&quot;I do believe you have peaked out at 85 million barrels a day 
 globally,&quot;Pickens, who heads BP Capital hedge fund with more than $4 
 bln under management, said during testimony to the Senate Energy and 
 Natural Resources Committee. The United States alone has been using&quot;21 
 million barrels of the 85 million and producing about 7 of the 21, so if 
 I could take just a minute on this point, the demand is about 86.4 
 million barrels a day, and when the demand is greater than the supply, 
 the price has to go up until it kills demand,&quot;Pickens told lawmakers.

 Wow. A judge who actually 
 interprets the law in favor of the consumer... A New York 
 administrative law judge recommended on Monday that state regulators 
 disapprove Iberdrola SA&apos;s $4.5 billion takeover of US 
 utility Energy East Corp saying the deal is not in the public&apos;s 
 best interest.  Not a complicated concept...&quot;not in the 
 public&apos;s best interest&quot;. If only our own PUC and legislature would 
 follow that principle... 

 Different utility --- same issue:  WSJ reports The faucets in one of six U.S. homes pour water provided 
 by a private co. Now, some of 
 these communities are revolting against their corporate water systems, attempting to put their water under government control because of 
 concerns over rising rates and service disruptions . Cheers broke 
 out in a packed senior center near the mountain village of Felton on 
 June 5, when the local water district officially wrested control of the 
 town&apos;s water from a unit of American Water Works.. Felton residents 
 waged a years-long battle to bring their water back to local control. 
 American Water finally agreed in May to sell the system to the local 
 public water district, which Felton recently joined, for $10.5 mln in 
 cash and assumption of $2.9 mln in debt. Similar conflicts have flared 
 up around the U.S. over the past few years -- part of a backlash against 
 a wave of water-works-privatization deals in the U.S. that began in the 
 1990s as cash-strapped municipalities sought to defray the costs of 
 upgrading old water plants and other infrastructure.   

 06/16/08:  Oppenheimer believes the current record high oil prices are not justified by supply and demand 
 and are mainly the result of excessive speculation . They note there 
 has been no meaningful supply disruption to fuel concerns about 
 potential shortages, and the world&apos;s refining system has been well 
 supplied, while oil demand growth forecast has been trimmed as a result 
 of the worldwide economic downturn. They say the  prevailing market 
 fundamentals should have resulted in oil prices at or below last year&apos;s 
 level of around $65/barrel , but instead, oil prices surged by more 
 than 100% in the last 12 months. They believe the government&apos;s 
 inability, or unwillingness, to curb excessive speculation has 
 significantly contributed to the current oil bubble. 

 Ignore this nonsense:  Crude oil sets 
 new record of $139.89; currently trading +3.70 at 138.58.  I 
 really think we&apos;re in a&quot;short squeeze&quot;situation whereby the folks 
 betting against the price rise are constantly forced to cover their bets 
 and buy to close their positions. Demand dropping, Saudis pumping 
 more oil, conservation coming along, ...It&apos;s panic buying, which is what 
 happens when a short squeeze occurs. 

 06/12/08: Here&apos;s a nearly two-year old story that seems pretty appropriate for today . Note, the bill 
 was killed in Congress. 

 NY Times reports a prominent 
 Washington lawmaker said Wednesday that he would propose next week to ban large 
 institutional investors, including index funds, from the nation&apos;s 
 booming commodity mkts. The idea is one of several outlined by 
 Senator Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, who is chairman of 
 the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. That 
 committee will hold a hearing on June 24 to continue examining whether 
 financial speculation is affecting the prices of crops and fuel.&quot;There 
 is excessive speculation in the 
 commodity markets that is driving up the cost of food and energy ,&quot;the senator said in an interview.&quot;The question is, do large 
 institutional investors play a positive role?&quot; His concern, he 
 said, is that they do not.  

 06/11/08: Let&apos;s put this in perspective:  Crude ended higher by $5.14 to $136.45, natural gas finished up 22.7 
 cents to $12.662, heating oil settled higher by 16.86 cents to $3.981 
 and RBOB gasoline closed up 15.4 cents to $3.4733.   What 
 changed to justify a 3.9% price increase? That&apos;s more than the 
 average guy&apos;s wage increase for an entire year. 

 Addendum to yesterday&apos;s note...the 
 line in the sand, so to speak, is $135/bbl. Demand numbers show 
 that we&apos;re finally consuming less oil. If prices go up from here, 
 it&apos;s probably speculation...if prices fall, it&apos;s back to economics. Time will tell... 

 US DOE says crude prices to stay well above $100/bbl through &apos;09 ; says gas prices expected 
 to stay around $4/gal through 09 - DJ 

 OPEC Secy Genl says we have to put a 
 brake on the futures market - DJ.  Amen. 

 06/10/08:  OK, I&apos;m putting this in writing. The pundits and financial shows and Wall Street all have a vested 
 interest in pumping energy prices higher. They smell profits from 
 one niche of the economy while ignoring the social implications of what 
 happens when the entire economy tanks. Years ago Houston was 
 minting millionaries from anyone working in the oil industry (Remember Dallas ?  Urban Cowboy ? And that cycle ended 
 badly...and brought us ENRON! All financial bubbles eventually 
 pop, whether it&apos;s tulip bulbs, Internet stocks, housing, whatever. Buying now is playing into the hands of the speculators because you&apos;re 
 listening to the $200/bbl people (who are long the stocks). If 
 people can&apos;t afford to drive and/or heat their homes, the economy is 
 headed for a major shock and the&quot;developing countries&quot;won&apos;t be seeing 
 the big income gains they expect...look at China&apos;s stock market sell-off 
 today. I recognize inflation and rising prices, but like anything 
 on Wall Street, the projections have gone too far, too fast, IMHO. Take a look at the mall parking lots. Lehigh is wrestling with 
 this issue and the urgency to&quot;lock down&quot;now is in and of itself a 
 contrarian indicator. Clearly there will be a change in DC come 
 1/20/09 and fiscal sanity should help the US $; a national energy policy 
 would be a bonus, as would (painful as it might sound) more tax on 
 gasoline, whether the $ goes to alternative research or maybe subsidies 
 on hybrids. The pundits assume demand continues unabated...the 
 charts disagree. High prices cure high demand. The Fed 
 fighting inflation is NOT a bad concept. Drive less, invest in 
 energy savings projects, fight electric deregulation, and we might get a 
 break. If not, move South! 

 Crude 
 continues its upward move in electronic trade; now up $3.20 to $137.55 

 Saudi Oil Ministry is saying production is up by 
 almost 500K barrels/day this qtr, putting total output at 9.45 mln bpd; CNBC reports the Saudi Oil 
 Ministry also said the current price of oil is unacceptable, and oil 
 prices are unreasonable. 

 The Wall Street Journal reports The International Energy 
 Agency on Tuesday lowered its 
 forecast for global oil demand this year amid surging prices , but 
 said the world&apos;s hunger for oil is still knocking the market off 
 balance.&quot;Supply growth so far this year has been poor and higher prices 
 are needed to choke off demand to balance the market,&quot;the agency said 
 in a monthly report. The agency predicted global oil product demand in 
 2008 to grow by 0.9%, or 800,000 barrels a day, down from the 1.2%, or 1 
 mln barrels, forecast earlier. The change follows decisions by 
 several developing countries to reduce fuel subsidies because of 
 high oil prices. The agency has also made upward revisions to its 2006 
 and 2007 data. The agency lowered its 2008 global demand forecast to 
 86.8 mln barrels a day, down 80,000 barrels from last month. The agency 
 has been steadily lowering its demand predictions for the past several 
 months as oil prices have climbed. The IEA predicted U.S. oil demand would 
 contract by up to 2.5% this year to 20.3 mln barrels a day.&quot;Airlines are cutting flights. ... Consumers are protesting and 
 politicians&apos; statements reflect that mood,&quot;the report said. Lower 
 fuel taxes or higher subsidies would, the agency said, be&quot;absolutely 
 the worst response.&quot; 

 06/09/08:    Reuters.com reports Saudi Arabia said on Monday it 
 will call for a meeting between oil producing and consuming nations to 
 discuss unjustified rises in oil prices . The Saudi cabinet also 
 said that there were no fundamental reasons for the oil price surge 
 adding that markets were well-supplied. 

 OPEC&apos;S Badri says OPEC has no 
 influence over speculation, ability to influence market limited - 
 Reuters  Badri says member countries committed to investing 
 over $160 bln to add extra 5 mln bpd output by end 2012;  says 
 no shortage of oil in market, inventories of major consumer regions at 
 comfortable levels, according to statement.  

 So, there&apos;s no speculation in the market, eh? One 
 need look no further than the 6 oil chart; Sunoco and 
 Hess have all of that inventory already refined and it&apos;s now worth 10% 
 more overnight? This is going to end badly. Inflation is one 
 thing, but prices are being manipulated while supply and demand are in 
 balance. And I can&apos;t believe demand isn&apos;t starting to slack off. The failure of the emerging market argument is simple...if the US stops 
 consuming and spending, who is going to buy all of their goods? And their governments can&apos;t keep subsidizing the cost of oil forever. Or have a look at the $/MMBTU 
 chart . Look at the scale! Those buyers are in a panic. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO JOIN THE PANIC AND BUY. IF PRICES CONTINUE 
 AT THIS PACE THE ECONOMY WILL FALL APART. 

 06/06/08: Crude makes new all time highs at 
 $135.40; now up $7.46 to $135.25. Talk about a vicious cycle... In 
 Europe, mkts tumbled, after data showed a jump in the U.S. jobless rate 
 that sent the dollar down and led to a surge in the oil price. Jobless rate rises, dollar gets whacked, oil goes higher, leading to 
 less consumption leading to more joblessness? At least we know the 
 US dollar is the primary driver of price. 

 06/05/08:  Forbes.com reports is it possible 
 for Congress to stumble into a correct or honorable action on the 
 economic front? Just such an event seems to have occurred in May, with 
 the passage of a bill to halt deliveries of crude oil to the Strategic 
 Petroleum Reserve. When it takes effect July 1 the bill will cause an 
 immediate pullback in the price of oil, as much as $20 . So says 
 energy economist Philip Verleger. His prediction is surprising, given 
 that injections into the reserve are just 60,000 barrels a day--0.3% of 
 U.S. oil consumption. But he notes that much of what&apos;s being hoarded by 
 the government is light, sweet crude from Arabia, Nigeria and the North 
 Sea--the stuff fetching headline prices of $135 a barrel. The market for 
 high-quality crude is very tight.... In a Nov. 29, 2004 column in 
 Forbes, Johns Hopkins economist Steve H. Hanke estimated that the 
 reserve was adding $10 to the price of oil ($55 at the time). 

 A third electricity retailer 
 defaulted on its obligations in Texas, slammed by a deregulated market 
 that continues to be roiled by extremely high -- and so far, unexplained

 change some market rules, possibly in an emergency board meeting on 
 Friday.

 fears that banks are still short of cash despite collectively raising 
 nearly $300 bln worldwide recently... KIA, which did not mention Lehman 
 as a target, said that it was looking to build on previous investments 
 in the United States, which include V, MER and C. Bader al-Saad, KIA&apos;s 
 managing director, said:&quot; We are in Visa and we are already looking 
 at other opportunities. In Citi or in Merrill, if there is a good 
 opportunity, we will look into it.&quot;  That&apos;s just one 
 example...our petrodollars are literally fueling a buying spree... 

 Some 35 years after the first oil shock, Brazil has 
 moved from dependence on imports to self-sufficiency while the United 
 States still relies on imported oil for more than half its needs. In the 
 same period, Brazil has developed the world’s most advanced ethanol 
 program, based on sugar cane, while the U.S. corn ethanol program is 
 essentially a wasteful folly of dubious carbon offset merits. Corn 
 is food. Turning it into fuel, which is costly and energy-intensive, 
 removes nourishment from the global food supply. Subsidizing 
 corn-ethanol production in Iowa also diverts land from soy, another 
 important staple. Sugar cane is not a staple. It’s eight times 
 more productive than corn. It grows year round. 

 06/04/08: Bernanke on inflation -&quot; &quot;For a 
 central banker, a particularly critical difference between then and now 
 is what has happened to inflation and inflation expectations. The 
 overall inflation rate has averaged about 3-1/2 percent over the past 
 four quarters, significantly higher than we would like but much less 
 than the double-digit rates that inflation reached in the mid-1970s and 
 then again in 1980. Moreover, the increase in inflation has been 
 milder this time--on the order of 1 percentage point over the past year 
 as compared with the 6 percentage point jump that followed the 1973 oil 
 price shock. From the perspective of monetary policy, just as 
 important as the behavior of actual inflation is what households and 
 businesses expect to happen to inflation in the future, particularly 
 over the longer term. If people expect an increase in inflation to be 
 temporary and do not build it into their longer-term plans for setting 
 wages and prices, then the inflation created by a shock to oil prices 
 will tend to fade relatively quickly. Some indicators of longer-term 
 inflation expectations have risen in recent months, which is a 
 significant concern for the Federal Reserve. We will need to monitor 
 that situation closely. However, changes in long-term inflation 
 expectations have been measured in tenths of a percentage point this 
 time around rather than in whole percentage points, as appeared to be 
 the case in the mid-1970s. Importantly, we see little 
 indication today of the beginnings of a 1970s-style wage-price spiral , 
 in which wages and prices chased each other ever upward.&quot; 

 Here&apos;s an interesting opinion on how 
 subsidies affect oil prices . 

 This reporter from the Morning Call does no good by 
 continuing to parrot the 34% / 42% increase numbers from PPL. And 
 this story is goofy ...PA tags 
 along on (yet another)complaint against PJM for the RPM while ignoring 
 LMP? We can&apos;t even take the lead? &quot;could discourage 
 companies from investing in new plants...&quot;???!!! Yeah right. Like I&apos;ve said before, why would they? Would you spend a ton of 
 money to LOWER your profits? No! Not in a deregulated world. That&apos;s why we had regulation. FWIW, RPM added 19% to wholesale 
 power cost IN THE PPL ZONE (only). 

 06/03/08:  Sad for the workers, but it&apos;s 
 overdue: General Motors to cease production at four truck 
 production plants; GM to cut North American truck capacity by over 700K 
 units. This from the CEO who vehemently opposed mandatory fuel 
 economy targets because they would add $5,000 to the car&apos;s cost. 

 The growth of funds designed to mimic the price of crude 
 oil and other energy futures is reminiscent of a similar craze that 
 precipitated the stock market crash of 1987, billionaire financier 
 George Soros told lawmakers Tuesday. The surge in popularity of 
 commodity index funds is&quot;intellectually unsound ... and distinctly 
 harmful in its economic consequences,&quot;Soros told a Senate hearing. When speculators enter a market 
 mostly on one side -- in this case, betting on rising oil futures -- it&quot;distorts the otherwise prevailing balance between supply and demand.&quot; 

 06/02/08:  Daily Telegraph reports two of 
 the world&apos;s largest energy exchanges have forced traders to deposit significantly more money 
 when investing to curb volatility in energy markets and drive out speculators. The exchanges and related clearing houses have found themselves at the 
 center of the growing storm over claims that speculators have been 
 behind the recent rise in oil prices to record levels. The NMX and ICE 
 Futures Europe in London, the former International Petroleum Exchange, 
 have now tripled&quot;margin calls&quot;for some contracts. They hope the 
 increased margin calls will reduce volatility and force out some of the 
 more speculative players. Nymex has announced a threefold increase in 
 margin calls for long-dated Brent crude futures in New York. As a result 
 margin calls on some contracts will jump from $100 to $300 for clearing 
 members. 

 FT reports the solar power business is bracing itself 
 for a collapse in prices that could lead to a shake-out in one of the 
 most promising areas of the renewable energy sector... prices 
 for solar components could drop from about $3.80 per watt to about $1.40 
 a watt by 2010. 

 05/30/08:  Remember our old friend biodiesel? 
 Here&apos;s a story about theft of grease . No wonder he won&apos;t call me 
 back! 

 WSJ reports wholesale power prices in Texas 
 have surged to new heights, confounding market officials and 
 worrying regulators who see early signs that the situation could destabilize the state&apos;s 
 deregulated electricity markets. The spikes in wholesale power 
 prices -- ominous and so far unexplained -- could take a big toll on both power providers and 
 electricity customers if they persist. The state&apos;s utility commission 
 held an emergency meeting Thursday,&quot;which shows the level of concern,&quot;said commission spokesman Terry Hadley. The situation will eventually 
 cost consumers&quot;tens of millions of dollars,&quot;though it may take weeks 
 to show up in utility bills, according to Dan Jones, the state&apos;s 
 independent market monitor. Mr. Jones said he and other grid officials 
 are examining the computerized system that is used to balance generating 
 supplies with consumer demand, as well as market rules and the conduct 
 of market participants... Officials fear that if prices continue to 
 be high, it could create a cascading problem in which electricity 
 resellers are driven out of business because they are paying more for 
 electricity than they can charge. Even if providers do pass costs 
 onto customers, they may see higher default rates because consumers -- 
 already struggling with high gasoline and diesel prices -- can&apos;t afford 
 the higher bills. LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP LMP...it 
 will kill us. 

 Let me make something perfectly clear...there is NO 
 INCENTIVE for clean coal projects and/or generation expansion due to the structure 
 of the deregulated market.  

 05/28/08:  I myself grew up on horsepower 
 and muscle cars...but this op-ed rings true ...I&apos;ve said it before...there is a reason that 
 Toyota is worth 100x GM. I&apos;m personally disgusted by the latest 
 ads on the radio touting how we are all wrong about the Hummer. 

 Bloomberg reports that crude oil fell to a one-week low on concern record fuel prices will cut demand at the height of the U.S. 
 driving season. U.S. consumer confidence dropped to the lowest level 
 since October 1992 yesterday. The average U.S. gasoline pump price 
 reached an all-time high May 26, crimping demand from motorists. Oil 
 demand typically peaks during the summer as U.S. drivers take to the 
 road for vacations. Crude oil for July delivery dropped as much as $2.35 
 a barrel, or 1.8%, to $126.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
 Exchange. That&apos;s the lowest since May 19. It traded for $126.79 at of 
 10:21 a.m. London time. Yesterday, oil fell more than $3 a barrel, the 
 biggest one- day drop since April 29, to close at $128.85. Futures reached a record $135.09 
 on May 22 and have doubled in the past year. 

 05/27/08:  How stupid are our politicians?  B-fast w/ PPL CEO to discuss price caps and 2010 ?! He has nothing 
 to do with deregulation, can&apos;t change the market prices, and stands to 
 double or triple his net worth if nothing changes.  Yeah, 
 he&apos;s there to listen.... 

 Another deregulation horror story:  NY Times 
 reports the squeeze on truckers&apos; profits from rising fuel costs is 
 compounded by the slowing economy, which is reducing freight traffic. 
 Truckers say they find it hard to impose fuel surcharges, in part 
 because their industry has suffered for years from over-capacity a s 
 deregulation drew thousands of small operators into trucking. John Seibert, a research analyst at the Owner-Operator Independent 
 Drivers Association, said&quot;that a company seeking to ship something can 
 put a load on a dock and some trucker will come by and pick it up, 
 accepting the offered rate.&quot; Like the truckers, air freight operators 
 are being hurt by higher fuel costs, although less so. But railroads, 
 the third pillar in the nation&apos;s freight infrastructure, have so far 
 sidestepped losses , the Association of American Railroads reports. 
 That is partly because of rising 
 exports of coal and grain , which travel by rail to port cities, 
 and partly because some trucking companies have turned to rail to move 
 trailers long distances... Still, 70% of the nation&apos;s freight tonnage 
 moves over the highways on trucks, much of it in the diesel-powered 
 tractor-trailers of the nation&apos;s 350,000 independent operators, each 
 with a fleet of up to five vehicles, one usually driven by the 
 proprietor. Profit margins, notoriously thin in good times, are 
 minuscule now, and each rise in fuel prices pushes more truckers into 
 the red.  (Rising exports of coal...think about that one...) 

 05/21/08:  Crude makes a new all-time high at $133.38, now up $4.10 to $133.06 

 I assume everyone recognizes that one 
 strategy for the 08-09 heating season is electric space heat in place of 
 heating oil? As you can see from the chart on the left, regulated 
 power is cheaper than fuel oil. Remember, your furnace is not 100% 
 efficient. 

 FOMC Minutes Signal No More Rate Cuts Even If Econ 
 Contracts... which is good, because inflation control is the first 
 step toward deficit control.... FOMC says Food, Energy Prices To Keep 
 Boosting Overall Inflation... no kidding? 

 Reuters reports that oil climbed to a life-time high 
 above $130 a barrel on Wednesday , driven higher by a combination 
 of long-term production worries and a near-term focus on tight fuel 
 stocks. 

 The other side of the 
 biofuel argument ... 

 Here&apos;s a sobering editorial. ..&quot;If this huge transfer of wealth to 
 the petro-authoritarians continues, power will follow. According to 
 Congressional testimony Wednesday by the energy expert Gal Luft, with 
 oil at $200 a barrel, OPEC could“potentially buy Bank of America in one 
 month worth of production, Apple computers in a week and General Motors 
 in just 3 days.” 

 05/20/08:  EIA Administrator on CNBC says 
 predicting oil prices is a risky business; notes their current outlook 
 is for $110 average oil price this year .  These guys 
 never get it right... 

 Greenspan Sees Speculative Bubble In 
 Oil, Grains Prices; says inflation not yet out of control.  I&apos;m 
 not sure Uncle Alan can spot a bubble... 

 June crude (which expires today) makes 
 highs at $129.58, now up $2.32 to $129.37.  Anybody else 
 weary of this T Boone nonsense? I mean it&apos;s not like he doesn&apos;t 
 have a vested interest in higher prices....they fatten his wallet...who 
 in their right mind would go on a financial show to talk DOWN prices? 

 Another shot at Lisa Boscola. ..I 
 agree...cap extension isn&apos;t the answer. The first step toward a 
 solution is to admit we have a problem and deregulation needs to be 
 examined in the context of how it was sold and why it failed.  

 Boone Pickens, on CNBC, says oil 
 prices will continue to go up because the people who have the oil want 
 the price to go up. Calls it simple supply and demand. Says oil 
 production can not go over 85 mln bpd. Says only one fuel can 
 compete with oil and it&apos;s natural gas. Says it is possible to reduce oil 
 imports by 40% using natural gas. Calls ethanol a &apos;joke&apos; - will never 
 amount to more then 5% of fuel use. Thinks oil will go to $150pbl this 
 yr. Does think there is a bubble in crude prices.  (T4 note: it&apos;s consumption, stupid! If gas demand spikes, then those prices 
 are headed to the moon.) 

 05/19/08: Guess where your budget $ are 
 headed... FT reports leading global fund managers and private equity 
 cos are quietly lining up for a chance to manage another new and 
 significant pool of money in the Middle East - an endowment for a new Saudi 
 university with at least $10 bln in assets. The King Abdullah 
 University of Science&amp;Technology will not open until 2009 but it is already holding talks on its endowment with fund managers such 
 as BLK and private equity cos including Bain Capital, people familiar 
 with the matter say. The university has received $10 bln for its 
 endowment from Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah, which would make it the 
 sixth biggest university endowment in the world, said a university 
 spokesman based in Washington. People familiar with the endowment 
 negotiations say they have been told the fund could grow to as much 
 as $25 bln. 

 (Today&apos;s glimmer of hope news clip)  Bloomberg.com reports treasury 
 bond traders are telling Americans to stop fretting about inflation . 
 Consumers expect prices to rise 5.2% in the next 12 months, the most 
 pessimistic since 1982. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, show traders anticipate 
 inflation of about 2.9% by January , in line with its average of 
 3.1% the last 20 years. The disparity has never been wider. While 
 consumers grapple with gasoline above $3.70 a gallon, record rice prices 
 and the escalating cost of wheat, TIPS say the commodities market 
 is a bubble about to burst . A commodity slump would worsen losses 
 in the $500 billion TIPS market, where investors lost 2.35% in April, 
 the most since December 2006. 

 ( Followed by the negative opinion of) Keybanc believes that elevated 
 commodity prices relative to the past are here to stay based on the 
 global supply/demand fundamentals, worldwide demand growth, and 
 geopolitical uncertainties, as well as speculation in a new class of 
 assets. Firm is raising their FY08 WTI crude oil pricing assumptions to 
 $96.47/bbl from $90.72/bbl. Firm is also raising their Henry Hub natural 
 gas price ests for remainder 08 and FY09. 

 WSJ reports ahead of the summer driving season, all eyes 
 are usually on gasoline. This year, it&apos;s diesel that&apos;s going for a ride. 
 The rise of diesel, and more broadly, the category of fuel known as 
 middle distillates, is driven by stockpiling in China ahead of the 
 Olympic Games in August and the prospect of even more fuel needed to aid 
 the rebuilding effort in Sichuan province after last week&apos;s destructive 
 earthquake. Prices are also supported by abnormally low inventories in 
 Europe. And for the first time, the U.S. is playing a key role in 
 supplying the global market because its diesel now is more palatable to 
 the rest of the world. The fuel&apos;s ubiquity in transportation and backup 
 electricity generation means that a broader swathe of the world will 
 face additional inflation pressures at a time when rising food and 
 energy prices are already a concern. Crude markets are taking a cue from 
 the strong demand for diesel, hitting repeat records on a stream of 
 reports that nations are keen to secure additional fuel supplies. 

 WSJ reports as Congress debates whether to limit 
 carbon-dioxide emissions, one of the most vocal supporters of such 
 legislation -- the nuclear-power industry -- is poised to reap a 
 multibillion-dollar windfall if restrictions take effect . Some 
 nuclear operators are already forecasting how much their profits could 
 increase under various versions of greenhouse-gas legislation that are 
 under consideration. Carbon limits could usher in a period of&quot; supernormal 
 profits&quot;for nuclear operators in markets where rates are deregulated and have more ability to rise, says Hugh Wynne, utilities analyst 
 for Sanford C. Bernstein. But he warns that profits, if perceived as 
 excessive, run the risk of inciting a public backlash, perhaps including 
 calls for a windfall-profits tax . Congress is considering several 
 measures that would impose a so-called cap-and-trade system, which would 
 limit the amount of carbon dioxide cos are allowed to emit. .. .where 
 rates are deregulated!!!...where rates are deregulated!!!..where rates 
 are deregulated!!! We don&apos;t want/need a windfall profits tax...get 
 rid of deregulation... 

 05/16/08: Saudi Oil Minister says Saudis to 
 boost output to 9.45 mln bpd in June  

 White House says Saudi pledges to 
 pump as much oil as needed to meet demand - Reuters.  Not 
 helping with conservation??? SSDD.  DJ reports Saudi 
 Arabia&apos;s leaders are making clear they see no reason to increase oil 
 production until customers demand it, the White House said Friday. U.S. President George W. Bush 
 was in Saudi Arabia Friday to appeal to King Abdullah for greater 
 production to help halt rising gasoline prices in the U.S . But 
 his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, said Saudi officials 
 stuck to their position that they already are meeting demand. Hadley 
 told reporters,&quot;What they&apos;re saying to us is...Saudi Arabia does not 
 have customers that are making requests for oil that they are not able 
 to satisfy.&quot; 

 EXACTLY!!! We have plenty of oil. This is 
 a trader-driven market not operating on fundamentals of supply and 
 demand. If our genious politicians would wake up and recognize 
 that the weak dollar is killing us, then maybe we see some pricing 
 reductions. And why is the dollar weak? It&apos;s called a budget 
 deficit. We can&apos;t hide from it just as we can&apos;t hide from the 
 fact that we import 66% of our oil. The hole has been dug, now we 
 need to figure a way out. 

 Bloomberg.com is reporting 
 Goldman Sachs revised higher its New York crude-oil price forecast for 
 the second half of this year by 32% , citing supply constraints. 
 Goldman now forecasts West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude grade 
 traded in New York, will average $141 a barrel in the second half of the 
 year, up from its previous forecast of $107. Prices will rise further in 
 2009, averaging $148 a barrel, the bank said. ``Supply constraints and a 
 lack of scaleable substitutes are set to continue driving the long end 
 of the oil curve higher,&apos;&apos;  

 (somewhat off topic; see my 5/9 comment)  Bloomberg.com reports rice 
 slumped for a fifth day , heading for the biggest weekly decline in almost four years , as the prospect of 
 exports from Pakistan and Japan eased concern that a global food 
 shortage is worsening. Pakistan, the fifth-biggest exporter, will permit 
 shipments of 1 mln metric tons because local needs have been met, 
 Mohammad Azhar Akhtar, chairman of the Rice Exporters Association of 
 Pakistan said yesterday. The staple for half the world reached a record 
 last month as some exporters including Vietnam and India cut sales to 
 guarantee local supplies, stoking concern that hunger and unrest may 
 spread. The price fell 14% this 
 week, the biggest weekly drop since July 2, 2004. 

 05/13/08: U.S. Q1 crude imports lowest any 
 since &apos;04; -2% on yr, according to E.I.A. - DJ 

 05/12/08:  Another view on oil, the non-bubble . If you read between the lines, you&apos;ll find the 
 same theme that I&apos;ve maintained, namely a need to cut demand. I 
 would love to see NYMEX margins raised once and for all to test the 
 speculation thesis. 

 WSJ reports a new generation of 
 nuclear power plants is on the drawing boards in the U.S., but the 
 projected cost is causing some sticker shock: $5-$12 bln a plant, double to quadruple earlier 
 rough estimates . Nuclear power is regaining favor as an 
 alternative to other sources of power generation, such as coal-fired 
 plants, which have fallen out of favor because they are major polluters. 
 But the high cost could lead to sharply higher electricity bills for 
 consumers and inevitably reignite debate about the nuclear industry&apos;s 
 suitability to meet growing energy needs.  Solution to 
 petroleum? Reduce consumption. Solution to power? Re-regulate to (cost +12%) and manage demand. 

 05/09/08: Where does it end?  Crude breaks above the $126 
 level, now up $2.42 to $126.11. 

 T4 
 brainstorm:   The Chinese and Indians are not eating any 
 more rice today than they were three months ago. The doubling of rice 
 prices cannot therefore be explained by a sudden shift in supply and 
 demand. And the same is true of oil, since the global growth of oil 
 output in the past two years has been substantially faster than the 
 growth of consumption. 

 Recent bubbles:  housing (flipmycondo.com), 
 computer storage, Internet stocks, bird flu, cancer vaccines, fiber 
 optics, ethanol... These things are great if you happen to catch the wave 
 and ride it to profits...but they all end badly. I still think 
 high prices force hard looks at alternatives that will cut 
 demand/consumption. If housing deflation forces less McMansions, 
 then that&apos;s less driving to the &apos;burbs and less furniture and less trips 
 to Sams Club. Time will tell. 

 5/08/08:  Wholesale electric prices in New England just blew through the 20 
 cents/kwhr mark. 

 Washington Post reports Democrats 
 in the Senate on Wednesday unveiled a new energy package that would 
 revoke $17 bln in tax breaks extended to big oil cos like XOM and slap a 
 25% windfall profits tax on cos that don&apos;t invest in new energy sources 
 ( i.e. why should they get paid for riding the market wave?) . The 
 Consumer-First Energy Act -- assembled by Senate Majority Leader Harry 
 Reid and other key Democrats -- would tax big energy cos, halt filling 
 the emergency U.S. oil stockpile, and seek to put checks on oil market 
 speculation . The Democrats&apos; energy bill seeks to lay the blame 
 for record-high gasoline prices over $3.60 a gallon on the Bush 
 administration, big oil companies like Exxon and the OPEC oil cartel... 
 One thing missing from the bill was a plan to suspend an 
 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal tax on gasoline this summer - an idea that 
 has divided Democratic presidential candidates senators Barack Obama and 
 Hillary Clinton. ( puh-leeze, why in the world should we drop gas 
 prices? We need to cut consumption, not make like it&apos;s a temporary 
 problem.) 

 Consumption, consumption, consumption, ....!!! We 
 need to transition/force consumption to drop. Nobody likes new 
 taxes, but if we don&apos;t alter the consumption mentality, we&apos;re heading 
 higher. I think our first stop should be 51% domestic production 
 and 49% imports... 

 05/07/08:  Crude makes new all time high at 
 $123.12, now up $1.20 to $123.04.   Dept of Energy 
 reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 5654K 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 1625K); gasoline inventories 
 had a build of 794K (Bloomberg: build of 100K); distillate inventories had a draw of 107K (Bloomberg: build of 1100K) 

 US Treasury Secretary Paulson says worst of credit 
 crisis over; gas prices econ drag - DJ; in a normal world, these numbers 
 would be good, or bearish for crude prices. See 5/5 comment... 

 05/06/08:  Crude makes new all time at 
 $121.49, now up $1.41 to $121.38  E.I.A says global oil 
 supply near capacity, vulnerable to snags. 

 Asked and answered... Bloomberg 
 reports that crude oil may rise to between $150 and $200 a barrel within 
 two years as growth in supply fails to keep pace with increased demand 
 from developing nations, Goldman Sachs Group analysts led by Arjun Murti 
 said in a report. Murti first wrote of a&quot;super spike&quot;in March 2005, 
 when he said oil prices could range between $50 and $105 a barrel 
 through 2009. The price of crude traded in New York averaged $56.71 in 
 2005, $66.23 in 2006 and $72.36 in 2007. Oil rose to an intraday record 
 $120.93 today on speculation demand will rise during the peak U.S. 
 summer driving season.&quot; The 
 possibility of $150-$200 per barrel seems increasingly likely over the 
 next six-24 months, though predicting the ultimate peak in oil prices as 
 well as the remaining duration of the upcycle remains a major 
 uncertainty,&apos;&apos; the Goldman analysts wrote in the report dated May 
 5.  Put into perspective, this is another 66% from here; $6/gal 
 gasoline...and then what?  

 05/05/08: If we&apos;re in a sluggish economy, 
 perhaps a recession, and oil is $120/bbl, what will happen if/when we 
 recover?  

 05/02/08: Conspiracy theorists?  Bloomberg.com reports Iran more than doubled the amount stored in 
 tankers idling in the Persian Gulf, sending ship prices higher as demand 
 for some of its crude fell, people familiar with the situation said. The 
 10 tankers hold at least 20 million barrels of oil, equal to about 5 
 days of the country&apos;s output, said the people, who asked not to be 
 identified because the information isn&apos;t public. Rates for tankers have 
 more than tripled since April 8, based on data from the Baltic Exchange 
 and ship-fuel prices... Iran&apos;s use of ships for storage cut the supply 
 of available supertankers, owned by cos including FTO and Euronav NV. 
 The number of double-hull very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, available 
 to rent within the next 30 days dropped to 28 from 56 a month ago.  Demand is falling, yet the oil keeps getting pumped...but where to 
 go? This is an early indicator that the law of supply&amp;demand 
 might finally wrest control from speculators. 

 05/01/08: 3 days does not a trend make... The 
 rise in the Dollar has contributed to the breakdown in the Commodity 
 ETFs with Agriculture (DBA) -2.8%, Base Metal (DBB) -3.1%, June Crude 
 Oil Futures -2.5%, Gold (GLD) -3.2%, Silver (SLV) -4.3%, Natural Gas (UNG) 
 -3.2%, Gasoline (UGA) -3.5% while the Commodity Index (DBC) is off 
 -3.3%.  But it would be nice... Pain starts at 10% down...then 
 the speculators start liquidating. 

 04/30/08: Where does it end?  UBS is 
 raising their long-term normalized U.S. coal price forecasts. Co is 
 lifting price tgts across the board. 

 Friedman is back with a vengeance:  US energy 
 policy:  &quot;Maximize demand, minimize supply, and buy the rest from the people who 
 hate us the most&quot;. 

 04/29/08: Disgusted with political BS:  
 Mr. Bush laid out a litany of complaints against 
 Congress, as he has done often in his final year 
 as president, and said he had suggested a 
 number of solutions that were repeatedly 
 shot down. As gas prices have soared in the past 
 year—as much as $4 a gallon in some parts of 
 the country after rising as much as $1.40 per 
 gallon on average since last year—the Bush 
 administration has called on Congress to allow 
 increased oil exploration in the Arctic National 
 Wildlife Refuge, and the construction of new oil 
 refineries on abandoned military bases. These 
 proposals, Mr. Bush said, would enable the 
 United States to produce 
 as much as 27 million gallons of gasoline and 
 diesel a day. 
 Here&apos;s the latest import chart.  27 million 
 gals/day is 642 thousand bbls/day. Hello? We import 10,000 thousand bbls/day (or 10MM bpd) 
 right now! So let&apos;s cut the crap about 
 ANWR as the solution. Drill there and 
 people will just rush out and buy cheap trucks 
 on sale. We could achieve way more with 
 conservation and a change of driving habits. 

 And new refineries? Ignoring the air 
 permit issues, current utilization rates of our 
 existing plants are 85%! Meaning we can 
 process a lot more already. IT&apos;S 
 CONSUMPTION, STUPID! USA vs. the world. Hopefully we&apos;re smart enough to recognize that 
 there are no easy&quot;solutions&quot;. 
 04/28/08: Off-topic slightly, but pay attention 
 to the next to last paragraph... Ben 
 Stein on banks and the credit crisis.  I think he hit the nail 
 on the head...deregulation carried to an extreme WILL lead to 
 calamity . 

 It&apos;s Monday and oil is up again... Forbes 
 reports that oil leapt more than $1 to a record high near $120 a barrel on Monday after workers pushed ahead with a two-day strike that 
 shut a major North Sea oil pipeline supplying about half of Britain&apos;s 
 oil. Fresh violence in Nigeria and simmering tensions between the United 
 States and major oil exporter Iran also helped to offset the impact of a 
 rising U.S. dollar to boost oil prices. U.S. light crude for June 
 delivery rose $1.01 to $119.53 by 0603 GMT, adding to Friday&apos;s nearly 
 $2.50 surge and briefly striking a lifetime high of $119.93 a barrel. 
 Prices are up almost 25 percent since the start of the year.  

 OK, let&apos;s see if I get this one...a strike in the North 
 Sea shuts down a pipeline, thereby cutting supply (and forcing 
 conservation?) and the price goes up? 

 Interesting data trivia point #1 today...Hess and Sunoco 
 have identical #6 prices.  

 Interesting data trivia point #2 today...it&apos;s cheaper 
 for Lehigh to heat with (projected forward) electricity over heating 
 oil. I&apos;m not sure this has ever occurred in the history of the 
 Lehigh Valley. I can&apos;t remember a time... 

 04/23/08: How bad is this action/reaction game?   US Security fires warning shots at Iran boats in Gulf, Fox says - DJ Crude ticks higher following 10:39 comment, now up $2.34 to $118.40. So the Arabs and Exxon just made 2% on their product because we fired a 
 warning shot? That has to be the most profitable round of 
 ammunition ever made. 

 Uh-oh...what&apos;s wrong with this story ? Dear Senator 
 XXX, maybe the problem is our fuel consumption??? OPEC does NOT 
 set the price of oil...our supplies are above 5-year moving 
 averages...there are no shortages in the USA... 

 04/23/08:  WSJ reports U.S. auto makers must increase 
 the average fuel efficiency of their cars and trucks to 31.6 miles per 
 gallon from today&apos;s 25 by 2015 under new rules issued by the Bush 
 administration. The pace of the increase is somewhat faster than was 
 mandated in last year&apos;s big energy bill. The rules are the first step 
 toward meeting a congressional mandate that U.S. cars and trucks average 
 35 mpg by 2020. Under the rules, each of the major auto makers has a 
 different target for cars and trucks, based on its future product plans. 
 General Motors&apos;s projected target for its light-truck fleet, for 
 example, is 27.4 mpg in 2015, while Honda Motor will have to meet a 29.6 
 mpg target in 2015. 

 Where do the eco-friendly Europeans go when reality 
 bumps up against electricity demand? Yup.  Coal plants . Environmental Enemy #1. Here&apos;s a similar story from 2 years 
 ago. 

 04/22/08:  Here&apos;s a great story.   Replace farm with school and replace 
 crops with fuel and you have the same problem that we are facing. Once upon a time, the futures market was a tool to stabilize your 
 budget. Today, it&apos;s financial fodder. What if you had locked 
 fuel oil last year at $2? Feeling pretty good today? Not 
 really, because your budget would probably not be ready for the near 
 double in cost that is coming next year. Our goal is price 
 stability, not trading futures.  NOTE: see my 4/14/08 
 comment below! Once again, great minds think alike? 

 04/21/08:  From a Paul Krugman column in today&apos;s NYT , (which camp are you in regarding 
 oil prices?), here are three competing views on oil prices: 

 The first is that it’s mainly speculation—that investors, looking 
 for high returns at a time of low interest rates, have piled into 
 commodity futures, driving up prices. On this view, someday soon the 
 bubble will burst and high resource prices will go the way of Pets.com . The second view 
 is that soaring resource prices do, in fact, have a basis in 
 fundamentals—especially rapidly growing demand from newly meat-eating, 
 car-driving Chinese—but that given time we’ll drill more wells, plant 
 more acres, and increased supply will push prices right back down again. 
 The third view is that the era of cheap resources is over for good—that we’re running out of oil, running out of land to expand food 
 production and generally running out of planet to exploit.   Personally, I still believe in economics and that the supply/demand 
 curve will set prices. Eventually the speculators go bust, but 
 when is anybody&apos;s guess. Maybe we need $5 gas to really create 
 meaningful change? If everyone commits to at least one Prius in 
 the family, would that make a dent in our oil consumption? Dunno... 
 but I do know that is one reason Toyota is worth $186 billion while GM 
 sits at $12 billion. Maybe we should share pickup trucks when 
 needed instead of driving them daily?  

 The oil price goose du jour: Crude moves towards session highs of $117.40 in electronic trade after 
 Shell declares Force Majeure following attack on Nigeria pipeline; now 
 up 58 cents to $117.27. Pick a day, pick an event...anywhere, 
 anytime...it will spike oil futures...yet we have no supply 
 interruptions and our reserves are near 5-year highs. Where does 
 it end? What is the point of maximum pain? This commodity 
 price is linear and upwards. There hasn&apos;t been an opportunity to 
 lock down prices since Christmas 07. My opinion remains the 
 same...why now? What signal is flashing that says a linear 
 unending climb higher is coming? Consumption numbers dropped off a 
 cliff the last time gasoline neared $4. Hey, it&apos;s a global 
 economy, right? If the US stops consuming, where are the Indians 
 and Chinese going to turn for revenue? 

 04/17/08:  Boone Pickens taking long 
 position in oil, says previous short position was &apos;mistake&apos; - Bloomberg. 

 LONDON (Dow Jones)-- Natural 
 gas prices in the second half of 2008 are forecast to be higher in a Dow 
 Jones Newswires poll of 16 financial institutions amid rising oil 
 prices, a falling dollar and worries over the shutdown of a major gas 
 distribution hub and below-average storage levels.  (T4 
 clarification: 3 Bcf below the 5-yr avg of 1,264 Bcf is technically 
 below, but come on, it&apos;s a tiny, tiny amt)  The median 
 price for gas deliverable at Henry Hub in the third quarter was forecast 
 at $8.89 per million British thermal units, up 11.1% from last month&apos;s survey . The median for the fourth quarter was up 12.5% to $9.00/MMBtu. Early Thursday, oil in New York hit a new record high of $115.45 a 
 barrel and the dollar held close to an all-time low against the euro 
 Thursday as the U.S. economic outlook continued to blacken. Compounding 
 macro-economic problems, f ront-month 
 gas futures hit a 27-month high of $10.489/MMBtu Wednesday as the 
 shut down of Independence Hub, a major gas distribution point in the 
 Gulf of Mexico, entered its second week. Independence Hub operator 
 Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) declared force majeure last week 
 after a leak was discovered in a pipeline connected to Independence Hub. 
 Enterprise reiterated Wednesday that repairs could take up to four 
 weeks. The outage means a slow start for what is likely to be a long 
 storage injection season. Current gas in U.S. storage totals 1.234 
 trillion cubic feet, 22.1% below last year&apos;s levels and 1.8% below the 
 five-year average for this time of year, according to the U.S. Energy 
 Information Administration. 

 04/16/08:  WSJ reports in a significant 
 shift on global warming, President Bush will propose stopping growth in 
 U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 2025 and signal that he is open to 
 lawmakers reining in pollution from power cos. The stance, set to be 
 unveiled Wednesday at a White House speech, indicates Mr. Bush&apos;s 
 willingness to grapple with the growing legislative debate over global 
 warming. It marks an acknowledgment by the Bush administration that the 
 U.S. likely will adopt some sort of broad new legal system to curb 
 greenhouse-gas emissions in coming years. Mr. Bush has opposed 
 comprehensive legislation to curb emissions. But like an increasing 
 number of utilities and manufacturers, he is aiming to join the 
 discussions in hopes of shaping the debate and creating a system that 
 won&apos;t be too costly to industry or consumers. 

 Ugh. Here&apos;s another bullish story on why oil prices 
 remain stubbornly high . Now $125/bbl is the new target, which 
 coincidentally would be $4/gallon gas. One former CBOT floor 
 trader described crude oil futures:&quot;Crude oil rallying is like asking 
 to an eight-year-old why they didn&apos;t do their homework. You&apos;re going to 
 get a ton of excuses and none of them are going to make any sense .&quot; Now that traders and speculators have seized the new target, what&apos;s to 
 stop the train? 

 04/14/08:  If you don&apos;t have something nice 
 to say, then don&apos;t say anything? I have never seen energy track 
 higher&amp;higher every single day with a total disconnect from supply&amp;demand. This simply proves that we are locked in a cycle where our 
 costs are driven by Wall Street. Anyone who has ever watched a hot 
 stock climb higher and higher without a pause understands this concept. We are not trading on fundamentals, we&apos;re trading because we&apos;re told 
 that commodities are a great investment. If you study the history 
 and purpose of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), you&apos;d recognize 
 that the system has been hijacked. The banks thought they were too 
 smart to fall/fail...et tu Exxon? 

 More on carbon caps:  Coal producers and coal-fired 
 electric utilities are voicing concerns about federal and state governments 
 each setting up their own carbon regulations, saying such&quot;dual 
 regimes&quot;would be detrimental to the economy and would raise costs for 
 companies to comply with the regulations. I dunno...one could 
 argue both sides here. 
 
 04/07/08:  Before you rush out and endorse 
 carbon trading or caps as a solution to emissions, please check out this story .  Note my comment below on 3/28. IMHO, the back end, or balance-of-plant, is the least glamorous aspect 
 of power plant engineering and might be one reason why it has lagged in 
 the engineering committee. The primary focus has always been 
 availability and heat rate. The BTG guys need to be redirected to 
 carbon sequestration. 

 A little off-topic, but the State of Ohio has had enough 
 with the 2008 NEC and reverted 
 back to the 2005 edition because of the cost of AFCIs and tamper 
 resistant receptacles which are estimated to add $1,000 to the cost of a 
 new home. 

 04/03/08:  Anyone see this story from the Chronicle regarding carbon neutrality ? 

 04/02/08: WSJ reports natural-gas producers are swarming into Pennsylvania to chase 
 what many are betting could be the next big thing: a thick wedge of 
 gas-bearing rock called the Marcellus Shale. The recent surge in 
 interest was triggered by disclosures in the fall from producer Range 
 Resources Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, that it had drilled a well there 
 producing more than three mln cubic feet of natural gas a day, proving 
 that Marcellus Shale wells can be profitable. Since then, Range has 
 reported wells that produce even more gas. The result is a land rush 
 unmatched anywhere else in North America as companies try to snap up 
 drilling acreage on a giant swath of rock stretching from West Virginia 
 across Pennsylvania to the northeast corner of the state, 90 miles from 
 New York City. RRC plans to spend $426 mln in Appalachia this year. 
 Other out-of-state companies, such as EOG, CHK and APC have either begun 
 drilling or are planning to drill wells targeting the Marcellus Shale... 
 Still, there have been relatively few completed Marcellus Shale wells, 
 and it isn&apos;t clear whether the rock will produce prolific wells across 
 the state or only in certain pockets. Cos could be spending a lot of 
 money leasing acres and drilling wells in counties where there won&apos;t be 
 enough gas for the wells to offer a reasonable return. 

 04/01/08:  Here&apos;s a news blip from the land 
 of regulated utilities: Wisconsin Public Service Corp. 
 filed a request with state regulators on Tuesday to increase retail 
 electric and natural-gas rates. The utility asked the Public Service 
 Commission of Wisconsin for permission to lift electric rates by about 7.75 percent in 2009 and 0.33 percent, plus an adjustment for fuel 
 costs, in 2010. It also asked to increase natural-gas rates by 
 2.16 percent in 2009, with no increase in 2010.  That&apos;s a little 
 less than 42% No? 

 I mention this not because I&apos;m a 
 conspiracy theorist, but mainly because I believe that all of this hedge 
 fund crap has seriously skewed the fundamental concepts behind investing 
 for the long haul:  CNBC commentator says LEH CEO Fuld has told 
 Wall St. execs and regulators that he has information that short-selling 
 hedge funds colluded to bring about the demise of BSC.  Fear 
 sells. Period. Short sellers can make a windfall much 
 quicker than a buy&amp;hold investor. Sure, there are frauds...but 
 Bear failed because their counterparties no longer would trust 
 them...and if they didn&apos;t trust them due to misinformation and/or BS 
 rumors, then THAT is the bigger problem. 

 03/31/08:  Clarification: The meeting 
 with the PUC ALJ on Wednesday at NCC regards PPL&apos;s plan to collect money 
 in advance of the rate hike.  Wailing at an ALJ to stop 
 deregulation or stop the rate hike will do no good.  Judges 
 interpret laws...they don&apos;t pass nor repeal them. If you want to 
 vent, then attend. But don&apos;t go with misconceptions about what you 
 can or can&apos;t achieve.  The only people who could stop this train 
 are PA legislators. 

 NEXT FY: We set our budgets at $100/bbl oil and 
 they&apos;re already blown.  There&apos;s risk management and there&apos;s trend 
 following. The forward curves aren&apos;t really curves...they&apos;re like 
 straight lines up.  It&apos;s not hard to see the case for $125/bbl oil 
 given a straightline projection. Same can be said for natty at 
 $12.  Now natty s hould be closer to $8.  But it&apos;s not. Because it can. There is no resistance to its price following oil 
 upwards. I continue to believe that buying now is playing into the 
 hands of speculators, but it&apos;s a tough game. I still have summer 
 and fall to stay on market gas. 

 03/28/08:  Interesting story in this month&apos;s Mechanical Engineering : Engineering&apos;s 14 Grand 
 Challenges...Sustainability...Make solar energy affordable, 
 commercialize fusion energy, develop carbon sequestration, manage the 
 nitrogen cycle. I mention this because these challenges indicate 
 that we have problems that are not solved...problems that the media is 
 using as buzzwords. Solar isn&apos;t a solution in PA (yet) and we have 
 a lot of coal but no good way to keep the carbon out of the atmosphere. 

 03/27/08:  FT reports Crude oil prices on Thursday 
 surged above $107 a barrel after saboteurs attacked a key export 
 pipelines in Iraq , reversing most of last week&apos;s losses. Ah 
 yes, back to the old global terror premium.  

 03/26/08: Common Sense 101; Why do you think 
 that FPL is building this in the desert?   Co announces 
 plan to add significantly to its solar power generating capability. FPL 
 Energy has filed an Application for Certification with the California 
 Energy Commission to construct, own and operate a 250-megawatt solar 
 plant in the Mojave Desert to be called the Beacon Solar Energy Project. 
 FPL expects to begin construction on the project late in 2009 and take 
 approximately two years to complete.   Why not in 
 Central PA, like near Harrisburg? Maybe because it would make 
 absolutely no sense???? 

 Crude spikes, following smaller 
 than expected build in DOE inventories, up $3 to $104.22; DOE 
 Inventories: Crude shows smaller than expected build for second straight 
 week Dept of Energy reports that crude oil inventories had a 
 build of 88K   (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 1800K); gasoline inventories had a draw of 3285K (Bloomberg consensus was a 
 draw of 1500K); distillate inventories had a draw 2141K 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 1750K). 

 Anybody else tired of the new ESCO sales pitches using 
 GHG and/or sustainability? Saving energy will cut greenhouse gas 
 emissions. No kidding? Wow. Sign me up. Cost 
 doesn&apos;t matter! Not. It&apos;s amazing how they continue to 
 pitch as if you can&apos;t figure out that less energy = less GHG. Duh. Or what, you don&apos;t know where every single molecule is used? Well, 
 yes we do. And in the end, oh by the way, we work with this 
 company called Johnson Controls...   Really? What do 
 they do?! 

 03/25/08:  Crude makes lows of the session 
 at $99.35, now off $1.44 to $99.42.  Boone Pickens, on CNBC, 
 says he believes in the second half of the year we will see oil above 
 $100; says he is pretty bullish on nat gas. 

 Jim Rogers, CEO of Duke Energy; from Forbes: he is 
 hoping to add a few nuclear plants to existing sites while he waits for 
 more affordable technologies to remove the 100 million tons or so of CO2 
 (27 million tons of carbon) his power plants send up the stack each 
 year. &quot;How can I change my business model to make money in a 
 low-carbon world?...Carbon is going to drive consolidation (of 
 utilities).&quot; 

 03/24/08: Great minds think alike?  Citigroup says that powerful 
 performance in commodities over the last couple of years raises the 
 plausibility that aggressive assumptions have further driven up prices 
 that appear to be on the verge of correcting meaningfully ; 
 moreover, industries such as related resource extraction equipment and 
 engineering services also face downward revaluation potential. Firm 
 thinks the notion of unwinding&quot;crowded trades&quot;could make the decline 
 sharper than probably is justified. In other words, patience. Stay nimble and don&apos;t lock prices...yet. 

 03/20/08:  Here&apos;s a pretty good summation of the&quot;credit crisis&quot;facing our economy .  Keyword: leverage. If someone could regulate the futures contracts by 
 simply requiring more margin, then oil speculation would decline 
 significantly. As it stands, it&apos;s easy to control huge contracts 
 with 5-10% down; your gain is magnified by what you have at risk...as is 
 your loss...which is why Wall Street will keep the balls in the air as 
 long as possible. They&apos;re not making any money in real estate! 

 03/17/08:  Wow. I&apos;m reminded of an old 
 saying: Don&apos;t fight the Fed. But it&apos;s a real, knock-down, 
 drag-out fight right now. Banks will be forced to cut dividends to 
 preserve capital which will drive their stock prices even lower. Greed won this round and fear is now running rampant. Given that 
 the fuel markets are married to the US dollar, it&apos;s not a pretty 
 picture. Cash is king. As I&apos;ve said, let speculators choke 
 on their contracts while supply and demand return to balance. 

 Oh look, Apr crude oil ($106.71 -3.50) is seeing aggressive profit-taking this morning (low of $105.50) on worries 
 the U.S. economic slowdown could lead to reduced energy demand. Apr 
 natural gas ($9.614 -0.254) is following suit, plunging from an 
 overnight high of $10.103 to as low as $9.563 in morning trade. Also, 
 short-term weather forecasts call for above normal temps in most regions 
 of the U.S.  

 Look at that heating oil ($/mmBTU) chart ...and this in MARCH??? Total 
 financial speculation/manipulation. 

 03/13/08:  Everybody up to speed on ZigBee ? PPL is hot on this technology...Here is Wikipedia summary . 

 Crude touches $111pbl, now up 80 
 cents to $110.72.   

 With electricity demand projected 
 to grow at twice the rate of new electricity generation over the next 
 decade, the investor-owned utility industry is facing critical decisions 
 on new generating capacity, says Moody&apos;s Investors Service in a new 
 report. Pending carbon control legislation and changing renewable 
 portfolio standards will have a significant influence on the industry&apos;s 
 overall generation mix. &quot;These resource decisions will entail 
 substantial capital costs and have long-lasting repercussions on a 
 utility&apos;s generating mix, fuel costs, and competitive position,&quot;says 
 Moody&apos;s Vice-President Michael Haggarty. New coal plants, which were 
 expected to provide a significant portion of the industry&apos;s new 
 generating needs over the near term, are facing both public opposition 
 and uncertainty relating to carbon and other greenhouse gas emission 
 costs, says Moody&apos;s. &quot; The 
 most immediate impact of an inability to add significant coal generation 
 will be an increased reliance on natural gas ,&quot; says Haggarty. This reliance on 
 natural gas as a fuel source is likely to reduce fuel diversity 
 and increase fuel cost volatility at some utilities, he explains. 

 03/12/08: Just what is inflation? E xample: Pilgrim&apos;s Pride to close chicken processing complex and six distribution 
 centers...&quot;The cost burden is already enormous, and it&apos;s growing even 
 larger. Based on current commodity futures markets, our company&apos;s 
 total costs for corn and soybean meal to feed our flocks in fiscal 2008 would be more than $1.3 bln higher than what they were two years ago. We 
 simply must find ways to pass along these higher costs...&quot; 

 WSJ reports diesel has followed 
 the petroleum surge, ending yesterday at $3.82 a gallon, based on govt 
 data. Much as gasoline has pressured consumers, diesel is pressuring 
 businesses that depend on the fuel. But some in the refining industry 
 see an opportunity. Their bet: Diesel is poised to take off. While 
 skyrocketing prices have weakened demand for gasoline in recent months, 
 global diesel demand has been growing. Some analysts expect 
 continued strong diesel-demand growth. In Europe, diesel will continue 
 gaining mkt share at the expense of gasoline as consumers switch to 
 diesel-powered cars. Developing countries such as China and India are 
 consuming more energy. Those countries often prefer diesel over gasoline 
 because of its flexibility: the fuel can be used to power industrial 
 plants as well as transportation. In the U.S., demand is expected to 
 grow as car manufacturers introduce more diesel-powered cars . If 
 U.S. consumers take to diesel, that would put them in line with drivers 
 in place like Europe. As the current price dynamic for diesel and 
 gasoline shows, that can be a mixed blessing. Because many refineries 
 outside the U.S. are set up to produce more diesel, increasing U.S. 
 reliance on that fuel means the U.S. would have more sources. But those 
 refineries are also feeding demand at home. As demand for diesel grows 
 elsewhere in the world, consumers could increasingly find themselves in 
 a tug of war over supplies -- a dynamic that is contributing to higher 
 diesel prices today... 

 Electricity Update: Yikes! All day meeting 
 with top PPL execs yesterday at Air Products.  Nothing will stop the D train.  You will soon see a brand new account rep from PPL Utilities. They 
 continue to tout real time pricing and demand response as the only 
 logical alternatives to fixed prices which they think will be skewed 
 very high to compensate for so many unknowns.  2007 PJM average wholesale price 
 of electricity = $70.98/mWh.  PJM soon will drop the hammer 
 on Energy Connect and others who have attempted to&quot;game&quot;the demand 
 response project. The Competitive Bridge Plan - 2010 is the name 
 of the plan for 1/1/2010... PL 
 will offer you both hourly price service and fixed price service (FPS). There will be a single solicitation in 10/2009 for FPS. Interested 
 customers required to express interest in FPS prior to solicitation. After price is established, you have 30 days to elect FPS option.  Lots of noise in the State House, but little worthy of realistic impact. 

 03/10/08:  NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM: Goldman sees $200 oil- CNBC ... you don&apos;t become the wealthiest 
 of the wealthy without having some pretty savvy financial types on your 
 staff...let&apos;s hope it was a 10 year prediction. 

 Anybody else notice that the 
 price of #6 has not confirmed these new highs in crude? (see the 
 $/mmBTU chart) Yet heating oil is in the stratosphere? Clearly 
 natural gas is playing follow-the-leader. The only good news is 
 that just like stock prices, speculation results in a rapid price 
 decline while the ascent is slow and steady. I see a blow-off top 
 in light oil coming soon. I think heavy oil is already turning. Let&apos;s see how this pans out... 

 Understatement of the year:  U.S. Treasury&apos;s 
 Ryan says recent financial turbulence underscores need for robust risk 
 management - Reuters.  Ya think? 

 03/07/08:  Welcome to the area between a 
 rock and a hard place:  Crude oil spikes to session highs at $106.31pbl, now up 54 cents 
 to $106.04pbl. And this in the face of an imploding stock market 
 and 4.3% inflation. It&apos;s not a pretty picture... 

 I hope everyone realizes that PPL sold the gas business 
 to UGI because the profits from manipulating power prices dwarf anything 
 from the old staid regulated gas business? Why deal with regulated 
 rates when you can look at 5-minute LMP pricing and make a killing? Free markets vs. regulation...hmmmm.... 

 This is surreal: White House&apos;s Lazear says 
 concerned about U.S. economy, believes Q1 will be weakest quarter - 
 Reuters Lazear says says expects strong growth by summer after 
 stimulus package kicks in...Do our politicos think we&apos;re stupid??? Um, can you tell me how a $1000 check is going to help with $4 gas, 4.3% 
 inflation, and 15-30% housing price&quot;corrections&quot;? Mortgage rates 
 are not that complicated...just add the rate of inflation to the yield 
 on the 10 year Treasury bond. They&apos;re gonna have to cut interest 
 rates to 1% to get mortgages&lt;5%. 

 03/06/08: Horrible news:  UGI 
 Corporation announced that its subsidiary, UGI Utilities, Inc., has 
 signed a definitive agreement to acquire the stock of PPL Gas Utilities 
 Corporation (PPL Gas), the natural gas utility and retail propane 
 distributor of PPL Corporation for approximately $268 million plus 
 working capital. PPL Gas will add approximately 76,000 customers to 
 UGI&apos;s current utility operations in Pennsylvania. PPL Gas serves natural 
 gas to customers in 35 counties in eastern and central Pennsylvania and 
 one county in Maryland. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Penn Fuel 
 Propane, LLC (Penn Fuel), PPL Gas sells approximately 15 million gallons 
 of propane annually to 33,000 customers in eastern Pennsylvania.  PPL was a decent gas utility...by the book, fair, customer-oriented. When I worked at PPL, the thought was for THEM to buy UGI and 
 consolidate energy supply in PA. 

 03/05/08: Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson said the record run in oil prices is related more to speculation and a 
 weakening dollar than supply and demand in the market.&quot;It&apos;s pretty 
 crazy,&quot;Tillerson said at a press conference at the New York Stock 
 Exchange after oil hit a fresh 
 record of $104.56 a barrel . A weak dollar accounts for about a 
 third of the recent record run in oil prices, another third on 
 geopolitical uncertainty and the rest on market speculation, he said. 
 Despite the concerns about political instability hurting oil supply, 
 history suggests that supply disruptions are actually quite rare, he 
 said.&quot;In terms of fundamentals, fear of supply reliability is 
 overblown,&quot;he said. None of Exxon&apos;s energy development projects are 
 based on $100 a barrel oil, he said. 

 03/04/08:  Anybody see the PPL website 
 lately?  This ad insults you. 

 EIA projects &apos;real-world crude&apos; at $57/bbl in 2016. That really helps when we have daily new highs. Remember what I 
 said about past predictions? They&apos;re not worth the pixels that 
 display them. 

 03/03/08:  Crude sets new record high, now 
 +1.60 at $103.44 ...This pretty much sums up our biggest 
 problem today:  Oppenheimer says a production cut by OPEC could 
 spike oil prices, induce a recession, and fuel inflation, which would 
 curtail demand and ( then, i.e. months later) trigger a selloff in 
 oil futures by speculators that could sink oil prices. However, by not 
 cutting production in response to the weak demand, OPEC risks an oil 
 glut and sharply lower prices. Firm believes oil prices are inflated by 
 speculation, as reflected by the 50% price rise in six months without 
 changes in supply or demand. However, given the government 
 inability, or unwillingness, to regulate the energy markets, don&apos;t 
 expect the oil price bubble to burst anytime soon. Deregulation = free market theory = capitalism = profits. The hardest part of 
 the free markets theory is the fact that energy isn&apos;t a cell phone or a 
 car or toilet paper. It&apos;s not discretionary , unless 
 you believe the business folks who will argue that you can consume less 
 power or turn off the heat. Can you say between a rock and a hard 
 place? The stock market continues to tank, interest rates are 
 below 3% and oil makes new highs each and every day. Welcome to 
 the free market. What will it take to end this action?  

 02/25/08:  We have an important data point 
 to note today...current nat gas prices have run up to meet the futures 
 prices. In other words, the futures market is not assigning a 
 premium price to supply one year forward, BUT, the price trend is UP, 
 which is not good. All of this pricing pressure is flying in the 
 face of an impending recession...or so the stock market is predicting. All I know is that the last runup in housing prices (1983-87) took 
 nearly a decade to resolve and this one will probably follow the same 
 track due to inflation. Big $ smells big $ in commodities, which 
 is not helping us...it all contributes to inflation and the FED can&apos;t 
 help with lower interest rates. 

 02/23/08:  Here&apos;s a decent wind story . T 
 Boone wants to build a 4,000 MW wind farm on his 150,000 acre ranch. And someone will pay him $16M per year just for the space. Nice. BTW, PPL makes about 10,000 MW (of fossil/nuke) here in PA. A big 
 keyword in all of this is subsidy. 

 02/21/08:  Another APPA broadast email sales 
 pitch is making the rounds. My response to www.celeron.com is that they do 
 what I do for people who don&apos;t have a me. If you can get their 
 service for less than $2000 per year, you should sign up. In fact, 
 I&apos;d like to see one LVAIC sign up and let me audit what is done over the 
 next FY. That would be the best way for all of us to learn. You should recognize that Philly-area schools already face much higher 
 embedded utility costs and the big sales brochure highlights Immaculata 
 with a whopping 13 buildings....nearly the same size as Central Moravian 
 Church in Bethlehem! Note, their pitch says no existing consulting 
 agreements need to be terminated. 

 Oil investor T. 
 Boone Pickens said on Thursday he has a short position on oil and 
 natural gas on expectations that prices will fall in the near term . 
 Pickens, speaking on CNBC television, said he expects the price of oil 
 to fall $10 to $15 a barrel in the second quarter from the $100 it hit 
 on the U.S. market this week. But he said he expects the price of oil to 
 be back above $100 a barrel in the second half of year. 

 02/20/08:  I&apos;ve tried to avoid the herd with 
 respect to the latest pop in oil.   The AP reports that oil 
 prices retreated Wednesday after 
 closing above $100 a barrel for the first time as investors seized on a refinery explosion and the possibility that 
 OPEC may cut its output. Many recent forecasts have said demand for oil 
 this year will be less than initially expected -yet prices continue to 
 rise. That suggests oil may continue its climb as the weakening 
 dollar attracts new investors to the futures market. Forget supply and demand and fundamentals...it&apos;s all a financial shell 
 game right now. 

 FT reports that the biodiesel industry is anticipating a round of consolidation in the 
 next 18 months , key industry executives and financiers told 
 mergermarket. After an initial flurry of investment in biodiesel 
 startups, many new companies in the sector are now unable to secure 
 adequate financing. Plant closings, consolidation and an industry 
 shakeout, coupled with the possibility of buyouts by&quot;vulture funds,&quot;may proceed, said James Eiler of Eiler Capital at the recent Biodiesel 
 Finance&amp;Investment Summit in New York. Daniel Oh, CEO of Renewable 
 Energy Group, said smaller plants could benefit from mergers to create 
 economies of scale. Biodiesel plants producing from 20m to 30m gallons 
 per year will be hit the hardest, as they have neither the economies of 
 scale of very large facilities nor the local contacts of smaller plants, 
 said Chris Sorrells of NGP Energy Partners. He said he believes these 
 plants may gain the most from mergers. Some of the larger and more 
 established companies like REG, which has approximately 27% market 
 share, may drive consolidation of these midsized plants, Oh said. 
 Smaller producers like Tri-State Biodiesel acknowledged the challenges 
 facing the industry, and could consider a merger with its joint venture 
 partner Connecticut Biofuels, this news service previously reported. 

 02/13/08:  Here&apos;s a decent 
 article on the challenges facing Exelon (PECO) from their CEO. He talks about carbon trading, among other topics. Its 
 title is catchy...Carbon, Competition, and Kilowatts. 

 02/12/08:  This would be funny if it weren&apos;t 
 so serious...can you say full court press? Yep, PPL with their record 
 projected profits actually pulled the Enron/California story out of the 
 closet to vehemently oppose a rate cap extension. 

 02/08/08:  Bloomberg.com reports that OPEC 
 may cut crude production when it meets next month to keep the price 
 above $80 a barrel , oil ministry officials from four of the 
 group&apos;s nations said. OPEC would trim output if prices slip to $80, 
 according to one delegate, while another said $70 would be unacceptable to 
 most members. Two of the four officials, who all asked not to be 
 identified because such discussions are private, said if prices stay 
 above $85 the group probably won&apos;t change supplies at its next 
 conference on March 5. The combination of falling crude prices and the 
 dollar&apos;s 12 percent drop in the past year on a trade-weighted basis puts 
 pressure on OPEC&apos;s 13 members to reduce supplies as slowing economies in 
 the U.S. and Europe threaten energy demand. Oil fell 30% and the group 
 reduced production quotas three times in 2001, the year of the last U.S. 
 recession. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi, who sets policy for 
 OPEC&apos;s largest producer, declined to comment to reporters on prices or 
 production levels at last week&apos;s meeting. Al-Naimi said only that the 
 outlook for supply and demand is&quot;sound&quot;. 

 Here we go again...now biofuels are bad . 

 02/06/08: Is the green movement about the 
 environment or green, as in money?  Although it has not yet 
 ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the U.S. would be the key market for carbon 
 offsets, and CCX aims to become the established exchange. It currently 
 allows companies to prepare for ratification, and gain&quot;green&quot;credibility, by 
 buying credits to offset their pollution on a voluntary basis. 

 02/05/08:  NY Times reports stymied in their 
 plans to build coal-burning power plants, American utilities are turning 
 to natural gas to meet expected growth in demand, risking a new upward 
 spiral in the price of that fuel . Utility executives say they 
 have little choice. With opposition to coal plants rising across the 
 country—including a statement by three investment banks Monday saying 
 they are wary of financing new ones—the executives see plants fired by 
 natural gas as the only kind that can be constructed quickly and can 
 supply reliable power day and night. But North American supplies of 
 natural gas will be flat or declining in coming years , according 
 to the Energy Information Administration. The United States already has 
 high natural gas prices, a problem for homeowners and many industries, 
 like chemical and fertilizer producers. Some experts fear a boom in gas 
 demand for electricity generation will send prices even higher... Now, 
 with many coal plants being canceled and demand for electricity rising 
 by 2% or so a year, the prospect is that utilities will be forced to 
 build and use a new generation of gas-fired plants regardless of the 
 operating cost—and consumers will bear the burden of higher 
 electricity rates. 

 Here are two 
 very timely articles from the January issue of OilHeating, a trade 
 publication. 

 01/31/08:  Forget about the Rendell/Boscola gabfest from 
 today&apos;s Morning Call . Here&apos;s all you need to know about PPL: Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.60 per share, excluding non-recurring 
 items, $0.05 better than the First Call consensus of $0.55; revenues 
 rose 5.2% year/year to $1.61 bln vs the $1.84 bln consensus. Co reaffirms guidance for FY08 , 
 sees EPS of $2.35-2.45. Co 
 reaffirms Y10 EPS of $4.00-4.60.  Anyone still wonder why 
 they&apos;re&quot; vehemently opposed &quot;to any change in deregulation? They cry bankruptcy if the train is stalled while crowing about a 
 DOUBLING of expected earnings...that double is coming from our pockets. 

 OPEC will not change oil output ceiling at Friday 
 meeting, according to Senior Gulf OPEC delegate -Reuters 

 01/28/08:  OPEC on Monday described 
 speculation as the&quot;principal driving force&quot;behind rising oil prices 
 and volatility, calling for something to be done about its&quot;damaging 
 hold&quot;on world oil markets. The main message from OPEC  has been that oil markets are adequately 
 supplied with crude and that there is no need for an output increase.  Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said over the 
 weekend that his country supports an OPEC-like cartel for natural gas. Venezuela&apos;s President, Hugo Chavez, said he hopes oil prices stabilize 
 and do not rise above $100pbl (this is interesting because Chavez is 
 typically a crude bull). Once again, another OPEC member (this time 
 Iran) says OPEC is unlikely to boost output when the cartel meets on Feb 
 1. 

 01/25/08:  Clearly the suppliers are unhappy 
 with lower prices:  Venezuela Oil Min: OPEC must resist pressures to up output - DJ 

 Why should electricity, a necessary commodity for daily 
 life, be deregulated? Here&apos;s an example of how a power outage in S 
 Africa is forcing WORLD prices higher: Gold and platinum prices 
 surged to new record highs today after a shortage of electricity in 
 South Africa forced mining companies there to shut production . 
 State-owned power utility Eskom has asked platinum and gold mines to cut 
 electricity use for the next 2 to 4 weeks. This is having a big impact 
 on prices because South Africa is the world&apos;s largest gold producer and 
 holds the world&apos;s largest platinum group metals resource. As such, 
 today&apos;s news pushed gold and platinum prices up sharply, with gold 
 moving above $924 and platinum setting new record highs at $1680... 
 While the supply disruption is sending metals prices higher, the 
 producers affected by the production stoppage are under pressure today. 

 Off topic... here&apos;s 
 a gem that shows how the left hand doesn&apos;t know what the right is doing . Congrats to the editors of Risk Magazine. You&apos;d be at the top of 
 my reading list. 

 01/23/08:  Rocket scientist award: US 
 Energy Sec Bodman says high oil prices starting to affect economic 
 growth - Bloomberg   Ya think??? 

 Evidence that we&apos;re closer to a bottom than a top. First we have this chart/opinion from today&apos;s NY Times . Then we have Steve asking 
 me about the&quot;markets&quot;...geez, we&apos;re already down 20% on the Russell 
 3000...why would you sell now? It&apos;s a time to buy. You don&apos;t 
 fight the Fed. And then there&apos;s the typical Morning Call&quot;day late 
 and a dollar short&quot;front page. Umm, guys, where were you when the 
 Russell dropped below 900? Markets never put in&quot;V&quot;bottoms...they 
 flounder around while the media calls for Armageddon and gold soars. Look how quickly oil has backed off the highs...down from $100 to $85 in 
 weeks. I&apos;ve said it before...banks will have to lead the way out 
 of this mess because they&apos;re the guys who started it by inflating real 
 estate to sell mortgages. And let&apos;s not forget that markets are 
 discounting mechanisms...today&apos;s slowdown was predicted in 
 November...remember the old saw...the stock market has predicted 10 of 
 the last 5 recessions!  

 I mention all of this because if oil breaks $80 on the 
 downside, it&apos;s time to think about locking NEXT WINTER&apos;S HEATING OIL. 

 Dow Chemical CEO says not experiencing recession in U.S. but 2008 will be slower; believes oil prices have peaked, 
 budgeting for average around $80 on 2008 - Reuters 

   India&apos;s 
 top oil official says major U.S. recession could cause oil prices to 
 tumble to $70 a barrel - Reuters 

 01/22/08:  Goldman Sachs said if all 
 speculative length were liquidated on the oil markets, prices could drop 
 to the low $80s , but fundamentals of supply and demand would 
 probably prevent funds from selling out completely. Fundamentals 
 continue to show little sign of weakness and suggest that the recent 
 sell-off is overdone,&quot;Goldman Sachs wrote in a note. ( Oil fell 
 to $86/bbl this AM; given the turmoil in the markets, this is still not 
 great news...the world economies are contracting and low $80s is the 
 best to expect???)  The Mike T Rule: prices usually go 
 higher than expected. The Corollary to the Mike T Rule: prices usually go lower than expected. 

 01/21/08:  Another caveat on 
 biodiesel from a generator sales&amp;service company. I agree 
 with this one...I wouldn&apos;t recommend filling your tank and forgetting 
 about it. The stuff we&apos;re burning is real time and we don&apos;t 
 maintain an inventory. 

 01/19/08:  Here&apos;s a story about the other side of 
 biodiesel. 

 01/17/08:  This story sticks in my 
 mind. Who really cares if we need to add $6000 to the cost of a 
 new car if we can start whittling down on our fuel binge? I&apos;ve got 
 to note that Detroit hasn&apos;t done a whole lot to lead us out of the woods 
 on this issue. 

 Duquesne picks up their toys and leaves PJM . More evidence of how skewed power prices have become in Pennsylvania. It pains me to think about a 40% price gouge on top of an impending 
 recession. Doesn&apos;t matter to the PPL shareholders, though. They&apos;ll make a ton of dough from our budgets. But how many 
 businesses will follow the Duquesne lead and just leave PA? One 
 has to ponder the&quot;Law of Unintended Consequences&quot;. Oh, but don&apos;t 
 forget, deregulation was sold as the path to LOWER prices for the 
 consumer. 

 01/16/08:  Geez, crash the stock market and 
 look what happens: The E.I.A. reports that crude oil inventories 
 had a build of 4259K (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 1250K); 
 gasoline inventories had a build of 2193K(Bloomberg consensus was a 
 build of 2500K); distillate inventories had a build of 1152k Bloomberg 
 consensus was 1250K ). And suddenly we&apos;re back to $90/bbl. The DUG, an ETF that is short the oil market, is flying higher, 
 predicting lower crude numbers. 

 OPEC Pres Khelil says oil prices will probably remain 
 between $80-90/bbl in Q1. 

 01/08/08: Here&apos;s a noteworthy piece from one of 
 those guys&quot;playing&quot;the oil market. 

 Here&apos;s a wakeup call from one of the 
 biggest money managers in the world:  Highlights from Bill 
 Gross&apos; January investment outlook, which likens the current financial 
 system to that of a pyramid scheme :&quot;Total derivatives amount to over 
 $500 trillion, many of them finding their way onto the balance sheets of SIVs, CDOs and other conduits of their ilk comprising the 
 Frankensteinian levered body of shadow banks... While the exact amount 
 of reserves supporting the Bank of Shadows is undeterminable, let&apos;s go 
 back to the $45 trillion BIS estimate of outstanding CDS for more 
 insight. If total investment grade and junk bond defaults approach 
 historical norms of 1.25% in 2008 (Moody&apos;s and S&amp;P forecast something 
 close) then $500 bln of these default contracts will be triggered resulting in losses of $250 bln or more to the&quot;protection selling&quot;party once recoveries are inserted into the equation . To put that 
 number in perspective, many street estimates ascribe similar losses to 
 subprime mortgages, a derivative category substantially distinct from 
 CDS insurance... Pyramid schemes and chain letters collapse because 
 there is no more credit to feed them. As the system of modern day 
 levered shadow finance slows to a crawl, or even contracts at the edges, 
 its ability to systemically fertilize economic growth must be called 
 into question . And as the private shadow banks of the 21st century are 
 found wanting, so then must public finance in the form of lower interest 
 rates and increasing fiscal deficits fill the breach. The Fed will 
 likely reduce Fed funds to 3% by midyear 2008 . Congress and the 
 Administration should, but likely won&apos;t, join hands in a tax relief 
 program that benefits low income homeowners.&quot; 

 I mention this against the backdrop of an impending 
 recession and what it will do for energy prices. High energy 
 prices stimulate research into alternatives.  

 01/07/08:  Bloomberg.com reports the 
 fastest-growing bet in the oil market these days is that the price of 
 crude will double to $200 a barrel by the end of the year . 
 Options to buy oil for $200 on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 
 10-fold in the past two months to 5,533 contracts, a record increase for 
 any similar period. The contracts, the cheapest way to speculate in 
 energy markets, appreciated 36% since early December as crude futures 
 reached a record $100.09 on Jan 3. While analysts at Merrill Lynch and 
 UBS say the slowing U.S. economy will lead to the biggest drop in prices 
 since 2001, the options show some traders expect oil to rise for a 
 seventh straight year. 

 01/04/08:  Happy New Year! Not. The USA is really between a rock and a hard place right now. We 
 continue to consume crude without any conservation while the stock 
 market sinks because the collective wisdom of millions has finally come 
 alive and recognized that energy MUST be factored into pricing somewhere 
 along the line. You can justify&quot;ex-energy&quot;all you like, but 
 prices are rising and that is known as inflation. And all of this 
 is happening in a macro environment where banks (the source of capital 
 for growth) have become risk-averse, as in no more lending. Umm, 
 if you don&apos;t lend, how do you make $? It never ceases to amaze me 
 how this subprime thing has blown up into no credit for anyone at any 
 cost. Banks will have to lead the way out of this mess. 

 Here&apos;s why 
 natural gas prices are stable : Working gas in storage was 
 2,921 Bcf as of Friday, Dec 28, 2007, according to EIA estimates. This 
 represents a net decline of 87 Bcf from the previous week. Stocks were 
 160 Bcf less than last year at this time and 222 Bcf above the 5-yr avg of 2,699 Bcf. In the East 
 Region, stocks were 52 Bcf above the 5-yr avg following net 
 withdrawals of 53 Bcf. At 2,921 Bcf, total working gas is within the 5-yr historical range .  It&apos;s all about inventory and historical averages...as long as we&apos;re 
 above those averages, prices will be stable. 

 01/02/08:  Kudos to T Boone...we finally hit 
 the $100 target. I had CNBC on in the background this AM...how 
 people can listen to this dribble all day is beyond me. The only 
 clear point to me is that prices are beyond our control. Talking 
 heads think a recession cuts demand, but India and China still 
 increasing. Blah, blah, blah...it&apos;s sad that some folks think we 
 should tap the&quot;strategic reserve&quot;. &quot;Biggest point drop in DOW 
 since 1932!&quot; Umm, in percentage terms, it&apos;s really not that big a 
 deal. Why hype it? 

 12/29/07: Here&apos;s an interesting news blip:  Westar Energy receives order on rate treatment for proposed 
 investment in wind energy. The Kansas Corporation Commission 
 issued its order on WR&apos;s request for the commission to determine the rate treatment for 
 its proposed investment in wind energy . While finding the 
 utility&apos;s proposal to invest in 
 wind energy prudent , the order declined to approve WR&apos;s request 
 for an incentive rate of return allowed by Kansas law. The order also 
 indicated that in the future wind generation could be subject to 
 undefined operating standards and potential financial penalties that 
 have not been imposed on other forms of generation. Co will proceed with 
 295 MW of wind power but suspends plans for second phase.  Wind 
 is viable, but should ratepayers be forced to pay more? Kansas says NO. 

 12/19/07: PA DEP has approved Lehigh&apos;s 
 request to modify our Title V permit to burn up to 2.5 MG of B-tane, 
 or biodiesel, as an alternate to #6 fuel oil. You need to burn 13% 
 more of this fuel to match the heating value of #6, but it has no sulfur 
 nor ash.  Note, it&apos;s now on the chart to the left of this 
 column. 

 Yesterday evening the House approved an energy bill, 
 which includes a renewable fuels standard (RFS) of which 15 bln gallons 
 comes from corn. A little 
 earlier today, President Bush signed the energy bill (called Energy 
 Independence and Security Act of 2007) and put it into law , which 
 is bullish for ethanol, farm equipment manufacturers, and fertilizer 
 stocks. Due to additional demand for corn, and with March corn closing 
 at $4.32 per bushel yesterday, the livestock sector will likely see 
 thinner margins as a result, and their stocks will likely suffer. 
 Provisions in the bill includes 9 bln gallons of renewable fuels in 
 2008. This will progressively increase to 36 bln gallons required by 
 2022, which a lso including a 
 one-billion-gallon mandate for biodiesel. Additionally, the bill 
 includes increases in the corporate average fuel economy standards to 35 
 miles per gallon by 2020. National Corn Growers Association leaders say 
 they are hopeful the President will sign the bill into law by Christmas.  Farmers and subsidies win again. 

 12/18/07:  I wish gas procurement was as 
 simple as this blurb 
 from Michigan . The questions are applicable to us. 

 Here&apos;s a blast from the past...remember when PPL did an annual bill 
 review to make sure you were on the most advantageous rate?  

 12/14/07:  I don&apos;t want to insult the author 
 of this op-ed piece in the Morning 
 Call, but there is little to no substance in this verbiage. I 
 dislike authors who parrot the utility fallback of&quot;oil and gas prices 
 have gone up&quot;or&quot;coal is up 150%&quot;. While technically true, these 
 numbers all flow into what is known as the cost of system generation . In other words, the market clearing, or wholesale price of a kwhr of 
 electricity. If PPL can make record profits today while still 
 under regulated rates, what does that tell you? In the old days, 
 the revenue requirement = operating cost + taxes + depreciation + (a 
 fair rate of return) * rate base. Now that the operating cost is 
 in the free market, anyone and everyone in a higher priced environment 
 (New England, for example) is going to gladly bid the cost up because 
 it&apos;s lower than their own cost. The #1 question our politicians 
 need to ask PPL is: What is your cost of system generation? The whole company! Not the oil or gas units because PPL is 
 primarily nuclear and coal. And given that coal is about 
 $2.19/mmBTU (and 33% efficient), how is it that your cheapest power rate 
 is $17.58/mmBTU while the cost to generate it is about $7? 

 12/13/07: This is why our Congress gets no 
 respect:  The U.S. Senate blocked the energy bill passed last 
 weekend by the house. The vote was 59-40, one short of the 60 need to 
 overcome Republican objections and move to a final vote. The main 
 sticking point was a $22 bln tax package that would essentially tax big 
 oil companies $10 bln over 10 years and redirect tax incentives . 
 The money would be earmarked for solar, wind, and nuclear. Speaker 
 Pelosi has come back saying that the bill would go under a second vote 
 today, with the tax provision removed, an obvious negative for solar, 
 wind, nuclear, etc. The Dems already dropped a requirement that investor 
 owned utilities get 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2020. 
 This would mark the second defeat for the Democrats and alternative 
 energies. The second vote is expected today and while in the past 
 President Bush has called the bill dead on arrival, these revisions may 
 make it more palatable for him to pass. Under its current watered down 
 version the passing of the bill would be seen as a victory of big oil 
 and utilities. Conversely, the losers are consumers. Status quo ain&apos;t helping get oil&lt;$100/bbl. 

 12/11/07: How fragile is this market???  Yesterday, crude oil surged in early morning trade on word a
Houston shipping channel closed due to severe fog. The rally was 
 short-lived, however, following reports the fog was lifting. But this 
 morning, Bloomberg is reporting that the Houston shipping channel has 58 
 incoming and 14 outgoing ships delayed. Jan crude oil is up 1.04 to 
 $88.90pbl (range overnight is $87.92 to $88.97).  I mean, come 
 on, there is fog in Houston and that is the excuse du jour to goose 
 prices? This is clearly not encouraging...like dancing on a 
 knife&apos;s edge. 

 12/10/07: Politics again:  WSJ reports 
 the Senate will try to modify the big energy bill passed by the House to 
 draw enough Republican support by next week to overcome a filibuster 
 threat. The most likely candidate to be jettisoned from the bill is a 
 requirement that utilities generate 15% of their electricity from wind, 
 solar and other&quot;renewable&quot;energy sources. Removing the 
 renewable-fuels mandate for utilities may not be the end of the 
 political and procedural snarl... The bill the House passed Thursday 
 failed its first test in the Senate Friday when Majority Leader Harry 
 Reid of Nevada requested a vote to close debate. The 53-42 vote fell 
 short of the 60 needed, and the five senators who didn&apos;t vote are 
 Republicans. Republican senators, emphasizing President Bush&apos;s veto 
 threat, said the measure&apos;s $ 21 
 bln tax package will have to be modified or removed before Mr. 
 Reid can get past the 60-vote hurdle. The Democratic leader still hopes 
 to save some of the tax provisions, which include incentives for 
 investment in the production of renewable energy. For comparison sake, 
 take a look at this graph .  

 Republican or Democrat, this story rings true. Houston, we have a problem. We dare not tax our beloved oil 
 companies, even though the tax could be structured to R&amp;D alternative 
 energy. #6 oil has nearly doubled in one year. Thank you 
 sir, may I have another? And the car ads on TV continuously spew highway MPG numbers that are essentially unattainable in real 
 life. Something&apos;s gotta give... 

 12/5/07:  Oil will hit $100 a barrel 
 within 6 months, Boone Pickens says- Bloomberg    Gee, pretty safe bet now, eh? 

 Do analysts matter?  The 
 E.I.A. reports that crude oil inventories had a draw of 7913K barrels (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 1250K barrels); gasoline 
 inventories had build a of 3995K (Bloomberg consensus is a 
 draw of 300K); distillate inventories had a build of 1428K (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 620K).  I mean, what are they 
 looking at? Not even close... Crude Oil jumps following data, 
 currently at 89.55 up $1.23...1 hour later: Crude Oil Futures fall 2% 
 off off morning peak . 

 11/28/07:  Gee, what happens when high 
 prices start to impact the consumer?  Crude now under $92pbl, 
 currently $91.98pbl, down $2.44.  EIA stats show significant 
 demand reduction. Combine this with all of the anecdotal BS 
 stories about wood, alternative fuels, and a Saudi statement of a 500K 
 bpd increase in output and you have speculators on the run. The 
 simple truth: investors load up on oil futures based on T Boone&apos;s 
 $100 target...we touch, but fail to run through that number...resistance 
 holds...lock your profits and run away...price drops. This is how 
 the game is played. 

 11/20/07:  Ugly. Crude oil move to 
 session highs, now +3.52 at 98.16, just below all-time high of 98.62 set 
 on 11/7. This in the face of an imploding stock market? This 
 is not a pretty macroeconomic picture. 

 11/15/07:  More misleading BS from the PPL 
 media machine. Folks, PPL is split into six different companies. Even if regulation led to bankruptcy for PPL Electric Utilities, the 
 balance of the machine would continue to grow and spit out profits. 

 11/13/07:  Crude-oil futures fell for a 
 second day on Tuesday, dropping more than $4 to $90.20 a barrel, the 
 lowest level in nearly three weeks, after the International Energy 
 Agency cut its estimate of global oil demand and a survey showed the 
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased crude production 
 in October. The contrarian in me sez that the media stories about 
 high heating oil prices are usually the top, after the fact. You&apos;ll note that futures are still indicating lower. Financial 
 manipulation can last only so long... 

 11/12/07:  Nigeria&apos;s oil minister, Odein 
 Ajumogobia, said oil prices near 
 $100pbl are excessive and oil may return to between $80 and $85 within a 
 month . This comment, coupled with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait saying 
 over the weekend that they will talk about raising output at the next 
 OPEC meeting, is likely to temporarily put the brakes on crude&apos;s upward 
 march (Shell&apos;s President, John Hofmeister, said this morning on CNBC 
 that oil prices are&quot;too high&quot;and says the U.S. should not touch the 
 SPR). OPEC will hold its third Summit Nov 11th through the 19th in 
 Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and will meet on Dec 5th in Abu Dhabi, 
 UAE. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva said this weekend 
 that the Tupi field discovery, which may hold reserves that could total 
 as much as 8 bln barrels of oil and natural gas, may lead Brazil to join 
 OPEC down the road. The Tupi field is the second-biggest field found in 
 the last 20 years. 

 This little blurb from PPL about adding motors contains a table that neatly 
 summarizes current rates. 

 11/8/07:  US Energy Sect says adding oil to 
 the SPR wont significantly affect price of oil. Says current oil price 
 suggests more supply need from OPEC, Non-OPEC producers. Declines to say 
 if $100 a barrel oil is inevitable, is &apos;very concerned&apos; about high 
 price. - Reuters   No kidding? Very concerned, 
 eh?                      

 11/5/07:  Wow. I had to adjust my 
 scales on the oil prices. My take? It can&apos;t continue at this 
 pace. Look at heating oil...we&apos;re in contango...futures are LOWER 
 than current. It&apos;s hard to say what deflates this bubble...P&gt;$100?...stocks correct?...weather? It&apos;s even harder to believe, 
 but the refiners can&apos;t seem to make any money despite record prices.  

 Natural gas is rising in sympathy with oil, not 
 because storage is down/depleted/dwindling. In other words, it&apos;s 
 rising because it can...it&apos;s a financial gain. 

 Lehigh has successfully burned waste vegetable oil as a 
 replacement for #6 oil. Score one for the sustainability/green 
 column. And no, the DEP didn&apos;t give us any grief. I&apos;m 
 working with the supplier to see if a refined product can replace home 
 heating oil. 

 11/2/07:  Sobering story on Texas 
 oil... 

 11/1/07:  Before you shed any tears for PPL 
 and their cry of bankruptcy if deregulation is stopped, note that Wall 
 Street firms are all tripping over themselves UPGRADING PPL stock this 
 morning...because they see nothing but profits ahead...profits coming 
 from your budgets. 

 Interesting: France releases 285,000 tons crude 
 from strategic stocks, according to govt - DJ. 

 10/30/07:  OPEC President says OPEC still 
 has spare capacity of 3.5 mln barrels per day. 

 What&apos;s the word for PPL&apos;s latest proposal ?  Chutzpah ? The train is 
 picking up speed... 

 10/29/07:  Wow! Take a look at those 
 $/MMBTU numbers on the chart. Obviously, that uptrend cannot 
 continue unchecked or we&apos;ll be at $4 heating oil next winter. Something&apos;s gotta give sooner or later...as I&apos;ve said, the traders see 
 $100/bbl...and then what? That&apos;s what I&apos;m watching.  

 Maybe it&apos;s just me, but these Morning Call stories are getting 
 wishy-washy. 

 I&apos;ve said it before and I&apos;ll say it again...oil prices 
 look like a hot stock chart...everyone is climbing aboard with the 
 expectation that the price rise is parabolic. Eventually economics 
 come into play...it&apos;s a game of timing.  

 10/22/07:  Great minds think alike?   Saudi Fin Min: Oil price not justified by demand - DJ 

 10/17/07:   The OPEC basket (a blend of 
 different crudes) rose to $80.82pbl (this is the first time it is above 
 $80). T. Boone Pickens says 
 within a year you will see $100pbl.  And then what??? 

 It&apos;s hard to watch the oil prices rise daily when this data is published...inventories are above 5-year averages...the only 
 anomaly is heating oil...it looks like refineries were late this year to 
 switch production...but the slope of the curve is encouraging. Unfortunately, price is based on a vote by the Turkish parliament, not 
 how much is in the tanks. 

 10/16/07:  OK, who knew that Turkey was 
 planning to invade northern Iraq?  

 10/15/07:  Swing and a miss . All technically true, but he doesn&apos;t mention 
 that two very high level execs at PJM were forced to retire after the 
 whistleblower came forward...and the issue remains LMP, or locational 
 marginal pricing. FERC rarely, if ever, intrudes upon States&apos; 
 rights. The PA legislature got this ball rolling and they&apos;re the 
 only ones who can apply the brakes. 

 Oil...now it&apos;s news that Turkey could invade Kurdistan. The geopolitical problems keep goosing traders who are just itching for 
 $100/bbl oil. And then what? What is that extra 25% hike in 
 the price going to accomplish? Energy conservation?  

 10/8/07:  Sad but true local reading...first 
 you get the PPL&quot; oops, sorry&quot;story 
 on the rate hike ...brought to you by Mr. I Only Report What I Hear. ( What have I been telling you all along??? ) Then PPL trots 
 out their Prez with the old&quot;bankruptcy if regulated&quot;BS. Umm, you 
 were around for 75 years under regulation...why would you go bankrupt if 
 you had to provide a fair price to the consumers of PA? Why does 
 EVERYTHING have to be about profit? Regulated monopolies earned a 
 fair profit for years and stayed in business...there is a reason for a regulated monopoly...the term&quot;economies of scale&quot;comes to mine. 

 Note the heating oil prices in the chart on the 
 left...winter premium disappeared. 

 10/3/07:  Venezuelan oil minister RafaeI 
 Ramirez said Tuesday he did not think OPEC needed to raise crude output 
 again at its next scheduled meeting in early December. Current high prices are not due 
 to any shortage of oiI , the minister told reporters on the 
 sidelines of a conference in Lisbon, adding that he thought crude prices were unlikely to 
 fall below a&quot;floor&quot;of $60/barreI . Asked if he thought OPEC, 
 which agreed last month to increase crude production by 500,000 b/d from 
 November 1, should raise output again in December, Ramirez said:&quot;No, we 
 believe not. We have to maintain the level that was decided in 
 September.&quot;Prices are currently high despite&quot;an increasing level of 
 production,&quot;he said, citing geopolitical tension and a lack of refining 
 capacity as factors supporting the market. In addition, he said,&quot;we 
 think the market has changed structurally. We will never again have oil at 
 $28; $60 is the floor.&quot; 

 10/1/07:  Nothing good to report on the 
 coming electric rate increase. The current PJM wholesale price 
 average is $64.74/MWHR.  Do the math. Lehigh&apos;s current 
 LP5 regulated cost is $60. Wholesale prices have TRIPLED since 
 1998 (right after deregulation became reality). 

 9/24/07:  It&apos;s funny how the Morning Call 
 uses a silly term like&quot;flip-flop&quot;to sell this story . They don&apos;t use 
 any power over there? This is the meeting I referred to on 9/20 
 (see below). Once again, the reporter comes to the show late and 
 misses the first act. Deregulation was sold as a means to SAVE 
 MONEY because regulation is a monopoly and regulation is bad. Well 
 guess what? As the article notes, electricity isn&apos;t a commodity 
 like grain or rice. The LMP model is killing the consumer and 
 fattening PPL. 

 9/20/07:  It&apos;s meeting time again. First up is this PPLICA session with PPL reps to discuss what we can and can&apos;t do 
 with power rates. And then there is this AICUP/ECI user group meeting in Philly. Lehigh is working with 
 Enernoc and I&apos;m attending to see how they stack up. 

 Looking at the oil numbers, I can&apos;t help but think we&apos;re 
 seeing an inverted head and shoulders top...clearly we&apos;re attacking 
 resistance and testing the price level. Here are the l atest 
 charts . The heating oil inventory chart is a little bothersome 
 given our high crude inventories...but you have to remember that nearly 
 every dual fuel customer in the USA is/has switched to natural gas. Given that driving season is winding down, OPEC is adding supply, and no 
 storms are imminent, and given that refineries have unused capacity, 
 it&apos;s odd that the numbers aren&apos;t charging toward the 5-year average. Conspiracy theorists??? 

 9/19/07:  Here we go again...T. Boone 
 Pickens says on CNBC oil could go to $100 next year, trend is up,  but high prices are beginning to take a toll...API data shows Aug oil 
 demand -2.2%, or 459K bpd YoY, gasoline demand up 1% to 9.678 bpd, and 
 distillate fuel demand off 2.4%. 

 Wonder where all of that wind money is headed?    A 
 recent article in the New York Times reported that Washington 
 utility American Electric Power will install huge banks of high-tech 
 batteries as a way of connecting more wind power to its grid. The 
 article goes on to say that the cost of the project is very high, $267 million for six MW of capacity, or about $4500 per 
 kW, including the cost of substation improvements. Finally, the 
 article reports that the batteries will use a sodium sulfur chemistry, 
 operate at temperatures of more than 800F, and will be the size of a 
 double-decker bus. NOTE...you can buy a 1KW generator for $200. 

 9/17/07:  Goldman raises end of 2007 oil 
 price forecast to $85pbl from $72pbl and sees a high risk of a spike 
 above $90pbl); note that in Mar &apos;05 Goldman said oil mkts have entered a&quot;super-spike&apos;&apos; period that could see 1970&apos;s-style price surges as high 
 as $105 a barrel . Timely. Where were you 6 months ago? 

 9/12/07:  Scary headline:  Crude oil trades to all time 
 highs at $78.77 , up $0.54 on the day. Yet the #6 oil failed 
 to confirm this high and the futures are not following. It&apos;s as if 
 they still think a big hurricane is coming...time will tell. All I 
 can say is NOT locking at all time highs seems like the prudent move. Gas is good...It&apos;s gonna be a green winter for many of us! Sorry 
 Sunoco and Hess...wonder where all of that product will end up? 

 9/11/07:  Wow! Not good...Crude Oil 
 for Oct. delivery officially settles at all-time closing high of 78.23 

 OPEC to agree to raise its oil output 
 by 500,000 bpd in november-delegate - Reuters ; I&apos;m thinking this is 
 somewhat good news, though refining constraints remain. Barring 
 any other unforeseen events, this should bring prices down a tad. Update: the market actually spiked UP on the news because it was 
 expecting 1M bpd...tough game. 

 Highlights from EIA&apos;s Short-Term Energy Outlook: Oil 
 market fundamentals will likely remain tight reflecting continued 
 production restraint by members of OPEC, rising consumption , 
 moderate growth in non-OPEC supply, and falling inventories . 
 Barring a slowdown in oil demand growth, continued high demand and low 
 surplus capacity leave the market vulnerable to unexpected supply 
 disruptions through 2008. .. Announced maintenance at fields in the 
 United Arab Emirates has lowered EIA&apos;s projection for OPEC crude oil 
 production in the fourth quarter by 100,000 bbl/d from last month&apos;s 
 Outlook to 30.9 million bbl/d. In 2008 EIA expects that OPEC will 
 increase production slowly, to an average of 31.4 million bbl/d, in 
 order to manage inventories and maintain prices... Driven by increases 
 in the residential, commercial, and electric power sectors, total natural gas consumption is 
 expected to rise by 4.5 percent in 2007 . 

 Although no formal comments have 
 been made by the Saudis, it is believed they are looking for a 500,000 bopd increase in output from OPEC today. (Venezuela, Algeria and 
 Libya do not support a production raise and believe current output is 
 sufficient to meet demand; keep in mind it is believed OPEC members have 
 been producing more than current quotas and that has not deterred crude 
 prices from rising). 

 9/10/07:  Lots of emails flying around. Top stories: Lehigh just locked down natural gas through Jun 
 08....and Gasmark&apos;s $10.19 offer is just a Rate NT conversion in disguise...Hess blew them away for Muhlenberg. Keep in mind that 
 basis (i.e. physical location of your meters) counts. 

 9/4/07:  This week is the beginning of the 
 end for winter gas. We&apos;re either going to break $5 or begin the 
 climb. The storm du jour appears harmless to oil&amp;gas production . And the day closes with this:  Oil jumped $1 past $75 a barrel 
 on Tuesday as a top U.S. hurricane forecaster called for a busy end to 
 the Atlantic storm season, raising concerns over potential oil and gas 
 disruptions. Once and again, if the forecaster is even slightly wrong, we&apos;re headed back to lows in a heartbeat. It&apos;s really a 
 little pathetic because we&apos;ve already had two Cat 5s and the season ends 
 in October. 

 8/27/07:  Here&apos;s a little commentary story on wind that I could have written because it touches on many undercurrents of 
 the wind argument that I&apos;ve discussed in the past; it&apos;s a subsidy, and 
 it really was birthed by Enron. 

 8/23/07:  Working gas in storage was 2,926 
 Bcf as of Friday, August 17, 2007, according to EIA estimates. 
 This represents a net increase of 23 Bcf 
 from the previous week. Stocks were 77 Bcf higher than last year at this time and 333 Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,593 Bcf. In the East Region, stocks were 
 137 Bcf above the 5-year average following net injections of 40 Bcf. Combine this with unseasonable 
 weather and no Gulf hurricane and we&apos;re on the road back to $5.  

 Dear Lisa Boscola, here&apos;s why your initiative is dead in 
 the water:  
 
 
 Compete, an advocacy group promoting competitive 
 electricity markets, paid Covington&amp;Burling LLP 
 $200,000 to lobby the federal government in the 
 first half of 2007, according to a federal 
 disclosure form. The Washington-based firm lobbied 
 Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
 Commission on electricity competition and other 
 energy issues, according to the form posted online 
 Aug. 7 by the Senate&apos;s public records office. PPL Corp. 
 and DPL Inc. are among the dozens of companies that 
 are members of Compete. William Massey, a 
 former FERC commissioner, is among those registered 
 to lobby on behalf of the coalition. Under a federal 
 law enacted in 1995, lobbyists are required to 
 disclose activities that could influence members of 
 the executive and legislative branches. They must 
 register with Congress within 45 days of being hired 
 or engaging in lobbying. 
 
 
 8/22/07:  October crude closed lower by 
 $0.36 to $69.20pbl and Sept nat gas ended at $5.59 mbtu, lower by 22.7 
 cents. Sept heating oil finished lower by 20 cents to $1.95/gal. The wheels are in motion for me with this price rout due to the storm 
 missing the Gulf. I&apos;ve got a number from UGI that&apos;s pretty good 
 and I&apos;m working Gasmark and Hess for their quotes. I&apos;m 
 entertaining a buy-limit order after I commit to a basis number from 
 Hess. I still think short term gas tests the $5 level. If it 
 does, I&apos;m buying my winter (except Jan/Feb). 

 8/21/07:  Wow! See what happens when 
 the big one misses the oil&amp;gas production facilities? Gas 
 dropped nearly $1! And crude is back to $70. NYMEX oil falls 
 below $70 a barrel for first time since July 2- Bloomberg 

 8/20/07:  A trader might interpret this chart of 6 oil prices as 
 a&quot;head and shoulders&quot;top... 

 Ignoring the political angle, here&apos;s an interesting story ...what if we used 10% as a return on high 
 efficiency investment? Instead of what is usually, or currently, 
 maybe 33%... 

 8/19/07:  Too little, too late. Here&apos;s 
 a nifty 
 little Sunday story from the Morning Call about our esteemed State 
 government starting to take notice that people will be more than a 
 little miffed on or about 1/1/2010. Umm, why is the DEP involved? Politics, as usual. Personally I see this as just a reaction to 
 PPL&apos;s giddy Wall Street guidance. Hey, it took 11 years to get 
 here and they&apos;re not about to let anything derail the profit train at 
 this stage of the game. It would take an extraordinary step in 
 this State to repeal that legislation. People at PPLICA asked the 
 same question 14 months ago and some extremely smart lawyers who 
 specialize in taunting PPL saw no way out. 

 8/13/07:  Hey! Did I call that gas 
 bottom on 7/31 or what? Take a look at the $/mmBTU graph. Congrats to Lafayette...timely move.  

 8/8/07:  Interesting story about stray 
 voltage.  A sump pump! Yeah, I&apos;ll make sure it never 
 trips off... 

 Deal makers in the so-called clean technology business are mostly 
 brushing aside recent market weakness and forecast a healthy flow of 
 venture capital and other transactions in the solar, biofuel and wind 
 energy sectors for the remainder of the year. 

 8/2/07:  Borrowing a line from Dirty Harry, 
 do you feel lucky? Just heard an interview with a gas trader on 
 CNBC...if we don&apos;t get a storm soon, gas could easily hit $5.60 before 
 winter issues come along. In other words, they&apos;re hoping for 
 SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to draw down inventory. 

 7/31/07:  Nukes again. 

 Crude oil continues to trade at levels not seen in a 
 year. Sep crude is up 54 cents to $77.37pbl (Crude hit a record 
 $78.40pbl on 7/14/06). Natural gas short-covering also continues as more 
 seasonal warm weather is finally forecast to hit much of the U.S. over 
 the next two weeks and we enter the heart of the hurricane season 
 (roughly 80% of the hurricanes that form in the Atlantic take place from 
 August to October; NOAA has issued Public Advisory Number 2 for Tropical 
 Depression THREE which is north of Bermuda and could become a Tropical 
 Storm today). Nat gas is also being helped by surging crude prices as 
 consumers look to cheaper gas rather than oil; nat gas is up 14 cents to 
 $6.635mbtu. Heating oil is up 1.69 cents to $2.0820/gal. 

 7/30/07:  PPL Corp To Sell Its Small 
 Natural Gas Distribution and Propane Businesses ; this didn&apos;t work 
 out as I had hoped...I thought PPL would make a play for UGI and bring 
 sanity to the business. Obviously, PPL found out that they 
 couldn&apos;t make money via tariffs and a common sense approach. UGI 
 survives via smoke and mirrors. Sad day for energy consumers.  

 7/28/07:  Is anybody still reading the 
 paper? Did you see this story and this story about PPL 
 rates? You already knew about all of this information over 1 year 
 ago!!! 

 7/26/07:  I would recommend this class to anyone interested in 
 learning more about the NYMEX and the futures markets. One night 
 in Manhattan is worth it for the experience. 

 7/25/07:  WSJ reports from coast to coast, 
 plans for a new generation of coal-fired power plants are falling by the 
 wayside as states conclude that 
 conventional coal plants are too dirty to build and the cost of cleaner 
 plants is too high . If significant numbers of new coal plants 
 don&apos;t get built in the U.S. in coming years, it will put pressure on 
 officials to clear the path for other power sources, including nuclear power , or trim the nation&apos;s electricity 
 demand, which is expected to grow 1.8% this year. In a time of 
 rising energy costs, officials also worry about the long-term 
 consequences of their decisions, including higher prices or the 
 potential for shortages. For now, coal cos haven&apos;t taken steps to 
 ratchet back production or big projects because of coal-plant delays. 
 They believe that in a time of global energy concerns, U.S. coal 
 supplies will be seen as too important to dismiss. The U.S. has the 
 world&apos;s largest coal reserves and is sometimes called&quot;the Saudi Arabia 
 of coal&quot;by energy-industry observers. 

 7/24/07:   Here&apos;s 
 a blast from the past . Didn&apos;t even know I was listed! It 
 may be 7 years old, but it&apos;s still as relevant as ever. 

 Crude oil continues yesterday&apos;s selling and is 
 off 94 cents to $73.95pbl (Iran agreed that within two weeks it will 
 provide details of its uranium enrichment; continued downward pressure 
 on crude is evident due to specifc OPEC comments which said a fair 
 price for crude is between $60 and $65 ; traders are fearful that 
 OPEC may start to think they need to add supplies to lower oil prices.  Natural gas , which fell 40 cents yesterday, is off 8 cents this 
 morn to $5.96mbtu largely due to unseasonal cool weather. Nat gas is now at the lowest levels since Dec (Aug ng expires on Fri). 

 7/23/07:  Here&apos;s a story from yesterday&apos;s NY Times whereby high gasoline prices are now 
 blamed on refinery outages. So instead of storms, we have the 
 infamous university term of&quot;deferred maintenance&quot;rearing its ugly 
 head. 

 We now have a crossover on the NYMEX crude oil 
 charts...prompt, or current pricing is HIGHER than future pricing. A trader might argue that high prices are expected to cut demand thereby 
 influencing supply and resulting in lower prices looking 12 months out. Either way, this means DO NOT lock anything at current levels. 

 7/16/07:  T. Boone Pickens says we will see 
 $80 oil before he turns 80 years old next year (says there is no way you 
 can be short oil); says Russian 
 and Saudi producers want higher oil prices . 

 U.S . crude price could top $90 a barrel this autumn and hit $95 
 by the end of the year if OPEC keeps oil production capped at current levels, Goldman Sachs said in a report issued on Monday. 

 7/9/07:  I apologize for the data gap...the 
 death-in-the-family was my Dad and I&apos;ve been traveling to Philly every 
 other day. I&apos;m out of the office until 7/16. 

 6/29/07:  Chavez calls for oil price to 
 remain above $60/barrel, Chavez tells Russian Duma he wants to upper 
 limit on oil price- Bloomberg 

 Sometimes you get lucky...gas prices are moving down 
 (diverging from oil) very nicely. I bought about 75% of what I 
 needed at a fixed price and as the month winds down I&apos;m in the spot 
 market filling the balance. I&apos;ve NOT done anything with my NDS 
 accounts as I&apos;m watching the (lack of) hurricanes. Gas could 
 easily break down another $2 short term and $1 long. Patience 
 pays. 

 6/25/07:  I haven&apos;t bothered to repost a lot 
 of the dribble that passes for news in the Morning Call. I would 
 like to note this column regarding our latest energy effort from Congress . Sadly, I have to agree with the hot air comment...green this and green 
 that...but don&apos;t mess with my truck.  

 6/20/07:  Inventories: At 
 349.3 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are well above the upper end of the average range for this time of year. Total 
 motor gasoline inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels last week, but 
 remain well below the lower end of the 
 average range. All of the increase was due to a build in gasoline 
 blending components. Distillate fuel inventories inched higher by 0.1 
 mln b/day, and are in the upper half of the average range for this time 
 of year. Propane/propylene inventories rose by 2.8 million barrels last 
 week. Total commercial petroleum inventories increased by 9.9 million 
 barrels last week, and are in the middle of the average range for this 
 time of year. Demand: Over the last four weeks, motor gasoline demand is 
 up 1.5%; Jet fuel demand is down 0.4%. 

 Surprised by build in inventory.  Here are the storage charts . 

 6/18/07:  Crude oil trades to ~9 month highs 
 on Nigerian concerns... July crude is currently +0.71 at 68.71 

 6/14/07:  U.S. heating oil 
 futures jump 2% to above $2.00/gal on supply concerns, highest since 
 Sept 2006 

 6/7/07: Reality check:  Energy 
 Conversion Devices, Inc. announced the installation of its UNI-SOLAR(R) 
 ground-mounted amorphous thin-film photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the 1.1 Megawatt solar energy 
 system at Paramount Farms, Inc., the world&apos;s largest vertically 
 integrated supplier of pistachios and almonds. The installation, which spans 8 acres, is one of the largest 
 single-site, privately-owned solar energy systems in the U.S. 

 6/4/07:  July crude closed the session higher 
 by $1.04 to $66.12pbl while July nat gas ended the day at $8.186mbtu, 
 higher by 30.8 cents. July heating oil ended higher by 4.12 cents to 
 $1.9640/gal.  Loving it when a plan comes together! 

  (Uh-Oh)... US refiners shelved 
 500,000 bpd expansion plans over past yr due to demand uncertainty, 
 costs, according to EIA - Reuters  OPEC needs to boost 
 output in second half 2007 to meet winter demand says EIA&apos;s Caruso. 

 Occassionally I read a little blurb 
 that clarifies a recent project. Here&apos;s 10 items for a fire alarm 
 contractor that could/should apply to any technical service agreement: 

 
 The current hourly rate, as well as any premium for 
 calls on nights, weekends and holidays, 
 
 The length of time these rates will be in effect, 
 
 Whether the provider imposes a minimum charge for a 
 service call, and, if so, how much it is, 
 
 The frequency with which labor rates increase, 
 
 The amount and date of the last price increase, 
 
 The average time to respond to an emergency, 
 
 Whether the service provider offers a discount, if 
 any, from the published price list for parts, 
 
 The length of the warranty period, 
 
 Whether the warranty covers both parts and labor, as 
 well as annual testing, 
 
 Whether system training is available to the end-user 
 and how much it costs. 
 

 5/30/07:  Wow. How about that price 
 disparity between Sunoco and Hess? Today it&apos;s 8 cents. Proof 
 that it never hurts to entertain at least two quotes. I&apos;m a little 
 surprised given the Pennsauken terminal for Hess and the proximity of 
 the Sunoco refinery. 

 5/24/07:  Have you ever heard of the Law of 
 Unintended Consequence? Here&apos;s a prime example as to why gasoline prices will stay high. &quot;Domestic refineries can process 17.5Mbpd...we consume 21Mbpd&quot;. 

 5/23/07:  I received an email from our 
 administration PR folks asking what Lehigh was doing for sustainability. It took great restraint on my part to inform newspeople that we didn&apos;t 
 just jump on this bandwagon.  Please read 
 this editorial . Energy engineers have been working on this 
 problem since the Carter administration. Compact flourescent bulbs 
 weren&apos;t invented yesterday! Every week I look at the oil import 
 vs. domestic production numbers and cringe. 

 Chairman says&quot;... PPL is strong, growing and 
 well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in the 
 continually evolving electricity business.&quot;The co continues to forecast 
 2010 earnings of $3.50 per share. 

 5/22/07: First we get this headline: NOAA sees 
 7-10 hurricanes this season, 3-5 may be major - DJ  NOAA says 
 75% chance hurricane season &apos;above normal&apos;. This leads to a quick 
 check on Jun-Oct gas prices...$9 at the city gate...which leads to a 
 Rich Kiernan phone tag session...which starts with $0.40/mcf and ends 
 with $0.25/mcf... THUS I&apos;VE JUST LOCKED DOWN GAS 
 FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS AT A PRICE ON PAR WITH OIL. 

 5/18/07:  I sincerely hope everyone read the Morning Call story on PPL today and remembered what I&apos;ve been saying since the beginning...please 
 scroll down to my 6/6/06 comment below. The marketing machine has 
 been out in force attempting to soften the blow while the stock price 
 has been soaring. This is not rocket science. PJM posts the 
 market price on an hourly basis. PPL still controls its own 
 generation and know what it costs to make a profit! Why are people 
 so hung up on round numbers? Like 30%? Fuel prices move 
 constantly and the IBEW cost will increment at least 3.5%/year forever. 30% is the MINIMUM budget increase for your planning. Let&apos;s not 
 forget the little distribution rate increases that are also scheduled to 
 hit. 

 Even the bit players smell the money to be made in a 
 deregulated market : EnerNOC (ENOC) prices its IPO at $26, well 
 above the expected range of $21-23. The co uses its Network Operations 
 Center, or NOC, to remotely manage and reduce electricity consumption 
 across a network of commercial and industrial customer sites to enable a 
 more intelligent electric power grid. In order to avoid service 
 disruptions, such as brownouts and blackouts, during periods of peak 
 electricity demand, grid operators and utilities have traditionally 
 increased supply by building additional power plants and transmission 
 lines. As an alternative, ENOC offers demand response services, 
 whereby it monitors electricity consumption and alerts end-use customers 
 to reduce their usage. This helps optimize the balance of electric 
 supply and demand and creates a more environmentally sound alternative 
 to building additional power plants. Grid operators and utilities 
 pay ENOC a stream of recurring revenues . With over 1,308 customer 
 sites and 579 mw of demand response capacity under management, the co 
 believes it&apos;s the largest national provider in the US . The co is 
 not yet profitable, but posted 2006 revenue of $26.1 mln, up 166% yr/yr. 
 Q1 revenue rose 95% yr/yr to $10 mln... This is the second IPO in a 
 month in the&quot;intelligent electric power grid&quot;space. The strong pricing 
 for ENOC looks in part due to the big move in the other IPO: Comverge , 
 which makes the devices that get installed at energy customer locations. 
 T4 note: this is similar to the scheme proposed by Utility Connect 
 at the AICUP meeting at Del Val College. The difference is UC was&quot;money for nothing&quot;. Here, the company expects you to cut demand 
 (in other words, turn it off).

 subsidiary, which provides broadband connectivity for telecommunication 
 companies, wireless and Internet service providers and large businesses

 4/27/07:  June crude ended the session 
 higher by 1.37 to $66.44pbl while June nat gas closed higher by 23 cents 
 to $7.832mbtu. May heating oil closed higher by 2.39 cents to 
 $1.9130/gal and May RBOB gas closed at $2.3570/gal, up 6.67 cents ( approaching 
 the highest levels of last summer&apos;s hurricane season ). 

 Nice to see that at least one other person in the Lehigh 
 Valley gets it...here is an editorial 
 from Saturday&apos;s Morning Call . 

 I guess it&apos;s time to see if anyone is listening...or 
 reading...my call was to buy heating oil in late January...nobody 
 responded...in March, I said the clock was running out...and nobody 
 responded...at this time, heating oil is getting close to last winter&apos;s 
 disastrous prepay. Buying now because that&apos;s when the historical 
 buy occurred makes no sense unless you want a guaranteed not-to-exceed 
 price. Given that there are two potential suppliers, I would at 
 least see who offers a better cap plan. 

 4/23/07:  T4 attended the PPLICA meeting on 
 Friday to discuss PPL&apos;s distribution rate increase proposals. They 
 are finally progressing to a cost-for-service model (thanks to 
 deregulation). The bottom line is a huge win for LP-5 customers 
 (7% rate DECREASE). Consumers are not going to be happy. Customer charges are transitioning from a demand-based model to a flat 
 rate; they&apos;re created their own internal&quot;insurance company&quot;to 
 compensate themselves for storm-related expenses (fishy). There 
 are several proposals to change the language of Rule 4 in their tariff; 
 these are anti-customer in that they make it nearly impossible for you 
 to get a second line of service without paying the entire cost, even if 
 the line is on your own property. And the elephant in the room 
 remains 1/1/2010...all 
 interruptible rates and EDI/IDI credits will disappear . 

 Fuel Switching 101: if you look at the $/mmBTU 
 graph, you&apos;ll note that current nat gas is cheaper than 6 oil...finally! Unfortunately, that pesky little company named UGI is not 
 included...once you add back the $0.35 DS rate (which would involve a 
 serious volume commitment) the number agains skews in favor of 6 oil. 

 4/18/07:  Here&apos;s the full story on 
 yesterday courtesy of the Morning Call. Blah, blah, blah...prices 
 are going up. 

 Here&apos;s an example of why you shouldn&apos;t lock into one supplier. I had a 
 contract with Sunoco and it expired. I asked Hess to supply market 
 pricing. Even though they are coming from Pennsauken, NJ, they&apos;re 
 a little cheaper.  

 U.S Gasoline pump price could touch record, Bodman 
 says- Bloomberg 

 4/17/07:  T4 a ttended the PPL presentation to the Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce in Allentown this 
 morning; it was a very generic presentation that could be summed simply 
 with: expect at least a 20% cost increase in 2010 . PPL presents the data in a way that makes it seem as if they&apos;re here to 
 help. Let&apos;s ignore the facts that the stock is on a tear, 
 deregulation = for-profits, and PA deregulation was spearheaded by Phila 
 politicians jealous of the low PPL rates which were nearly 2x higher. And Enron. Today PPL says 20% in 2010. T4 maintains 30% 
 because you also need to factor in these little distribution rate 
 increases.

 4/12/07:   NEW ALTEMOS CONTACT = VINCE 
 CATRAMBONE...267-228-0631  Let&apos;s not shoot the messenger...the 
 current quote on next year&apos;s heating oil is $ 2.24 . Please 
 see the 1/12/07 and 3/23/07 comments. I&apos;ve asked for a cap quote. 

 Crude oil prices are higher after 
 the International Energy Agency 
 said OPEC had cut supplies to a two-year low to reduce trim global stockpiles. The real issue here is gasoline 
 inventories (gasoline inventories have already fallen 9 weeks in 
 a row so the fact that crude supplies are at the lowest levels since Jan 
 2005 ahead of the summer driving season could be problematic and that 
 could result in higher wholesale/retail prices of gasoline especially 
 since r efining utilization rates 
 are at 3-month highs ). Crude oil is up 69 cents to 
 $62.70pbl (range is 62.91 to 61.92). Ahead of weekly inventory stats at 
 10:30am EST (expectations of a build of 16bcf), nat gas is up 8 cents to 
 $7.935 ($8.01 was yesterday&apos;s high). Heating oil is up 1.18 cents to 
 $1.8865/gal. (+ at least a 15 cent margin + higher costs into winter). 

 Boone Pickens said last night on CNBC that we should take out the $78pbl crude 
 level by the end of this year. 

 4/11/07:  Productions: U.S. crude oil 
 refinery inputs averaged nearly 15.1 mln b/day during the week ending 
 April 6, up 231K b/day from the previous week&apos;s average. Refineries 
 operated at 88.4% of their operable capacity last week. However, gasoline production declined 
 compared to the previous week , averaging over 8.5 mln b/day, 
 while distillate fuel production increased, averaging over 4.2 mln 
 b/day... Imports: U.S. crude oil imports averaged 9.8 mln 
 b/day last week, down 441K b/day from the previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude 
 oil imports have averaged over 10.0 mln b/day, or 202K mln b/day more 
 than averaged over the same four-week period last year . Total 
 motor gasoline imports (including both finished gasoline and gasoline 
 blending components) last week averaged 953K b/day. Distillate fuel 
 imports averaged 259k mln b/day last week... Inventories: At 333.4 mln barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are just above the upper end of the 
 average range for this time of year. Total motor gasoline 
 inventories fell by 5.5 mln barrels last week, and are just below the 
 lower end of the average range. Distillate fuel inventories inched 
 higher by 0.1 mln barrels, and are slightly above the upper end of the 
 average range for this time of year. Heating oil inventories 
 (high-sulfur) fell last week, while diesel fuel inventories (the sum of 
 ultra-low and low-sulfur) inventories reported a modest gain. 
 Propane/propylene inventories rose by 0.7 mln barrels last week... 
 Demand: Over the last four 
 weeks, motor gasoline demand is up 2.5% ; Jet fuel demand is down 
 0.8%. 

 4/9/07:  Last night on&quot;60 Minutes&quot;nuclear 
 energy was a big focus. The segment showed how France is leading the 
 world in using nuclear energy. Also during the segment, President Bush 
 was shown walking through a Exelon Corp (EXC) plant when the commentary 
 focused on the U.S. looking to boost its own use of nuclear energy. 

 4/5/07:  PPL is starting the media parade to 
 sell their distribution rate increase request with a meeting in 
 Allentown on 4/17 ; T4 will attend. Later that week, there is a 
 full-blown PPLICA meeting to discuss this case . Good for 
 industrial/commercials and bad for residentials is the summary of the 
 PPL plan. The fear amongst I&amp;C bigwigs is that the Office of 
 Consumer Advocate, at a minimum, will vehemently argue against the PPL 
 plan. In other words, the PPL plan is good for Lehigh, but bad for 
 the Trzesniowski family home. 

 Here&apos;s a good study entitled&quot; The 
 Costs and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings &quot;. It&apos;s a big 
 file. The author, Greg Katz, is highly regarded by many attendees 
 at the Labs21 training seminar. 

 Do you have science labs? Jon Zboralski, Director 
 of Engineering for ThermoFisher (was Fisher Hamilton) offers the&quot;4s&quot;as design tips for successful fume 
 hood jobs: max 400 cfm/diffuser (preferably perforated), and 2&apos; x 
 4&apos; diffusers located&gt;4 ft from the hood. Low flow hoods/venturi 
 designs are really sales pitches because NFPA 45 seems to be the 
 governing Code on hood stats and they require a minimum of 25 cfm / sq 
 ft of work area. 

 Did you realize that every wasted cfm of conditioned lab 
 air that is exhausted is worth nearly $7 annually? Do the math. 

 4/4/07:  Here&apos;s a screenprint from a 
 scenario on Utility Connect&apos;s website (the 
 AICUP) presentation. For our 13.5 MW load, they&apos;ll pay us $17,253 
 to do nothing? I&apos;m not a firm believer in the money for nothing 
 business case. I&apos;m still digging. 

 4/3/07:  Anybody remember my&quot;coal and 
 yellow cake&quot;comment from the last meeting? Check out this story 
 on Florida Power&amp;Light&apos;s plan for the next decade . 12 years (est?) to get a 
 nuke up and running. 

 I finally took a look at the AICUP 
 presentation regarding the PJM demand response program . I&apos;m 
 still formulating some questions. In a nutshell, I think this is 
 great for PECO customers, but I&apos;m not sure of the benefits in a 
 (currently) low cost territory such as ours. And lest we forget, 
 demand control means turn off the lights, shut something off, kill the 
 air conditioning...and it usually happens on the hottest days when 
 classes demand it most. Lehigh studied this years ago and the 
 professors with research (and gov&apos;t $) were not happy campers. On 
 the + side, it seems like a no-brainer if you&apos;re willing to participate. 

 4/2/07:  Here&apos;s a nice summary of the PPL distribution rate increase request . Remember, these are NOT part of the big hit coming in 2010. Just a 
 little tease of what&apos;s coming. 

 3/23/07: NOTE: I&apos;m out of the area next 
 week at a class in Wisconsin. I have to note that the energy 
 markets are now firmly in an uptrend due to the Iranian/British sailor 
 issue.  I think I was clear at our last meeting that the timeframe 
 to act on next year&apos;s budget was short. The demand numbers from 
 last Wednesday&apos;s storage report were not good if you expect lower 
 prices.  The USA continues to demand ever increasing volumes of 
 gasoline. 

 3/22/07:  Here&apos;s a classic UGI story. I emailed Rich Kiernan yesterday and asked for a DS offer; well, 
 actually, I did all the work and told him that $0.35 would work for us. He calls back this AM and wants an answer NOW. I think we all know 
 that gas marketers don&apos;t exactly move at the speed of light. And 
 to top it off, he must know that Gasmark had a sales meeting yesterday 
 and nobody was in the office? This game is very tough. 

 Anybody catch the  Morning Call 
 story about the poor guy in Bucks getting run over by big bad PPL? Let me offer some of my PPL knowledge...that line has been on the 
 drawing board since the 1960&apos;s! Lehigh was approached in 1995 and 
 granted a ROW to install a sectionalizing switch as part of that 
 project. 69KV is an archaic method of power transmission. This is a tough fight. They&apos;re building Q-town like crazy and 
 growth is moving westward. Something&apos;s gotta give. 

 Are you familiar with Value Line? Here&apos;s the VL summary on PPL . Our impending rate increase is neatly summarized in the last paragraph. Good for investors. Bad for ratepayers. 

 3/14/07:  Interesting article on Silicon Valley&quot;rewiring&quot;itself.  I 
 guess this is somewhat good news? Or is it bad because they 
 recognize that costs will skyrocket and there is money to be made? You be the judge! 

 For anyone who has to explain a power outage, here&apos;s a good story . Squirrels are rats with tails. 

 3/12/07:  WSJ reports deep in the heart of 
 Texas, Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS.A ), BP ( BP ) and a wind-development co owned by Goldman Sachs ( GS ) are racing to 
 lease vast expanses of ranchland. In a bet on wind power&apos;s 
 long-term viability, they&apos;re planning to erect what would be some of the 
 biggest wind farms in the world, with thousands of wind turbines costing some $2 
 mln apiece . But generating power from wind isn&apos;t profitable without govt tax breaks , 
 which in the past have been offered and taken away. Energy cos investing 
 in wind power are expecting govts to toughen rules relating to 
 traditional energy sources, part of long-term efforts to reduce 
 global-warming emissions and reliance on Middle East oil. As a result, 
 they&apos;re hoping renewable energy 
 will become a profitable niche , not merely one that allows them to 
 burnish their green credentials. Moreover, unlike most other 
 green-energy options, wind power doesn&apos;t require any technological 
 breakthroughs. The soaring pinwheel turbines that turn wind into 
 electricity are manufactured by a growing cadre of mainstream cos, 
 including General Electric ( GE ) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
 and are getting more reliable and efficient. Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) 
 remains unconvinced. Exxon is bankrolling research on clean-energy 
 technologies, but says renewable energy isn&apos;t yet viable on a large 
 enough scale. In addition, the co says, it doesn&apos;t want to get into a 
 business that depends on subsidies . 

 3/5/07:  Published again!  I wish they would have printed it along with this story from 
 Saturday ....&quot;We have some trouble heading our way unless we do what 
 the governor has outlined..&quot;???  Umm, Kathleen, if we can repeal 
 a faulty pay grab, why can&apos;t we repeal a faulty deregulation law? 

 Great news blip from the CEO of AEP , a huge Midwest ute...&quot;coal and 
 yellow cake&quot;! I especially like the quip about California. 

 Crude oil is lower this morning (currently off $1.19 to 
 $60.45) on concern global 
 economic growth will slow , reducing fuel consumption. The fact 
 the Saudis are saying that military action against Iran would only make 
 matters in the Middle East worse has some traders thinking negotiations 
 rather than militant action will be how the U.N. deals with Iran for 
 now. Also weighing on energy prices is bearish comments from OPEC Member 
 Algeria that OPEC, producer of 
 40% of the world&apos;s oil, will probably keep its production quotas 
 unchanged when ministers meet March 15, because crude oil prices are&quot;normal.&quot; The Algerian Oil Minister also said, prices are expected to stabilize 
 between $50 and $60&apos;&apos; a barrel. 

 Forbes.com reports just an hour&apos;s 
 drive outside the capital of Brazil, a traffic-choked metropolis where 
 President Bush kicks off a Latin American tour Thursday, sugar cane 
 fields stretch for hundreds of miles, providing the ethanol that fuels 
 eight out of every 10 new Brazilian cars. In only a few years, Brazil 
 has turned itself into the planet&apos;s undisputed renewable energy leader, 
 and the highlight of Bush&apos;s visit is expected to be a new ethanol&quot;alliance&quot;he will forge with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da 
 Silva. The deal is still being negotiated, but the two leaders are 
 expected to sign an accord Friday to develop standards to help turn 
 ethanol into an internationally traded commodity , and to promote 
 sugar cane-based ethanol production in Central America and the Caribbean 
 to meet rising intl demand. Meanwhile, political and energy analysts 
 warn that any agreements reached between Brazil and the U.S. are 
 unlikely to have short-term effects. And the deal itself could end up 
 largely symbolic because of reluctance by Washington to address a key 
 point of friction: A 53 
 cent-per-gallon U.S. tariff on Brazilian ethanol imports . 

 WSJ reports just days after two of the nation&apos;s leading 
 environmental groups blessed an investor plan to buy TXU Corp. and take 
 the controversial Texas utility in a new and&quot;greener&quot;direction, a 
 battle has broken out in the environmental community over the terms of 
 the deal. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental 
 Defense said they had extracted a pledge from the investors to cancel a 
 slew of coal-fired power plants, cut emissions and back federal 
 global-warming legislation. But now, opponents of the deal, in a 
 blizzard of emails and Internet posts, have put the two organizations on 
 the defensive by accusing them of settling for too little. The critics, 
 who encompass a broad range of smaller environmental groups and 
 individuals, say TXU should have been forced to give up all, not just 
 some, of its future plans involving coal-fired power plants . The 
 plants release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping 
 gas blamed in part for climate change. Even worse, some believe that the 
 environmental interests were snookered. Since the buyout was announced, it has become apparent that some of the concessions involve projects 
 that TXU was already planning to shelve for a variety of reasons . 
 And TXU has fueled the skepticism further in recent days by outlining new loopholes in the 
 pledge.    No kidding? As I mentioned in the 
 Morning Call letter, investors don&apos;t pony up $32B for an asset that 
 won&apos;t produce serious gains. 

 3/2/07:  April crude closed higher by 19 
 cents to 61.98, April nat gas closed higher by 2 cents to 7.320, while 
 April heating oil closed lower by 0.0045 to 1.7765. 

 Look for another letter to the editor by yours truly in 
 the Morning Call this weekend. It disgusts me that our State can&apos;t 
 look at deregulation and recognize that it&apos;s Wall Street running wild. There once was a day when utilities existed to serve the people who 
 lived within their service territory. 

 2/27/07: Hearing that the strength in crude oil 
 (61.90 +0.51) is being attributed to two things: concerns that 
 tomorrow&apos;s gasoline data will be very bullish for prices due to so many 
 recent refinery issues in North America, and word that terrorism was the 
 cause of a Frenchman&apos;s death in Saudi Arabia. 

 2/26/07: Lots of news this weekend. First, let&apos;s look at a State that just said no:  WSJ reports Virginia&apos;s legislature formally 
 pulled the plug on deregulation last week, eight years after it 
 restructured the state&apos;s electricity mkt. But the effort to undo the 
 deregulation plan has sparked a dustup between regulators and Dominion 
 Resources over a plan that critics say gives too much away to the 
 state&apos;s biggest utility. Had legislators not acted, Dominion would have 
 been able to charge mkt prices for electricity after 2010, possibly 
 causing rate shock. The legislation phases in modest rate increases and 
 ties some future charges to utilities&apos; underlying costs. The legislation 
 nevertheless is controversial because it is packed with incentives not 
 typically offered to utilities, and Dominion has enjoyed a strong 
 financial performance. Harvey Morgan, a Republican member of the 
 Virginia House of Delegates, said Dominion was given too much say in 
 what went in the legislation. Unlike in other states where utilities 
 divested their plants, the state&apos;s two biggest utilities, Dominion and 
 American Electric Power ( AEP ), kept theirs. 

 Next up, let&apos;s examine this story:  The Wall 
 Street Journal reports a total of six firms -- led by Kohlberg, Kravis, 
 Roberts&amp;Co., Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs Group -- have 
 signed a deal to buy TXU Corp. ( TXU ) for $32 bln plus more than 
 $12 bln in TXU debt, according to people familiar with the matter. TXU 
 directors last night voted to recommend that shareholders approve the 
 deal. In a creative twist, the firms have moved quickly to pre-empt 
 opposition from powerful environmental groups while seeking support from 
 various regulators and politicians. Already, the potential buyers have 
 promised to cancel plans to build all but three of the co&apos;s proposed 11 
 coal-fired plants. And they are planning to placate consumers with rate 
 reductions. 

 Folks, you don&apos;t spend $32 BILLION for an asset that 
 is expected to decline in value. Taking the company private means 
 that they are not subject to the same financial oversight as a public 
 company. Texas rates are already among the highest in the 
 nation... 

 Hence, we get news like this that shows the&quot;Lazarus&quot;effect: Citigroup notes news reports indicate K.K.R is leading a 
 private equity bid for TXU Energy (TXU) with a purchase price estimated 
 at +/-$70/share. The firm believes KRR&apos;s bid has positive valuation 
 implications for merchant power companies and integrated utilities with 
 large deregulated generation portfolios and corroborates their bullish view on fundamentals for 
 those companies, specifically ones in tightening east coast markets . 
 The firm says NRG Energy ( NRG ) and Mirant ( MIR ), Reliant ( RRI ) 
 and Dynegy ( DYN ) could all be takeover target s 

 2/22/07: (Uh-oh)   The E.I.A. 
 reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 3.694 mln barrels 
 (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 1.05 mln barrels); gasoline 
 inventories had a draw of 3.041 mln barrels 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 50K); distillate inventories had a draw of 5.037 mln barrels (Bloomberg 
 consensus was draw of 2.875 mln barrels) ---&gt; Crude oil sees 
 initial spike higher following energy data... now 60.40 ---&gt;(from 
 EIA) Demand: Over the last four weeks, motor gasoline demand 
 is up 3.8% y/y; Distillate fuel demand is up 9.8% y/y; Jet fuel demand is up 5.7% y/y. 

 We are doing a fine job of working off the oversupply 
 without conserving anything. 

 Ahead of stats at 10:30 crude oil is off 36 cents to 
 $59.71 after moving above $60 for the first time since Feb 9 (range overnight is 59.61 to 60.19). Natural gas is off 3.2 cents 
 to $7.614mbtu (range is 7.58 to 7.697). Heating oil is off .25 of a cent 
 to $1.6791/gal. Forecasts for stats: looking for crude to build 
 1mln, gas to draw 50, distillate to draw 2.875mln and nat gas to draw 
 226bcf. 

 2/21/07:  Another infrastructure story on aging water pipes, etc. 

 Clean coal = oxymoron?  Stick this in your green file. 

 2/20/07:  Just in case you don&apos;t have enough 
 work on campus, you should be aware that this whole &quot;green&quot;and&quot;carbon neutral&quot;trend is coming to a President&apos;s office near to 
 you. Wind is a subsidy that amounts to money for nothing. Photovoltaic will cost you a solid $0.30/kwhr (vs. $0.08). Ethanol 
 chews up gas pumps and fuel system components; it&apos;s not economical for 
 $60/bbl oil. It&apos;s very PC to 
 sign on to the treaty; unfortunately, implementation is going to be a 
 pain for you. Note: there is a nice summary of green intiative information on the&quot;Green Energy&quot;link on the Clients Only 
 page. (Look at the top of the link list on the left!) 

 2/12/07:  The Wall Street Journal reports 
 the world oil market is in&quot;much, much better health and balance&quot;now 
 and, if trends hold, there will be no need for further production cuts 
 or increases in supply when members of the OPEC meet next month, Saudi 
 Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi said yesterday. In an interview, Mr. 
 Naimi said the kingdom&apos;s production is now 8.5 mln to 8.6 mln barrels a 
 day, confirming its reduction by one mln barrels a day from its output 
 about six months ago. The world oil market is in&quot;much, much better 
 health and balance&quot;now and, if trends hold, there will be no need for 
 further production cuts or increases in supply when members of the 
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet next month, Saudi 
 Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi said yesterday. The reduction is part of 
 a push by OPEC to shrink stockpiles of oil that climbed sharply last 
 year as demand growth stumbled. OPEC is to meet March 15 in Vienna to 
 assess its production policy. 

 &quot;This is ridiculous 
 that we are raising rates to tell people that their rates are going 
 up...&quot;  Yep. PPL earns $3 BILLION and they&apos;ll charge us 
 to remind us that we&apos;re going to earn them even more. Hello PUC? What is the purpose of regulation? 

 2/8/07:  Here are a few tidbits of recent communications from UGI. First off, why would anyone prevent a marketer from 
 access to records that would help you cut costs? Second, I asked 
 Rich Kiernan if the $1.70 DS offer would be a CREDIT, or enticement for 
 us to burn gas. They just don&apos;t seem to understand the economics 
 of their product. He actually asked me how I arrived at $6.67/mmBTU 
 for #6. Seriously. And finally, look at how they communicate 
 an interruption. Take the script and pencil in your name! And for some reason, they absolutely refuse to email this notice.

 Here&apos;s a little fictional green humor ! Sad but true?  

 Nigerian Oil Minister says OPEC will probably keep oil 
 output ceiling unchanged at March meet if prices hold - Reuters 

 2/2/07:  Is Rendell rearranging the deck 
 chairs on the Titanic with this plan ? PPL just set 
 another record on earnings: $868 million. And we need to plow further 
 with deregulation because...??? Think of what their earnings will 
 look like when they use&quot;market pricing&quot;to pick your pockets while 
 sitting on low cost nuclear and coal assets. And the best we can 
 offer is another 3-year transition period? 

 Crude oil is up 46 cents to $57.76pbl (range is 57.15 to 
 57.81). OPEC&apos;s 500,000 bopd additional cuts went into effect yesterday 
 so there is speculation that this time OPEC members will comply and thus 
 tighten supply. 

 1/29/07:  Lots of cross-currents from the 
 weekend news, especially toward ethanol. On one hand, we have the Saudis seeking to temper the price of oil , and on the other, we have 
 a critical analysis of the 
 ethanol plan . Note the quandry: lower oil prices make 
 ethanol unattractive/uneconomical.   T4 still believes that 
 conservation has to be a part of any solution. Whether it happens 
 in 100 years or later, it seems to me that fossil fuels have a finite 
 supply. 

 Barron&apos;s reports the U.S. ethanol complex has been a 
 long-term beneficiary of government assistance through tax subsidies and 
 tariffs on imported ethanol. The president&apos;s call for even more 
 production of ethanol and biodiesel won&apos;t do much to change the biofuel 
 industry&apos;s near-term course. Refiners are already straining available 
 engineering resources to add capacity as quickly as possible. Current 
 projects are expected to expand production capacity to six bln gallons a 
 year in 2007. As reflected in the price of a bushel of corn, supply 
 limits can take some of the fun out of the new ethanol-refining 
 capacity. Those other kinds of corn stocks -- the inventories 
 sitting in grain elevators -- have been drained to 20-year lows. That 
 makes weather a bigger short-term risk factor, should production get 
 pinched by a bad harvest. In the medium term, farmers will surely shift 
 acreage to corn from other crops. That, in turn, could limit supplies of 
 soy to biodiesel refiners. And the growing appetite of ethanol refiners 
 for corn will make the grain more expensive for livestock and, 
 indirectly, humans. To be sure, continuing improvements in corn yields 
 will ease some of those constraints. A boost in corn supply won&apos;t be 
 enough to boost the crush spread, the profit from buying corn and 
 turning it into ethanol, and make ethanol stocks recover. They&apos;ll need 
 another rise in the price of oil. 

 T4 rocket scientist award: Bank of America energy analyst Robert Morris on Friday cut his 2007 
 annual gas price forecast 17% to $6.25/MMBtu, noting that this winter 
 appears to be nearly 10% warmer than normal and is nearly half over. 

 1/25/07:  I guess Robert Plant has gone back 
 to Led Zeppelin. Now I understand why getting price quotes from 
 HOP has been like pulling teeth. Let&apos;s see where this goes. As I understand it, LVAIC had Jim McKelvey for many years, then Altemos 
 became HOP and we had six months of Bob Plant. Now it&apos;s Jeff 
 Brunner. 

 1/23/07:   PPL 
 wants&quot;intermediate&quot;rate increases before the big shocker.  Now if this is so necessary, why did Wall Street suddenly pump their 
 stock as soon as word hit? Profits run counter to the purpose of a 
 regulated utility. Yeah, they want to hire more linemen...give me 
 a break...half of their work is already farmed out to Henkels. Stepping up tree trimming? Hello PPL, you&apos;re the guys who 606ed 
 Vegetation Management a decade ago in your quest for ever higher 
 profits. And now we have to pay more for you to do what you were 
 supposed to be doing all along? 

 Crude oil closed up ~$2.32 today to $54.90, with much of 
 the gain occurring immediately after headlines hit that President Bush 
 wants to double the Strategic Oil Reserve. Note that Bloomberg earlier 
 quoted an analyst from Wachovia on the significance of this:&quot;Doubling 
 the size of the SPR would add significant upward pressure on oil prices. 
 It would remove a significant amount of supply from the market. Refiners 
 will have to spend more to get the available barrels.&quot;Note that China 
 is quietly filling their own SPR, and when combined with all of the 
 bellicose statements coming out of energy producers Russia, Iran, and 
 Venezuela, this is taking much more crude off the market than many may 
 think. OPEC only has roughly a million excess supply, so the mkt can&apos;t 
 afford even the slightlest disruption (even just pipeline problems or 
 any refinery maintenance problems would qualify here)... In addition to 
 the SPR news, some other bullish developments for oil are the statement 
 from the head of OPEC (mentioned this morning) that the&quot;basket price&quot;for OPEC crude should be around $55pbl. This usually trades below the 
 spot price, so if there are calls that the basket should be near $55pbl, 
 than you can make a case that spot crude could be closer $58 than $50 
 very soon. In addition, tensions in Lebanon have been ratcheting up the 
 past few months -- the Prime Minister repeated today that he will stand 
 firm against Hizbollah protests, which have been occurring in Beirut for 
 the past few months -- and recall that the war in Lebanon sent crude oil 
 into the highs $60&apos;s last summer.
  

 1/19/07: This kind of story drives me nuts:  The Wall Street Journal reports investors are trying to figure out 
 which companies will be hurt most if oil stays down amid a relatively 
 warm winter and ample global supply.&quot;Some oil shares have held up 
 better than expected,&quot;says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at 
 Harris Private Bank.&quot;But profit expectations are getting slashed.&quot;He 
 says Hess ( HES ) is vulnerable because it historically has been 
 sensitive to crude-oil prices but lately its shares have held up 
 surprisingly well. Among larger oil companies, ConocoPhillips ( COP ) could 
 be hurt if oil prices keep tumbling, some investors say. Others say that 
 oil-service companies, like Tidewater ( TDW ) could be risky. In 
 previous oil downturns, drilling-co stocks have been hit because they 
 operate with a high degree of operating leverage, or their earnings are 
 most sensitive to moves in oil prices. Larger drilling companies include 
 Grey Wolf ( GW ), Rowan Cos. ( RDC ) and Nabors Industries ( NBR ). 

 Now we&apos;re locked in the cycle of lower prices as we work 
 off supply. And drillers can&apos;t make money and then we stop 
 drilling and then there is no conservation and then the demand starts to 
 outstrip supply and then....

 EIA Update:  Production: USA crude 
 oil refinery inputs averaged 15.1 Mbpd, down 502K bpd w/w; refineries operated at 87.9% of operable capacity last 
 week; gasoline production declined last week compared to the previous 
 week, while distillate fuel production decreased significantly ... Imports: USA crude oil imports averaged nearly 11.1 
 million barrels per day last week, up nearly 1.6 mln bpd w/w; over the last 4 weeks, crude oil imports have 
 averaged 73K bpd y/y; total motor gasoline imports (including both 
 finished gasoline and gasoline blending components) last week averaged 
 over 1.0 million bpd; distillate fuel imports averaged 277K b/d... Inventories: U.S. 
 commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the SPR) jumped by 6.8 mln barrels w/w; 
 USA crude oil inventories are above the upper end of the average range

 1/17/07:  Boone Pickens gives interview on 
 CNBC to discuss oil prices, saying he is not surprised at the 
 pullback, but the depth of the pullback is a surprise to him . Says 
 his equity fund is down 6% YTD, but he hesitates to reset the portfolio. 
 Says he thinks we&apos;ll see a turnaround, and thinks we&apos;re&quot;at the 
 bottom.&quot; Says he thinks the Saudis have already made a cut, as the 
 data they have suggest it looks like they&apos;ve cut 200K barrels per day. 
 Says he can&apos;t believe they would want the price down, when the market 
 can stand $60 oil. 

 1/16/07:  Add 363 heating degree days thru 
 Mid-January. And let&apos;s not forget that January 20th is the 
 midpoint of winter. We are well on our way to the warmest winter 
 in at least 21 years.  

 Crude oil is 
 fast approaching the key psychological level of $50 per barrel . 
 (Scroll down to 12/13/06!!!) The economic picture plays a large 
 role in the direction of crude oil prices (increased demand in a strong 
 economy / reduced demand in a sluggish economy), nonetheless, there are 
 also these factors: [The Bear Case for crude ]: 
 1) Saudi Oil Minister says the crude oil mkt is oversupplied by 1 mln 
 barrels, which has led the mkt to expect another cut of production; if 
 this cut delayed, prices will fall. 2) Warm winter/higher product 
 build. 3) Technically, crude prices are off 33% from highs seen in 
 mid-July and the spot contract has failed to hold many key support 
 levels including $60 (psychological level), $55 (a level many analysts 
 thought would be the bottom) and $52.25 (the June 2005 low). In 
 addition, hedge fund selling continues to plague crude oil prices | [The Bullish Case ]: 1) Crude is still very much 
 subject to headline risk, be it from frequent disruptions of production 
 in Nigeria from militants; Iran&apos;s continued defiance on nuclear weapons; 
 nationalism by Russia, Venezuela, and Ecuador, which would take 
 production off the mkt; the continuing violence in Iraq; and any storm 
 that affects the Gulf of Mexico or any prolonged maintenance issues at 
 refineries or problems with waterways. 2) Any emergency meeting by OPEC 
 ahead of March 15 (next scheduled OPEC meeting) should cause 
 short-covering. If the Saudis change their tune and go for a cut, the 
 prices should move higher. Another cut of greater than 500K bpd may get 
 some shorts nervous, especially ahead of the summer gasoline season. 

 1/15/07:  Lehman Brothers energy 
 analyst Tom Driscoll on Friday cut his 2007 natural gas 
 price outlook 10% to $6.75/MMBtu , saying that the large amount of 
 gas in storage and warm weather could depress gas prices for most of the 
 year . Driscoll warned gas prices 
 could drop even further than his $6.75/MMBtu prediction if gas 
 begins to trade, as it did last year, at a 10-to-1 ratio with crude oil.&quot;The recent warm weather and the natural gas storage overhang, along 
 with the drop in crude prices, have led us to become more concerned 
 about 2007 prices,&quot;Driscoll said.&quot;Recent warm weather and 
 disappointing storage withdrawal rates mean that the market is likely to 
 deal with a large storage overhang for the next six to nine months. A 
 repeat of last year&apos;s winter-end storage levels (and we think winter-end 
 storage will approach last year&apos;s 1,695 Bcf) would likely depress prices 
 until [towards the end of] 2007,&quot;Driscoll said.&quot; A 
 crude oil price in the mid-$50s[/barrel] and a comparable gas-to-oil 
 ratio implies that gas could average as little as $5.50[/MMBtu] over the 
 remainder of &apos;07, &quot;Driscoll speculated. &quot;We are not quite 
 that bearish (we are using $60 crude) but the risks are becoming more 
 apparent.&quot;&quot;Our model indicates that the supply demand balance has 
 gotten 2-3 Bcf/d more bearish in the past several weeks vs. Q4 trends,&quot;Driscoll said, although he couldn&apos;t ascribe the slack supply/demand 
 balance to weaker demand, growing supply, or simply&quot;noise&quot;in his 
 model.&quot;Adjusting the October storage data for the colder weather 
 implies that last week&apos;s storage withdrawal should have been roughly 2 
 Bcf/d stronger than the 7 Bcf/d that was reported,&quot;Driscoll said.&quot;With 
 recent crude oil prices testing $50[/barrel] (vs. an average in the 
 mid-$60s/barrel in 2006), it appears that natural gas prices could be&quot;capped&quot;at prices of $6.00-6.50/MMBtu until mid-summer,&quot;Driscoll 
 concluded. 

 1/12/07:  Congrats to Lafayette on this apparent win against 
 Met-Ed.  IMHO this is a Pyrrhic victory because what we need is 
 someone with the backbone to propose 
 this concept . The Met-Ed clock expires one year after the PPL 
 clock and I&apos;m sure they&apos;re aware of the public outrage that will occur 
 when the PPL rate hikes hit home. Met-Ed is stuck with low cost 
 recovery and the prospect that the golden goose of 2011 will get 
 stalled. 

 I opened some lines of communication with Sunoco, Hess, 
 and HOP to check on NEXT year&apos;s numbers. Sun is quoting $1.21/gal 
 for #6 oil and HOP is around $1.85 for heating oil. Once again, 
 the laddering strategy is very appealing to me for cost containment and $1.85 heating oil certainty doesn&apos;t look too bad for at least 33% of 
 expected draw. 

 OPEC mulls Jan. 20-21 emergency meeting, according to 
 senior delegate - DJ 

 I have to note that this really feels like a 
 weather-driven bottom.  Sunoco&apos;s cash price drops a penny, at best, 
 despite all of these huge moves (-15%) in crude. Htg oil on NYMEX 
 isn&apos;t crashing. And gas prices at the pump aren&apos;t $2. All of 
 these headlines are wonderful if you have the storage capacity to buy 
 all of your oil right now. If you&apos;re a stock investor you know 
 that a price can tick down for 30 days in a row and then gap and go to 
 make new highs. I think the&quot;$15 terror premium&quot;is gone and we&apos;re 
 retracting to a normalized supply/demand price structure. Hedge 
 funds need to find a new sandbox in which to play. 

 1/10/07:  A UGI Gomer Pyle moment...suhprize, 
 suhprize...burn 150,000 mcf and we&apos;ll go for $0.25 DS! Can&apos;t make 
 that decision too quickly, though. Need to crank thru a few 
 scenarios. If we didn&apos;t have a high TETCO basis, I&apos;d be on it like 
 a fly to poop. Every negotiation has to start somewhere and this 
 one isn&apos;t too bad. 

 1/9/07:  Crude is again trading to the 
 downside on concerns that OPEC members will not comply fully with recent 
 production targets slated for Feb 1st (traders also said the recent warm weather coupled with OPEC 
 not cutting production as planned will keep too much oil on the 
 market--something seen as bearish for the complex). OPEC may cancel 
 plans to expand production capacity after crude prices plunged. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Jarrah al-Sabah said today.&quot;Falling prices 
 will damage our economies,&quot;he said.  Feb crude hit an overnight low 
 of $54.06/bbl. Crude is t rading 
 at levels not seen since June 2005 (weighing on crude is 
 speculation that tomorrow&apos;s product inventory data will show very large 
 builds). If $54 fails to hold, the next major support level is $53.68. 
 Nigeria is drawing from its reserve fund to offset losses in oil output. 
 Crude is now under levels that OPEC members feel comfortable with---this 
 could lead to extraordinary meeting very soon. 

 1/8/07:  OPEC should call extraordinary 
 meeting to discuss oil price drop, Venezuelan Oil Min - Reuters;   OPEC, 
 excluding Iraq&apos; cut 195K barrels a day in Dec- Bloomberg 

 Here&apos;s an interesting story on real-time electricity metering/pricing.  

 1/4/07:  Hope you all took a few seconds to 
 read the email on HDDs. Someone at the NYMEX must have seen a copy 
 because we had the biggest one day selloff in crude yesterday in over 20 
 months! It&apos;s interesting to watch the refined product respond...we 
 certainly don&apos;t have huge price moves there, though even the TETCO basis 
 is finally coming down. This is really a good time to be thinking 
 about NEXT year. You can easily get pricing up to 18 months in 
 advance. I&apos;ve already asked UGI for a DS offer thru 12/07. 

 12/31/06:  Happy New Year from T4 
 Engineering. I&apos;m getting ready to check with the National Weather 
 Service to confirm my suspicion that this is the warmest 6-month heating 
 degree day stretch since 1985. Lest we forget about the high 
 prices of last summer, here&apos;s a tidbit to remind you why we don&apos;t&quot;play 
 the market&quot;:  (Worst performing hedge funds of 2006) Amaranth, which had more than $9 billion in assets earlier this 
 year, lost roughly two-thirds 
 of that in September as a lack of hurricanes and warm weather played havoc with Brian 
 Hunter&apos;s huge natural gas trades. Founder Nick Maounis tried to salvage 
 the firm, but by the end of September he decided to shut down, saying 
 the market had turned against him. Amaranth wasn&apos;t alone in falling prey 
 to the volatility of energy markets in 2006. MotherRock, an energy hedge 
 fund run by the former president of the New York Mercantile Exchange J. Robert Collins, shut down after losing $230 million in June 
 and July in the natural gas market.  

 12/18/06:  I&apos;m not even going to comment on 
 the lunacy of Saturday&apos;s Morning Call headline except to note that 
 nobody is&quot;losing money&quot;and a record of prepay as the correct move 11 
 out of the past 12 years is pretty good. You don&apos;t lock to&quot;beat 
 the market&quot;, you lock to prevent a price surge.  

 TINSFAAL (There is no such thing as a free lunch). Note this story about folks 
 now burning wood. 

 UGI is pretty coy about the A-town gas 
 explosion...&quot;rookie mistake&quot;? Hello? I&apos;d be willing to bet 
 that this kid was told either gas service was already shut off or that 
 it was a low pressure service. Personally, I&apos;ve not seen 60 psig 
 (or medium pressure) gas INSIDE a building anywhere. It&apos;s always 
 reduced at least twice. What are the odds that a contracted gas 
 worker carries a shutoff key and/or is even permitted to turn the valve 
 in the street? 

 12/14/06:  Despite some members stating 
 publicly that they did not back a cut (Kuwait), Reuters is reporting 
 that OPEC has agreed to cut 500,000 bpd as of Feb 1 (Qatar Oil Minister 
 confirmed this but no formal OPEC still has been announced). Saudi 
 Arabia&apos;s Oil Minister says supply and demand NOT in balance. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said oil service cos are sapping 
 profits generated in OPEC nations as costs to explore and produce oil 
 deposits soar; also said OPEC should cooperate more in the upstream 
 industry to reduce the dominance of foreign companies. 

 12/13/06: Prognostication #3... $53 
 oil by 2008 . 

 12/12/06:  Kuwait says most OPEC members 
 satisfied with $60pbl crude yet OPEC Pres Daukoru says $60 crude is&quot;low&quot;and he said prices can be&quot;better&quot;. Iran Oil Minister says oil 
 below $60 is not appropriate. 

 12/11/06: Another week, another 
 prognostication:  Globe and Mail reports Merrill Lynch cut its estimate 
 for oil prices next year, because of slower economic growth and 
 increasing supply, but hiked its target for the commodity in 2008 on 
 expectations demand will rebound . The investment bank now sees 
 oil at $60 a barrel, down from its previous forecast of $65 a barrel, 
 and crude rising to $62 a barrel in 2008, from its earlier prediction of 
 just $50 a barrel. Merrill also 
 boosted its forecast for natural gas in 2007 and 2008 

 12/8/06: Would we expect a different statement?  US Energy Secretary says OPEC should not cut production when it 
 meets next week - Reuters  

 12/6/06: Another prognostication! Back in 
 October I mentioned the fact the the US EIA has all of the facts and 
 figures in the world but the one thing they never get right is price!!!  US natural gas consumption is projected to grow to 26.1 Tcf by 
 2030, the US Energy Information Administration said Tuesday in its 2007 
 Annual Energy Outlook. The newest forecast is below the 29.6 Tcf the 
 agency predicted in its 2006 outlook for 2030 and is well below the 
 projections of 30 Tcf or more included in AEO references cases of 
 several years ago, largely because of the effect of higher projected gas 
 prices, EIA said. In its latest AEO, EIA said it expects the real 
 wellhead price of gas to fall from current levels to just under $5/Mcf 
 in 2005 dollars by 2013 as increased drilling brings on new supplies and new import 
 sources become available. After 2013, the AEO sees wellhead prices 
 increasing gradually, to about 
 $6/Mcf in 2030, a price equivalent to $9.63/Mcf in nominal dollars . 
 The agency said major contributors to anticipated growth in gas supply 
 include liquefied natural gas imports, the completion of an Alaskan 
 natural gas pipeline in 2018 and domestic unconventional production. The 
 outlook said LNG imports are expected to rise from 0.6 Tcf in 2005 to 
 4.5 Tcf in 2030, while Alaska production will reach 2.2 Tcf by 2030 and 
 unconventional production will grow to 10.2 Tcf by the same year. 

 12/5/06:  According to the WSJ Online, 
 investors are pouring billions of dollars into&quot;renewable&quot;energy 
 sources such as ethanol, biodiesel and solar power that promise to 
 reduce the world&apos;s reliance on petroleum. But exploiting these 
 alternatives may produce unintended environmental and economic 
 consequences that offset the expected benefits. Some experts are also 
 concerned that crops for biofuels will compete with other farmland, 
 possibly driving up global costs of basic food production. It&apos;s not 
 clear how serious these problems will become -- or whether they 
 eventually will be resolved through new technologies and stricter 
 environmental measures. Proponents of alternative energy, including some 
 palm oil industry executives, say the dangers are exaggerated and are 
 outweighed by the benefits new fuels promise. David Pimentel, Cornell 
 University Professor, argues that expanding corn production for biofuels 
 would deplete water resources and pollute soils with added fertilizer 
 and chemicals. It would also require huge volumes of traditional energy 
 for farming equipment and ethanol-conversion facilities -- a toll that 
 could nullify gains from the less-polluting fuel produced. 

 12/4/06:  You should pay attention to this chart . This price isn&apos;t taking 
 off because it&apos;s a dividend play...it&apos;s because the market expects big 
 results in the future. Smart money knows that your wallet will 
 fatten their coffers.  

   Saudi 
 Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said crude inventories are too high on 
 Friday. Yesterday he was making some big statements that should 
 be listened to.&quot; I agree that we 
 have to take 100 mln barrels out of the market ,&apos;&apos; Naimi told 
 reporters in Cairo yesterday, where there is a meeting of Arab oil 
 ministers, without specifying how that should be done. Iran is also calling for a production cut from OPEC (between 500K 
 and 1mln bopd on top of the 1.2mln cut in Nov). Yesterday Iran&apos;s OPEC 
 Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told the state-run Islamic Republic 
 News Agency,&quot;A fall in world economic growth, a drop in international 
 oil demand against OPEC and International Energy Agency estimates as 
 well as an unexpected output rise by non-OPEC oil producers, which is 
 predicted to continue in 2007, and accumulation of oil reserves and 
 products all indicate that the 
 oil market needs a new output cut, &apos;&apos; Kazempour told IRNA today. 
 Lyba, Qatar and Kuwait&apos;s oil ministers made comments over the weekend 
 that also indicated oil inventories are too high (suggesting a rate cut 
 in Dec). 

 According to the NY Post, Goldman Sachs is putting its 
 Horizon Wind Energy subsidiary up for sale, in a bet that the market for 
 renewable energy is nearing a top . According to energy news 
 website Sparkspread.com , which first reported the sale, Goldman 
 might get around $1.5 bln for the Houston, Texas based company. Goldman 
 is pitching the co as possibly being able to throw off $800 mln in 
 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization 
 by 2011. A more traditional financial valuation, Ebitda, is expected to 
 come in at around $400 mln by then. To get that cash flow from wind 
 energy, Goldman is assuming that Horizon will control 14% of all wind 
 generation developed in the U.S. since 2000. Those figures also assume 
 that 2,100 megawatts of additional generation capacity is added by 2010.

 12/1/06: We have an awful lot of nervous 
 government wonks out there this morning:  Saudi Oil Min says 
 oil mkt&quot;significantly&quot;out of balance - DJ  |   U.S. 
 Energy Secretary - OPEC doesn&apos;t need to cut output at Sec meeting, 
 markets still need OPEC&apos;s 
 oil - Reuters |  OPEC won&apos;t have accurate info on U.S. 
 stocks by Dec meet, risks &apos;inaccurate&apos; decision on output cut, EIA - Reuters  

 T4 opinion: we&apos;re over the $60&quot;balance point&quot;and 
 markets usually fall farther than expected and rise higher. With 
 that stated, where is conservation? I think the only reason we&apos;re 
 stagnant is this delayed onset of winter weather. Time will tell.  We&apos;re switching from gas to oil today. I have to burn 1.2 MG 
 over the next 4 months and I have 180K in the ground under a buck. 

 11/30/06:  Crude is up 19 cents to $62.65 / 
 bbl. Cooler weather expected to hit over the next few days coupled w/ 
 the lowest distillate supplies since Aug has crude oil at 2-month highs . 
 Natural gas is off 13 cents to $8.74mmbtu.  Libya says OPEC should seek to 
 keep oil prices between $57 and $63 a barrel (Libya, an OPEC 
 member, produced 1.72 Mbpd in Oct).  

 Friedman Billings notes Wednesday&apos;s DOE petroleum 
 inventories report for the week ending Nov 24 was positive for refiners, 
 as the administration reported 
 decline in gasoline and distillate inventories vs. consensus 
 expectations for rises in both, driven by rising consumption and lower 
 supply. Product inventories have declined 8% over the past eight weeks 
 and are now only 1% above year-ago levels, and firm expects this 
 positive trend to continue in Dec. 

 11/29/06: Can you say soup-to-nuts?  Pepco Energy Services, a subsidiary of POM and a leader in energy 
 savings performance contracting, will implement a comprehensive energy 
 performance contracting program for Salisbury University, located on the 
 Eastern Shore of Maryland. The 15-year contract calls for Pepco Energy Services to provide 
 energy conservation measures in the majority of buildings, dormitories 
 and facilities on the Salisbury campus. As part of the performance 
 contract, Pepco Energy Services will design and build a new central 
 chilled water plant, install high-efficiency lighting, provide 
 comprehensive upgrades of the plumbing fixtures and complete building 
 envelope work on 45 buildings throughout the campus. Final design 
 efforts are underway, and construction is expected to be completed by 
 the end of 2007. 

 11/28/06:  WTI crude is likely to remain 
 above $50/barrel for the next few years as spare production 
 capacity remains tight and oil companies battle for access to upstream 
 reserves, the IEA&apos;s chief economist Fatih Birol said Tuesday. &quot;We 
 do not expect prices will come down (below) $50/barrel in WTI terms,&quot;Birol told an industry conference in London. &quot;We would like to see 
 prices lower than that,&quot;he said, but&quot;it would be a surprising trend if 
 we see prices lower than $50 in the next few years.&quot;Even if all upstream 
 projects currently being planned&quot;see the light of day by 2010,&quot; current spare capacity of 2 
 million b/d will only reach 3 million b/d, he said. At the 
 same time, non-OPEC oil 
 production is expected to peak&quot;within the next ten years or so.&quot; As a result, OPEC&apos;s share of 
 world oil supply will rise from around 40% today to reach about 50% in 
 2030, &quot;enhancing OPEC&apos;s role in having influence on global oil 
 prices,&quot;he said. OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq are 
 likely to be critical to future supply growth, he said. But he 
 added that the investment framework and geopolitical environment 
 currently&quot;makes us uncomfortable.&quot; In terms of investment,&quot;the 
 global capital is there,&quot;but the question is whether or not projects 
 and the capital&quot;will meet,&quot;he said. &quot;In terms of availability of 
 reserves, we have no problem,&quot;especially in the Middle East.&quot;But we 
 see a major barrier,&quot;he said, saying this was&quot;access of foreign 
 capital to reserves.&quot; More than 60% of upstream investment is 
 needed just to maintain current capacity, which is why&quot;spare production 
 capacity in 2010 will not be comforting.&quot;This, Birol said, is&quot; why 
 we do not expect oil prices to come down significantly in the next three 
 or four years .&quot; Supply growth from Saudi Arabia and Iran 
 together will only be enough to meet Chinese demand growth, he added. 

 January crude closes up +1.08% to $60.97, January nat 
 gas closes up +2.43% to $8.56, January heating oil closes up +1.05% to

 11/21/06: URGENT!  Please read this story on the electric markets. 

 Wow! Here&apos;s another timely story on what could 
 conceivably be the reason that T4 exists ! 

 11/20/06: Big news out today if you use copper 
 wire.  Freeport-McMoRan to acquire Phelps Dodge; Co and 
 Phelps Dodge announce that they have signed a definitive merger 
 agreement under which FCX will acquire Phelps Dodge for approx $ 25.9 
 bln in cash and stock. This seems to be the name of the 
 game in commodities...own as much as you can and control the price.  

 11/16/06:  Houston, we have a disconnect from 
 reality here :  Crude is trading off $2.22 to $56.54; hits 2006 low of $56.43 ; 
 which is all well and good, but refined products are moving UP . Current #6 oil price is $1.15. Hate to keep beating a dead horse, 
 but NOW is the time to think about NEXT HEATING SEASON.  

 Friedman Billings notes 
 Wednesday&apos;s DOE petroleum inventories report, for the week ended Nov 10, 
 was positive for refiners, as the administration reported a l arge 
 decline in total refined product inventories , driven by strong consumption and reduced 
 supplies . Over the past four weeks, total refined product demand 
 has been, on avg, 4.5% above comparable year-ago levels. Total refined product 
 inventories, adjusted for demand, are now only 1% above the historical 
 three-year avg. 

 11/15/06: T4 is not a registered investment 
 advisor, however, I&apos;d like to pass this along for your own due 
 diligence:  

 Prudential notes that NYMEX Holdings is the holding 
 company for the NYMEX, a large energy derivatives exchange (84% of 
 volume), and COMEX, a large metals exchange (16% of volume). They note 
 that over four-fifths of rev is driven by volume, of which the three 
 largest derivatives contracts (WTI, Natural Gas, Gold) make up nearly 
 three-quarters. The firm thinks valuation will likely reflect above 
 trend growth and takeout potential. The firm says pricing of the IPO is 
 currently estimated at $54-$57, but they believe this could be low 
 given above trend growth and potential for takeover. They note that 
 unlike other derivatives exchanges that have monopolies in their core 
 derivatives contracts with little threat of substitution or competing 
 products, NYMEX faces competition in both energy and metals. On the 
 energy side, they say NYMEX faces competition primarily from the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and also from a more limited 
 standpoint from other global exchanges. On the metals side, they 
 note NYMEX faces competition from the CBOT (BOT) and the London 
 Metals Exchange. 

 11/13/06:  Calpers approves first investments 
 in commodities ;  Bloomberg reports the largest US 
 public pension will invest $500 mln in oil, metals and other commodities 
 for the first time.  T4: What have I been mentioning all 
 year??? 

 Saudi Arabia to continue 
 enforcing its full share of OPEC oil cut through Dec; Gulf Source |    Bodman says U.S. will need more oil to meet winter 
 heating demand - Reuters 

 WSJ reports a new Rand 
 Corp. study showing the falling costs of ethanol, wind power and other 
 forms of renewable energy predicts such sources could furnish as much as 
 25% of the U.S.&apos;s conventional energy by 2025 at little or no additional 
 expense. A second renewable-energy report soon to be released by the 
 National Academy of Sciences suggests wood chips may become a plentiful 
 source of ethanol and electricity for industrial nations because their 
 forested areas are expanding, led by the U.S. and China. Because use of 
 renewable fuels to replace oil and cut emissions of carbon dioxide is an 
 area on which Congress&apos;s coming Democratic leadership and the Bush 
 administration agree, the studies are likely to hasten efforts to 
 increase production incentives next year, either in a new energy bill or 
 a farm bill. The Rand study concludes that because prices for gasoline, 
 natural gas and coal are likely to remain high, their cost advantage 
 over renewables will erode, furthered by the hope that ethanol from farm 
 wastes will be available by 2020. 

 11/10/06:   Reuters reports world oil markets will tighten 
 in Q4 as OPEC cuts supply and peak winter demand kicks in , the 
 International Energy Agency said on Friday. The world&apos;s demand for oil will rise 
 2.4 mln barrels per day in the last three months of this year 
 from the third quarter, the agency said in its Oil Market Report. That 
 is 400,000 bpd higher than the agency 
 forecast last month 

 11/9/06:  LA Times: General Motor&apos;s 
 new electric car, to be unveiled as a prototype early next year, would use an onboard 
 internal-combustion engine as a generator to produce electricity to extend the range of the vehicle&apos;s rechargeable batteries;  finally 
 they&apos;re getting their act together... 

 Crude is trading&gt;$60 again. Before you get swayed by the talking heads, take a look at these charts . Pay particular attention to sheets 16&amp;18. The OPEC cuts are 
 beginning to be felt by the market. Remember, we aren&apos;t conserving 
 anything. There was an oversupply situation and it&apos;s been 
 addressed. 

 11/8/06:  E.I.A. Statistics -Update : The 
 E.I.A. reports that crude oil inventories had a build of 435K barrels (Bloomberg consensus was build of 750K barrels); gasoline 
 inventories had a draw of 584K mln barrels 
 (Bloomberg consensus was unchanged); distillate inventories had a draw of 2.675 mln barrels (Bloomberg 
 consensus was draw of 800K barrels). 

 Mercury News reports car culture 
 beat out eco-consciouness as Californians voted down an oil production tax that promised money for 
 alternative energy research . Despite drawing endorsements 
 from celebrities and a former president, Proposition 87 lost Tuesday 
 after becoming the subject of the costliest ballot initiative campaign 
 in state history. With nearly three-quarters of precincts reporting, 56% 
 of voters opposed the measure, which would have imposed a tax on cos 
 that drill for oil in California . The $4 bln raised would have gone 
 toward loans, grants and subsidies to promote alternative fuels and more 
 energy-efficient vehicles. Oil cos led by Chevron ( CVX ) and Aera 
 Energy raised nearly $100 mln in their effort to defeat the so-called 
 oil tax. Supporters spent more than $57 mln, most of it contributed by 
 Hollywood producer Stephen Bing. Their pitch: It would help wean the state from its reliance on foreign oil while 
 helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

 All OPEC 
 ministers have pledged sincerely to implement their cut in full from 
 actual production, an OPEC delegate said Wednesday.&quot; The 
 EIA is wrong, &quot;the 
 delegate told reporters in Abu Dhabi. The US Energy Information 
 Administration in its Short Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday 
 forecasted OPEC 10&apos;s production for November at 27.025 million b/d, down 
 745,000 b/d from the agency&apos;s estimate of the cartel&apos;s output in 
 October. That means the group will fall 455,000 b/d short of its planned 
 1.2 million cut, which went into effect November 1, EIA said. OPEC 
 decided last month in Doha, Qatar, to cut production by 1.2 million b/d 
 from November 1, using a baseline of 27.5 million b/d for the OPEC 10 
 and putting their new limit at 26.3 million b/d. While the cartel listed 
 how much each country was to cut, it did not disclose specific overall 
 production targets for its members. A Saudi delegate earlier stressed 
 that the kingdom had implemented its 380,000 b/d cut in full. Meanwhile, 
 Qatari oil minister Abdullah Al-Attiyah in response to the EIA report 
 said:&quot;I cannot say now. We have to wait until we meet in Abuja.&quot;(OPEC 
 is due to meet in the Nigerian capital of Abuja December 14) 

 T4: Once and again, why are we so arrogant as to think that OPEC has no 
 control over its members? Wishful thinking? 

 11/7/06:  Oil prices are now &apos;reasonable&apos;; its 
 too early to decide on second round of cuts according to U.A.E oil 
 minister- Bloomberg 

 11/2/06:  Here&apos;s an interesting blurb from 
 Fidelity Investments entitled:  Oil Markets and the 
 Middle East.   Decent read. 

 Graphic support of the 
 original T4&quot;September is natural gas month&quot;email alert . The 
 support break initiated a day-by-day look at futures pricing. It 
 took nearly a full month to get the Cedar Crest deal done. 

 11/1/06:  Here&apos;s a lengthy study ( Warning! 
 1.5MB download ) on why electric prices 
 are increasing. 

 The EIA reports that crude oil 
 inventories had a build of 1.91 Mbbls 
 (Bloomberg consensus:  build of 2.6 
 Mbbls); gasoline inventories had a draw of 
 2.80 Mbbls (Bloomberg: draw of 925 Kbbls); 
 distillate inventories had a draw of 2.72 
 Mbbls (Bloomberg: draw of 1.175 Mbbls). 

 Is this too simplistic a 
 thought?....If PPL can EARN $226 Million in 3 months in a regulated 
 environment, then why do we need deregulation? &quot; Dampening 
 earnings growth, the company reported lower synfuel profits, unrealized 
 hedging losses and higher operation and maintenance expenses. These 
 factors outweighed higher electricity delivery margins in its domestic 
 business and deferred income tax adjustments in its international 
 business, the company said.  Yet their PROFIT rose on higher 
 energy margins. Umm, what&apos;s a margin? It&apos;s the difference 
 between cost of production and sale price. They&apos;re making a 
 killing in a still-regulated arena and crying about the need to increase 
 rates 30%. 

 The Edison Electric Institute is a lobbying group for 
 utilities...their solution to higher prices?  Conserve . Nowhere does it 
 say anything about re-regulation or combining assets to give consumers a 
 better price. Nope. Conserve and/or face higher prices. Thanks guys! 

 10/31/06:  This was get the paperwork done 
 day for Cedar Crest. Great deal. 12 month gas @ $9.10 city 
 gate. UGI came in with a $2.30 delivery offer. Gasmark was $0.50 
 higher, but offered decent savings for the NT rate, so it&apos;s a win-win. 

 10/30/06:  The Observer reports 
 multinational oil cos are having a tough time. Crude prices are falling, 
 maintaining production is a struggle, yet taxes set by the world&apos;s 
 resource-rich nations are rising - as are costs. Topping it all is a 
 rising trend of energy nationalism stretching round the globe. The 
 problems raise several linked questions in the minds of experts: is this 
 a taste of the future for the majors such as Exxon,Shell,and BP? More provocatively, is there a future for these cos as we know them? Or 
 will they have to change what they do dramatically - even merge, as 
 Shell and BP are rumored to be considering, to create super-giant cos? 

 10/27/06:  Reuters reports that coalition 
 naval forces in the Gulf have been deployed to counter a possible seaborne threat to Saudi Arabia Ras Tanura&apos;s terminal, which is the world&apos;s biggest offshore oil 
 facility , the UK&apos;s Royal Navy said on Friday. The navy issued a 
 warning in a statement to merchant shipping as precautionary measure 
 after receiving intelligence of a possible threat. 

 Off-topic:  NY Times reports E85, a blend of 
 85% corn-based ethanol and 15% gasoline, could be eating away at metal 
 and plastic parts in pumps being used to dispense the fuel at gasoline 
 stations , Underwriters Laboratories, the private product-safety 
 testing group, said this month. BP said on Thursday that it would delay 
 the expansion of E85 at its American gasoline outlets until the 
 laboratories certified an E85 dispensing system. Underwriters 
 Laboratories and the Department of Energy are holding two days of 
 hearings next week at the testing group&apos;s headquarters outside Chicago, 
 inviting oil cos, automakers and researchers to help develop standards 
 for E85 equipment. Underwriters Laboratories has temporarily withdrawn 
 authorization for the U.L.-approved label on parts used in E85 
 dispensers. Those dispensers, it turns out, were modified from regular 
 gasoline dispensers and were certified only for a maximum of 15% ethanol 
 concentration; U.L. said it had never certified any E85-specific pumps. 

 10/26/06: Here&apos;s a graphic view of recent activity on 
 my fuel plan. 

 Natural Gas Inventory rose 19 bcf to 3461 bcf, analysts 
 were expecting inventories a build of 29 bcf, ranging from a build of 
 20-50 bcf. Crude oil trading at the upper end of this morning&apos;s 
 range of 61.20-61.65... now 61.60 +0.20.  OPEC should cut 300k 
 barrels more in Dec, Ramirez says - Bloomberg 

 T4 opinion: the window of opportunity is now 
 closed. Gas bottomed the week of 10/2, as previously opined.  Anything you do now is trend-following. I&apos;m going to update the 
 chart at left on Monday mornings. Next stop is $65 crude. Support should be $60. We&apos;ll see... 

 10/25/06:  Crude closed up $2.02 or 3.4% or 
 $61.37pbl; JanNG rose 37 cents to $8.70mbtu; heating oil rose 4.38 cents 
 to $1.7390/gal.  Sub-$2 heating oil for 2007 just disappeared .  

 Please take a look at the expanded 
 table by clicking on the link under the table to the left. 

 The E.I.A. reports that crude oil inventories had a  draw of 3.21 Mbbls (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 3.0 Mbbls); gasoline inventories had a draw of 2.76 Mbbls (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 550Kbbls); distillate inventories had a draw of 1.42 Mbbls (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 1.5 Mbbls).  Crude oil 
 trades to new session highs following inventory data, now 60.30 +0.95. 

 T4 opinion: congrats USA...we&apos;re sucking the fuel straw 
 hard again. Low prices = zero conservation.  

 10/24/06:  Take a look at the table on the 
 left side...I heard your comments at the LVAIC meeting and hope this is 
 a first step. You want to know when to push the oil button vs. 
 gas? It depends. The gas cost in the table EXCLUDES UGI. You need to understand what their delivery cost will be to make an 
 informed decision. mkt = current market prices, i.e. cash, 
 spot, rack, whatever; delivery is included on oil . 07 = calendar 2007 cost if you locked today; also includes delivery, except 
 for natural gas, which is city gate, which excludes UGI. Right 
 now, this table says you should think about gas in 2007. There are 
 lots of little iterations that can change the balance...gas is more 
 expensive Nov-Mar and cheaper Apr-Oct...as is basis...let&apos;s see if this 
 stimulates any discussion. 

 10/23/06:  Crude is weaker this morning b/c 
 there is much speculation OPEC will cut less than they said last week 
 (London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies, founded by a former 
 Saudi oil minister, said OPEC&apos;s oil production cuts will be&quot;significantly less&quot;than the agree size of the reduction. OPEC is 
 trying to defend oil prices from falling below $55pbl). Saudi Arabia did 
 say it will trim its oil exports to Japan, its largest customer, by 8% 
 (1st cut in more than 2 yrs). Crude is off 69 cents to $58.64pbl 
 (range is 58.26 to 59.47), and natural gas is up 4 cents to 
 $7.28mbtu (range is 7.102 to 7.40). Cooler temps throughout the week in 
 the Midwest are expected and the speculation is boosting natty&apos;s appeal.  

 T4 opinion: prices usually end up higher than expected AND lower than 
 expected... gas dipped into the $5.36 area briefly and 21 days later and 
 we&apos;re at $7.28! Clearly, we need to work off the oversupply, but 
 betting against OPEC without either a tax to spark conservation or some 
 alternative energy play seems foolish. 

 Here&apos;s another follow-up story 
 from the NYT regarding electricity deregulation and power plants as blue chip stocks .  

 10/20/06:  Details of the OPEC cut, from Platts... 

 Schlumberger (equipment supplier) comments: &apos;High 
 levels of natural gas storage in N.America with consequent volatility in 
 the price of natural gas have recently begun to impact activity, 
 particularly in the areas of higher cost methane and shallow gas 
 production in Canada. This is not yet materially impacted our activity. 
 However, if the coming winter fails to stimulate strong natural gas 
 demand, there is a growing likelihood of excess equipment capacity and 
 the pressure pumping business at some point in 2007. Activity growth 
 elsewhere for both oil and gas will remain strong as our customers 
 continue to fight the decline curves and bring in new fields&apos;... co is 
 not seeing any effect on pricing so far due to slowdowns in N. 
 America... &apos;Asked for view on recent OPEC cuts and pricing 
 discussions: View is 
 that the whole position of the oil price and the pessimism that 
 surrounds it has been completely overplayed; true that U.S. crude and 
 product inventories are high but if you look across the world, they are 
 not very high; if you look at demand, there is no significant sign of 
 weakness in demand; think OPEC is defending the price but I don&apos;t think 
 there is a huge danger of a price collapse and as we&apos;ve always said we 
 don&apos;t need $65 oil for our customer&apos;s spending plans to be maintained . 
 They will maintain them at a much lower price because the basic issue of 
 renewing supply has not really changed very much&apos;. 

 10/19/06:  Why are we so ambivalent toward 
 UGI? Because I cut a gas deal that requires Cedar Crest to install 
 telemetry. And of course UGI won&apos;t even initiate the work order 
 until they have the stupid $976 check in their hands, thereby delaying 
 installation beyond another billing cycle. This would never fly at 
 PPL. At least they have Esther! The closest thing to instant 
 turnaround. 

 10/18/06:  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
 and the Chicago Board of Trade, longtime fierce competitors, said 
 Tuesday that they would merge in an $8 billion deal creating the largest market 
 for financial derivatives contracts in the world. 

 OPEC may need to cut again by 2Q &apos;07, according to OPEC 
 research director ; Mkt now oversupplied by 1.5 mln B/D; 2Q &apos;07 global oil surplus seen 2.5 
 mln B/D.  DowJones | Friedman Billings says Wednesday&apos;s DOE 
 petroleum inventories report for the week ended October 13 was positive 
 for refiners, with the administration reporting much larger-than-expected decline in 
 gasoline and distillate inventories due to favorable year-over-year 
 demand growth and materially lower supply (production and imports) .  Let&apos;s not forget an old Wall Street axiom: the market is always 
 looking 6 months ahead...futures are barely moving on this news. I&apos;m hoping for a tweak, as in tuning a loop...cut too far and throw in a 
 geopolitical event and we&apos;re back to $75. 

 Production: US refinery inputs 
 averaged 14.8Mbpd, down 483Kbpd w/w; refineries at 86.3% of their operable capacity ; 
 ( remember T Boone&apos;s comments???) gasoline production rose 
 slightly last week compared to the previous week, while distillate fuel 
 production declined... Imports: U.S. crude oil imports averaged 
 over 10.4Mbpd, up 66,000 w/w ; Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports have averaged 
 10.6Mbpd; total gasoline imports last week averaged 676Kbpd, the lowest 
 weekly average since the week ending November 25, 2005; distillate fuel 
 imports averaged 271Kbpd... Inventories: U.S. commercial 
 crude oil inventories rose by 5.1 Mbbls compared to the previous week; U.S. Crude oil inventories 
 remain well above the upper end of the average range for this time of 
 year ; total motor gasoline inventories remain above the upper end 
 of the average range; distillate inventories remain well above the upper 
 end of the average range; regular and ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel 
 inventories fell by a combined 4Mbbls, while high-sulfur distillate fuel 
 (heating oil) inventories fell by 0.5Mbbls; total commercial petroleum 
 inventories remain well above the upper end of the average range for 
 this time of year... Demand: Over the last four weeks, 
 motor gasoline demand is up 3.1% 
 y/y; Distillate fuel demand is up 5.0% 
 y/y; Jet fuel demand is up 3.7% 
 y/y.  Hopefully, we can all do the math...refineries are 
 running 14.8Mbpd while we import 10.4Mbpd; 70%. I&apos;m not sure why 
 the media paints OPEC as ineffective. The USA produces only 
 30% of what we consume. If you spent 70% more than you took home, 
 you&apos;d be in trouble! We have good news on a short term basis 
 due to excess supply. Period. 

 10/17/06:  Morgan Keegan notes that 
 according to yesterday&apos;s Wall Street Journal , the North American 
 Electric Reliability Council reports that electricity demand is 
 increasing faster than resources are being added. They say the article 
 suggest that this trend could lead to federally mandated electrical 
 infrastructure investment under the 2005 Energy Policy Act. 

 Crude oil is up 17 cents to $60.11pbl; there is a 
 lot of speculation in the market that OPEC&apos;s 1 mln barrel cut will come 
 from actual production not formal quotas. Natural gas  up $0.46 to 
 $6.90mbtu. 

 10/16/06:  Great minds think alike? Here&apos;s the Sunday NY Times cover story about electric deregulation . It&apos;s 
 so simple, yet they can&apos;t make the connection. Power is real time. It can&apos;t be stored. The auction pricing system is exactly what 
 attracted big money. At least my message about the failure of the 
 concept is mirrored by many others in this story.  Today&apos;s follow-up story deals with the grid. 

 One full week after requesting a DS offer for Cedar 
 Crest, I finally get a call back from UGI. The good news is that Rich 
 Kiernan is our single point of contact for schools...the bad news is he 
 can&apos;t approve anything. It&apos;s important to have the right delivered 
 price of the alternate fuel ready when he calls. Aim high and you 
 hurt yourself. Aim low and let them challenge the number. 

 This is just so typical:  Chicago Tribune reports as President Bush promotes ethanol as a green alternative to 
 gasoline, his administration is quietly relaxing environmental rules for 
 dozens of new corn-to-fuel refineries sprouting up across the nation. 
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is planning to change the 
 way ethanol plants are treated under the Clean Air Act , a move 
 critics say could make it easier for the burgeoning industry to evade 
 controls that dramatically reduce toxic air pollution. The shift in 
 policy would give a break to agricultural conglomerates and newcomers 
 seeking to cash in quickly on the nation&apos;s growing thirst for renewable 
 fuel. More than 40 new ethanol plants are expected to be built during 
 the next year, boosting U.S. production by 30%. Environmental groups 
 think one of the motives behind the new rule is to make it easier to 
 change the type of fuel used to produce ethanol. Most of the industry 
 now relies on natural gas, but several in the planning stages would burn 
 coal, which is less expensive but produces far more pollution.  Gee, think they&apos;ll have to get an analysis of each fuel load??? 

 10/12/06:  I 
 fought the gas company and the gas company won.   They&apos;re 
 only serving a measly 215K customers, but they asked for and won a rate 
 increase. The PUC is not issuing very many rate DECREASE notices 
 on the tariff side. 

 10/11/06:  Here&apos;s another weapon in my 
 arsenal...today, I started the process to get my 180,000 gallons of empty 
 storage in the ground filled.  At $0.99 . That&apos;s 
 nearly enough for Apr-Jun 07. I would fill my tanks to the gills 
 with whatever backup fuel you need because the price is right. I 
 know many of you have little to no storage and this hurts. The 
 cost to put my big tanks in the ground is nearly meaningless given their 
 50-year life and the ability to play the dual fuel card. 180,000 
 gallons is two full weeks of consumption at single digit outside air 
 temps.  

 T. Boone Pickens appears on CNBC, 
 says sees oil going to $70 before it goes to $50. See 4/25/06 
 comment. Why does he have to hem and haw all the time? I 
 like the $60 number for stability. Supply and demand are in 
 balance. Why not $50? Because there are no alternatives and 
 many conservation initiatives are stalled. US imports aren&apos;t 
 dropping. 

 10/10/06:  I&apos;m want to open a line of 
 communication on call options, which are price insurance policies. &quot;I&apos;ll buy forward my next (month/quarter/year) of (heating oil, #4 oil, 
 #6 oil, gas) requirements for $x.xx, unless the price declines.&quot; This is what a call option gets you. There are a lot of other 
 derivatives, but this statement seems to cover nearly all LVAIC schools. I&apos;m working on a presentation to decide if it&apos;s right for everyone. For example, LVAIC heating oil vols need to exceed 42,000 gallons in a 
 given month, which equates to Dec-Mar.  The current delivered price for 
 heating oil for all of 2007 could be locked today for $2.05 .  This is why we need to 
 discuss risk management. If you&apos;re budgeted for $2.50, what do you 
 do? You know my position...I&apos;d lock either 50% of the whole year 
 or 80-90% of the winter. There is NO hard&amp;fast rule. It 
 all depends on your level of risk. If nobody had locked this year, 
 you might be enjoying some savings right now on market price...with 100% 
 risk. A lock is a hedge against price risk. You have 0 risk 
 of prices above budget. I think the proper approach is to buy 
 calls for Dec-Mar, which set a cap on the price. More to follow... 

 If you&apos;re wondering about the technicals behind the 
 bottom call, here&apos;s some details from the high-powered seminar at the NYMEX that I attended last week. 

 10/9/06:  Still sorting thru tons of 
 information. Here are some interesting facts from producers: in East Texas, the cost to pull 1 mcf out of the ground is $4.50; and 
 the average cost of gas in storage is $6.65. 

 Natural gas 
 continues its march toward $7; now at session highs of $6.68mbtu, up 25 
 cents. 

 10/5/06: I apologize if this is late, but I 
 firmly believe the bottom is in place (from Tuesday&apos;s session) on 
 natural gas.  Contrary to the story in the Morning Call, this is 
 NOT a bubble. I met face-to-face with top traders in natural gas 
 at the NY Mercantile Exchange. This is not a hedge fund story. Watch the prices rise over the next month. The cross currents that 
 lead to price discovery are vast and hundreds of extremely bright 
 analysts are constantly feeding market-makers, who assume the burden of 
 actually making the market in gas. My charts say we bottomed on 
 Tuesday. Let&apos;s watch how well I do because I was told that 
 consultants NEVER back check their recommendations! 

 Crude oil rallied off 7-month lows because OPEC 
 will cut production by a million barrels a day. You knew it was 
 coming. If you&apos;re a trader, you would be long. 

 10/3/06:  Thanks to Larry Stallica of BOC 
 for this graphic 
 presentation of the status of electric restructuring across the USA . Anyone see the irony? Thanks Enron. In retrospect, the sales 
 pitch was quite simple...deregulation will lower your cost. I sure 
 wish PA had the guts to admit the mistake and join the&quot;suspended&quot;or&quot;repealed&quot;clubs! 

 Your humble consultant will be out of the area on 10/4 
 and 10/5 to attend a training session on collars, caps, and futures at 
 the New York Mercantile Exchange. Yes, at the NYMEX, on the floor! This will be covered in depth at our quarterly update meeting. 

 9/29/06:  OPEC spokesman says Nigerian oil 
 supply cut appears unilateral, no OPEC agreement to curb output; says 
 other OPEC supplier cuts would be voluntary and remain to be seen - Reuters  Crude oil is off 37 cents to $62.39pbl; OPEC may have drawn a line in 
 the sand that it does not want oil under $60 (group talking about&quot;voluntary&quot;production cuts by members) ; Nigeria will lower 
 exports by 5% starting 10/1 (speculation is growing that other OPEC 
 members may make similar moves next week); Statoil, Norway&apos;s largest oil 
 co, cut its oil and gas production targets for 2006 and 2007 by 3%; OPEC to issue a statement on oil markets later on Friday, according to 
 spokesman. 

 T4 opinion:   the&quot;terror premium&quot;is gone. Now we&apos;re getting back to supply vs. demand.  Record imports aren&apos;t going to help this situation.  

 9/28/06: N ote that crude oil traded as high 
 as $64 (+1.04) this morning before pulling back to its current level of 
 63.09 +0.13. The volatility in crude has taken place amid various news 
 headlines discussing potential output cuts . The early strength 
 was seen as headlines claimed OPEC had informally agreed to an oil 
 output cut to stem falling prices. The headlines said&quot;Saudi Arabia, 
 Kuwait and Nigeria have agreed to trim oil supply from October 1.&quot;However, other headlines throughout the day have disputed claims of a 
 cut , with DJ reporting that&quot;two senior OPEC officials dismissed 
 speculation Thursday that several members of OPEC had reached an 
 informal agreement to cut crude outputs.&quot;There were also earlier DJ 
 headlines saying a Kuwait oil source dismisses talk of informal OPEC 
 cut, and one saying the Algeria Oil Minister sees no need for output 
 cut. Most recently DJ has reported that the OPEC President is unaware 
 of any deal to cut OPEC output . 

 T4 opinion: they&apos;re going to cut production. See yesterday&apos;s comment. With imports at record levels, they can 
 afford to throttle back and let $60 be the floor. There&apos;s no room 
 to produce any more and inventories are high. Enjoy it while it 
 lasts. Lafayette...bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get 
 slaughtered! I&apos;d lock 50% now. If we&apos;re lucky, we&apos;ll get 
 some price stability over the next year. $60/42 = $1.43/gal. May 05 resistance has become support. 

 9/27/06:   Chesapeake Energy announces 
 that it has elected to shut-in a portion of its unhedged near-term 
 natural gas production in light of currently low wellhead natural gas 
 prices. Effective October 1, 2006, the co plans to temporarily shut-in 
 approx 100 mln cubic feet per day of net natural gas production (approx 
 125-150 mmcf per day gross) in various areas of operations in the 
 southwestern U.S. until natural gas prices recover from recently 
 depressed levels. Their current oil and natural gas production is 
 over 1,600 mmcf of natural gas equivalent per day (91% natural gas) and 
 these shut-ins represent approx 6% of the co&apos;s net oil and natural gas 
 production.  

 The E.I.A. reports that 
 gasoline inventories had a build of 6.34 
 mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 700K barrels); crude oil inventories had a draw of 109K barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 1.7 mln barrels); distillate inventories had a build of 2.62 mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 2.6 mln barrels). Before we 
 pop the champagne, think about this: U.S. crude oil imports hit 11.1 mln bpd, third 
 highest weekly average on record says the EIA. The term&quot;livin&apos; 
 on the edge&quot;comes to mind. There&apos;s no conservation...suppliers 
 are just pumping everything they can; capacity utilization is 
 approx 92.7%, compared to 86.7% from year ago.  

 Crude is up 34 cents to $61.35pbl ahead of 10:30est 
 stats (range is 61.10 to 61.76); speculation is running rampant that OPEC may do something to lift prices 
 (yesterday OPEC Pres Daukoru said something needs to be done to steady 
 the price) . Merrill and Credit Suisse calling for oil to avg 
 $65 in 2007; crude oil stats are expected to draw 1.7 mln barrels. 
 Natural gas is off 9 cents to $4.434mbtu (range is 4.35 to 4.491). 
 Heating oil is up 2.22 cents to $1.68/gal (range is 1.6550 to 1.68).  

 9/26/06:  I could spend all day detailing 
 discussions at today&apos;s PPLICA meeting. Let me lead with this chart.  Does this look 
 like competition? Remember, deregulation = customer choice = lower 
 prices = market efficiency. That&apos;s what we were sold. Current electric work revolves around PPL&apos;s competitive bridge plan. Lafayette, you&apos;re OK to 1/1/11. PPL will beat Met-Ed by one year. 
 Anybody care to venture a guess as to the cost of POLR (provider of last 
 resort) residential power in Texas? Hint: think BIG. POLR power cost is exactly like heating oil lock costs; once you&apos;re 
 locked, you&apos;re locked for one year. It&apos;s a contract. And get 
 this:  PPL expects you to 
 sign up for POLR service WITHOUT knowing the cost of the power in 
 advance! . 

 PPL clearly concerned about their loss to PPLICA in Commonwealth Court regarding cost-of-service 
 recovery. Recall, PPL is overbilling industrial/commercial users 
 to subsidize residentials. Welcome to deregulation and the free 
 market. If you want everything deregulated, then the small user 
 has to pay his fair share of the bill, which means huge increases down 
 the road. PPL&apos;s concern is that this could drag on for years and 
 if they ultimately lose in the Supreme Court, they would have to credit 
 HUGE amounts to I&amp;C consumers (GS3 and higher) while simultaneously 
 killing the consumer with market power + make-up recovery for their 
 overbilling. As I&apos;ve said, the residential rate could easily go up 
 60%.  See 
 for yourself what&apos;s happening in Texas . 

 PPL also spewing some unkind verbage behind the scenes, 
 including a comment in their brief to the court that i f 
 they can&apos;t recover Hurricane Isabel costs, this will discourage utility 
 restoration.   Is that a threat? Welcome to 
 deregulation.  

 9/25/06:  Excellent piece from Sunday&apos;s NYT regarding energy markets and our old 
 friend Enron. 

 9/22/06:  Amaranth Energy Portfolio sale 
 prevented total fund loss; lost $560 mln in Natural Gas trades on Sep. 
 14.  Smart guys, eh?  

 I expect a quarterly update meeting with everybody will 
 be scheduled by Bill Marushak at Moravian on 10/9 or 10/10, i.e. Pacing 
 Break. 

 9/21/06:  I&apos;ve not seen anything like this in all of my years of monitoring the market. I had to 
 adjust the scale! 

 The psychological pain from heating oil consumers at the 
 Hess meeting was overwhelming. People feel like they&apos;ve been 
 hoodwinked. WRONG. A fixed price deal means no risk. If oil were $100/bbl today, you&apos;d be walking around with a big old grin. As it stands right now, the strip for FY07 
 is at $2.05 . The lowball numbers you&apos;re seeing in the paper 
 are for current (i.e.prompt) delivery. The flip side of this fact 
 is that you would be assuming risk. The strip for next winter 
 stands at $2.15 delivered. I just came back from a budget meeting 
 and they were happy to hear that next FY might merit a 0% increase. Note, we&apos;re not giving anything back. With electricity increases 
 of 30%+ coming, that would be foolish. I&apos;ve investigated some out-of-state plans . I&apos;ve found that some of the &quot;capped&quot;price plans need the market price to be 50 cents lower before you get market price. And the cap would have cost you an 
 up-front payment. Unfortunately, the 500,000 gallons of combined 
 usage are not enough to get attention from the big suppliers who offer 
 derivative options. They want to talk about 6000 gallon drop loads 
 and 42000 gallon contracts.  

 Attended the 4th annual Hess 
 energy marketing meeting this AM. One thing I&apos;d like to point out 
 is on the left-center of this page. See that Nymex link? All 
 of the king&apos;s horses and all of the king&apos;s men can&apos;t tell you where 
 prices are headed...but they all agree that Nymex is still the best 
 forward prognosticator. And they repeated a theme often heard 
 here: high prices are a cure for high prices. 

 Natural gas inventory rose 93 bcf to 3177 bcf; analysts were 
 expecting inventories a build of 90 bcf, ranging from a build of 80-99 
 bcf. Your humble consultant had one of those&quot;forest from the 
 trees&quot;moments this AM. I watch the gas build/draw numbers every 
 week, however, all of my draw/build, under the microscope analysis 
 missed one very interesting point - the maximum storage level in the 
 ground in the USA is 3500 bcf.  You&apos;re never too old to 
 learn! Prices are dropping because there is no place to go with 
 the gas we are pulling out of the ground. DOH!  

 9/20/06:  The E.I.A. reports that gasoline 
 inventories had a build of 560K bbl 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 650K 
 bbl); crude oil inventories had a draw 2.85 
 mln bbl (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 
 2.0 mln bbl); distillate inventories had a build of 4.08 mln bbl 
 (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 820K 
 bbl).  EIA says U.S. 
 distillate supplies hit highest since January 1999 - Reuters 

 Here&apos;s a reprint of a decent editorial from Buildings.com . Fooled by 
 fuel? Electricity is a bigger problem and it&apos;s not going away. Just look at these babies: Public Service may separate generation, 
 utility businesses; failed takeover by Exelon prompts review, according 
 to Ferland- Bloomberg  We can&apos;t get what we want so we&apos;re going 
 to force you to pay more? Deregulation has failed but these 
 businesses refuse to yield. Why can&apos;t we admit a mistake and work 
 toward a solution that is equitable for the consumer? 

 9/19/06:  Administrative changes to website ...see the Gas link under&quot;Clients Only&quot;...you can see all historical Gasmark/Hess/Colonial Energy 
 reports. You can even sort by date modified to see chronological 
 history .  You now have the history for any day you choose. You can back check an old purchase. If you check the Oil link, 
 you&apos;ll see folder for #4 oil prices. 

 Oil&apos;s rout outpaces its advance ... 

 Once and again, our energy prices are influenced heavily 
 by financial markets.  And if they fail?  Who picks up the tab? 

 9/18/06:  Should we feel bad for this 
 group? Ever hear of the term&quot;collar&quot;?   Why isn&apos;t a 
 billion $ fund hedged?  Bloomberg.com reports Amaranth Advisors, a hedge-fund manager with $9.5 bln 
 in assets, said last week&apos;s plunge in natural-gas prices left its two 
 main funds with year-to-date losses that may exceed 35% .&quot;We are 
 in discussions with our prime brokers and other counterparties and are 
 working to protect our investors while meeting the obligations of our 
 creditors,&apos;&apos; Nick Maounis, founder of the firm, said in a letter to 
 investors obtained by Bloomberg. The decline came after the Amaranth funds had gained almost 30% through 
 August. Gas prices fell 12.2% last week as the U.S. Energy 
 Department reported its first triple-digit inventory increase in more 
 than a year. Demand for the power-plant fuel usually declines after 
 summer air conditioner use slows and before heating needs pick up. 
 Amaranth was&quot; near the end of our disposition of natural-gas exposure ,&apos;&apos; 
 the letter said, adding that Amaranth had met every margin call. 

 Reuters.com reports Warren 
 Buffett&apos;s investment co 
 Berkshire Hathaway is interested in acquiring further utility cos in coming years, the U.S. billionaire said on Monday during a visit to 
 Israel. In March, Berkshire&apos;s MidAmerican Energy Holdings unit bought 
 the western U.S. utility PacificCorp from Scottish Power for $5.1 bln in 
 cash.  Buffett told reporters:&quot;We are interested in 
 acquiring additional utilities. My guess is in the next 10 years we will 
 buy one or two or three good-sized ones. You never can tell when they 
 will come along.&quot;He added that his co was familiar with all the 
 utilities in the U.S. and some outside the U.S.&quot;We look at anyone that 
 indicates an interest.&quot; 

 9/17/06:  Make up my mind! First we 
 have the $100/bbl stories. Now we get that lone voice in the wilderness that we&apos;re headed back to $1.15 a gallon 
 for gasoline.  Who&apos;s right? Who cares? I don&apos;t 
 think you can sum up worldwide geopolitical activity and market actions 
 in one paragraph. If, if, if, if,...  If I could pick 
 the right Powerball numbers, I could be living on a beach. You need to 
 budget appropriately and hedge your obligations. Hedge? &quot;Locking&quot;winter oil, or natural gas for that matter, is a hedge against 
 price instability. It should be fairly clear from reading this 
 newsletter that I believed the recent highs were inflated. There 
 is no magic date for purchases and no magic number to lock. The 
 number one goal right now is data collection and aggregation because if 
 you can&apos;t measure it, you can&apos;t purchase what you need. Are we 
 going to break down and get back to $48/bbl oil? I&apos;m really 
 ambivalent because while high prices are a cure for high prices, low 
 prices kill conservation and alternative development. The good 
 news for LVAIC (in my humble opinion) is that FY07-08 energy 
 expenditures SHOULD be less than FY06-07. But that doesn&apos;t imply 
 returning money to your respective budget offices. I would argue 
 strongly that any energy surplus should be held in escrow to temper 
 future shocks. Once again, it&apos;s September, there&apos;s no Gulf 
 hurricane, no heating demand, no cooling demand, and anecdotal evidence 
 (Ford, Mcall school bus story , etc) that high prices are beginning to 
 impact spending. This might just be the calm before the storm. 

 9/15/06:  Little &apos;ole T4 isn&apos;t an agent for 
 social change, but this story has me thinking. Refer to the 8/29 comment in the 
 newsletter. Maybe ethanol conversion for the stinky diesel bus 
 fleets that we all have throughout our campuses is an interim step in 
 the green direction? Let&apos;s face it, solar is a crappy option. We&apos;re not going to erect windmills. And I doubt any of you want to 
 entertain new fluid bed boilers to burn corn husks. I know my own 
 staff&apos;s corporate average fuel economy is 8 mpg. Even a journey of 
 1000 miles begins with the first step...??? 

 9/14/06:  Natural gas inventory rose 108 bcf 
 to 3084 bcf; analysts were expecting a build of 91 bcf, ranging from a 
 build of 68-98 bcf.  Wow! Short-end falling apart, but 
 that pesky strip isn&apos;t exactly in a free fall. Too bad we can&apos;t 
 all buy and store natural gas. This drop is helping hedge funds 
 who are short, but not many others.  

 Crude oil is up 33 cents to 
 $64.30/bbl (range is 64.17 to 64.65); the International Monetary Fund 
 raised its oil price forecast and global economic growth ests ( rose 
 its 2007 oil forecast 20% to $75.50pbl ); the US is pressing the 
 UN to punish Iran for not complying in halting to enrich uranium; 
 Nigerian oil workers are into their 2nd day of a 3-day strike over 
 security; natural gas is off 8 cents to $5.367mbtu (range is 5.35 
 to 5.43); inventory report due out at 10:30est (Bloomberg ests looking 
 for a build of 91bcf vs a build of 71bcf 
 seen last week). Heating oil is up .02 of a cent to $1.7430/gal (range 
 is 1.7405 to 1.7650). 

 9/13/06:  The E.I.A. reports that gasoline 
 inventories had a build of 114K barrels 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 200K 
 barrels); crude oil inventories had a draw of 2.9 mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 2.48 mln barrels); distillate inventories had a  build of 4.64 mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 2.0 mln barrels).  Hmmm... 

 Where&apos;s T Boone when you need him? It seems like 
 just yesterday when the $100 hype was in full swing. Today we get 
 this story of how oil&apos;s price 
 rout is deepest in 16 years! 

 This chart speaks for itself. Could we get back to 4/1/05 levels? Please note, this is EXACTLY what happens when prices 
 have been propped up by speculators. You can&apos;t ignore the 
 supply/demand signals forever.  If we break $60, I&apos;m going 
 after the Apr/May/Jun chunk of the budget. I&apos;m also sniffing 
 around the 07-08 numbers. 

 OPEC said 
 earlier this week that they didn&apos;t want crude to fall below $60/bbl , 
 so if oil continues to drop, we could see OPEC adopt a production cut 
 ahead of the Dec meeting in Nigeria, Africa&apos;s biggest oil producer, 
 where production may be slowed during a 3-day&quot;warning&quot;strike over 
 better security for workers. Crude oil inventories expected to be 
 released at 10:30est. Bloomberg expected a draw of 2 mln bbls; crude oil now up 30 
 cents to $64.06pbl. Natural gas is off 3.4 cents to $5.54mbtu (range is 
 5.41 to 5.635). Bloomberg looking for distillate build of 2 mln bbls (thus softening any 
 huge draw expected for crude oil). 

 9/12/06:  Crude oil dropped $1.86 to 
 $63.75/bbl due to speculation BP&apos;s Prudhoe Bay may come online a lot 
 faster than thought, coupled w/ the IEA lowering their demand for oil in 
 2006. A $15 retracement of the war premium of the recent 
 highs of $78.40 would be $63.40 (could be big support there); 200-day moving avg in crude 
 was taken out yesterday ($67.53) and today&apos;s fall under $65 is a 
 psychological bear pt. Natty fell a dime to $5.57mbtu; heating oil 
 is off 4.14 cents to $1.7640/gal; gasoline fell 4.26 cents to 
 $1.5520/gal;  put another way, I&apos;ve missed the absolute bottom 
 by at least 4.4 cents. 

 Chicago Mercantile announces NYMEX 
 Energy Futures Contracts Set Daily Volume Records on CME Globex... great 
 minds think alike? Everyone locking down this dip at the same 
 time? 

 BP says to ask govt this week to 
 restart part of East Prudhoe Bay pipeline if inspections positive. Crude oil is off 50 cents to $65.11pbl (range is 65.18 to 66.44). Iran says it will push OPEC to 
 cut production if crude falls below $60 ; Saudi Arabia said it 
 will invest $70bln( wow ) in oil and gas infrastructure over the next 5 yrs; 
 the IEA said worldwide demand for oil will be 84.7 mln barrels a day in 
 2006 (100,000 bpd less than forecast last month). Natural gas is off 2 
 cents to $5.652 (prices may recover as weather reports indicate behind 
 Florence is a new storm brewing: 
 Gordon ). Heating oil is off a half a penny to $1.7995/gal 
 (range is 1.7995 to 1.8370). 

 LVAIC FUEL FOR THOUGHT: if HO could be locked TODAY for $1.95 for FY07-08 heating season, would 
 you do it? The futures market supports this concept, though it&apos;s 
 unclear if the current supplier would entertain it. Think about 
 it. 

 9/11/06:  11:30AM...done deal...1.2 MG of #6 
 @ $1.27 delivered. $210,600 under budget. Also burning NG to 
 12/1 @ burnertip of $7.85; Apr/May/Jun 07 still not locked; since I&apos;m 
 not Enron, I&apos;m not taking credit for savings that have not yet been 
 realized! 

 Lots of news items today.  (11:30) Bloomberg 
 has been running some headlines from today&apos;s OPEC meeting: OPEC says 
 clear imbalance between supply and demand; will take needed steps to ensure 
 supply/demand balanced . Says crude inventories comfortably above 
 5-year avg. 

 Crude 
 oil is down six days in a row (the longest losing streak since Oct 2003) to $65.35/bbl, off 90 cents (range is 65.20 to 66.11). Progress to solve 
 a dispute over Iran&apos;s nuclear research was believed to be made this 
 weekend according to the European Union foreign policy chief, Javier 
 Solana. There is speculation that OPEC may move to cut oil production at 
 its Dec meeting, especially with much non-OPEC oil coming into 
 production next year (OPEC is meeting today in Vienna). A full $15 war premium retracement in crude oil off the highs would bring crude to $53.40bbl (Venezuela says demand in the US and China is still strong). I ran&apos;s Oil Minister says he does not favor oil prices below $60 ; Sinopec 
 and Iran have agreed to terms to develop the Yadavaran field (it is 
 believed Royal Dutch Shell could benefit from this deal since it 
 has been an advisor to Sinopec). Cooler weather and the lack of a real 
 hurricane threat has caused the price of natural gas to fade to 
 their lowest levels in nearly 2 years; natty off 26 cents to $5.421mbtu 
 (range is 5.31 to 5.60). Heating oil off 2.82 cents to 
 $1.8150/gal (range is 1.8128 to 1.8432).  Where&apos;s T Boone??? 

 NYT story regarding lower oil prices. 

 Here&apos;s a snippet from Floyd Norris&apos; blog on oil prices. I agree. Just as nat 
 gas is down RIGHT NOW, it&apos;s not down on the strip. Oil is down 
 RIGHT NOW, but not via futures. My finger is on the trigger and I will lock my winter oil if I 
 can get the cost&lt;$1.27 . Look at this chart . In 
 technical terms, we&apos;ve broken support. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to 
 $1.00; but I&apos;m budgeted for $1.45 and every dime under $1.45 nets us 
 $200K.  Why $1.27? If 
 the terror premium is MIA, then $53.40/42 = $1.27.  I&apos;m not 
 greedy. If my supply is guaranteed over the next 7 months for less 
 than I&apos;ve budgeted, then what more can I hope to achieve if I&apos;m not a 
 commodities trader? 

 9/7/06:  BP says no sign of corrosion on 
 downstream segment of eastern transit line, tests ongoing - Reuters  Says some eastern Prudhoe output can be restored if east line partially 
 restarted. Says replacing 
 Prudhoe Bay oil transit lines to cost over $150 mln . ( Umm, how 
 much PROFIT did you book last year?) And later:  BP says 
 Prudhoe Bay could hit full capacity above 400,000 BPD by end of Oct. 

 Well,well,well... The E.I.A. reports that Gasoline 
 Inventories had a build of 718K 
 BBLs 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 2.8 mln 
 BBLs); crude oil inventories had a draw 2.21 mln BBLs (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 2.48 mln BBLs); distillate inventories had a build of 3.1 mln BBLs (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 1.25 mln BBLs). 

 Natural Gas Inventory rose 71 bcf to 2976 bcf; analysts 
 were expecting a build of 69 bcf, ranging from 55-81 bcf. 

 Finance ministers in the Middle East were concerned, 
 hence:  Al Jazeera TV airs audio from Iraq&apos;s Al Qaeda leader. 

 9/6/06:  Before we pop the champagne corks 
 over today&apos;s oil headline story , 
 let&apos;s do a little research on the latest petroleum storage chart s. Note that we are currently 
 importing 9M BPD vs. a refinery run of 15M BPD. That&apos;s 60%. Chevron found some oil at nearly 10,000 feet. That&apos;s a two-mile 
 deep hole! ( Note, this was the initial hit, per Oil&amp;Gas 
 Daily; they had to go 5 miles for the heavy flow ). It&apos;s not going to change much in the 
 near term. Now if we imported&lt;30%, then maybe we&apos;ve got 
 something to crow about. As it stands, this story simply counters 
 last Saturday&apos;s story about how we&apos;re out of oil.  

 Here&apos;s a sample of how NOT to dig out of the energy hole ; more NIMBY&apos;s 
 despite state-of-the-art controls, in Texas, of all places. 

 Crude oil is lower this morning after the UN took no 
 action against Iran despite missing the 8/31 deadline to stop enriching 
 uranium ($10-$15 premium given to oil for Hezbollah/Israel conflict and 
 Iran); it appears like the UN will 
 continue to delay potential sanctions against Iran b/c they fear the 
 repercussions of Iran using oil as a weapon coupled w/ Iran ready to 
 strike back, which would further cause unrest in the Mid East and an oil 
 price hike shock that will be felt globally. Crude is also lower on word 
 that Tropical Storm Florence, which may be upgraded to a hurricane later 
 this week, will likely miss the Gulf of Mexico , where 25% of the US&apos;s 
 oil output takes place. Crude oil is off 60 cents to $68pbl (range is 
 67.77 to 68.82). Natural gas]is off 11 cents to $5.931 (range is 5.88 
 to 5.99). Heating oil is off 1.63 cents to $1.92/gal (range is 1.92 to 
 1.9430); gasoline is off .80 of a cent to $1.6385/gal ( lowest level 
 since March 9th ; market not banking on any hurricane affecting 
 production in the Gulf, which could be a mistake since it only takes one 
 storm to be a major concern). 

 Here&apos;s the real read from the Street about expectations:  Prudential downgrades Energy Group to Underweight, based on expensive 
 valuations.  Are we finally ready to entertain a return to 
 the mean? 

 Here&apos;s a T4 reprint of an editorial for anyone who has 
 children . This movement is like a cancer...it&apos;s already spread 
 to Lehigh Valley Hospital Center. If Dupont can do it, why not me? Heck, even Radio Shack thinks it&apos;s OK to fire by email.  

 9/5/06:  Look at what we&apos;re exporting 
 now:  The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia is facing a worsening energy crunch as its economy outgrows aging 
 infrastructure; they are going ahead with a sweeping liberalization of 
 its electric-power industry aimed at drawing $87 bln in investment to 
 the sector by 2010. The overhaul will phase in market-driven pricing for power , which now is sold mostly at low, 
 regulated rates. Private investors , including foreigners, will be given the chance to own 
 generating companies, selling the electricity they produce at free-market prices.  

 9/2/06:  Lots of news from the Morning Call 
 yesterday! First we get this story about 
 Texon and the Allentown School District. Then we get a story about PPL trying to make nice with the residential consumer at 
 the expense of I&amp;C users. And finally, it&apos;s nice to see that wholesale natural gas prices are 
 dropping by a whopping 2% ! Saturday it&apos;s all doom&amp;gloom with $200 oil and such .  

 I couldn&apos;t help but respond to the author of the Morning Call story on the ASD. That 339% byline is just so inflammatory. Unfortunately, I still 
 firmly believe that a supplier/end user alliance against the LDC is 
 doomed right from the start. You can&apos;t beat UGI. That&apos;s not 
 what we&apos;re trying to accomplish. We need to work within the 
 boundaries of the regulated v. for-profit mindset that exists over there 
 and structure win-win deals where you get uninterrupted gas supplies at 
 a fair price without paperwork nonsense. As I&apos;ve mentioned before, 
 this is a chess match. You need to be steps ahead with decision 
 trees and alternate endings. Stop and think about this for a 
 second...let&apos;s say ASD/Texon somehow manage to get a sympathetic 
 commissioner to rule that delivery rates are unfair. That would 
 involve a huge cost-of-service study and a year&apos;s worth of time. Do you really think that individual users can expect to negotiate their 
 own rates with UGI? The components of this game are 
 meter aggregation, purchase timing, alternate fuel capability, auditing, 
 load matching, and conservation. Ted Fritz is blowing smoke in 
 their eyes and trying to lock them up via sole-source contracts whereby 
 he can make a lot more than his typical $0.05/dth. I&apos;ve known Ted 
 for 11 years and his marketing shtick has always been to paint UGI as 
 the villain; it started when poor Curt Clifford was separated from 
 Gasmark and never let up. Promark, NEBC, ConEdSolutions, Black Hills Energy, PPL Gas, Texon LP...Ted&apos;s been looking out for Ted 
 over the last decade and the act hasn&apos;t matured one bit. I&apos;ll 
 never doubt his ability to meet or beat Gasmark on price, but you should 
 be aware of the caveats such as balancing, nominations, force majeure, 
 and such that come with the territory. Ignore the BS and compare 
 apples to apples. You&apos;ll feel better about your choices when you 
 understand what you&apos;re buying, why, where, when, how, and how much. 

 One little tidbit that I omitted from the Morning Call 
 email is how I confidentially solicited both ASD and BASD to try and 
 broker a fair settlement with UGI. Neither of the business 
 managers responded...in fact, Ted called me and offered to hire me for 
 them. When I pointed out the obvious and blatant conflict of 
 interest, he blurted out that he called the shots for them and his phone 
 call would make or break me! Guess I messed up his marketing plan. I&apos;m somewhat disturbed that Mssrs. Crawford and Majewski have fully 
 aligned themselves with their supplier and won&apos;t discuss options with a 
 neutral party. I&apos;m especially disturbed because I&apos;m a taxpayer! Yeah, UGI is going to treat these guys real nice over the next few 
 years. I can call UGI&apos;s O&amp;M people day or night and get 
 meters moved, piping rearranged, new services installed, lines marked. And I still pay them $0.35 for delivery! We need to work 
 together, not antagonize them with silly headlines. I admit that I wish PP&amp;L had 
 taken them over, but PP&amp;L already took a shot at the gas business and 
 quickly decided it wasn&apos;t their cup of tea. Too bad. Their 
 rates and customer service would be much better. Anyway, now we 
 deal with the hand we&apos;re dealt. We&apos;re going to determine just how 
 much revenue UGI needs to book from each of you and then work on 
 commodity savings, which don&apos;t affect (and actually hurt) their bottom 
 line. 

 9/1/06:  From Marketwatch:  Natural-gas 
 futures touched their lowest level in 20 months Friday, putting the 
 contract on track to end the week with a loss of more than 19% as traders fretted over hefty U.S. 
 supplies .  T4 Note: This only deals with short term 
 numbers...Tetco basis is still high and the strip still hasn&apos;t matched 
 July&apos;s lows. 

 8/31/06:  From the Gasmark newsletter:   According to today’s Gas Daily Publication, a 
 Washington D.C. watchdog group, the National Legal&amp;Policy Center (NLPC), 
 has completed a study of natural gas prices over the last six years, concluding that there has been 
 major manipulation of prices. NLPC noted that:“since 2000, an 
 anomaly has appeared; demand, domestic production and net imports all 
 have remained largely unchanged from the 1990’s, yet wellhead prices 
 have risen sharply…300%. The report does not name any one group 
 responsible for the manipulation, just that it happened. NLPC has sent 
 letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Commodity 
 Futures Trading Commission, demanding an investigation.  Ya 
 think? 

   Natural Gas Inventory rose 48 bcf, 
 analysts were expecting inventories a build of 52 bcf, ranging from a 
 build of 42-62 bcf. 

 Chicago Tribune reports BP 
 officials are growing increasingly optimistic that Prudhoe Bay oil 
 production may be returned to normal levels earlier than expected, believing a portion of the 
 pipeline idled by corrosion concerns may be useable at least temporarily 
 and that other sections can be bypassed.&quot;The idea that there was 
 widespread corrosion simply was not correct,&quot; David Peattie, BP&apos;s 
 vice president for exploration and production told The Associated Press 
 on Wednesday. He said the corrosion was isolated and that ultrasound 
 tests now being conducted -- foot-by-foot in some sections of pipe -- 
 are to determine how much of the shut down pipeline might be returned to 
 service temporarily. BP officials emphasized that any resumption of oil 
 flow in the closed eastern section will depend upon whether the co can 
 convince the federal Transportation Department that such a move can be 
 made without risk of another spill. 

 California takes the lead in cutting carbon emissions... 

 8/30/06:  The E.I.A. reports that 
 Gasoline Inventories had a build of 367K 
 barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 
 600K barrels); crude oil inventories had a build of 2.4 mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 1.5 mln barrels); distillate 
 inventories had a build of 1.3 mln barrels 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 1.3 mln 
 barrels). 

 Ahead of weekly inventory stats 
 due out at 10:30est (Bloomberg ests looking for a draw of 1.5 mln barrels ), crude oil is up 10 cents to $69.81pbl (range is 69.72 to 70.25); the move back 
 over $70 is due to speculation Iran will ignore tomorrow&apos;s UN deadline to cease enrichment 
 of uranium .  And if they don&apos;t?  Oct natural 
 gas , now the spot contract, is off 13 cents to $6.63mbtu (range is 
 6.58 to 6.77). Heating oil is up 1.43 cents to $1.9575/gal (range 
 is 1.9470 to 1.9625). Gasoline is up .58 of a cent to $1.7950/gal 
 (range is 1.7869 to 1.8025); RBOB gas is unch at $1.8250 (hearing the 
 recent slide in gasoline has been helped by Goldman Sachs preparing to 
 move its index from motor gasoline to RBOB). 

 8/29/06:  Politics and $:   Sen Lugar says US farm lobby blocks Brazil ethanol imports; says farmers 
 fear competition from sugar-based ethanol - Bloomberg 

 WSJ reports on India&apos;s northwest 
 coast near Pakistan, Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of India&apos;s largest 
 private-sector co, Reliance Industries, is building the world&apos;s largest 
 refinery complex. When it&apos;s finished, he plans to load 40% of the fuel 
 it turns out onto huge tankers for a 9,000-mile trip to America . 
 The potential for oil refineries 
 abroad that can serve the U.S. is so strong that Chevron ( CVX ), 
 though based in the car-happy state of California, is investing in Mr. 
 Ambani&apos;s project rather than try to build a new refinery at home. While 
 in the past, thinner profit margins required that refineries be close to 
 consumers to save on shipping, today&apos;s margins are wide enough that it pays to haul gasoline and 
 other refined products long distances . Locating refineries in a 
 region such as Asia is an easy decision, given its less-onerous 
 construction costs, environmental limits and red tape, plus its own 
 rapidly growing fuel demand. Saudi Arabia&apos;s national oil co, Saudi 
 Aramco, currently envisions two giant new 400,000-barrel-a-day 
 refineries. ConocoPhillips ( COP ) is in talks to build one, and 
 France&apos;s Total ( TOT ) the other. In addition, Saudi Aramco and 
 Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) are talking about being partners in a refinery 
 expansion and petrochemical complex in China&apos;s Fujian province, near 
 Taiwan. 

 8/28/06:  Those stupid hurricanes just 
 won&apos;t cooperate!   The entire complex was weak due to 
 Ernesto being downgraded and word the storm was tracking away from Gulf of 
 Mexico , where many rigs and platforms are located. Crude closed 
 off $1.91 to $70.60pbl; natty fell 66 cents to $6.50; heating oil fell 
 6.58 cents to $1.9640/gal; heating oil fell 6.28 cents to $1.9670/gal; gasoline fell 12.41 cents 
 to $1.7710/gal ( lowest close 
 since late March ). 

 8/24/06:  Traders are still waiting for 
 the elusive Gulf hurricane ... Calyon says the consensus mean 
 for today&apos;s EIA natural gas storage injection is 60 Bcf for the week 
 ending August 18th. Firm says based on population-weighted cooling 
 degree days (CDDs), the week ending August 18th was seasonally cool. 
 Firm says there were 68 cooling degree days for the 7-day period, which 
 was 13% colder than last year, 3% colder than the five-year average, and 
 19% colder than the prior week. Meanwhile, firm says Tropical Storm 
 Debby has formed in the eastern Atlantic with sustained winds near 45 
 mph. Based on its projected storm track, Debby is likely to spin 
 harmlessly into the North Atlantic, passing at least 500 miles east of 
 Bermuda, thereby avoiding natural gas production facilities in the Gulf 
 of Mexico. Firm says the NOAA believes that the season&apos;s fifth tropical 
 cyclone may form about 200 miles north of Trinidad within the next 24 
 hours. 

 8/23/06:  Time for CNBC to trot out T 
 Boone soon?   The E.I.A. reports that Gasoline 
 Inventories had a build of 402K barrels 
 (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 2.05 mln 
 barrels); crude oil inventories had a draw of 643K barrels (Bloomberg consensus is a draw of 1.35 mln barrels); distillate inventories had a build of 2.31 mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus is a build of 700K barrels).  High 
 prices might be a cure for high prices?

 or not? 

 8/21/06:  FYI...here&apos;s the website of the parent company over 
 Altemos-Atlantic. 

 The Financial Times reports as US 
 federal and state investigators probe BP&apos;s ( BP ) Alaska 
 operations, the co&apos;s insistence that it had no knowledge of the degree 
 of corrosion in its Alaskan oil transit lines is coming under scrutiny. 
 A veteran worker at Prudhoe Bay told the FT he and others had taken to 
 US criminal investigators at the EPA accusations that BP misrepresented 
 corrosion data over the years to indicate its pipelines were in better 
 shape than they were, even as it 
 cut back on monitoring and prevention . The FT also 
 spoke with a contract worker who has been in contact with the 
 investigators. Daren Beaudo, BP spokesman, said:&quot;We are aware of all of 
 these claims and have a process in place to look into every concern that 
 comes our way, given enough specificity to direct us to a place to look 
 for answers.&quot;The EPA is investigating the complaints, along with 
 documents the workers submitted to back their claims.  T4&apos;s 
 co-op job in 1980: monitoring corrosion in refinery pipes.  BP is BS. 

 8/19/06: Here&apos;s a paragraph lifted from an op-ed piece in the NYT:  K Street’s bright young men fill 
 the top posts at federal agencies; K Street’s money keeps wages low and 
 prescription drug costs high; K Street’s“superlawyers”fight to make 
 our retirement insecure; K 
 Street’s deregulation gurus turn our electric utilities into the 
 plaything of Wall Street. What K Street wants from government is 
 often the opposite of what the public wants. And yet what K Street 
 wants, far too frequently it gets—if not by the good offices of Bob 
 Ney, then by the timely disappearance of the now useless Bob Ney.  Politics and power. They go hand-in-hand. 

 8/18/06: Edited responses from some emails between T4 
 and MWN:  
     We are in the process of drafting an initial response by PPLICA to 
 the PPL filing on mitigation. We can share that with you when 
 finalized and approved by the group. Our next meeting is September 
 26 and we hope you join us. The PUC has not yet scheduled anything 
 on the remand from the Commonwealth Court case and we hear rumblings 
 that PPL, the Commission, and the OCA may pursue and appeal to the 
 Pa. Supreme Court.     The 
 other significant current PPL proceeding that we will discuss on 
 September 26th relates to how they will establish POLR 
 generation rates for 2010.  W e 
 are working on a summary of the&quot;Competitive Bridge Plan&quot;filing 
 that PPL submitted on this topic earlier this month. I&apos;ll make 
 sure that you are on the distribution list for that 
 correspondence.  
 8/17/06:  Natural Gas Inventory rose 37bcf 
 (analysts were expecting inventories to rise 30bcf) - crude oil little 
 changed after nat gas data, currently 70.65 -1.24... morning range 
 70.60-70.90. 

 Definition of&quot;under a microscope&quot; : BP hit by another accident in Alaska -MSN Money reports the co said 
 on Wednesday it had suffered another accident at its troubled Alaskan 
 oilfield, when a pressure surge jolted an above-ground pipeline off its 
 steel mount and on to the delicate tundra. The accident came as BP had 
 been attempting to ramp up production that had been drastically reduced 
 after the discovery of severe corrosion forced the co to shut half of 
 Prudhoe Bay, North America&apos;s largest oilfield, just over a week ago. Yet 
 in bringing up a section of the field that had been cleared to operate 
 after being downed for routine maintenance, a power surge jolted the 
 flow line so violently that it fell to the ground. The aluminium casing 
 and insulation appear to have burst open, but BP said there was no 
 visible damage to the pipeline , which is back up on mounts and now 
 being tested for&quot;stress damage&quot;. BP had hoped to add 20,000 more 
 barrels per day to its current 150,000 barrels of daily production in order to get up to capacity the half of the field that has been 
 cleared for operation. But this latest accident has forced it to 
 abort that effort. 

 8/16/06:  Off-topic, but take a look at this 
 one: Verizon considers selling landlines in three states - WSJ reports the co is in talks to sell its landlines in New Hampshire, Maine 
 and Vermont. Verizon spokesman Erle Pierce said the co is entertaining 
 offers from more than one company to purchase the landlines. The sale of 
 1.6 mln telephone lines and poles in the three states could net Verizon 
 between $2 bln and $3 bln. The possible sales are part of the New 
 York-based phone giant&apos;s strategy to delve deeper into the wireless and 
 broadband arenas, while getting out of the traditional phone business in 
 U.S. areas that aren&apos;t slated for fiber upgrades -- which allow the co 
 to sell more Internet-based services -- and therefore are less valuable 
 to the co in the long run. But so far Verizon&apos;s past efforts to sell 
 systems have had limited results.  The telephone company selling 
 off telephones? 

 The E.I.A. reports that Gasoline Inventories had a draw 
 of 2.27mln barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a draw of 1.8 mln barrels); 
 crude oil inventories had a draw of 1.61 mln barrels (Bloomberg 
 consensus was a draw of 1.3 mln barrels); distillate inventories had a 
 build of 748K barrels (Bloomberg consensus was a build of 1.3 mln 
 barrels).  And yet, crude oil fell $1.15 to $71.90 bbl;  nat 
 gas fell a dime to $6.76mbtu; heating oil dropped .85 of a cent to 
 $2.0150/gal; gasoline fell 1.76 cents to $1.9775/gal.  Could 
 traders be concerned about the missing Gulf hurricane? 

 8/15/06:  WSJ reports BP officials are 
 considering alternative pipeline routes from the closed portion of the 
 giant oil field here, a move that might allow production to resume by 
 October. BP, which operates the field on behalf of a consortium that 
 includes Exxon Mobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), could boost output 
 from the eastern half of the hobbled field by tying some of the eastern 
 Prudhoe production into the nearby Endicott pipeline, which it operates. 
 Though built for 110,000 barrels a day, Endicott is currently flowing at 
 just about 20,000 barrels because of field decline, said Craig Wiggs, a 
 field manager for BP Alaska. Routing into Endicott would require some 
 modest modifications to infrastructure, as well as approval from state 
 and federal regulators, Mr. Wiggs said. But if that works out, Endicott could lift Prudhoe&apos;s production to more than 300,000 barrels a 
 day .&quot; You&apos;re going to be well into October before I could see the 
 construction completed &quot;to allow the Endicott alternative, he said. 

   8/14/06:  Back in the saddle. Here&apos;s 
 the repost of the 8/5 PPL story with comments. They&apos;re trying to make nice with the consumer on 
 the backs of the industrial consumer, whose cost to serve is quite low. Another of those nasty facts of deregulated life...can&apos;t have it both 
 ways...business has ALWAYS subsidized the consumer. From Day 1. Welcome to the failed reality of deregulation. It&apos;s not helping 
 the consumer. What I find astonishing is their whining about the 
 NEED for the rate increase and then the RECORD $181M quarterly PROFIT. 

 Here&apos;s an interesting story from the Sunday NY Times that affirms a position 
 I&apos;ve repeated many times in public and at our one-on-one meeting. IMHO, there is a serious disconnect between the original purpose of the 
 New York Mercantile Exchange and what is occurring today. Anecdotal evidence, at best, but what I&apos;ve heard about #6 getting barged 
 offshore and with the reports of oil storage at record levels, how can 
 we sustain this&quot;terror premium&quot;? Note the $69/bbl projection for next year . Runs contrary to T Boone, eh? 

 8/10/06:  In July, monthly average crude oil 
 and gasoline prices reached new high levels in nominal terms, but 
 remained below the peak inflation-adjusted levels reached in the early 
 1980s... Consensus forecast for the August 2006 West Texas Intermediate 
 (WTI) crude oil price is $76.50 per barrel, an increase of $3.00 per 
 barrel from forecast last month... result of the additional 
 pressures in July and a projected reduction in Alaskan oil production 
 following the August 6 announcement by BP oil company that it was 
 temporarily shutting down Alaska&apos;s Prudhoe Bay oil field ( though 
 traders who bought long were spooked by the announcement tha the west 
 side of the pipeline is still operating! ) Petroleum product prices are also expected to be higher in August, 
 particularly on the West Coast... Significant relief from the high crude 
 oil and gasoline prices is not likely to occur soon as the current tight 
 market must also cope with strong gasoline demand, which typically 
 reaches its seasonal peak in August, and the traditionally more active 
 months of the hurricane season. In 2006 and 2007, the WTI crude oil spot 
 price is projected to average around $70 per barrel (West Texas 
 Intermediate Crude Oil Price)... Adjusting for inflation, crude oil prices have not been this high since 
 late 1982 . Natural gas prices are projected to be lower 
 through the rest of this year relative to the corresponding period in 
 2005.  

 8/9/06: You have not been abandoned!  T4 is on vacation...at home...working on an extensive To Do list...back 
 on Monday with comments on PPL&apos;s misfire on the I&amp;C rate vs. consumers 
 public relations problem and BP&apos;s Alaska corrosion issue. 

 8/3/06:  Unbelievable. Checking the 
 most emailed stories on the mcall.com site and the PPL we&apos;re 
 going to help you with a 30% rate increase didn&apos;t make the top 5! These headlines are out there: Allentown energy company PPL Corp. said today its 
 second-quarter profits rose strongly from the same time period 
 last year. PPL, one of the region&apos;s two Fortune 500 companies, said net income reached $181 million or 47 cents per share for the 
 three months ended June 30, up from $128 million or 33 cents per share 
 last year. Chief Executive Officer William Hecht, who is retiring later 
 this year, said PPL is&quot;firmly on track&quot;to reach year-end earnings 
 expectations of $2.18 to $2.28 per share. Last year, PPL posted earnings 
 of $1.77 per share.  FirstEnergy Corp., owner of electric 
 utilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said second-quarter net i ncome 
 rose 70 percent as it sold more electricity to its retail 
 customers. Net income rose to $304 million, or 91 cents per share, 
 from $178 million, or 54 cents in 2005&apos;s second quarter, Akron, 
 Ohio-based FirstEnergy said in a statement Tuesday. Sales fell 1.8 
 percent to $2.79 billion after 
 the sale of a majority stake in MYR Group, a utility contractor.  (T4: more divestiture of the ill-fated mech/elec 
 contractor buying spree). 

 Can anybody spot the elephant in the room? On one 
 side we have utilities with 30-60% rate increases in the forecast and on 
 the other side they&apos;re making record profits TODAY. Right now. As I type.  

 Deregulation as 
 a concept to benefit the CONSUMER has FAILED . Deregulation 
 to benefit stockholders, Wall Street, and public companies is a 
 screaming success story. Your money is going to help every single 
 utility customer in the Northeast who was served by a high-cost 
 supplier.  Meanwhile, all of that PPL company average 3 
 cents per kilowatthour power that PPL produces is going to be sold at 
 the utility market to folks who used to pay 11-14 cents per kilowatthour 
 and now salivate at the thought of 7 cent juice. Unfortunately, 
 our wallets will make up the difference. The&quot;electricity pool&quot;is 
 lot like the concept of corporate average fuel economy...some cars get 
 40 mpg and some cars get 5 mpg. The average mpg is 20. What&apos;s happening with electricity is not only are you forced to drive 
 the 20 mpg car (in place of a 40), but you&apos;re also forced to drive 1 mpg 
 cars whenever the demand exceeds supply. 

 PPL is making boatloads of money at 3 cents per 
 kilowatthour and using the&quot;market&quot;as its excuse to overcharge 
 everyone. 

 And now they want to make nice and only jack the 
 residential and small consumers by 30% in 2010. All of that 
 proposal involves a 1 year supply agreement and excludes industrial and 
 commercial customers.  

 Do the math. A power plant is 33% efficient. If 1MMBTU of coal is currently $2.08, then the fuel cost of a coal plant 
 is 2 cents per kilowatthour! A nuke is 0.5 cents!   Deregulation 
 was supposed to open up interstate competition to sell excess power. The system is broken. 

 Here&apos;s a fun engineering problem for you to solve...
  

 7/31/06:  Front page of Allentown 
 Morning Call on Sunday .  Nothing you don&apos;t already know .  Note the group buying hint. And also how she ignored the 
 fact that Duquesne was just bought by a foreign utility (see 7/05/06 
 comment below). And she never notes that the concept of 
 deregulation was intended to help consumers, not harm them. 

 The CEO of Chevron said over the weekend that oil demand 
 is unabated due to high prices (also said the era of cheap oil is over 
 b/c demand is pushing producers to crank out petro at full capacity). 
 Venezuela&apos;s Chavez promised oil contracts to Iran (combined the two OPEC 
 nations producer of 6mln bopd). Russia&apos;s main oil pipeline sprung a leak 
 near the Belarus border (with so much tensions in the Middle East, this 
 disruption in Russia is being viewed as a big problem and a potential 
 ecological catastrophe); Lithuania, which has the only refinery in the 
 Baltic states, stopped getting Russia crude over the weekend due to the 
 pipeline problem in Belarus (while the Russia pipeline situation is a 
 problem for supplies, it should be noted that any upward pricing 
 pressures should affect European oil prices more than domestic -- 
 however, any global disruption has already nervous energy traders even 
 more skittish). Crude oil is up 62 cents to $73.86pbl (range is 
 72.77 to 73.92);  natural gas  is up 70 cents to $7.89mbtu (range 
 is 7.22 to 7.95). Sweltering hot temps covered the US the weekend and 
 the temps are going to persist this week (something that should boost 
 natty prices further as traders speculate this week&apos;s inventory report 
 will show a high draw). Heating oil is up 1.65 cents to 
 $1.9577/gal (range is 1.9350 to 1.9577). 

 7/27/06:  Janney downgrades UGI Corp. 
 (UGI 25.66) to Neutral from Buy based on valuation, saying Warm 
 weather, high energy prices and customer conservation continued to 
 dampen UGI&apos;s earnings throughout most of fiscal 2006.  T4: Anyone who has ever worked in industry knows what this means inside the 
 company... 

 Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM ), 
 the world&apos;s largest public oil company, on Thursday reported quarterly 
 profit surged 35 percent to top $10 billion, driven by yet another 
 quarter of sharply higher oil prices. 

 Politics again... yet another energy bill . 

 7/26/06:  WSJ reports House 
 lawmakers, sensing that fuel prices will be a top voter concern in the 
 fall elections, are rushing out two energy bills that would fund 
 projects to develop alternative fuels or ease reliance on imported oil. 
 With only about 25 legislative days remaining before Congress adjourns, 
 the chances of either bill passing Congress are slim. House Republicans 
 said they will try to pass theirs in September. Democrats say that their 
 bill will be used to rally voters for elections, and that if they win 
 control of the House, they will relaunch the measure early next year. 
 House Republicans are renewing a push to open part of the Arctic 
 National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas exploration. 
 Meanwhile, Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, 
 unveiled a bill to spend billions of dollars in the next 10 years to 
 develop cellulosic ethanol and a national ethanol distribution system; 
 expand municipal rapid-transit systems; and give U.S. auto makers grants 
 to make more fuel-efficient vehicles. 

 7/25/06:  Boone Pickens said today that 
 crude oil would hit $100 within the next year (he said higher oil 
 will be needed to bring gasoline demand in line w/ supply). Israeli 
 Prime Minister said Israel will keep fighting Hezbollah, which is 
 raising concerns that oil shipments in the Mideast could be disrupted. Natural gas is adding to large gains seen yesterday on calls for 
 warmer weather above seasonal temps, a tropical storm heading toward 
 Corpus Christie, Texas that could gain hurricane status (a lot of 
 oil/gas rigs/platforms in that area), and California in a near state of 
 emergency w/ power outages (natty is up 19 cents o $6.799mbtu).  T4: Finally, the long awaited Gulf storm! Prices ratchet 
 like clockwork! And is Boone talking up his position? 

 Met-Ed customers ... this 
 article is NOT about market-based rates...this is the first step to 
 the big whammy that is coming in 2010. FYI...PPL ended up with 
 about an 8% rate increase last year. This is the intermediate, or 
 distribution rate increase. 

 And here&apos;s the final heating oil prepay offer from Pipeline Petroleum . 

 7/18/06:  U.S. manufacturers can lower their 
 energy costs–if they can overcome certain identifiable internal 
 barriers to making energy improvements within their own organizations–says Executive Reactions to Energy Efficiency, a new report by

 Reuters reports that power outages shut parts of 
 LaGuardia Airport and the NY subway today . Terminals of American 
 Airlines, Delta and the Marine Terminal were without full power. Also, 
 the subway trains were stopped for part of the rush-hour commute because 
 signals were off without power. Yesterday, a power failure stalled a 
 subway train in Queens, leaving dozens of passengers stranded in the 
 summer heat on an elevated track for nearly two hours.

 Corn v. soybeans!  NY Times 
 reports biodiesel produced from soybeans produces more usable energy and 
 reduces greenhouse gases more than corn-based ethanol, making it more 
 deserving of subsidies, according to a study being published this month 
 in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study points 
 to the environmental benefits of the biodiesel over ethanol made from 
 corn, stating that ethanol provides 25% more energy a gallon than is 
 required for its production, while soybean biodiesel generates 93% more 
 energy. The study&apos;s authors also found that ethanol, in its production 
 and consumption, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 12%, compared with 
 fossil fuels. Biodiesel, they said, reduces such emissions 41%, compared 
 with fossil fuels. The study concludes that the future of replacing oil 
 and gas lies with cellulosic ethanol produced from low-cost materials 
 like switch grass or wheat straw, if it is grown on agriculturally 
 marginal land or from waste plant material. Indeed, the study found that 
 neither ethanol nor biodiesel can replace much petroleum without having 
 an impact on food supply. If all 
 American corn and soybean production were dedicated to biofuels, that 
 fuel would replace only 12% of gas demand and 6% of diesel demand, the study notes. 

 7/12/06:  The E.I.A. reports that gasoline inventories fell 426K of barrels (expected draw of 250K); 
 crude oil inventories fell 5.99 mln of barrels (expected draw 
 of 1.3 mln barrels); distillate inventories had a build of 2.58 mln 
 barrels (expected a build of 1.6 mln barrels). In a very 
 fast-paced energy complex, traders digested a crude draw that was 4X the 
 expected estimates and a gasoline draw that shocked many traders looking 
 for a build . In recent trade, headlines that Iran may be referred to the 
 UN very soon have caused a late-day spike. $75 crude continues to be 
 short-term resistance (oil is currently 74.70 +0.54). An expected heat 
 wave across the US next week is helping nat gas move off recent lows 
 (now up 15 cents to $5.78).

 extract it . This is NOT why the NYMEX was established.  

 7/10/06:  WSJ reports heavy oils, which can 
 be the consistency of molasses, or even denser, are costlier to bring to 
 the surface than light oils. They also typically contain more 
 contaminants like metals and sulfur. Because refineries need special 
 equipment to remove these impurities, heavy oil is priced lower than 
 light oil. But a growing number of refineries around the world can 
 handle heavy oil, turning it into such products as gasoline, diesel, jet 
 fuel and heating oil, and Saudi Arabia recently announced plans to build 
 more of them. Earlier this year, in a critical trial of Saudi Arabia&apos;s 
 heavy-oil potential, Chevron Corp. ( CVX ) began a field trial of a 
 technique designed to pump out heavy oil that was previously considered 
 unrecoverable. In the pilot project, which it plans to expand to 
 additional wells, Chevron is injecting steam to loosen up sludge-like 
 heavy-oil reserves in Wafra, a field in the so-called neutral zone 
 between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Chevron and the Saudis say initial 
 results are promising and that the technique could greatly enhance 
 recovery at some huge fields. In Oman, Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ) 
 is preparing to spend $2 bln on a large-scale steam-injection project in 
 the Mukhaizna field, which holds about a bln barrels of oil. After four 
 years of negotiations, Occidental persuaded the Omanis to let it run the 
 field, in part by promising them a ten-fold increase in production to 
 150,000 barrels a day.

 7/5/06: Why would an Australian-Spanish group 
 pay a 21% premium to acquire a small PA utility???  DQE and a 
 consortium led by Macquarie Infrastructure Partners and Diversified 
 Utility and Energy Trusts, announced that they have entered into a 
 definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the

 Light Holdings and the members of the Macquarie Consortium.  $$$ 

 Three interesting 
 stories from Pipeline and Gas Journal... 

 T Boone Pickens 
 appears on CNBC discussing his oil outlook, says we&apos;ll see $80 before 
 the 1st of the year . Says OPEC is producing 750K barrels 
 per day less than a year ago -- says you know you have a tight supply 
 situation. Notes Nigeria has 460K barrels off production -- a problem 
 too. Says with refineries operating at 94% of capacity, he doesn&apos;t know 
 how much equipment can hold up operating at 94% of capacity. Says in 
 equities they are biased long, and he says they&apos;re always long Suncor 
 (SU) and Canadian oil sands. He won&apos;t say what they&apos;re short. Says he 
 likes the coals -- says he just likes energy. ( Scroll to the 
 4/25/06 note below ) 

 7/4/06:  Oil prices fell below $73 a barrel 
 on Tuesday in thin trade, but nagging fears about supply disruption and expectations of strong 
 U.S. demand for gasoline were expected to prevent a deeper sell-off. The peak was struck in September last year after massive hurricane 
 damage and forecasters have predicted another 
 active U.S. hurricane season. &quot;The bull run is back and the 
 hurricane season lies ahead,&quot;said Deborah White of SG CIB in a research 
 note. The investment bank has predicted this season 
 could see hurricane-related losses of 33 million barrels of oil, as well 
 as 25 million barrels of oil equivalent of natural gas and 20 million 
 barrels in light products, such as gasoline.&quot;The &apos;triple whammy&apos; would certainly send crude 
 heading through the $80 a barrel mark ,&quot;SG CIB said. U.S. 
 crude has already rallied by around 20 percent from the end of last 
 year, pushed higher by anxiety about oil producer Iran&apos;s dispute with 
 the West over its nuclear program, as well as disruption of oil output 
 by militant unrest in Nigeria.- Reuters   Note these 
 terms: expectations, predicted ...fear sells and a quick 10% 
 gain is possible for fast money. What if it isn&apos;t another active 
 hurricane season? What if all of these&quot;investors&quot;are caught long 
 and the demand dries up?  

 7/3/06: Here, in a nutshell, is the crux of the 
 electric utility problem facing deregulated States:  Banc of 
 America says that while they continue to believe that an abrupt movement 
 in the Treasury will hurt utilities over the very short periods, they 
 continue to expect that investors will focus on utilities strong fundamentals, driven by 
 i mproving realized commodity 
 prices and substantial ratebase growth. Assuming the 10-year 
 Treasury settles in south of 5.3%-5.4%, they believe that utilities 
 should perform relatively well in 2H06. That being said, they would 
 focus more on the stocks which could unlock better value or gain a 
 higher relative multiple. With DUK&apos;s recent announcement to spin off its 
 natural gas business, Dominion Resources (D) would be the logical next 
 candidate to unlock further shareholder value . While they remain 
 upbeat for the electric utility sector, they note that a number of 
 regulatory decisions this year are critical to their thesis . 
 However, they continue to believe that Maryland will end up being 
 constructive enough to allow Constellation Energy (CEG) to outperform 
 over the 2H.   Key terms: profit, regulation, 
 investors, Wall Street. 

 6/30/06:  T4 had a phone conversation with 
 John Shaddock of Shared Services , the LVAIC Harrisburg link...still 
 working on educating our legislators about the variability of the DSO 
 charge and how tough it is to budget when the toll varies by whim. He has set-up a teleconference with Terrance Fitzpatrick, a PA PUC 
 commissioner and staff to discuss details. 

 Wall Street Journal:   House voted to lift bans that 
 have prevented oil and gas drilling on most of the federal undersea tracts off the Atlantic 
 and Pacific coasts and in parts of the Gulf of Mexico . The bill 
 also allows states that currently have oil production on federal land 
 off their coasts or those that allow oil and gas drilling there in the 
 future to share royalty payments that would otherwise go entirely to the 
 federal government. The measure still needs to be approved by Senate. 
 The 232-187 vote came despite a statement by the Bush Administration 
 that says, by sharing royalty payment with coastal states, the measure 
 could cost the federal treasury &apos; several hundred billion dollars &apos; over 
 the next 60 years. Rep Pombo (R-CA), chairman of the House 
 Resource Committee, countered that the CBO found 
 it would result in a net increase in federal funds over the next decade 
 as new oil and gas reserves are found.  

 The commodity markets closed early today, at 1P... 
 Crude oil rose 38 cents to $73.90pbl; NG fell 3.5 cents to $6.10mbtu;

 6/29/06:  Wall Street Journal reports traders at BP PLC secretly and 
 illegally cornered part of the U.S. propane market in early 2004, 
 driving up heating and cooking costs for millions of mostly rural 
 Americans, federal investigators charged. In a civil complaint filed in 
 federal court in Chicago, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
 outlined what it said was a 
 scheme to manipulate the price of propane , and it alleged that executives at a BP trading unit 
 approved the effor t. The Justice Department filed a simultaneous 
 criminal plea in Washington in which a former BP trader admitted to 
 participating in the alleged conspiracy and agreed to cooperate in a 
 continuing criminal investigation of others at BP. The case is 
 based partly on audiotapes of BP traders, who were caught openly 
 discussing the propane price-manipulation scheme, the federal complaint 
 said.&quot;In terms of whether we should do this or not,&quot;the complaint 
 quoted one trader as saying,&quot; what 
 we stand to gain is not just that we&apos;d make money out of it, but we 
 would know from thereafter that we can control the market at will. &quot;

 6/27/06:  Attention #6 oil users...check out

 at $8.24 equivalent.  

 PPL is in the gas

 Fuel Gas.  

 From a top White House economic advisor... &quot;U.S. 
 inflation has not risen excessively and prices excluding food and energy have been 
 contained. Prices haven&apos;t gone up very much. Core prices have been contained ,&quot;Council of Economic Advisers Chair Edward Lazear said in response to 
 lawmaker questions at a hearing before the Joint Economic Committee. &quot;We have full confidence in the Fed (Federal Reserve) ... I think 
 they&apos;ll do the appropriate and responsible thing,&quot;he said.  Hello Edward? Have you seen copper prices lately? Energy 
 feeds EVERYTHING. So if we just exclude the elephant in the room 
 (energy), there is no inflation, right? I guess Ed hasn&apos;t shopped 
 for 12/2 Romex at the Home Depot lately.  

 And finally, here&apos;s a news item from B&amp;V

 6/23/06:  Wow!  Anadarko Petroleum to 
 acquire 
 Kerr-McGee&amp;Western Gas Resources, Inc. in separate transactions 
 totaling $23.3 Billion...&quot;All three companies have certain assets that we will likely deem to be 
 non-core once combined...Even with divestitures that we believe could 
 generate substantial after-tax proceeds, we expect the proposed 
 acquisitions to be accretive to both earnings and cash flow on a pro 
 forma basis ... Given our outlook for energy markets, these 
 transactions make a lot of sense for Anadarko shareholders. We expect to 
 hedge up to 75 percent of the acquired production through late 2008 
 using a series of three-way collars, with floors designed to ensure a 
 return on our investment and ceilings that allow considerable upside&quot;. Oil companies buying gas companies. One stop shopping. And a 
 46% premium to boot. This is an important insight on where the $ 
 is going. One doesn&apos;t pay up 46% for assets that will not 
 produce... good news for their 
 shareholders and bad news for consumers . Take a look at 
 these charts:  WGR   KMG   APC  Wealth is moving from consumers to their shareholders.  

 Heating Oil Update : here&apos;s the spreadsheet sent to Bill Marushak . Yesterday, we were discussing a $0.10 margin and today it&apos;s $0.145, 
 thereby pushing beyond my original $2.30 thought. This is still 
 better than the&quot;typical&quot;oil dealer margin of $0.30. I&apos;ve said it 
 time and time again, it&apos;s not who, but when. You can lock futures 
 at any time and clearly the best lock would have been on the ascent from 
 the triple bottom support at $1.60. But that&apos;s driving via the 
 rear view mirror. Once I get a better handle on volume draw and 
 number of drops, I&apos;m going to work at beating this baseline number. For now, it&apos;s better to accept that high prices are a reality and set 
 budgets appropriately. If oil drops, move the $ to the electricity 
 column . Anybody feel they can do better? If so, email me . 

 Spin City : Take a look at this clipping . Oh no, your 
 rates won&apos;t go up 20-30% sez Doug Krall. Correct. Plan on 
 20-60%! I think his attempt at levity was misquoted and/or 
 misjudged. Let&apos;s not forget that electricity is commodity + 
 transmission + distribution. Big consumers like Lehigh (69KV) have 
 no distribution cost. Residential consumers have to pay for 
 substations, transformers, poles, wires, and losses. Real-time, 
 demand-shifting, and off-peak aren&apos;t great ideas for schools. Customers in PECO (Excelon) territory are finally breathing a sigh of 
 relief because their already exorbitant rates are only planned to rise 
 11%! 

 6/22/06:  You have to love this PPL 
 quote:&quot;Continued 
 early planning will be essential so that the state and utilities can 
 educate customers about the transition to market-based prices well in 
 advance of changes taking place.&quot;  Absolutely nowhere in this press release is the anticipated price spike. Typical 
 utility-speak. They&apos;re too focused on the details to explain to 
 consumers that their bills are going to skyrocket! &quot;...customers 
 who do not select an alternate supplier...&quot; Like the 1% in PPL 
 territory? Refreshing would be a statement to the effect that 
 deregulation was flawed and that the LMP model for PJM electricity sales 
 in no way benefits the customer. Like THAT will ever happen!  

 6/21/06:  US crude inventories now at 
 highest level since May 29 1998 , according to the EIA - Reuters  | Meeting tomorrow with a Sunoco rep...preliminary indication for a winter 
 #6 oil lock is $1.45 | Got a call from UGI...they want to 
 offer a&quot;dual rate&quot;DSO for interruptible gas...lower number ($0.35) for 
 3rd party transportation. I&apos;m checking with marketer because I 
 don&apos;t think this works. Thanks for #2 oil numbers. You know 
 who you are! 

 6/20/06:  T4 as Paul Revere on the coming electric rate increases .  One point I&apos;d like to make is if consumers revolted against a 
 30% pay raise for legislators, how will they react to a 70% electric bill increase?  I&apos;ve heard rumblings that it can&apos;t happen.  Read this headline ! Bill 
 Marushak again asking about #2 oil. I told him that I&apos;d lock 75% at current price 
 and ride the market . Worst case might be that your budgets 
 get adjusted for this current shock and then prices trickle down. I can&apos;t offer more insight until after we&apos;ve had our one-on-ones. And if that&apos;s not enough for today, look at this headline:  World oil prices could triple if 
 US takes military action against Iran, says the Saudi Ambassador to the 
 US - Reuters .  Please refer to the Politics link for selected insightful looks at this issue. Saudi Ambassador to US, says current oil prices too high, but mkt is 
 well supplied with oil, also reiterates plan to hold 1.5 mln-2 mln BPD 
 surplus capacity available in long term - Reuters  Final thought: see this current heating oil chart . Did all of the dealers make their buys in 
 May? We&apos;re getting closer to my $2.30 buy target. 

 6/19/06:  The Morning Call just 
 added their $0.02 to the oil prepay issue . T4 refers you to 
 this chart from the folks who 
 bring you the CPI. There is no secret supplier hiding in the 
 background. Lehigh uses&lt;4000 gals of #2 oil in a year for only 
 four properties. Pipeline Petroleum is the historical best price 
 compared to Fritch and Deiter Bros, but we also want service and choose 
 Fritch for convenience. This is a tough call.  Email your thoughts . I&apos;m leaning toward a 50-75% annual volume lock, but I&apos;m ambivalent 
 because of the recent stock market activity (which is forecasting a 
 business slowdown). 

 Oil&amp;Gas industry consolidation expected 
 to accelerate over next 12 months, domestic natural gas producers to be 
 primary tgts - Oppenheimer 

 6/17/06:  I like to revisit prescient calls .  Did we hit a short term bottom in natural gas? Beware of a 
 V-move. A recent publication by Hess is posted in the Gas section. I&apos;ve 
 had questions about the players in the local gas market ; top three are Gasmark, Hess, and Texon . Hope this graph helps to understand heating oil 
 price today. We&apos;re essentially 50 cents higher than last year&apos;s 
 price; remember, you need to add at least 35 cents to the market price 
 of spot for storage/delivery. Your supplier can buy at spot but 
 he&apos;s not going to deliver to you for no profit. T4 has an action 
 item to consider an LVAIC oil service/delivery operation; would need at 
 least two employees. If we bought wholesale and did all the 
 service, we might save a significant sum. This item will be 
 discussed during our one-on-one meetings. 

 6/16/06:  We talked about oil vs. service at 
 the last LVAIC meeting. Here&apos;s an example . I also added 
 a few historical information scans to the Electricity page. BANANA 
 = Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody, which trumps the NIMBY 
 = Not In My BackYard. Here&apos;s an old chart that shows why 
 #6 oil and coal are kings. I&apos;ve also corrected some bad links on 
 the gas page. Sorry. 

 6/15/06:  Kuwait Oil Min: Considers 
 $45-$55/bbl a stable price; &quot;terror premium&quot;on oil $8-$12/bbl , expects 
 winter demand less than last year - DJ 

 6/14/06:  Remember the comment about new 
 plants at yesterday&apos;s LVAIC meeting?  Check this out . The 
 stock market is acting as if another recession or business slowdown is 
 in the works. Bad is good for energy prices. As Sgt 
 Esterhaus said on Hill Street Blues,&quot;Let&apos;s be careful out there.&quot; Did anyone see the ad for propane from Pipeline Petroleum in Sunday&apos;s Morning Call?  $1.41 delivered is a great 
 price.  Here&apos;s a real world scenario: T4 gets home 
 tank filled...bill is $3.95/gal...T4 calls Suburban Energy Svcs...oh, 
 that&apos;s a mistake...how about $2.50?...sounds OK, except I know that 
 Trexler-Haines charges $1.80 to LU; when asked, they acknowledged that 
 would also be the consumer cost for&gt;300gal/yr...so now we&apos;re in the 
 reduce your charge or take your tanks back ($120 charge) mode. T4 
 knows that NYMEX cost right now is $1.02 or so. Pipeline can get 
 it to you for $1.41 and T-H for $1.80. These fees are comparable 
 due to tank rental charge. $3.95 is criminal. 

 6/13/06: WSJ reports surge in Internet use, 
 energy costs has big tech companies seeking power . The search 
 is being led by cos including Microsoft, Yahoo and IAC/InterActiveCorp. 
 Big Internet cos have been adding thousands of computer servers to data 
 centers to handle heavy customer use of their services, including 
 ambitious new offerings such as online video. Some Internet executives say 
 electricity has become a closely watched expense and can even be 
 a factor when they consider rolling out new services. While always a 
 concern, the cost of power has 
 become more important amid a recent run-up in energy prices and 
 increased use at data centers. To satisfy their power needs, Internet 
 cos are exploring options ranging from building facilities in former 
 defense bunkers -- which already have rugged grid connections -- to 
 plunking themselves down near hydroelectric plants to get a slice of the 
 inexpensive power. Anticipating demand a decade from now, some 
 executives even are mulling whether proximity to nuclear-power plants 
 could be a plus. The scramble serves as a reminder of the strategic 
 physical issues facing cos whose most visible presence is on the 
 Internet. For all the popularity of on-screen features of YHOO&apos;s or 
 Google&apos;s Web sites, their long-term prospects could increasingly depend 
 as well on how they manage such physical considerations as power.

 cents to $2.2550/gal. US Energy Secretary says current crude oil 
 prices too high, spare global capacity is tight - Reuters   (T4 opinion: this is an oxymoronic statement)   T4 has 
 written an editorial letter to the Morning Call to see if the electric 
 rate warning fire can get lit. All of this and Hurricane Alberto 
 is lurking! 

 6/6/06: Bad news for electricity consumers in 
 Pennsylvania... your electric 
 bill will be at least 60% higher after the rate caps expire on 12/31/09 . Happy 2010. This is not a speculative projection. It is a 
 fact based on the (current and projected future) market price of power 
 in the PJM. T4 attended a PPLICA meeting today and met with a 
 group of power consumers that make LVAIC look like a tiny dot on the 
 usage radar. Deregulation is a fact and both Federal and State 
 laws support the power companies and the situation we are facing.  

 Note from Bill Marushak regarding #2 fuel oil procurement ...T4 
 opinion:  if you can beat 
 $2.30 delivered, you can beat the market . 

 6/5/06: Crude oil is up strongly after Iran&apos;s top 
 leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Sunday that energy supplies from 
 the Gulf region would be disrupted if his country was attacked by the 
 US; Iran is the 2nd largest oil producer in OPEC at 3.85mln bpd. Crude 
 oil is up $1.16 to $73.49pbl (range is 72.47 to 73.84). The WSJ reports 
 that Saudi Arabia&apos;s oil minister confirmed that his country&apos;s massive 
 crude-oil output has declined in recent months, but he attributed the 
 trend to a drop in demand and denied the kingdom is aiming to limit 
 supply. Natural gas is up 8 cents to $6.705mbtu (range is 6.64 to 
 6.82). Strong words out of Iran regarding their right to produce nuclear 
 energy is boosting products . Heating oil is up 4.36 cents to 
 $2.0581/gal (range is 2.0260 to 2.0635); gasoline is up 3.2 cents 
 to $2.2295/gal (range is 2.1950 to 2.2350). 

 6/2/06:  Global oil demand growth forecast 
 to rise 1.42 mln bpd in 2007, according to Reuters survey - Reuters 

 6/1/06: T4 one step ahead of the WSJ!  WSJ reports the proposed buyout of pipeline company Kinder Morgan ( KMI ) 
 highlights a new way Wall Street is seeking to profit from price moves 
 in oil and natural gas: to physically move the commodities. In recent 
 weeks, two of the financial 
 world&apos;s biggest commodities players , Goldman Sachs Group ( GS ) 
 and Morgan Stanley ( MS ), have sought to take stakes in fuel-distribution cos that operate 
 in the commercial side of the commodities boom. Their interest in these 
 transport cos, which function like tollbooth operators and deliverymen 
 for raw materials, suggests that as natural resources become more sought 
 after, the infrastructure that gets the materials to market is viewed as 
 a hot commodity, too. GS -- along with a group of other investors, 
 including American International Group ( AIG ) and Carlyle Group&apos;s 
 Riverstone Holdings affiliate -- proposes to put up $4.5 bln as part of 
 a mgmt-led buyout of KMI. MS, meanwhile, has been locked in a protracted 
 bidding war to purchase petroleum-products distribution co 
 TransMontaigne ( TMG ). Both efforts show how investing and trading 
 in commodities is evolving as more players rush in and seek a fresh 
 competitive edge. Both the trading desks and the private-equity arms of 
 Wall Street firms, as well as hedge funds, are now investing in the 
 storage and distribution of valuable commodities. |  Libya

 5/23/06 : Gas is bouncing off an uptrend 
 line. I believe gas prices will continue to drift down until the 
 first hurricane threatens the Gulf. July crude oil (now the 
 spot contract) is up 82 cents to $70.78pbl (range is 69.85 to 70.96); 
 crude is higher after yesterday&apos;s hurricane forecast (possible 10 
 hurricanes this season) and word that Valero Energy (VLO), the largest 
 U.S. oil refiner, said diesel and gasoline production was cut at its 
 Norco, Louisiana, refinery following a 5/20 explosion and fire (the 
 accident also damaged some electrical and data transmission lines, 
 requiring the shutdown of a crude distillation unit, a coker and three 
 other refinery units). Kuwait&apos;s Shuaiba refinery caught fire but is 
 believed to be operating normally (the refinery has the capacity for 
 200,000 bpd), Higher gasoline prices ahead of the Memorial Day holiday 
 are also lifting crude. Natural gas is continuing yesterday&apos;s 
 uptrend and is up 12 cents to $6.40mbtu (range is 6.277 to 6.40). Heating oil is up 3.36 cents to $1.9962/gal (range is 1.9325 to 
 1.9725). Gasoline is up 3.48 cents to $2.0922/gal (range is 
 2.0560 to 2.0950); June gold is up $3.70 to $660.20 (range 
 is 652 to 663.80) largely due to higher energy prices, which have made 
 the inflation hedge more attractive this morn (also a weaker dollar is 
 fostering more of a currency hedge). Copper is up 13.35 
 cents to $3.595 a pound on the COMEX (copper rose $255 to $7,835 a 
 metric ton on the LME on speculation demand will exceed production). Aluminum rose $55 to $2,815 a ton on the LME. 

 5/2/06 : Iran, the world&apos;s second largest oil producer, on Tuesday predicted that crude oil prices might touch $100 a barrel by the winter of 2006 . Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, who had last year predicted that crude prices will touch $70, on Tuesday said:&quot;It is possible&quot;, when asked if crude prices could touch $100 a barrel. 

 4/28/06 : (NYMEX ENERGY CLOSE) Crude oil rose 83 cents to $71.80pbl; nat gas fell 26 cents to $6.55mbtu; heating oil rose 2.93 cents to $2.0150/gal; unleaded gasoline rose 4.81 cents to $2.12/gal while RBOB gasoline jumped 7.31 cents to $2.24/gal 

 4/28/06 : Samuel Bodman, Energy Sec , appears on CNBC to discuss energy situation, and what steps the gov is taking to correct it. He believes that ANWAR makes sense, wants to push Congress to move on this . He says that the gov won&apos;t start adding oil back to reserve until fall, and although this is not a major amount of oil being added into the mkt right now, it is something. He says that it is possible to lower tariffs on ethanol, but he doesn&apos;t believe that is the biggest issue. Right now he believes that the biggest issue is getting the ethanol is distributed. He doesn&apos;t believe tariffs are protecting American co&apos;s interests at expense of keeping gas prices low. Says the country will see an increase of ethanol usage of about 40% increase (5.6 or so bln gallons will be used this year) . They are working on increasing supply and technology to help with the energy demand. He doesn&apos;t know if price gouging is actually happening, but the opportunity exist to register complaints about possible gouging. No suspicion that he is aware of, notes we have seen some instances of this (following hurricanes saw $7 and $8/gallon), but has no reports of anything this high. Believes that we are &quot;going to get out of this box&quot; that we are currently in. Says its a deadly serious matter, something that the President is very serious about it, something that everyone in Administration is focused on. 

 4/25/06 : Boone Pickens says that energy will be front and center for a long time, and would not be in a rush to sell. Says President&apos;s administration getting pressure from Sen Specter about price gouging (Pickens says there is no such thing happening in terms of gouging). Says we are in contango (when back months are worth more in storage than out of the ground); says no one in rush to sell inventory with so much going on in the world (i.e. Nigeria, Iran, Venezuela). Says we will see $80 oil before $60 . Says there is plenty of nat gas around, and nat gas will go down further . Says only reason nat gas holding above $7 is due to high oil; says hurricane season or cold winter can bring us back to $15 nat gas . Based on supply/demand, he thinks oil could be $60 or $65 based on his gut feeling. 

 4/21/06 : Crude oil hit a fresh record high of $74.15 as concerns continue to escalate that supplies may shrink due to geopolitical issues in Iran and Nigeria. Concerns that MBTE being removed from gasoline may cause temporary gas hikes would be incrementally positive for crude prices, since gas is derived from crude oil. 

 (earlier today) June crude oil is off 71 cents to $72.98pbl (range is 72.73 to 73.50); the sell-off is associated w/ Royal Dutch Shell&apos;s Mars restarting the Mars platform earlier than anticipated; will resume pre-hurricane levels by the end June (full capacity at the platform is ~220,000bpd). Efe newswire reported that Venezuela&apos;s Chavez would be content with oil at $50pbl . Natural gas is off 25 cents to $7.824mbtu (range is 7.801 to 8.02). Heating oil is off 2.52 cents to $2.0284/gal (range is 2.0250 to 2.0491). Gasoline is off 3.34 cents to $2.1814/gal (range is 2.1760 to 2.2075) many people believe any pullback in prices will be short-lived b/c of the changeover from MTBE to RBOB (RBOB is a wholesale non-oxygentated blendstock traded in the New York Harbor barge market that is ready for the addition of 10% ethanol at the truck rack). May RBOB gasoline closed yesterday at $2.3220/gal. 

 4/20/06 : LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Oil jumped to a fresh record high above $74 a barrel on Thursday after a steep drop in U.S. gasoline inventories fueled fears of tight summer supplies at a time of growing anxiety over Iran&apos;s exports. The United States on Wednesday reported a l arger-than-expected drop in gasoline inventories of over 5 million barrels , adding to concern created by the shutdown of almost a quarter of Nigeria&apos;s oil output and the row over Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. &quot;We&apos;ve gone from comfortable U.S. gasoline stocks to average and seem to be heading very clearly toward the low of the range,&quot; said Deborah White of SG SIB Commodities in Paris. &quot;The market is worried about that.&quot; London&apos;s Brent crude climbed as high as $74.22 a barrel, its eighth consecutive session to mark a new peak. It was trading down 3 cents at $73.70 a barrel by 1132 GMT. U.S. May crude oil futures were down 3 cents to $72.14, hitting an all-time high of $72.49 earlier. Gasoline stocks in the U.S. fell as demand averaged over 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd), 0.8 percent more than a year earlier, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. &quot;It&apos;s all about gasoline and it has been since January,&quot; said U.S. consultant PFC Energy in a report, adding that stocks are at the bottom of a five-year range in terms of days of supply 

 4/18/06 : Crude opened at $72+, an all-time high . June crude oil continues to hit new session highs, now 72.90 +0.92 

 4/17/06 : 

 Gold prices are rallying into 25-year highs and crude oil prices (May contract) are trading at $69.70pbl --- near levels seen post Hurricane Katrina ( $70.85 high on Aug 30th ) as growing tensions in Iran cause a spike in energy prices that has many investors thinking could foster global inflation (gold historically has been considered a great inflation hedge).
