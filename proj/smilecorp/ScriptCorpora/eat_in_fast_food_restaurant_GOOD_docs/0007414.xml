 Imagine your next holiday in Ireland.... 

 Advantages: Pleasant to do business with, competitive ferry prices when booked as a package
 Disadvantages: Credit Card supplements


...I have to admit, trying to find a cottage for a week?s holiday in Northern Ireland was quite a challenge. My internet research uncovered loads of sites, and it was a question of too many to choose from. I wanted a well kept fairly contemporary decorated home somewhere close to Portrush/Bushmills area, and it did seem that there were plenty to choose from. One site that I hit a few times was the Imagine Ireland website. As the name suggests, Imagine Ireland book self catering/cottage holidays across the whole of Ireland, and they also have some properties in the UK and even in France. They have been trading since 2002, so a reasonable on line history. I finally settled on a particular property in Bushills (property no 9708) and sent off an on line query. I particularly liked this website as it did have what looked like up...

Review of Imagine Ireland 
 
 Curry In A Hurry! 

 Advantages: cheap, quick, tasty
 Disadvantages: don&apos;t eat every day, you will need variation


...Ready meals have been my best friend whilst at university as they are relatively cheap, easy to make and already prepared so there&apos;s no messing about with a long recipe or buying loads of different ingredients that I&apos;ll only ever use once and then they&apos;ll go mouldy at the back of the cupboards (ew!). 

My favourite curry is Korma because I&apos;m a bit of a wuss when it comes to spicy foods but I love the creaminess of korma so the Tesco Korma was the obvious choice when looking at the selection of Indian ready meals on offer. 

The curry comes in a cardboard sleeve which has an image of the curry on the front, the cooking instructions and ingredients on the back and a brief product description and title on the font. Inside the sleeve is a black plastic tray with two troughs one houses around 10-15 spoon fulls of pilau rice and the other...

Review of Birds Eye Chicken Curry With Rice 
 
 CURRY IN A HURRY 

 Advantages: tastes nice, won&apos;t make you fat
 Disadvantages: could of had vegetables in the sauce


...I previously wrote a review about the sweet chilli chicken curry from the Weight Watchers range and brought this chicken curry at the same time. These ready meals are mostly used for during the week when my busy lifestyle makes me too tired to cook anything! I did used to buy the standard ready meals from supermarkets but they are so bad for you and with joining Weight Watchers I decided to give these a go. If you&apos;re thinking about trying them too check out my review about the Sweet Chilli Chicken because I recommend it!

The meal cooks the same as any other ready meal - in the microwave or the oven. I prefer to use the micowave because I usually begin to cook these once I&apos;m starving! Cooking in the oven takes 40 minutes but obviously this depends on the oven you have. Mine is incredibly fast to heat up and cook for some reason (I found...
