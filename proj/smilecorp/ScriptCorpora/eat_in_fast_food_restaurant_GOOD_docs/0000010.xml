Crappy Look Counter

So, when I started this whole thing, I thought Crappy Looks would be daily. You know what, my faith in humanity wasn’t strong enough. While that faith is still deserved (e.g., no/few crappy looks, I will document each and every one–hopefully w/o PII, but if you recco yourself, well, then, thats something you own, not me!)

Current Counter

8

Lifetime Until 12/7/2007–0–I lead a Life of Priviledge (white, male (presenting), cute (passable–my blog, my words–deal )

12/7/2007 - SFO Airport–at gate 87, walking back from Peet’s coffee, dude w/a rollaboard.

12/10/2007–Seattle–Bus #3–Lady Sitting Across From Me (LADY–too kind)

12/10/2007–Seattle–Walking into King County District Court Building with Jenny–Perp Leaning Against the Wall (Dude, that was HARSH)

12/10/2007–Seattle–Restaurant–Poseur, Hanger-On who neither worked there, nor owned it. JUST ASK–don’t stare, and DAMN if you want to listen to our convo, ask to join us!

12/10/2007–Seattle–Bus #4–Young Woman Sitting Across From Me. This is an unconfirmed crappy look sighting. I wasn’t sure, but I think so. It was a least a stare, and it was for too long. I THEREFORE RULE IT CRAPPY. Please, don’t stare. I *know* I’m beautiful.

12/12/2007–Three days, no crappy looks. I’ve been out and about a lot…its been totally fine!

1/5/2008–Seattle–Queen Anne Peet’s Coffee–~945am–Wow, nearly a month. Well, it was bound to happen sometime. I didn’t just get a Crappy Look, I got a“Harumph!”. Older guy in front of me doing the“add sugar/cream”thing, turned around, looked me up and down, and I got the Crappy Look, plus the“Harumph!”. I was wearing baggy running pants, three layers, and a hat. Ok, sure, my outer layer was zipped down but whatever.

1/11/2008–SeaTac–Airport–“A”Gates, outside of the restroom area by gate A9. This is an indirect Crappy Look sighting, but it came from a reliable source (Anh). We get off the plane, and I have to use the restroom. Anh and Samwich are outside waiting. I come out, and behind me is an older“lady”who gives her older“husband”some sort of Crappy Look, pointing at me. He looks at her, shrugs, gives his own Crappy Look (I didn’t see it again, Anh did), and then they move on. We need to consult with the Crappy Look audit committee–this may count for two, but for now, I’ll count it as one.

2/28/08 Little Girls at Art Class

It was a“giggle moment”, not crappy, but not unmentionable either. For the record, its now eight.

Ah the odd stares, I would have quite an astonishing collection if I kept track of all the peeps looking oddly at me (crappy looks as you call them). It never really got to me, and 99% of the times I don’t even notice them anymore. I’m looking forward to your crappy faces count …

Sophie

PS
been reading some of your posts, nice to read!

Megan&gt;&gt;(At her snarky best) Dammit, how do I put the infinity symbol in with this editor? (re crappy faces)

Seriously though–if you didn’t get from this page (and everything else) that I just viewed this as a little society experiment, and never once has anyone made me feel bad w/a look (since I got whole–recently–thats not a lifetime comment, I’m not that good).

But, thanks for reading and the comment. Its still 5 BTW. Samwich was kind last night, and I didn’t have to up the counter.

Oh dear no, i well understood that this isn’t a number-of-times-people-make-me-feel-bad-by-the-way-they-look-at me counter. People looking oddly at me make me grin on the inside (i must write the reasoning behind this in a post on my blog one day, would take too much space here), maybe i should’ve wrote that in stead of“It never really got to me”.
The memorable‘crappy looks are those from kids age 4 to 10, because they’re so persistent and it’s adorable. (Hard to keep a grin inside in such a situation)
So I wish you many of such encounters

Just noticed. You are still wearing a man’s watch. I KNOW all the women’s watches suck. I have personally raged against this, but if you want to pass better, get a women’s watch. It doesn’t need to be expensive, but it does need to be delicate and feminine.

Just a detail I noticed from today’s video…

Interestingly enough I get more“odd looks”when I go out in drab than I do when I go out presenting as a female. Most of it probably is my longer hair, but also from less facial hair and effects of hormones on my face. I think most are trying to figure out if I am a man who looks feminine or a woman who looks masculine. I feel sorry for those drive-through clerks at a fast food restaurant who goes back and forth on the gender pronouns. My voice also is somewhat androgynous, which probably does not help as much. It kind of reminds me of that one skit on older episodes of Saturday Night Live, with a character named Chris and others trying to figure out if a man or woman.

My husband when to Thailand and got FFS. He looks like a female but a little over done. Big lips, eye lift, eye brow shave, chin shave, nose job. But he didn’t tell me he was getting boobs. He denied it until he got back to the US. I feel lied to. He said he had to do what he had to do. A month later I delivered a baby girl. He left me alone for a month during my final months of my pregnancy. I didn’t want to live with him because of all this transition but took him in b.c I needed help with my two daughters.
Its a crazy thing that is hard to deal with.
thanks.

Megan&gt;&gt;Wow, that sounds incredibly hard, and I’m sorry that you had to go through that.

I think this points out an interesting point–that the dishonesty is more harmful than anything else. I can’t say that I was as always as honest with Anh as I should have been and I now realize that I would have made it easier on us all if I was. I just thankful that she was willing to give me the chance to learn from the mistakes that I made.

Aaaah. Isn’t it great to live in a world where you can look at these crappy-look givers and know that your response can be,“f***‘em”, and not give a second thought. If only more people realized that, they’d save themselves a lot of hassle.

Our 19-year old son came out to us a year ago as a MTF, and has been seeing a counselor for the past year. He recently dropped out of college to work full-time for Wal Mart (I know, ironic, considering that cross-dressing video making the rounds right now). We’d really like him to go back to college eventually, but we understand his need to take a step back from it right now.

I was looking for employers who cover transgender health coverage and Microsoft popped up. It was great to read that they are so supportive, and it gives me great hope in humanity to see that more people are cool about this, and that the crappy-look givers are in the minority. Just remember, the adaptable people of the world are the strong ones, and the others are the people who do not prosper, and will eventually die out.

Does Anh keep a“crappy look”counter? In my experience, I tend to not notice as many“looks”as my wife does when we are out together. . . and if I do notice, I am less quick to label it“crappy”as she might. We have three theories about this:
The first theory is that people are busy giving a look and concealing it from me, but they don’t notice my wife, who sees what’s going on. Therefore, she sees the crappy looks–I don’t. Our second theory is that she is paranoid. The third theory is that I am naive.
