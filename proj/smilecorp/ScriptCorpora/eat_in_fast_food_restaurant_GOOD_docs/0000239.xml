A Restaurant Guide - From Fast Food to Fine Dining

With so many choices for dining-out, you may need a restaurant guide to help you make sense of them all. Want to know the difference between fast food and casual dining? Curious about what sets fine dining establishments apart from their casual cousins? If so, then this restaurant guide can help!

There was a time when the word“restaurant”referred specifically to an eatery where customers were sat at tables and served by waiters. However, with the rise of fast food and take-out restaurants, the meaning of the word has grown quite broad.

Fast Food Restaurant Guide

Fast food (or take-out) restaurants are those that emphasize low cost and speed of service above all else. The fast food category covers a wide variety of eateries, from small scale street vendors to globe-spanning franchises. For the sake of convenience, these restaurants typically serve their food in paper or plastic containers, providing disposable plastic cutlery if necessary.

Most fast food establishments offer a variety of low-maintenance, easy-to-eat sandwiches and finger foods. These food items are often prepared ahead of time so they’ll be ready to serve as soon as they’re ordered. However, one popular variation of the fast food model is the delicatessen, where made-to-order sandwiches and salads are served from behind a counter.

By its very nature, fast food has a reputation for being unhealthy. However, a number of fast food restaurants have amended their menu to offer fresh and nutritional alternatives to their traditional fare.

Casual Dining Restaurant Guide

Casual dining restaurants offer food that is moderately priced in an atmosphere that is laid-back and informal. Most casual dining establishments adhere to the traditional restaurant service model, where the diner sits at a table, orders from a menu, and is attended by a server. However, some casual dining restaurants offer a buffet-style serving line, while others provide counter-service (similar to fast food restaurants, where the customers place their order and pay at a counter, then carry their food to their own table).

Casual dining restaurants typically provide a wider menu selection than fast food eateries. Meals are served on proper plates, and actual cutlery is provided. Many casual dining restaurants also include a full bar, with a reasonable selection of beers and a limited wine menu.

Casual dining includes a wide variety of restaurant types, including cafeterias, pubs, bistros, all-you-can-eat buffets, Mongolian barbecues, and Japanese teppanyaki grills.

Fine Dining Restaurant Guide

Fine dining restaurants are full service, offering high quality meals in a formal atmosphere. Most fine dining establishments offer prix fixe menus (limited menus that change daily or weekly). The food is expertly prepared by chefs and often served in a manner that is creative and visually appealing. With fine dining, the meal itself is an event, often delivered over a number of set courses.

A fine dining restaurant usually features an extensive wine list that compliments its menu. It also offers a variety of top shelf liquors, as well as a selection of brandies, cognacs, and other after-dinner drinks.

Customers of fine dining establishments can expect to receive attentive service from a well-trained and formally-attired wait staff. The servers are knowledgeable and quite capable of making menu suggestions, or answering questions. The atmosphere is traditionally that of fine china and linen tablecloths, although some trendier restaurants may opt for modern furnishings and bold colors. Lighting is generally subdued, and music is often played subtly in the background.

More so than the other establishments in this restaurant guide, fine dining restaurants are quite exclusive. Most require reservations, and many have a strictly-enforced dress code.
