 Never Say No To La Novia (1,859 thumbs up) FOR SALE: 
 The YAM Network (Auction ends Thursday, July 12, 2012!) 
 The Fries Are Tastier On The Other Side 
 Restaurant | Ottawa, Ontario, Canada | Food&amp;Drink 
 (I work at a food court restaurant that primarily serves fries. On quiet days like today, we do all our cooking to order. A group of three French women have just come up to our counter and are trying to decide what to order. They each get an order of fries and gravy and leave to sit and eat. Suddenly, the first customer comes back to the counter.) 

 Customer #1: “I want new fries.”

 Me: “I’m terribly sorry. Was there something wrong with your food?”

 Customer #1: “Their fries taste better.”

 Me: “Pardon me?”

 Customer #1: “I tried my fries, then I tried their fries. Theirs are better, so I want new ones!”

 (All three women’s fries were from the same batch, cooked and prepared exactly the same way.)

 Weeding Out The Crazies 
 Retail | Chicago, Illinois, USA | 
 (I work in a store that sells lotions, body scrubs, etc. One of our best sellers is our line of hemp products.) 

 Customer: “So, what’s this stuff over here?”

 Me: “This is all of our hemp products. A lot of customers who don’t like heavily-scented lotions tend to like this stuff a lot. It’s a fantastic moisturizer.”

 Customer: *quietly* “It’s not real hemp though, is it?”

 Me: “No, it is. All of our products contain natural ingredients.”

 Customer: “Oh, No! I want absolutely NOTHING to do with this stuff!” *walks away* 
 ( 699 Thumbs Up!) 
 On Our Side For Once 
 Grocery Store | New York, NY, USA | Crazy Requests 
 (A customer left her shopping cart in front of my register. Another customer is walking up before I can move it. This is a huge pet peeve of mine.) 

 Customer: “Did they leave that there so I would trip?”

 Me: “No, she left it because she was lazy.”

 Customer: *completely seriously* “You’re so nice!”

 Me: “Thank you?”

 Customer: “You’re just as nice as everyone else who works here. Do they only hire nice people here?”

 Me: “Yes, sir, they try to only hire nice people here.”

 Customer: “Well, you tell your manager to start hiring some rude people!”

 Me: “Excuse me, Sir?”

 Customer: “Yes! Hire some rude people! Keep us on our toes!”

 Me: “Okay, I’ll let someone know.”

 Intellectual Stimulation: Not Self Perpetuating 
 Call Center | Edinburgh, UK | 
 (I work in a market research call center. I carry out all kinds of surveys on behalf of various organizations. On this particular day, we are calling final year undergraduate university students to ask them for some feedback on their university course. Bear in mind this person has spent the past 3 years studying at university.) 

 Me: “On a scale of 1-10, 10 being very and 1 not at all, how intellectually stimulating would you say your course was?”

 Student: “What does intellectually stimulating mean?”
 ( 1,080 Thumbs Up!) 
 Equal Opportunity Confusion 
 home improvement | Lexington, KY, USA | Bigotry 
 (I am a female employee at a popular home improvement retailer, where I get a lot of sexist comments. A male customer nearby looks confused.) 

 Me: “Sir, is there anything I can help you with?”

 Customer: “I’m going to say yes, because I don’t discriminate.”

 Me: *speechless* 
 ( 1,115 Thumbs Up!) 
 Canada: America’s Hat, Part 5 
 library | Central Florida, USA | Geography 
 (This is during the 2008 primaries. Our library has been set up as an early voting center. We have information sheets to help the voters make their choices.) 

 Customer: “I just don’t know what I should do. These things are so confusing. Who did you vote for?”

 Me: “I didn’t vote.”

 Customer: “That’s what’s wrong with you young people today. No ethics.”

 Me: “You misunderstand. I didn’t vote because I can’t vote.”

 Customer: *shocked* “Oh MY GOD! You’re a FELON? Why would they let a FELON work here?”

 Me: “No, ma’am. No. I’m not a citizen.”

 Customer: “Oh. You’re just saying that aren’t you?”

 Me: “No, ma’am. I’m not a citizen. Would you like to see my green card?”

 Customer: “So, you’re from Canada?”

 Me: “No, I’m from Europe.”

 Customer: “That’s in Canada, isn’t it?”

 Ethnically Ethical 
 Retail , Video Game Store | Wichita, KS, USA | 
 (An older lady is asking me for help with her shopping list.) 

 Customer: “Sir, do you…well, I don’t really know if I can say this out loud, but do you have this video game?”

 (The customer points at her list to the game title,“Ethnic Mickey”, which doesn’t exist. We sell“Epic Mickey”.) 

 Me: “Um, ma’am…we have Epic Mickey , if that helps.”

 Customer: “Oh, my goodness. Here I was, worried about the title and if it was appropriate. We spoke over the phone, so I guess I misheard.”
 ( 972 Thumbs Up!) 
 Actividad Paranormal 
 Restaurant | Washington, USA | Bizarre 
 (An older latino woman comes into the shop speaking rapidly in Spanish.) 

 Me: “Can I help you?”

 Customer: *continues to speak rapidly in Spanish* 

 Me: “I’m sorry, I don’t speak Spanish, but I can get somebody who can.”

 (I go to the back to get one of the other employees that speaks Spanish. After a few minutes, my coworker comes back shacking his head.) 

 Me: “What did the woman want?”

 Coworker: “She’s not right.”

 Me: “What do you mean?”

 Coworker: “She says that we have the spirit of a murdered boy in our basement.”

 Me: “But we don’t have a basement.”

 Coworker: “Exactly.”
