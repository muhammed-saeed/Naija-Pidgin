 I-40&amp;I-77 intersection at Statesville My cousin is coming from Raleigh with cat going to Winnsboro SC; and I am traveling from Boone going to meet her somewhere convenient. That is my question for this board...what would be simple, convenient place for her and I to meet to exchange the cat.

I am thinking that meeting her at the Intersections of 40 and a77 would be best for all. Am I thinking soundly here?

I could get on I-77 south and she could get on I-40 west; and we could meet at Statesboro where we would hug, I would take the cat whose owner was killed over Thanksgiving, then I would head back to Boone and she would go to her home in Winnsboro SC

Any suggestions for which exit? We are both over 60 yo and want something SIMPLE...that is the prioity.
thanks for suggestions and details.
She does have her adult son with her but I don&apos;t have such luck
Thanks

 I would recommend you go one exit NORTH on I-77 (I think it is 21 overpass).

There is really nothing at the 77-40 interchange except a cloverleaf, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you do not stop on it.

As I recall, and it has been awhile, the first exit north on 77, about a mile , is much more conducive to meeting. Good Luck.

 I think I found it!
I used the Holiday Inn map here:
 Map of Holiday Inn Statesville-I-77 Exit 49A, Statesville, North Carolina 
and was able to scroll to the Hwy 21/I-77 intersection. Hwy 21 is called
Turnersburg Highway.

Thank you so much for your advice. Perfect place for us to meet!

 Does anyone know if there is a gas station or fast food restaurant at this intersection? I need the NAME of either (like Exxon, Hess or Hardee&apos;s, Burger King)
Thanks

 I&apos;m going to suggest an alternative meeting place. There is a K&amp;W Cafeteria at Exit 151 off I-40. It&apos;s the first exit on I-40 west of I-77. It is a busy intersection because there is a LOT of shopping there, but K&amp;W is a great place to stop. Here is a map: K&amp;W Cafeterias Statesville NC Of course there are a lot of other restaurants there as well, but when we lived in Winston-Salem, this is where my husband used to meet his daughter who lives in Hickory.
