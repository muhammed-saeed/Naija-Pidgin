 A public group is a list of users created by the system administrator and is available for use by each GroupWise user. For example, there may be a public group for the Accounting Department. Each employee in Accounting is included in the group. Public groups are listed in the system address book. 

 A personal group is a group created by you. For example, if you often send an appointment to your work group, you can include each co-worker&apos;s address or name and a meeting place (a resource) in a personal group. Groups are marked with the icon.

  How do I add an automatic “signature” to the bottom of all my messages? 
 
 Use Signatures to insert a signature or tag-line at the end of items you send. 

 For example, you can have GroupWise automatically list your name, phone number, and e-mail address at the bottom of every item you send. If you have a number of different accounts, including POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP newsgroup accounts, you can create a different signature for each account. 

 You can also have GroupWise automatically add a vCard*, or virtual business card, to the end of messages. GroupWise searches the Address Book for your user information and places it at the end of any messages you send. 

 .vCard Files 

 vCards are electronic business cards formatted according to standards set by the Internet Mail Consortium. A vCard file has a .VCF extension, and you can add the file to your outgoing e-mail items. Third-party companies create software you can use to create vCards that include text, graphics, and sound. 

 When you use GroupWise to generate your vCard, it uses the information from the fields in your Address Book listing. 

 To view a vCard that has been attached to an item, right-click it&gt;click View 

 Attachment. For information about importing vCard information into an address book. 

 Adding a Signature or vCard to Items 

 1. Click Tools&gt;Options&gt;double-click Environment&gt;click the Signature tab. 

 2. Click Electronic Business Card (vCard) or Signature. 

 3. If you selected Signature, type the text you want as a signature in the Signature box. 

 or 

 If you selected vCard, either specify a .VCF file or leave the field empty to have the vCard use information from your listing in the Address Book. 

 4. Click Automatically Add to add the signature or vCard to every item you send. 

 or 

 Click Prompt Before Adding to give you the choice whether or not to add the signature or vCard every time you send an item. 

 5. Click OK. 

 You can have both a signature and a vCard at the same time. 

 Adding a Signature for POP3/IMAP4/NNTP Accounts 

 If you have a number of different accounts, including POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP newsgroup accounts, you can create a different signature for each account. You can have both a signature and a vCard at the same time. 

 1. Click Accounts&gt;Account Options. 

 2. Click the Mail or News tab. 

 3. Click the account you want to create the signature for&gt;Properties. 

 4. Click the Signature tab. 

 5. Click Electronic Business Card (vCard) or Signature. 

 6. If you selected Signature, type the text you want as a signature in the Signature box. 

 or 

 If you selected vCard, either specify a .VCF file or leave the field empty to have the vCard use information from your listing in the Address Book.

 8. Click OK. 
 How do I attach a file to an email message? 
 You can attach one or more files or document references to the items you send. 

 You can also embed one or more OLE objects. You can use files that exist on your hard disk, a diskette, or a network drive. The recipients can open the attached file, save it, view it, or print it. If you change the attached file after you have sent it, the recipients will not see the changes. 

 If you attach a file that is password-protected, the recipient cannot open or view the attachment without entering the password. 

 If the file you want to attach is a document stored in GroupWise Library, you can attach a document reference. When a recipient opens the attachment, the document in the library will open if the recipient has rights to open or view the document and if the library is available. If any recipients do not have sufficient document rights, or if they are not using an e-mail product that supports GroupWise Library, or if the library is unavailable, only a copy of the document will open. If the recipient edits the copy, the changes will not affect the actual document in the library. 

 1. Open a new item. 

 2. Fill in the To, Subject, and Message boxes. 

 3. Click Attach&gt;browse to and select the file or files you want to send. 

 To remove an attached file, right-click the attachment&gt;click Delete. 

 4. Click OK&gt;Send. 

 Moving or deleting a file on a disk or network drive does not affect a file you’ve attached to an item and sent. If you delete an attached file, it is not erased from disk or network drive; it is simply removed from the attachment list. 

 Attaching a Document Reference to an Item 

 1. Open a new item. 

 2. Fill in the To, Subject, and Message boxes. 

 3. Click Attach&gt;Document Reference. 

 4. In the Library drop-down list, click the library that contains the document you want to attach. 

 5. In the Document # box, type the document number. 

 If you don’t know the number of the document, click Find to locate the document in the library. To attach a document displayed in the Find Results dialog box, click the document&gt;click OK. 

 6. In the Version drop-down list, click which version you want to attach. If you select Specific Version, type the version number in the Version # box. 

 7. Click OK&gt;Send. 

 Attaching Sound Files to an Item 

 You can add voice or digitally recorded sound files to an item. For example, you might dictate a letter and have the recipient listen to the dictation and type the letter. You must have the appropriate hardware and software drivers installed. 

 1. In an open item, drag from the status bar onto any area of the view outside of the boxes. 

 If your computer has the appropriate hardware and software drivers, the Sound Recorder dialog box will appear. 

 2. Click the circle to begin recording the sound. 

 3. Click the square to stop the recording. 

 4. Click File&gt;Exit&amp;Return to GroupWise to close the Sound Recorder dialog box and attach the file to your message. 
 How do I open/save a file attached to an email message? 
 
 Opening Attached Files 

 When you open an attached file, GroupWise determines the correct application to open the file in. You can accept the suggested application, or you can type the path and filename to another application. 

 1. Open the item containing the attachment. 

 2. Right-click the attachment&gt;click Open. 

 or 

 If you cannot see an icon representing the attachment in your view, click File&gt;Attachments&gt;Open. 

 Saving an Item to Disk or to a GroupWise Library 

 1. Click the item you want to save&gt;click File&gt;Save As. 

 2. Ctrl+click the item and attachments you want to save. 

 3. Select to save the item to disk or to a GroupWise Library. 

 4. Type a filename for the item in the Save File As text box. 

 or 

 Type a subject name in the Subject box. 

 5. To save the item in a different directory than is shown in the Current Directory text box, click Browse&gt;select the new directory. 

 or 

 To save the item in a different GroupWise Library, click the drop-down list&gt;select a library name. 

 6. If you are saving to disk, select Report Filename Conflicts to be prompted before replacing a file with the same name. 

 7. If you are saving to a GroupWise Library, make sure Set Properties Using Default Values is selected unless you want to specify document properties at this time. 

 8. Click Save&gt;Close. 

 Saved items remain in your Mailbox as well as being copied to the location you specify. Items are saved in WordPerfect* format, but with a .DOC extension so that they can also be opened in Word. Attachments are saved in their original format. 
 How do I create an automatic out-of-office (e.g., on vacation) message? 
 You can automate many GroupWise actions, such as replying when you’re outof the office, deleting items, or sorting items into folders, by using Rules to define a set of conditions and actions to be performed when an item meets those conditions. 

 When you create a rule, you must do the following: 

  Name the rule. 

  Select an event.The event is the trigger that starts the rule. 

  Select the types of items that will be affected by the rule. 

  Add an action. The action is what you want the rule to do when it is triggered. 

  Save the rule. 

  Make sure the rule is enabled. 
 How can I check my e-mail via the Internet when I’m away from my office? 
 Remote mode is similar to Caching mode, a copy of the Online mailbox, or the portion of the mailbox that you specify, is stored on your local drive. You can retrieve and send messages on a periodic basis with the type of connection you specify (modem, network, or TCP/IP). You can restrict what is retrieved, such as only new messages or only message subject lines. To use Remote mode, the client installation must be a standard installation, not a workstation installation. 

 Caching mode stores a copy of your Online (network) mailbox, including messages and other information, on your local drive. You can use GroupWise whether or not your network or Post Office Agent is available. Because you are not connected to the network all the time, this mode cuts down on network traffic and has the best performance. A connection is made periodically to retrieve and send new messages. All updates are performed in the background so GroupWise is not interrupted. This mode requires that you have enough disk space on your local drive to store your mailbox. When you run Caching mode and Remote mode on the same computer, the same local mailbox (also called the Caching mailbox or Remote mailbox) can be used to minimize disk space usage. To use Caching mode, the client installation must be a standard installation, not a workstation installation. 
 How do I change the look of my calendar screen (e.g., see one day at a time, see a week/month at a time, include Task List or not) 
 You can view your schedule in a variety of views or formats, including day, week, month, year, task list, project planner, and multi-user. For example, the month view lets you view a month schedule, while the Multi-User view lets you view, compare, and even manage the schedules of multiple users or resources to whose Calendars you have proxy rights. 

 You can use Graphic Display to show appointment duration in blocks to visualize time use in your schedule or you can use Text Display to better comprehend the sequence of your appointments. Time intervals in the Appointments List can be adjusted from ten minutes to two hours, depending on how detailed a list you want to see. You can also define your work schedule to display only your office hours on your Calendar. And by using Show Appointment As, you can display levels of availability for appointments in Busy Search and in your Calendar. 

 Many types of calendar views and printouts are available to let you choose the one that displays the information you need. 

 The calendar view in the folder list shows several tabbed calendar view options. You can add more tabs to the Calendar and configure them however you want. The view that is displayed when you exit your Calendar will be displayed when you open the Calendar folder again. 

 1. In your Folder List, click&gt;click the tab of the view you want to display. 

 or 

 Click Window&gt;Calendar. 

 You can view the Calendar in various formats, including week, month, and year. Click a different tab or click the arrow to the right of on the toolbar&gt;click a view. 

 You can right-click any day in the Calendar to get more options. For example, you can see any day in an expanded view that displays in a separate window. 

 You can also switch between Graphic Display and Text Display. If you want, you can close your folder list to leave more room for other views in the Main Window. Click View&gt;Folders List to open or close the Folder List display. 
 How do I create a new appointment on my calendar?
 
 Scheduling an Appointment for Yourself 

 If you are working toward a deadline, are on vacation, or are otherwise not available for meetings, schedule a posted appointment for those times. When another user includes you in an appointment and does a Busy Search, the user can see you are not available at those times. 

 Posted appointments are placed in your Calendar on the date you specify. 

 They are not placed in your Mailbox or in any other user’s Mailbox. 

 1. On the toolbar, click the arrow on the right of&gt;click Posted Appointment. 

 or 

 In your Calendar, open a view with an Appointments List&gt;click a date&gt;double-click a time in the Appointments List. 

 2. Type a subject and a place (optional). 

 3. Specify the start date and start time if you haven’t already done so. 

 4. If necessary, click the calendar icon to specify a date or auto-date for your appointment. 

 5. Specify a duration. Duration can be in minutes, hours, or days. 

 6. Type a message (optional). 

 7. Specify a Show Appointment As type by clicking Actions&gt;Show 

 Appointment As&gt;a type (optional). 

 8. Click OK. 

 For both group and posted appointments, being scheduled for a certain period does not prevent you from being scheduled for another appointment at the same time; it simply creates a scheduling conflict. Users who do a busy search will want to avoid double-booking you, but they can if they choose to. 
 How do I make it a recurring appointment on a particular schedule? 
 Scheduling Recurring Items 

 Use Auto-Date to schedule recurring appointments, tasks, and reminder notes. 

 For example, if you were responsible for scheduling a department meeting every other week, you could create one auto-date appointment that would schedule the meeting for the entire year. You could also reserve a room and projector with the same appointment. 

 Auto-Dates can occur on the same day every week (for example, every Monday), the same day(s) of the month (for example, the 15th and last day), or any other defined series of dates. You can also use Auto-Date to schedule irregular or infrequent events, such as holidays. 

 When you send an auto-date item, GroupWise copies the item and places one of the defined dates in each copy of the item. For example, if you define five dates for the event, GroupWise makes five copies of the item and schedules one copy for each date. If you send the item to other users, you will have five outgoing items with a five-occurrence auto-date. If you receive the event, you will find five copies of the incoming item in your Mailbox, each scheduled for a different date. 

 You can create an auto-date three ways. 

 Dates lets you select specific days from a year calendar. 

 Example lets you schedule events on the same day every week, the same day each month, or periodically. 

 Formula lets you enter the scheduling information in text format. 

 Scheduling a Recurring Item by Dates 

 1. In an item you are scheduling, click Actions&gt;Auto-Date.

 8. To verify the dates you have scheduled, click the Dates tab and check the dates selected in the calendar. 

 9. Click OK. 

 Scheduling a Recurring Item Based on the Last Day of the Month 

 You can schedule recurring items for events that occur a specified number of days before or after the last day of the month. For example, if you want a reminder note to appear in your Reminder Notes List on the second-to-last day of each month, type -1 in Step 8 below.

 5. If you want to clear the Auto-Date dialog box, click Reset. 

 6. To verify that you have scheduled the correct days, click the Dates tab. 

 The days you scheduled are selected in the calendar. If you want to deselect any occurrence, click the day you want to deselect on the Dates tab. 

 7. Click OK. 

 Using Auto-Date Formula Functions and Operators 

 You can schedule auto-dated items by formula, dates, or example. Formulas should only be used if you prefer them; scheduling is much easier by dates or example. 

 Auto-Date Formula Functions 

 Use the auto-date functions listed below to schedule specific days of a week, month, or year. You must use the exact spelling of the functions. For example, GroupWise reads “tue”, but not “tues”. GroupWise formula functions are not case sensitive. 

 Day of the Week 

 For example, TUE would schedule all Tuesdays. 

 Day of the Month 

 For example, the number 3 would schedule the 3rd day of the month. Also, the word LAST would schedule the last day of the month. 

 Day of the Year 

 For example, 35 would schedule the thirty-fifth day of the year. 

 Month of the Year 

 For example, JAN would schedule all days in January. 

 Year 

 For example, 2002 would schedule all days in 2002. 

 Weekday of the Month 

 For example, TUE(1). This would schedule the first Tuesday of the month. 

 Also, SUN(LAST) would schedule the last Sunday of the month, and FRI(LAST-1) would schedule the second to last Friday of the month. 

 Auto-Date Formula Operators 

 An operator is a character or word you insert in an auto-date formula to perform a specific operation. Each operator is assigned a priority, meaning that when a formula is evaluated, some operations are performed before others. 

 You can use grouping operators to group operators according to their priorities. The table below lists operators and their priorities. Additional details about the operators are provided following the table. 

 Grouping Operators 

 Use parentheses as grouping operators to change the priority of operators or to group functions together for clarification. 

 Function Priority 

 A blank space (high-priority And) 1 

 Plus or + 2 

 Minus or - 2 

 To or : 3 

 Every. . .Starting 4 

 Every. . .Ending 4 

 Before 5 

 On/Before 5 

 After 5 

 On/After 5 

 Near 5 

 Near/After 5 

 Or or , 6 

 Not or ! 6 

 And or&amp;(low-priority And) 7 

 Scheduling Group and Posted Items 99 

 For example, because the high-priority And operator (a space) has a higher priority than the Or operator (a comma), the formula below means that all scheduled days must fall on a Tuesday or must fall on a Thursday and be in the month of July or must be in the month of August. 

 tue,thu jul,aug 

 In other words, the formula is performed as if parentheses were inserted as 

 follows: 

 (tue,thu) (jul,aug) 

 Now examine the following formula: 

 (tue),(thu jul),(aug) 

 This formula would schedule all Tuesdays, all Thursdays in the month of July,and all days in the months of August. Notice how the meaning changes when parentheses are included as in the formula below. 

 (tue,thu) (jul,aug) 

 With the above formula, all scheduled days must fall on a Tuesday or Thursday and must be in the month of July or August. The end result is that only Tuesdays and Thursdays in July and August are scheduled. 

 High-Priority And 

 A space between two functions acts as an And operator, meaning that both functions must hold true. For example, 25 means the 25th day of all months in all years. But 25 oct means that all scheduled days must fall on the 25th day of the month and must be in October. And 25 oct 2002 means that all scheduled days must fall on the 25th day of the month and must be in October and must be in the year 2002. 

 Offset Operators 

 You can use a positive offset operator (+ or the word PLUS) or a negative offset operator (- or the word MINUS) to add a relative offset to a function or statement. 

 For example, to schedule an event three days before the first Thursday in February for all years, you could enter the following formula: 

 thu(1) feb-3 

 Range 

 The range operator (: or the word To) functions like a series of Or operators between each item (day, month, etc.) in the range. For example, if you want to schedule the 15th of every month, but only if the 15this a weekday, you could enter either of the following formulas: 

 15&amp;mon:fri 

 15(mon:fri) 

 This formula means that all scheduled days must fall on the 15th of the month and must be a day from Monday to Friday. Another way of describing the formula is that all scheduled days must fall on the 15th of the month and must be a Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday. 

 Periodic Operators 

 The three periodic operators are Every, Starting, and Ending. Use Every in combination with Starting and/or Ending to schedule days at regular intervals, beginning on a specific date and/or ending on a specific date. For example, suppose you want to schedule a meeting for once a week starting on March 3, 2002 and continuing through June 11, 2002. You could use the following formula: 

 every 7 starting mar 3 2002 ending jun 11 2002 

 The formula will schedule every seventh day starting with March 3, 2002 and ending with June 11, 2002. The starting date is always scheduled as the first day and the ending date is scheduled only if it naturally falls at the Every interval. 

 If you do not use both the Starting and Ending operators, the starting or ending date is the first or last date in the Calendar file. 

 For example, examine the following formula: 

 every 7 starting mar 3 2002 

 The above formula schedules every seventh day starting on March 3, 2002 and continuing to the last date in the Calendar file. The Every command will work with numbers up to 30. For example, “every 45 starting mar 3 2002” is not a valid formula.

 Relative Operators 

 The six relative operators are Before, On/Before, After, On/After, Near, and On/Near. Use these operators to schedule days relative to a specific date. For example, to schedule the Monday closest to November 6 in all years, you could enter the following formula: 

 mon on/near nov 6 

 If you need to schedule the first Tuesday after November 6, 2002, you could enter the following formula: 

 tue after nov 6 2002 

 Or 

 You can use the Or operator (a comma or the word Or) to indicate that one or the other function or statement must hold true in order to schedule days. 

 For example, to schedule an appointment on the 15th day of each month in the year 2002, but only if the 15th falls on a Tuesday or Thursday, enter the following formula: 

 15 2002 (tue,thu) 

 Not 

 When placed before a function, the Not operator (! or the word Not) negates that function. 

 For example, if you want to schedule all days in January 2002 except for Tuesdays and Thursdays, you could use the following formula: 

 jan 2002 !tue !thu 

 Low-Priority And 

 Like a space, the low-priority And operator (&amp;or the word And) between two functions indicates that both functions must hold true. However, the lowpriority And has the lowest priority of all operators. 

 For example, examine the following formula: 

 tue,thu jul,aug 

 This means that scheduled days must be a Tuesday or must be a Thursday and must be in July or must be in August. However, suppose you were to substitute the high-priority And (a space) with a low-priority And, as in the following formula: 

 tue,thu and jul,aug 

 The above formula indicates that scheduled days must be a Tuesday or must be a Thursday and must be in July or must be in August. In the first formula, the And operator is evaluated before the Or operators. In the second formula, the And operator is evaluated after the Or operators.

 Subscribe to my alarms 

 Receive the same alarms you receive. 

 Subscribe to my notifications 

 Receive notification when you receive items. 

 Modify options/rules/folders 

 Change the options in your Mailbox. The proxy can edit any of your Options settings, including the access given to other users. If the proxy also has Mail rights, he or she can create or modify rules and folders. 

 Archive items Store and read your items in his or her archive folder. If you give a proxy Archive rights, items archived by that proxy may be stored on his or her hard disk and will be inaccessible to you. 

 Read items marked “Private” 

 Read the items you marked Private. If you don&apos;t give a proxy Private rights, all items marked Private in your Mailbox are hidden from that proxy. 

 5. Select the rights you want to give to the user. 

 6. Repeat Steps 4-5 to assign rights to each user in the Access List. 

 You can select All User Access in the Access List and assign rights to all users in the Address Book. For example, if you want all users to have rights to read your mail, you would assign Read rights to All User Access. 

 7. To delete a user from the Access List, click the user&gt;Remove User. 

 8. Click OK. 

 Managing Someone Else&apos;s Mailbox or Calendar 

 Before you can act as a proxy for someone, that person must give you proxy rights in his or her Access List in Options. The amount of access you have depends on the rights you have been given. 

 1. If you haven’t already done so, add the username of the person to your Proxy List. 

 2. In the Main Window or Calendar, click to open the Proxy pop-up list. 

 3. Click the name of the person whose Mailbox you want to access. 

 4. When you have finished your work in the other person&apos;s Mailbox, click&gt;click your own name to return to your Mailbox. 

 You can work with several Mailboxes open at one time by opening a new Main Window for each Mailbox (click Window&gt;New Main Window&gt;switch to the Mailbox you want.) You can tell the Mailboxes apart by looking for the Mailbox owner&apos;s name, which appears as the root folder label for each Mailbox. 

 If you have the appropriate Proxy rights, you can view the schedules of multiple users or resources side-by-side. 

 Adding and Removing Users in Your Proxy List 

 Before you can act as a proxy for someone, that person must give you proxy rights in his or her Access List in Options, and you must add that person’s name to you Proxy List. The amount of access you have depends on the rights you have been given. 

 1. In the Main Window or Calendar, click . 

 2. Click Proxy. 

 3. To add a user, browse to the name in the Address Book&gt;double-click the name.
