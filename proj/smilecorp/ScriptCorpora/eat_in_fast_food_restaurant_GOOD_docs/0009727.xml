 Fast food with an Asian touch... 30 June, 2009 I chanced upon MX when I was looking for a place to eat inside New Town Plaza (Sha Tin), instead of dining at those familiar “tourist” restaurant/cafes, my friends and I decided to follow the residents and opt for Maxim’s MX.

This place is just like a fast food restaurant; the only different is they are serving Asian food. Being my 1st meal in Hong Kong, I ordered the 1st thing that caught my eyes from the menu board - 6寶飯 45HK$ it consist of roast duck, steamed chicken, char siew, cuttlefish, vegetable and salted duck egg. My rice comes with a glass of soft drink but I top up 10HK$ to change it into Ice Milk Tea with coffee jelly. Once you made the payment, you’ll be given a receipt, bring that receipt to the counter and collect your food, which was cook, and prepare on the spot.

My 6寶飯 is super yummylicious, a great mixed of the various kind meats and what stole the limelight was the salted duck. It’s so flavorful and of enough oil (if you know what I mean). It’s probably one of the best-salted eggs I’ve ever tasted. The ice milk tea is rich in taste and thick in texture, only one word can describe it – SHIOK!

I will definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Hong Kong, as MX is a place to experience what the locals are eating at more affordable rate. For those visiting Hong Kong, do look out for the big red sign – Maxim’s MX to wake your holiday tastebud up.

Do note: This is a typical fast food setting so no ambience and service rating given. Must tries: 6寶飯 I also recommend this place for:

 Type of Meal : Breakfast , Lunch , Dinner , Take Away Occasion : Children/Family Atmosphere : Vibrant/Noisy
