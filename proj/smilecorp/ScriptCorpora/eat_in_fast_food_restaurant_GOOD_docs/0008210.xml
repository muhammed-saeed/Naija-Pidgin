I’ve decided to put down my Beijing Summer Olympics protest sign (“Moo Goo Go Home!”) and embrace the games for the beneficial things they will provide—friendly international competition, jobs for race-walking announcers and technological advances for the good of humankind. That’s right–I’m talking about the slippery new material used to make the record-setting LZR Racer swimsuit that will be worn by America’s swimmers.

The LZR Racer was developed by NASA (Now Aiding Swimmers’ Aquadynamics), which hasn’t had a bankable scientific hit since Velcro, the ubiquitous product that has finally run its course—unless geneticists can figure out how to combine it with bananas to make a resealable peel.

According to NASA’s technical specifications, the LZR suit is designed to “reduce skin vibration and muscle oscillation.” I guess unnecessary skin vibrations and muscle oscillations can cause problems in outer space as well as in the swimming pool, not to mention the governor’s office.
 Slick means quick. 
The suit is marketed by Speedo (motto: “Large, hairy people shouldn’t be in the pool”), which claims it can knock 2 percent off of a swimmer’s race times. That’s a lot in a sport where the margin of victory can be a nanosecond, or about the time it takes for a video of Britney Spears’latest accident to be posted on YouTube.

The LZR suit retails for $550, or $225 per square inch. Luckily, it can be stretched to cover the parts of a swimmer’s body that, if exposed, would turn the backstroke into an X-rated activity, like beach volleyball. That price is sure to drop if American swimmers use them to win a Spitzload of medals.

Don’t get me wrong–I don’t want to actually wear an LZR Racer swimsuit. I’m perfectly happy wading in cutoffs and a T-shirt that says, “My other body is a Schwarzenegger.” I’m waiting for either NASA or Speedo or two guys in a Silicon Valley garage to turn this miracle material into miracle labor-saving products suitable for infomercials. I’m talking kitchen gloves that cut dishwashing time in half. Or hip waders that allow lousy fly fishermen to sneak up on unsuspecting trout and grab them with their bare hands. What kid wouldn’t want a Slip-N-Slide that lets them slide through the sound barrier?

I’m sure there are more products that can benefit from this new slick, water-resistant material (gravy-proof shirts?) but we’ll have to wait until it proves itself at the Olympics. I’m hoping all of the water sports athletes wear the LZR Racer swimsuit. Nothing will improve its popularity like reducing the length of synchronized swimming performances to under 10 seconds.

 I’m Bailing on‘Me.’Now It’s Federal Bailouts for‘Me Inc.’

Starting today, I am no longer me. From this day on, please address me as Me Inc. Before I get doused in paint by an irate PETA member, that’s pronounced“me-ink,”not“mink.”

I have a perfectly good and possibly brilliant reason for changing my name to Me Inc. The Federal Reserve (slogan:“All the Cash That’s Fit To Print”) has recently decided to protect the economy from the housing crisis by bailing out Bear Stearns (aka“Hannibal Lessor”) instead of rescuing homeowners in danger of being foreclosed, including the aforementioned corporation-formerly-known-as me.

As Me Inc., (listed on the New York Stock Exchange as NOTU), I no longer have to fear bill collectors, natural disasters, manmade catastrophes, bank runs, animal stampedes or acts of God (or your preferred deity). Minutes after any of these events might occur, the economy will be saved from the collapse of Me Inc., when Fed Chairman Ben“Cash or Check?”Bernanke
transfers funds to restore Me Inc., to its full me-ness.

Disaster recovery is not the only benefit of being Me Inc. My new shell company in the Bahamas, a telecommunications firm called Me Shell Ma Bell, Inc., will free Me Inc., from paying income taxes. My wholly owned subsidiary in Dubai, an energy company named Me Thane Gas, opens the door to huge no-bid government contracts. And just in case PETA is still mad about the name, Me Inc. will write off any remaining tax liabilities through a non-profit kitten placement service called Me Ow. Read more…

It was getting near closing time on open mike night at my favorite local comedy club–Laugh or Else–and I seemed to be the last comic-watcher standing or sitting. I handed a five to the waitress for one more virgin scotch-and-soda with a twist as the final wannabe comedian walked onstage. He was tall, thin and bearded, wearing a stovepipe hat and looking at notes scribbled on the back of an envelope. I grabbed the five back from the irritated waitress, checked the picture and rubbed my eyes in disbelief–I was about to witness the first performance of Abe Lincoln, Standup Comic:
 
Thank you for that warm welcome. I don’t usually get that kind of applause unless I say either“Your people are free!”or“Your drinks are free!”

It’s great to be here to celebrate President’s Day. Nobody was here on my birthday. You remember my birthday–February 12th? It got moved to Presidents Day with George Washington’s birthday because I could never generate enough mattress sales on my own. You wouldn’t know it by how much people pay–I mean“donate”–to sleep in my White House bed nowadays. Read more…

 ‘Hill’or‘Bama’? Take the Quiz!

With Super Tuesday fast approaching, many Democratic voters are still undecided about whether they are a Hillary Clinton supporter (a‘Hill’) or a Barack Obama supporter (a‘Bama’). What these confused individuals don’t realize is that their subconscious minds have already made the decision—It’s kind of like when you read the menu board at a fast-food restaurant even though you always order a cheeseburger. To help identify which candidate your subconscious mind has selected, take this simple test. If you are dissatisfied with the results, there’s still time for therapy, flipping a coin or writing in“Al Gore”:
 
If you yelled during the State of the Union address, you’re a Hill.
If you played a drinking game during the State of the Union address, you’re a Bama.

If you’re in your 20’s, you’re a Bama.
If you can’t remember your 20’s, you’re a Hill.

If you can find Kenya on your map, you’re a Bama.
If you can find Wellesley on your map, you’re a Hill.

If you read Harry Truman’s biography in hardcover, you’re a Hill.
If you read Harry Potter on a Kindle, you’re a Bama.

If you would never name your daughter“Hillary,”you’re a Bama.
If you would never name your daughter“Monica,”you’re a Hill.

If your racial status has a hyphen, you’re a Bama.
If your marital name has a hyphen, you’re a Hill.
