Pretty Good Fast Food
 
This place has only been open for about 2 months now and so far they are doing well. I visited after a recent story in the AZ Daily Sun covered how great it was. I was not disappointed. When I entered I was greeted by a guy behind the cashier, anxious to help me. He asked if it was my first time there, either I looked lost or they ask this of everyone. He was quick to assist me with reviewing their menu and was quickly able to answer my questions. Per his suggestion I tried the Shack Combo; it comes with 3 chicken strips, seasoned fries, a piece of garlic toast, and their special sauce. I also got an order of Hot chicken wings, since the gentleman stated that the Scorching sauce is pretty hot. I placed my order and waited about 10 minutes for my food, that’s fine with me because it was fresh and not sitting under a heat lamp :)

I got my order to go and when I arrived home I was surprised by the large portions! The chicken and fries were very fresh and still hot. The seasoned fries were very good and so was the batter on the chicken. The batter didn’t seem very greasy and the chicken was juicy. The sauce it came with was also flavorful. I was very impressed and think it’s a great alternative to the chain drive thru chicken places.

The only disappointment were the wings. They were your typical size and the sauce was pretty standard, it wasn’t very spicy, maybe I should have got the scorching sauce. It was also very runny and didn’t have much sauce on them. We debated the authenticity of the garlic bread and thought with all the local bakeries it is probably fresh, then on our way to the car we saw a Texas Toast box! LOL Just a slight disappointment, but otherwise it was great.

So great that I’ve already gone back in less than a week from my first visit!
