How to Avoid Processed Foods

 By Becki Andrus 
 
Anyone seeking to adopt a healthier lifestyle will have to change a few things such as the type of food that is consumed on a daily basis. There are a number of foods that are simply bad for a person&apos;s health. All the preservatives and loads of fat can wear away at one&apos;s health over time. Processed foods are not good for one&apos;s health. The ways in which these foods are made and preserved make them very unhealthy. Even foods that many people consider to be healthy are not because they have been processed. It is true that there are so many foods that are processed, but this does not mean that they can&apos;t be avoided. There are tips people can use to avoid consuming processed foods.

1. Eat Natural Foods - The best way to avoid consuming processed food is to only buy natural foods. Although many people may purchase canned fruits and vegetables because they may be cheaper or because they are quicker to prepare, these foods are highly processed. Canned fruit is usually surrounded by high fructose corn syrup and the canned vegetables are loaded with salt. It is better to go the produce section in a supermarket or even better, to a local farmer&apos;s market and buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Not only are they better for one&apos;s health, fresh produce tastes better too.

2. Avoid Refined Flour Products - Anyone that is trying to avoid processed foods should think twice before purchasing the white bread and certain types of pasta. Nearly all of the white breads are processed which eliminates the bran and fiber that is needed by the body for proper cleansing. When buying bread and pasta products it is best to stick to those products that are made from whole grain.

3. Buy Fresh Meats and Fish - Processed meats such as meat in cans, bacon and frozen fish are very often processed to ensure a longer shelf life. People that are trying to avoid processed foods should replace these foods with fresh meats and fish from the local market. Fresh meats and fresh are much healthier than the processed varieties. They do not contain all the harmful preservatives and ingredients that are used to extend the shelf life of processed foods.

4. Say Goodbye to Fast Food-McDonald, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s - Take your pick. Fast food eateries should be avoided at all costs. Yes, there are a number of &quot;healthy&quot; options on the menu, but even some of these contain processed foods. French fries, loaded burgers, cookies, apple pies, sundaes and sweet teas are the many processed food options that are offered at a fast food restaurant. There are very few healthy options available at these restaurants. Even the salads are topped with processed chicken and bacon pieces. It is best to avoid these places altogether when choosing to avoid processed foods.

Making the decision to live a healthier lifestyle is very important. Taking the steps to actually live healthy requires fortitude and effort. People that want to begin eating better have to eliminate processed foods from their diet.
