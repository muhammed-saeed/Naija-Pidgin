 Open Question: Is it weird to put ice in your cup of milk? 

A coworker of mine today put some ice cubes in her glass of milk. I told her I thought it was weird and that I didn&apos;t know anyone that did that. She says that people in her family do that and she thinks it is a Mexican thing. I told her I have some Mexican friends on my soccer team that I would ask about that later. Maybe it reminds her of icecream? I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m not sure how creamy the milk is.

 Open Question: THE ALTERNATIVE TO TAMPONS! (It&apos;s not pads!)? 

Before I start, this is a perfectly acceptable question, as I am searching for those same me.

Yes, today I&apos;m ditching chemical infested tampons for a fairly new AMAZING product, by the name of &quot;mooncupUK&quot;!

For those who don&apos;t know, the mooncup is one of many brands of menstrual cups. 
The aim of a menstrual cup is to catch the blood in a soft and flexible cup, the alternative to a tampon.

Here are some reasons why I adore my mooncup!:

Mooncups can be used by women of every ages: from when you just start your period, to later on once you have had kids.

There are 2 sizes: 
size A: for those over 30 and for those who have given birth. 
size B: for those below 30 and for those who have not given birth. 
(I&apos;m 15 and I adore my mooncup so far!)

In many ways, a mooncup is safer than a tampon, giving no risk of TSS, and containing no dioxins. 
They are environmentally friendly, and although they cost alot, they are re-usable for each period, and cost much less in the long run (having to buy more tampons or pads each period.)

It may look massive, but once folded correctly for insertion, it&apos;s about the size of a tampon applicator.

What I find very convinient and re-assuring is that the mooncup is placed VERY low down in the vagina, so you don&apos;t have to worry about it getting lost. I had to trim the stem quite a bit actually for it to be low enough!

It also has measurements on the side if the cup, so you can keep track of how much you have been bleeding. It also comes with a cute little bag!

every the information you need will be on their website:

www.mooncup.co.uk

There will be diagrams on how to fold it, insert it, take it out, ect. 
You also have the opportunity to ask the experts about anything you are concerned about.

I find that I have to change a mooncup much less than a tampon, and that it&apos;s good not to carry around every these tampons or pads around with me.

You may find this disgusting, but it&apos;s the future, and these are 100 times better than tampons.

If your a swimmer or a dancer ect, you could just wear one for those and then go back to pads after.

There are LOADS of good reviews on mooncup, and I strongly reccomend these to everybody, especially teens - periods are so much better with these!

WHO IS NOW INTRESTED IN ONE OF THESE? : ) or who owns one already ?

Ps, if you have any more questions about girl stuff or anything, feel free to email me at: adamsgeorgie@yahoo.co.uk. 
(don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m generally interested in helping other teens with new products or advice, and I won&apos;t ask for any personal info : ) )

 Open Question: Had my first ultrasound and the doctor told me my baby had no heartbeat and I was going to have a miscarriage.? 

From my last &quot;known&quot; period I should be 9 weeks and 5 days. My periods are really irregular though. So at my very first doctors appointment they didnt do a physical exam, make me pee in a cup or do any bloodwork. They did an ultrasound right off the bat and told me that I am measuring at 8 weeks and 2 days. He also told me he couldnt find a heartbeat and that I was going to have a miscarriage because there was no heartbeat and it was measuring at 8 weeks when i should be 9. I asked if there was a chance that maybe I was actually 8 weeks because my periods are weird so that would make ovulation weird and he said no that HE can look a heartbeat at 6 weeks. I have had no signs of miscarriage at every. No bleeding, no cramping, nothing. Is it possible that maybe it was too early to look my babies heartbeat? I am thinking about waiting 1 - 2 weeks and getting a second opinion or calling the doctors office back and telling them I want them to do bloodwork to be sure.

 Open Question: My dog licks her nose/sucks on her tongue often, and has an upset stomach; what should I do for her? 

Originally, I thought her sucking on her tongue was a puppy thing, like a toddler thumb-sucking, but she&apos;s persisted to do it every the way to now, coming on 3 years of age this year. She used to lick her genitals a lot when she was a puppy, but now licks her nose instead. Her nose often looks too wet, with droplets of clear liquid gathering. She really can&apos;t help herself, I&apos;ve held her mouth closed when trying to clip her facial fur, and feel her try with every her might to stick her tongue out to suck on it, and usually bites a notch in it doing so. I&apos;ve stuck a snug muzzle on, and she does the same thing, only she starts frantically clawing at the muzzle and cries loudly. Her tummy often growls, and I look her give a &quot;baby barf&quot;, looking like she pukes into her mouth and then swallows it. She&apos;s been doing this quite a while. Recently, her dry food brands were switched too quick, and the vet said she has gas, so I have to put her on a chicken broth diet for a few days.

It&apos;s a very irritating sound when she licks her nose repeatedly; her nose seems to be turning from black to a pinkish brown down the middle, where she licks it. Like I said, she also ends up biting a notch into her tongue as she tries licking her nose while barking or doing some other activity like running. I also started finding her licking the furniture... specifically the wooden table legs. She&apos;s a pound or two over weight (I brought her down from about four pounds over weight, she&apos;s only 13 inches tall), so I feed her two thirds a cup of kibble in the morning, and a fourth in the afternoon to control her weight better.

 Open Question: Will Chelsea even finish above ARSENAL...? 

...The PL is not a cup, where you can just defend your way through it... and wish to receive a bit of luck in a semi... (where the best player in the world misses a pen and countless other chances) then win the final on penalties..

No.. the PL doesn&apos;t work like that... you can&apos;t win on penalties...

I don&apos;t look how Chelsea will be THAT different from last season... just older..

She looked down at her fingers then up at her. ‚ÄúSorry-‚Äù
‚ÄúI should have set you two on flame when I had the chance!‚Äù
Catherine picked up her purse. ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù
Tiffany faked a gasp. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù
‚ÄúI am sorry that you got hurt, I set the trash on flame than I threw a cup of water on it. I just wanted Jean to look the flame from my home.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust so you could look wild in front of your friends. That is unhappy!‚Äù
‚ÄúGoodbye Tiffany. I mean Kendra.‚Äù

 Open Question: question about garage sale food? 

I was thinking about selling brownies individually wrapped in Saran wrap and chocolate chip cookies also wrapped at our garage sale, but my mom is convinced that they will go bad very quickly in the heat. It is supposed to be about 98 degrees tomorrow. Will they go bad? If so what are some ideas were I could keep them chilly but still visible? How much should I charge? I was also thinking of having ice water and maybe lemonade in pitchers and charge for a cup. Is this a good idea, or would I be better off just buying a bargain brand pack of pop or water (although I would only have 1 flavor of pop available) and putting them in a cooler? How much should I charge for either of these options? Is there anything else I should offer? Thanks :)

The Rangers, waiting, to hold Lord Stanley&apos;s Cup. The Devils don&apos;t want to play the Kings.

This is just my first draft so not only do I want you to give me ideas on what to change/add to what I already have, but also help me with the relax of the tune! THANKS!

Rules:
1) Has to follow the tune theme (Current NHL)
2)Has to follow the tune of Don&apos;t cease Believing

 Open Question: Weight Loss Tips That Work? 

Tips that work on losing weight.?
I&apos;ve been on a diet for a month now.I&apos;m currently 145 pounds. I started my diet, weighing 145 pounds.


Breakfast:
tiny bowl special k cereal, or a whole grain cereal, a splash of soymilk, a handful of strawberries.
One Yoplait.

Lunch:
Usually a fresh fruit smoothie, made with only water and fruit.

Snacks:
Apple.
Grapefruit.
Raspberries.

Dinner:
A spinach salad with the Wish Bone Salad Spritzer dressing, with onions on top.
Sometimes I&apos;ll have a Morning Star burger with mushrooms and onions, 
and sometimes I&apos;ll make Tofurkey wraps that have red bell peppers, onions, spinach, and limes on them. 

I work out an hour-two hours a day.
I follow either one or two &quot;weightloss&quot; videos and I use the Wii to track how long I run, usually 15-20 minutes, and do the hulu hoop session for ten minutes.

In this past month, I have seemed to receive even bigger, and not lost anything.
Is there anything I could do differently?

5+ bottles of water a day. 5+ cups of tea a day.

My daily diet is usually less than 800 calories. I can&apos;t really survive off of &quot;less food.&quot;

 Open Question: What is the average bra size for a 13 year-old girl? 

I am 13 years old and just went looking for my first bra. The lady working at the store gave me the smallest possible size, a 32 double A, but it was really too big. I was surprised because I am pretty tall. So I couldn&apos;t find a bra that wasn&apos;t too big, and I&apos;m 13 years old. I think that every girl in my class wears a bra, but I can&apos;t even find one that fits! I don&apos;t actually feel bad about this because I like being flat-chested, but out of curiosity what is the average cup size for a 13 year old girl?
Yeah the band fit alright (the 32 part), but every the cups were too big.

 Open Question: Lesbian selfish&quot;preference&quot;(about breast)? 

I don&apos;t care about boobs size - I never did. If I adore the girl, then that&apos;s enough. I have very tiny boobs (AA cup, maybe almost A cup) and I&apos;m ok with it. But, I don&apos;t know really why, I feel more comfortable with a bigger breasted girl. But I didn&apos;t want to be greedy - my boobs are tiny. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because the chemistry would be bigger? Can someone try to explain me?
The question isn&apos;t about my boobs
Yes, I&apos;m actually only attracted to femmes...

 Resolved Question: What are dinner ideas for a pescetarian? 

I&apos;m currently making a fish felet with fresh broccoli and a half cup of brown rice. 1.) is this a good meal for a peacetarian? 2.) what are some ideas for a dinner or luch that I could make for myself? Things you should probably know:
1.) my parents don&apos;t buy me any extra stuff for me
2.) I&apos;m 13
3.) my parents are on a primal diet which means they eat meat and only meat. Never beans. Never bread. Which makes this difficult for me. So something simple that I could find in my cabinets please!

 Open Question: Style for short girls? 

I&apos;m 17, 4&apos;11&quot; (almost 5 foot! So close!), I&apos;m really skinny (90 something pounds, but with B cup boobs) and I have great taste in clothes, that is, what looks good on other people-tall people. My style is defined as punk or rocker chic but what cuts of clothes can I wear? I know I can&apos;t wear high waisted shorts but I don&apos;t know what I can wear..

 Open Question: I need some medical help? 

I am 21 (22 in a few weeks) and a female. I have been getting my period every 3 months or so, I am nauseous every the time, I have been having stomach problems and pain in my abdomine. The last period I got (after 3 months of not having one) was extremely light, like literally only a few extremely tiny pink dots. I have been also getting a lot of gas if this means anything. I was wondering if there is something severly wrong here? My doctor doesn&apos;t do any tests besides make pee in a cup for a pregnancy test, which doesn&apos;t even make sense since I have never had sex. She says she thinks I have polycystic ovary syndrome, but she never checked, she just guessed and didn&apos;t refer me to gynocologist or anything like that. She&apos;s a new doctor for me so maybe she doesn&apos;t know me enough to care yet. I called a gynocologist today to make an appointment but they are booked until Mid September, I called other places and they said November! I have never been to gynocologist before so I guess new patients receive screwed. I posted a similar question like 5 or 6 months ago but got no serious responses. Are these symptoms of something specific? Should I be worried? Thank you.

 Open Question: Is butter actually bad for you? 

I always have i&apos;d say a light scraping of Clover Butter Lighter on my sandwich.

I have a pretty balanced and healthy diet for a 13 year old i&apos;d say.

I usually have: Breakfast: medium sized bowl of oatmeal

Lunch: sandwich, sometimes i have a banana sandwich, couple times a week, other times it&apos;s some lettuce and chicken or something. (with some butter)

Dinner: just anything really, whatever what&apos;s in the freezer or whatever my mum makes, usually pretty healthy but if not i&apos;ll have some salad with it.

Snacks: I usually only have fresh fruit or yogurt, sometimes i&apos;ll have a biscuit, like a couple digestives or a couple ginger nuts to go with a cup of tea, but not very often. 1-2 times a week.
probably doesn&apos;t make a difference but it&apos;s wholemeal bread I use

 Open Question: wrong cup size bra???? 

hi,
today i bought 4 bras because they were on sale. i bought 34a (im tiny :( ) because that&apos;s what i thought i was.
i got them home and tried them on and they are quite tight along the top bit of the bra. the cups sort of dig into my boobs and if i turn to the side you can look it digging in and it looks like &quot;overspill&quot;

would this be the wrong cup size? should i go up to a B?
the band is ok and so are the straps, its just the cup?

theres also no where in town i can receive measured professionally :/ ive tried doing it myself online but they every say different. sometimes im a 32a, sometimes a 34b...

 Open Question: Help getting pregnant? 

My partner and I plan to start trying to concieve next month. (we&apos;re same-sex partners) I was wondering if anyone had any tips? So far I am aware that I should be taking Prenatal and Multivitamins before I start trying to concieve and that a 5ml syringe is okay to use for insemination. I guess my question is after my donor ejaculates into a cup, and does it matter what nice of cup, how do I keep it room temperature and what steps should I take when going through the insemination process.

 Open Question: Does wearing a too big bra make your breasts looks smaller? 

I used to be a 36DD bra size. I recently lost weight and now I&apos;m a 34DD. I only have 36DD bras and I can&apos;t receive any new bras until the weekend. I wore my one bra today and my breasts look very tiny. The bra itself feels too big on my back and around my breasts. Could it just be that my breasts look tiny because they&apos;re not being supported properly? I understand that my breasts are smaller because a 34DD is equal to a 36D, which is one strap and cup size smaller than 36DD (a Victoria&apos;s Secret employee explained that to me), but they look extremely tiny to me and when I tried on the 34DD bra, they didn&apos;t look that tiny, so I feel they should be bigger. Thanks for any help!
