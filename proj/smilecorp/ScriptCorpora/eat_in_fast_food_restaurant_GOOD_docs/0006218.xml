 If i have a Sallie Mae student loan can i file bankruptcy and wipe it way?

It was a student loan for culinary school. Ive been jobless for more than 2 years now the initial amount for the loan was ,000 now it is ,000 because of interest and because i stopped paying it 2 years ago because i haven’t been willing and able to find a job . If i file bankruptcy may i be willing and able to get that loan off my back?? or may it still linger. I heard student loans are impossible to get rid of even if you file bankruptcy?
NOTE: THAT ,000 LOAN IS MY merely DEBT. I DONT HAVE ANYMORE DEBT.NO CREDIT CARD DEBT NO CAR NOTE NOTHING. how can i get this paid off asap or if i must file bankruptcy may it erase that debt???
Lauren, if i ask for deferment may that accrue interest??
