 Popular Chinese Food Terms 
Chinese food is very versatile. You can enjoy take out or delivery at home, or sit down for a buffet, family-style or dim sum meal. Recipes may be wok-fried, stewed, pot-roasted, smoked, steamed or braised. These terms are common to Chinese menus. Asian fusion – Asian fusion restaurants often cater to a more gourmet, metropolitan crowd and integrates Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Indian and Chinese elements. They may also serve Asian-infused Western recipes such as edamame bruschetta. Dim sum – Servers at dim sum restaurants will present carts of small plates, which you choose a la carte. You may recognize traditional fare such as teriyaki pot stickers, pork dumplings, fried wonton soup and egg rolls, and you’ll also encounter more exotic choices like lotus wraps and savory turnip cakes. Many take out and delivery restaurants feature dim sum. Hoisin sauce – Hoisin sauce has a spicy, piquant taste with heavy notes of soy and garlic. It may be used in Chinese barbecue, General Tsao&apos;s Chicken, and in beef dishes. Hunan cuisine – Hunan cuisine is chock-full of nutritional vegetables and fresh chili peppers. “Sweet and sour” and “hot and sour” combinations are frequent menu options. MSG – Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, has been used to intensify flavors in Chinese food since the 1950s. While this ingredient has been stigmatized because it gives some people migraines and other unpleasant symptoms, it can be used in place of fat and salt to enhance flavor. Oyster sauce – Oyster sauce is a thick brown condiment made with oysters, sugar and salt. It can top rice and noodle dishes or serve as the base for recipes. Szechuan cuisine – Szechuan dishes are heavy in garlic, chili bean paste, ginger, sesame and the signature Szechuan peppercorn. Kung Pao chicken is a popular Szechuan dish.

 Chinese cuisine has been popular in this country for nearly a century. And for good reason! Chinese food is delicious and often nutritional. It tastes wonderful, whether you&apos;re eating it in a restaurant, or as a take out or delivery option, and it&apos;s usually good for you too!

Most people have a Chinese - or Asian - recipe that they prefer more than any other. Some people, for instance, love traditional dishes, like dim sum. Or wonton soup. Or spicy egg rolls. Other people prefer to eat wok fried meats and vegetables. Chicken, pork, and beef all taste great when fried in a wok. Still other people prefer to eat simple rice dishes with teriyaki or soy sauce added to them for extra flavor. And some people - especially indecisive types - love Chinese restaurants for their plentiful buffets.

Many people also love Chinese food because many restaurants offer extensive menu options. Some restaurants even add take out and delivery options to their menus.

There are many reasons to love Chinese food. It&apos;s tasty, nutritious, and convenient. It&apos;s also often less intimidating to Western diners than Japanese and Thai cuisine, and that makes it great for slightly less adventurous eaters. Chinese food is versatile and inexpensive, and everyone ought to enjoy at least one Chinese recipe.

So, if you&apos;d like to eat at a Chinese restaurant, or if you&apos;d like to pick up an order or have an order delivered to your house, consider contacting your local Chinese restaurant today. Odds are, you&apos;ll be glad you did!
