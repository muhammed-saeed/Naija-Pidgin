 The Price Difference Between Healthy Food&amp;Fast Food 

If you check out the dollar menu at your favorite fast-food restaurant, the prices seem hard to beat–for about $3 you can get a double cheeseburger, a small order of fries and a dessert. You could easily spend three to four times as much for a nutritious meal at a sit-down restaurant. But with careful grocery shopping and a little time spent in the kitchen, you can eat healthy food on a strict budget.
