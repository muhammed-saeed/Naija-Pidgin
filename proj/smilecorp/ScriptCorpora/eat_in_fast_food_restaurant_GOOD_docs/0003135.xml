  Testimonials 1 
 
 &quot;I used to think that all 
 work at home opportunities 
 on the &apos;net were just scam 
 artists trying to steal my 
 money. With my last bit of 
 hope, I decided to try your 
 website and boy am I glad I 
 did! It took a couple days 
 to really get the hang of 
 everything, but now I&apos;m up 
 to $100 per day in 
 earnings... and climbing! I 
 just wanted to write and 
 thank you for providing such 
 a great resource for me to 
 actually earn a real income

  Testimonials 2 
 
 My girlfriends laughed at me 
 when I first told them that 
 I was going to get paid to 
 shop. I just received my 
 first cheque in the mail for 
 my very first shopping 
 assignment from 3 weeks ago, 
 can&apos;t wait to rub it in 
 their faces :).This is the 
 perfect job for me, it 
 allows me to make some extra 
 cash while still in school. 
 When I&apos;m finished school in 
 7 more months, I plan to do 
 this full time. Kevin from 
 support, thank you so much 
 for putting up with me the 
 first week and answering all 
 my dumb questions, thank you 
 for your patience with me.

 you mystery shop at a fast food 
 restaurant, after your lunch you head to 
 a department store like the GAP and 
 purchase a pair of jeans for yourself or 
 your kid, then head to Red Lobster later 
 on in the afternoon for your final 
 assignment where you fill your belly 
 with another meal. And you get paid by 
 each of the places not only for the 
 items you purchased but also for your 
 mystery shopping service (your 
 assignment reports relating your 
 shopping experiences). On average, a 
 good mystery shopper can realistically 
 make $800 - $1200 per month part time, 
 not to mention all the free merchandise
