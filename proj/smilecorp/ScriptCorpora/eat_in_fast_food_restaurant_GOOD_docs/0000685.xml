Negative Leadership Behavior
Introduction
There are two different approaches to leadership, negative and positive. A positive leader will concentrate on positive rewards for their team to work for the organization, while the negative leader concentrates on punishment (Clark, 2010). A positive leader will get their team to work with enthusiasm and interest, while a negative leader will get their to work through force and the constant threat of fear (Clark, 2010). This paper will outline a negative leadership experience, analyze the leaders’ behavior, show supportive research for the analysis, and show recommendations to change the leaders’ behavior.

The General Manager was very set in her ways, and took any approaches of change as a personal insult.

After doing the inventory with the General Manager two times, the author was instructed to do the inventory count by herself. To make it easier, the author decided to make a new inventory count sheet that had all items ordered in the way they were counted and entered.
