Fast food restaurant robbed in Hermitage
 Posted: Thursday, August 25, 2011 6:41 AM EST Updated: Thursday, September 22, 2011 8:06 AM EST Posted by Scott Sutton - email NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - 
Metro police are investigating an overnight armed robbery at a fast food restaurant in Hermitage.

Officers said two men rushed into the Jack in the Box on Lebanon Road around midnight just as employees were closing the dining area.

One of the robbers had a gun, forced the manager and an employee back to the office and made them get money from three different locations inside the store.

The robbers ran after employees gave up the cash.
