 Reviews for Asia Buffet: 28           AVERAGE OVERALL RATING Showing 1 - 10 of 28 Previous | 1 | 2 | 3 | Next Sort By: Most Recent Positive Negative Most Helpful           USER RATING By JoGo , 4/7/11 Any time Hubby and I have gone to the Krikorian Theatres at the BP mall, we have noticed the restaurant was packed, and there were always people waiting outside to get in. Then a friend at work had gone to eat here with her family and they really enjoyed it, and she said this place was always so busy, so&quot;It must be good.&quot;Well, after reading the recent reviews, 90% of which are very negative, I must say we were EXTREMELY leery, but we decided to take a chance. I figured we could go in, look at the food, and if we weren&apos;t impressed, then we could go across the street to Panda Express. At 5:30PM, it wasn&apos;t nearly as busy as I had expected, and there were booths available, so we decided to dine there, even though there were no crab legs to be found. 

The employees were courteous and most, but not all, spoke some English. The place was clean but very dimly lit. The bathroom was rather dirty - less clean than you might expect at even a fast food restaurant. Hubby said that the men&apos;s smelled like urine. I&apos;m glad to report that neither of us saw roaches or other vermin scurrying about.

We loaded up a plate a piece, and finally found the crab leg pan which had 2 left, so we took them. We took the crab to our table and returned to the line to find a fresh, hot new pan, so we got some fresh ones. We had fried rice (good), green beans (delicious!), beef and broccoli (not sure if THAT was beef - yuck!), mushrooms (yum), sweet and sour ????? (good), sesame balls (interesting/good), stuffed shrimp (hubby really liked them), crab salad(he liked that too), noodles (BLAND as plain water!). 

The most DISGUSTING THING was the plain cooked shrimp. They had a really soggy texture to them. I am always one to eat whatever I put on my plate (after all, there are children starving in 3rd world countries, right?) but these were just plain GROSS. I am not even ashamed to say I let them go to waste.

A first for me was the fried frog legs which to my surprise really did TASTE LIKE CHICKEN! Once I pulled off the tempura batter, there was a small morsel of meat on each leg. It was pretty good - I&apos;m really glad I tried it! The highlight of the night was the crab for Hubby - Although it wasn&apos;t spectacular, but it wasn&apos;t bad either. I would say if you LOVE crab, and you want to come dine on CRAB and other seafood only, it would be worth the $15. I myself would prefer Panda express, where I can get my Orange chicken, fried rice and egg rolls and I don&apos;t have to guess whether it&apos;s going to be any good - and that&apos;s at half the price.

Overall, Hubby and I are in consensus - we&apos;re glad we checked the place out, but unless I was taking my little brother (the CRAB freak) out for his birthday dinner, we would not be returning to the Asia Buffet.

BUENA PARK JUST CLOSED DOWN THIS PLACE FOR A WEEK BECAUSE THEY FOUND ALOT OF CACKROACHES IN ITS BUILDING......... BEWARE PEOPLE.... THIS IS THE REASON OF MY REVIEW, TO LET U GUYS KNOW.. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Leticia S , 11/6/10 My husband and I went there for dinner last night. After we finished our meal I went to the rest room and noticed that one of the servers used the rest room and did not wash her hands. I followed her out and observed her immediatly start to work. I reported it to the manager but he didn&apos;t even blink as I told him. I demanded that he do something so he went asked the server in question and she of course denied it. He told me that his employee stated she did wash her hands so there was nothing to be done. He refused to refund our dinner and told me to do whatever I wanted that it didn&apos;t matter to him and refused to give me his name. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Jen , 8/7/10 DISGUSTING!!! DO NOT BOTHER GOING HERE IT&apos;S DIRTY AND THE FOOD IS BAD!

My husband and I went here for lunch one day and we saw one of the servers massaging her FEET out in plain sight and then serve a food dish. I was so disgusted I refused to eat and told the manager. The manager did very little and still charged us for the little my husband had already eaten plus drinks!! I WILL NEVER GO BACK! Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 0 of 1 Yahoo! Users found this review helpful           USER RATING By TomM , 5/9/10 Today for mothers day, myself, my girlfriend and her familiy went to the Asian Buffet. Although the reviews that I read prior to going made me pretty nervous about even stepping inside the doorway. Upon our arrival, the line was short but the capacity of people was nearing its end. We were promptly seated with a welcome.

I&apos;ve been to quite a few chinese buffets, but this one was the best. The food was fresh, the veggies were not over cooked, and all the food had good taste and was hot. The workers were fast to place out new food, seldom did a tray of food go beyond a quarter full. The waitressess were expediant and friendly. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By Lynne , 1/24/10 I have been to this buffet twice with my husbands entire&quot;clan&quot;. We go back to this place because of the many food choices. Its a good place for a big family on a budget wanting a quick dinner/get together. The food is not that great. The crab is ok but I&apos;ve had better.The steamed fish is bland.Well , you can try everything and Im sure you wont be happy with the taste. And the service isnt good either. I guess that&apos;s how buffets are - cheaper price equals poor food and poor service. Otherwise pay up and have dinner at Orange Hill Restaurant. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 1/23/09 Well I tried it, didn&apos;t like it. I wont be going back. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By dana , 1/12/09 I just happened to be ath the Buena Park Mall fo some shopping, when i noticed the Asia Buffet. I went in to try it out. From the start it was a bad experience. The manager had a bad attitude and was short with me as I was being seated. I thought perhaps he was having a bad day, so I dismissed his rudeness. He sat me at a dirty table...it had food crumbs and sticky grease all over. He didnt seem to mind sitting me there. The food was below par and cold. It seemed the only flavoring they use is MSG. It gave me a headache from the food after the first plate. There were lots of disgusting choices. You can have your pick between two types of food Asia Buffet...you choose either cagooey or slimey. 
The only food they didn&apos;t destroy when&quot;cooking&quot;was the crab legs. Unfortunately for me, they place the crab legs in a half pan on the food line. Needless to say, you cannot fit much crab leg into a half pan...it went fast. They would refill the crab legs every 45mins to an hour. you would wait a long time for them to bring crab legs out. If you have patience and a lot of time...you may get a couple plates of crab. Couldn&apos;t find my waitress to get my drink refilled...dunno where she ran off to. It isn&apos;t like Hoemtown Buffet where you get your own drinks...at Asia Buffet they bring the drinks to you. So I had only one cup of soda with no refill. They seemed to be very generous with the food noone liked...the crab leg was nonexistant. 
The overall atmosphere was overshadowed by the employees leering glances and bitterness. The employees, especially the manager, gave off the impression they didn&apos;t want to be there or to be serving customers. Quite frankly, they should find a career that brings them joy, rather than to ruin peoples meals. Basically, they want you to come in, sit down, eat nothing, pay the rediculously large bill, leave a hefty tip, and leave!
