quick, casual lunches
 
if you’ve been to one portillo’s, you’ve been to them all. offering a more refined take on fast food, portillo’s offers hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, and sandwiches in a nice, but casual dining environment. i like coming here for quick lunches. be careful during rush hour times though, it can get pretty crowded, but the lines seem to move fast.
 
Dishes I tried:
 
Char-Broiled Chicken Sandwich
 
 5.0 star rating           
 
chicken wasn’t dry at all, but rather moist and tasty. maybe b/c i was hungry, but for a chicken sandwich, this was quite good.

Good All Beef Hot Dogs
 
This is a great quick stop, Your order is taken at your car door. The server will come to you. The hot dogs are huge with all the fixings of a Chicago dog. They have cheese fries and they are the best I&apos;ve tasted. They also serve burgers…

One of the Best
 
Portillos hot dogs are always really good but this location has probably the best service. In the drive-through, they walk around on foot and take your order and are quick to get your food. The service inside is just the same. The line…
