Brazil Fast Foods (BOBS) - Description of business
 
 
 Restaurant Operations 

     As of December 31, 2005, we had 451 points of sale, including 143 kiosks and trailers, of
which 65 are owned and operated by us and the remaining 386 by our franchisees, all under theBobstradename. Note that approximately 54.3% of these points of sale are located in the states
of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, with the remainder widely spread throughout major cities in other
parts of Brazil, except for one franchised restaurant in Portugal and one in Angola. The largest
number of franchise operations outside Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are in the states of Santa
Catarina and Paraná, both in the south of Brazil.

     All points of sale serve a uniform menu of hamburgers, chicken burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches,
french fries, soft drinks, juices, desserts, ice creams and milkshakes. Selected points of sale
also serve coffee and/or beer. We are particularly known for our milkshakes and the special spicing
of our hamburgers.

     Our fast-food service is based in a single line system distinguished from other competitors by
its variety and flexibility, which allow customers to add items to or exclude items from the
several meals they have to choose. We maintain a cooked-to-order philosophy: cooks would prepare
orders as read to them by the counter service representative who took the order.

     Our points of sale are generally open all year round, seven days a week. Our points of sale
generally open at 10:00 a.m. for lunch and remain open for dinner. Closing hours vary according to
location. In some locations with proximity to late night entertainment, the points of sale remain
open for theafter hourscrowd.

     Our prices are consistently positioned at the same levels as those for comparable products
offered by our major competitors. We attempt to maintain the overall cost of our meals at levels
competitive with prices offered by popular street snack bars known aslanchonetes.

     Almost all of our points of sale have now been renovated to update the decor, introduce our
new logo created in 2001, modernize the menu boards, expand the seating facilities, include
playground for children and provide air conditioning. All new franchisees open their restaurants
with this house style, which is also carried through in the uniforms worn by our personnel
(occasionally modified to feature hats and shirts used in promotions).

     For the past eleven years, we have been the exclusive provider of hamburgers and related items
at one of Brazils largest special eventsthe Rio de Janeiro Carnival, the one-week festive
period that precedes the advent of Lent. Likewise, our food products are sold at other special
events throughout Brazil, mainly intent on young crowds. In Rio de Janeiro, we participated in the
events sponsored by Coca-Cola and the mobile phone operator Claro, respectivelyVibezoneandClaro QéRock, as well as in the event sponsored by renowned Pontific Catholic University of Rio
de Janeiro and during the games of two major soccer clubs in the 2005 Brazilian Soccer
Championship. In São Paulo, we participated in the Winter Festival of Campos de Jordão and in the
event sponsored by the beer trademark Skol, theSkol Beat. We also participate in events through
our franchisees in the north and northeast of Brazil. Using custom constructed trailers and
moveable kiosks, we are able to offer most of our products at temporary locations for the duration
of each special event. Besides providing an additional revenue

source, our visibility is enhanced by signage that can be picked up via television coverage of
the special event and by reaching a consumer market where we may not have a permanent outlet.

     The following table presents the openings and closings of both our owned and operated
restaurants and our franchised restaurants for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:


                                                       Years Ended December 31,     2005   2004   2003     Stores   Kiosks   Stores   Kiosks   Stores   Kiosks Owned and operated restaurants (a):                                                 Opened during period     0       4       5       4 (b)     0       1   Closed during period     1       0       3       0       1       0   Sold to franchisees     0       0       4       2       4       0   Bought from franchisees     1       0       0       0       1       3   Open at end of period     49       16       49       12       51       10   Franchised restaurants (a):                                                 Opened during period     36       48       28 (c)     31       33       30   Closed during period     13       5       15       3       18       6   Sold to us by our franchisees     1       0       0       0       1       3   Open at end of period     259       127       237       84       224       56   Total stores&amp;kiosks at end of period:     308       143       286       96       275       66   


(a) Does not include trailers and kiosks used for temporary locations during 2005, 2004 and 2003. (b) In prior annual report, the total number of owned and operated kiosks opened during the
period ended December 31, 2004 was mistakenly overstated in two units. (c) In prior annual report, the total number of franchised restaurants opened during the period
ended December 31, 2004 was mistakenly overstated in four units.
     The average guest check per customer for both our owned and operated points of sale and
franchise for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 was R$7.93, R$7.57, and R$6.70,
respectively.

     We strive to maintain quality and uniformity throughout both our owned and operated and our
franchised points of sale by publishing detailed specifications for food products, food
preparation, and service, by continuous in-service training of employees and by field visits from
our supervisors. The store manager, who visually inspects the products as they are being prepared
for cooking, undertakes quality control at each point of sale. The store manager also keeps a
record of the expiration date of the products in inventory. In the case of our franchisees, a
marketing manager in each of our six primary geographic regions periodically reviews their
operations and makes recommendations to assist in the franchiseescompliance with our
specifications.

     Our quality control inspectors are also sent periodically to each restaurant, whether owned by
us or by one of our franchisees, to conduct a review of the food stock. These inspectors also take
samples of the water used at each restaurant in the preparation of food and drinks as well as
random samples of one food item, which are taken to a contract laboratory for a microbiological
analysis.

 Growth Strategy 

     Bobs is the second largest fast food hamburger restaurant chain in Brazil. Our primary goal
is to continue to increase our network of points of sale in Brazil, where we believe fast food is a
developing market, and to gain market share by entering city markets where we are
under-represented.

     Brazil has an estimated population of 184.2 million, a third of Latin America and Caribbean
total population. Sao Paulo, Brazils largest city has 10.9 million residents. The city of Sao
Paulo is located within the state of Sao Paulo, which has a population of 40.4 million. Rio de
Janeiro, Brazils second largest city, has 6.1 million residents and is located within the state of
Rio de Janeiro, which has a population of 15.4 million. Fourteen metropolitan areas in Brazil,
including those of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, have populations in excess of one million.
According to the IBGEBrazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, in 2004 the average
monthly income of the Brazilian working population was as follows:


   27.60% received up to the minimum wage (R$300.00); and,


   0.90% received above 20 times the minimum wage (R$6,000.00)

     We are focusing our growth efforts upon the development of new franchises, in the proportion
of 40 stores to 60 kiosks. Our target is to achieve 580 operating points of sale in 2006, occupying
growth potential locations to avoid the entrance of competitors and increasing the number of
outlets in major cities of Brazil, like São Paulo (SP), Salvador (BA), Porto Alegre (RS) and
Brasília (Brazils Federal District), as well as in cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants, and
depending on the average income, in cities with between 150,000 and 300,000 inhabitants.

     We are also focusing our growth efforts on the increase in profitability of existing points of
sales. One of the objectives is to increase sales per square meter through the study of production
process and service attendance improvements, as well as personnel training.

     In 2006, we intend to make capital expenditures of R$4,500,000 to conclude projects initiated
in 2005, upgrade both the technology system and the computer base at our own-operated stores,
purchase new equipment, introduce Coffee Station on existing stores and open new kiosks.
Furthermore, we intend to increase our marketing effort on children, as well as continue a
motivational program to improve service throughout our restaurant chain.

 Franchise Program 

     In 2005, for the eighth year in a row, Bobs received the Quality Seal of the Brazilian
Franchise Association (ABF). This quality seal is granted after a consultation with the franchisees
of pre-qualified franchisors about marketing performance, business support and training offered by
the franchisor. Franchisors only pre-qualify when fulfilling all necessary requirements of the
franchising industry.

     Our franchise agreements generally require the franchisee of a traditional Bobs restaurant to
pay us an initial fee of R$90,000, which is lower for kiosks and small stores, and additional fees
equal to 5% of the franchisees gross sales. Franchisees pay also 4% of monthly gross sales in
cooperative advertising fees. Our typical franchise agreement also provides that the franchisee has
the right to use the Bobs trademark and formulas in a specific location or area, must use our
approved supplies and suppliers and must build each franchised outlet in accordance with our
specifications at approved locations. The term of the majority of our franchise agreements is 10
years, with a few agreements having 5-year terms. Our existing franchise agreements have an average
remaining duration of approximately ten years. Historically, upon expiration a franchise agreement
is renewed without the interruption of the franchisees business. We generally have no financing
obligations with respect to these franchise agreements.

     At present, approximately 9 months elapse between our initial contact with a prospective
franchisee and the opening of a franchised point of sale. After the initial meeting, and if the
potential franchisee meets certain basic conditions, such as significant business experience,
financial resources and
knowledge of the market in the area where the franchise will be located, a preliminary
franchise

agreement is signed, which, among other matters, requires the prospective franchisee to
pay us a non-refundable sum equal to 50% of the initial franchising fee. Following mutual agreement
as to the site of a new restaurant, a definitive franchise agreement is signed, outlining the
obligations and responsibilities of each party, including the franchising fees and promotion
commissions to be paid to us. The franchisee then begins a four-month training program.
Construction of the restaurant typically begins at the beginning of the training program and is
generally completed within three to six months. The franchising fee is sufficient to cover all
training expenses we incur.

     Under Brazilian law, we cannot dictate the price at which our franchisees sell their products,
although the prices charged by our franchisees generally mirror the prices charged by our owned and
operated points of sale.

     Individuals wishing to own and operate a Bobs franchise are required to submit an application
to a steering committee formed by our top management, which reviews all applications and determines
which should be accepted. As part of our growth strategy, we have begun to participate in regional
business presentations and organize road shows in order to captivate new franchisees candidates in
targeted cities in Brazil.

     We encourage mature and profitable franchisees to increase the number of stores they operate.
As a consequence of this strategy, the number of stores per group of franchisees (which includes
franchised restaurants in the name of partners and family relatives) increased from 1.77 in 1999 to
3.30 in 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had 158 franchisees that collectively operated 386 points of
sale.

     We are also focusing on developing special agreements with gasoline retailers to house Bobs
points of sale in retail gasoline stations. We contemplate that some of these new restaurant/gas
stations, orjoint sites,although housed at gas stations, will be built, owned and operated by
our present and future franchisees rather than by the gasoline retailer. We will then share a
portion of the royalties attributable to those joint sites with the respective gasoline retailers.

     We are currently testing several joint sites with gasoline retailers, including Shell, Forza,
Ale, and Petrobras, the largest one in Brazil with approximately 7,000 locations. Our agreements
with each of these gasoline retailers do not establish a number of joint sites to be opened. These
agreements, like our standard franchise agreements, only set forth conditions to establish a joint
site and do not limit the number of joint sites that may be opened under the agreement. To date,
there are nine joint sites operating in Petrobras gas stations. Shell has five joint sites in
operation and we are negotiating an agreement with them to house a specific number of other joint
sites in certain approved locations. Forza, a gasoline retailer that also offers natural gas, a
fuel commonly used by taxi-drivers, now has twenty-one Bobs sites in operation. Besides, other
four join sites operate in Ale, Esso, Texaco and Repsol.

     In November 2005, we opened our first franchise point of sale in Luanda, capital of Angola,
one of the largest countries in Africa with approximately 11 million people. As of today, we have
two points of sale operating abroad. Although we ceased a master franchise agreement to open
franchised points of sale in Portugal in 2004, there is still one point of sale operating in this
country; nevertheless, we are currently reevaluating its operation.

     We generally retain a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale of a
franchisees interest.

 Advertising and Promotions 

     We aim to increase fidelity among our target-market, formed by young consumers from 13 to 25
years old, and attract consumers not familiarized with our products. For this reason, we intend to
identify our fast-food hamburger restaurant chain with a place to go with the family and to meet
friends. In 2005, we focused on reinforcing our primary products in order to boost sales and
achieve these objectives.

     To invigorate our image, we changed our advertising agency to NBS, a dynamic agency that
formulate marketing campaigns for other companies focused on communicating to young consumers. We,
through our advertising agency, develop a multi-media marketing program to advertise our restaurant
network in its primary markets. We usually employ television, radio, outdoors, and a variety of
promotional campaigns to advertise our products; and we develop 15 and 30-second television
commercials, which, typically, are aired one to six times a day for a 15-day period.

     The first marketing campaign launched in 2005, by the end of February, was calledMilkshake
Carente(Needing Milkshake). Its goal was to increase sandwich sales by associating it to our
blockbuster, the milkshake. The promo focused on the loneliness of the milkshake without a sandwich
companion and offered 50% off the price of three selected sandwiches to those who bought the medium
size milkshake.

     In July, we launched a marketing campaign calledBig Bob Forever, consisting in advertising
our leading sandwich, theBig Bob. The promo offered free french fries to those who bought the
sandwich with a soft drink and a prize to the best photo taken with the display made specially for
the campaign and the best devotion sentence to theBig Bob.

     To compete with McDonalds and Burger King, we have also launched a big size new sandwich, theDouble Grill Bacon, a sandwich with two hamburgers of 120g and a slice of bacon. In addition, we
have also launched a huge promotion (using sampling, outdoors, busdoors and bikedoors) of our
delivery service in the state of Rio de Janeiro, theBobs Fone.

     We also offer a kids meal, a three food items with a packaged toy, called theTriKids. In
2005, we launched three different packaged toys to accompany the kidsmeal. TheSecret Kitand
the miniatures of the six personages of the cartoon Kids Next DoorKND and theSqueeze Doo, a
plastic bottle colorfully decorated with Scooby-Doo cartoon personages. Certain of our points of
sale offer special services for childrens birthday parties and also feature appearances byBobi,
Biba, and Bonga, our mascots. Visual tools, such as banners, posters and place mats, reinforce all
these programs.

     In December, when increased masses occupy shopping malls and the streets due to the holidays
season, we launched a promo offering 50% off the price of theDouble Cheeseburgersandwich to
those who bought the medium size milkshake.

     We keep franchisees informed of current advertising techniques and effective promotions and
make our advertising materials available to our franchisees. Our franchisees are required,
generally, to pay us 4% of their monthly gross receipts for advertising and promotions. Individual
stores also develop promotional programs to attract additional clientele or to assist in the
implementation of expanded business hours. Each outlet pays for these promotions. We commit 4% of
our system-wide gross sales to marketing activities.

 Sources of Supply 

     We and our franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment,
fixtures, or other products which are necessary to restaurant operations. We anticipate no such
shortages of products and, in any event, believe that alternate suppliers are available.

     We purchase food products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers. In selecting and
periodically adjusting the mix of our suppliers, we assess and continuously monitor the efficiency
of their regional and national distribution capabilities. To take advantage of volume discounts, we
have entered into centralized purchasing agreements. Food products are ordered by, and delivered
directly to each point of sale. Billing and payment for our company owned and operated points of
sale are handled through the centralized office, while franchisees handle their own invoices
directly. Packaging and durable goods are delivered to Fast Food Distributor Ltda.FBD, a
centralized warehouse operated by a non-affiliated person. This centralized purchasing helps assure
availability of products and provides quantity discounts, quality control and efficient
distribution.

     In June 2005, we renegotiated our contract with FBD to include transportation and delivery of
supplies to each point of sale, and extended it, which otherwise would expire in December 2005, for
five more years. The new terms represent substantial cost reductions and will impact positively on
the operational margins of our fast-food restaurant chain. Due to that, Suprilog, a limited
liability company established by Venbo Comércio de Alimentos Ltda., BFFC wholly-owned subsidiary,
with the objective to carry out the transportation service left by TGB in 2004 due to financial
difficulties, ceased its operations in November 2005.

     We participate in long-term exclusivity agreements with Coca-Cola, for its soft-drink
products, Ambev, the biggest Brazilian brewery company, Farm Frites, the Argentinean producer of
french fries, and Sadia, one of the biggest meat processors in Brazil, as well as with Novartis
Nutricion for its Ovomaltine chocolate. These agreements are extensive to four to five years. The
Coca-Cola agreement was amended in 2000 to extend the exclusivity period to 2008.

 Trademarks 

     We believe that our trademarks and service marks, all of which are owned by us, are important
to our business.

     Our trademarks and service marks have been registered in the Brazilian trademark office. These
trademarks and service marks expire at various times, when they are routinely renewed. The
following table sets forth our significant trademarks and service marks that are registered in the
Brazilian trademark office:


       Trademark or Service Mark   Expiration Date       Bobs Double Cheeseburger   October 24th, 2010 Big Bob   January 5th, 2012 Bobs   June 5th, 2012 Franfilé   March 24th, 2013 


     Currently we are reevaluating our trademarks referring to kids meal and related services, such
as birthday parties for children.

     We have registered our trademarkBobsin Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, the three
countries members of the MercosurSouth America Commercial Agreement, in which Brazil takes part.
We have also registeredBobs Burgerstrademark and logo in Paraguay and Uruguay, and we believe
we will in the near future register both in Argentina. We have also registered our trademarkBobsin Portugal, Germany, France, Italy and Benelux (an economic union of Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Luxembourg), as well as in Angola, where we opened a franchise store at the end of
2005. As of today, we are initiating the process of registering our trademarks in the United Sates
of America, Mexico and Chile.

 Competition 

     In terms of number of points of sale, we are the second largest food service organization in
Brazil. Each of our restaurants is in competition with other food service operations within the
same geographical area. We compete with other organizations primarily through the quality, variety,
and value perception of food products offered. The number and location of units, quality and speed
of service, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of marketing are also important
factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market depending on
competitive pricing and the local cost structure.

     Additionally, each of our restaurants is in competition with informal food service. Fast-food
restaurants have to focus on a limited number of options, sometimes even on just one type of
product, in order to achieve the efficiency required in the competitive food service industry.
Brazil is a vast country with an extensive regional cuisine, where a typical meal from one region
can be found exotic in another, making more challenging the act of convincing the general public of
a cross-country homogeneous menu. Because of that, made to order improvisations, prepared at the
street by informal and moveable vendors nearby bus stations and subways, can be more appealing to
the general public, since it mirrors people preferences, is convenient and overcomes income
barriers more easily.

     Moreover, each of our restaurants is in competition for consumers pocket with other services
and consumer goods, such as: mobiles, cable TV, broad band Internet, retail stores financing and
credit cards payments.

     Statistical data drawn from the 2005 annual report elaborated by ABIABrazilian Food
Industry Association indicate that our share of the fast-food market approximated 7.5% and 6.6%
during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The food service industry total
revenue increased 12.5% per annum from 1995 to 2005. In 2005, its total revenue was of R$38.2
billion. The fast food represents around 12.0% of the total food service industry, which includes
restaurants, bars, snack bars, bakeries, industrial food service, hotels and catering, among
others.

     As of December 31, 2005, McDonalds had approximately 1,197 points of sale in Brazil,
including 655 kiosks and 48 coffee stations. From the total, 140 stores were operated by 86
franchisees. Habibs, a Brazilian fast-food chain that offers Arabic food products at low price,
had approximately 260 points of sale. Giraffas, a fast-food chain that offers Brazilian popular
dishes as rice and beans and feijoada, black beans prepared with meat, had approximately 180 points
of sale. Subway, an American fast-food chain that offers made-to-order cold sandwiches, had
approximately 42 points of sale. Burger King, a new entrant in Brazils fast-food industry, opened,
in just one year, 9 stores in São Paulo and 3 other stores, respectively in Brasília, Salvador and
Belo Horizonte.

     Our competitive position is enhanced by our use of fresh ground beef and special flavorings,
made-to-order operations, comparatively diverse menu, use of promotional products, wide choice of
condiments, atmosphere and decor of our points of sale and our relatively long history in Brazil.
We

believe that the use of moveable trailers and kiosks, which are not utilized by our
competitors, affords us an advantage over our competitors. We also believe that, as a
Brazilian-based company, we have the advantage over our non-Brazilian competitors of being able to
readily understand and respond to local consumer preferences.

 Personnel 

     As of December 31, 2005, we, including our franchisees, employed 8,000 persons, of whom 1,629
were employed in our owned and operated restaurants. The total number of full-time employees as of
December 31, 2005 was 1,761 of which 190 were temporary personnel.

     Our employee relations historically have been satisfactory. We are not a party to any
collective bargaining agreements. However, we have agreed to be bound by the terms, as they may be
applicable to our employees, of agreements negotiated on a city-by-city basis by trade associations
of hotel, restaurant and fast food owners and operators, of which we are a member.

 (d) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

 Not applicable. 

     Note: we opened our first franchise point of sale in Luanda, capital of Angola in November,
19th 2005; although we have been receiving royalties attributable to this operation since then, the
total amount received is not relevant to our operations.

Annual Report will in fact transpire or prove to be accurate. Investors are cautioned that such
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including without limitation the
following:

 Risks Relating to Operations 


   We have a history of significant net losses, and we may not
be profitable in the future; we may need to seek the
forbearance of creditors in the future.

     Although we have reached a positive result in 2005 and 2004, we incurred in net losses of
R$4,118,000 and R$11,210,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our
accumulated deficit at December 31, 2005 was R$58,687,000 and our working capital deficit at such
date was R$4,371,000. The year 2005 presented a positive macroeconomic scenario that, together with
strong measures implemented by the Company in its operation and administration, has helped it turns
itself profitable. Yet, we cannot say that the negative tendency is wholly reversed. Some of our
own stores are still non-profitable and our small operation margins are constantly been affected by
market factors concerning raw material, wages and location costs.


   Our registered public accounting firms report raises uncertainties about our ability to
continue as a going concern.

     The report of BDO, the registered public accounting firm of our consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and those of Grant Thornton Auditores
Independentes, the independent auditor of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, recite that our recurrent losses from operations and negative
working capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans
to continue as a going concern, discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, focus on efforts to
increase our cash flow. At this time, we cannot state with any degree of certainty whether such
increase will be possible and, if possible, sufficient to pay our debt obligations or operating
expenses.


   Our success depends on our ability to compete with our major competitors in the fast food
industry.

     The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to compete with other restaurants
and fast food chains. To compete, we may be required to spend significant funds on marketing and
promotions and on developing and offering new products, while maintaining the prices we charge our
customers. Many of our competitors have vastly greater over-all financial and other resources
available to them than we do. For this reason, we may not have the resources necessary to compete
effectively, which may cause consumers to prefer the products of our competitors. As a result, we
could experience a decrease in revenues, which would have an adverse impact on our business and
operations.


   A new challenge: the light food.

     The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to respond promptly to changing
consumer preferences. The demand for low fat and less caloric food has increased significantly in
the last few years. In addition, Government is constantly imposing new disclosure rules on the
nutrition content of food products on sale. To respond in accordance, we may be required to spend
significant funds on research and development of new products, new food preparation methods and new
appliances, as well as

on preparing and printing disclosure materials to be exposed in stores and on food packages.
We may not have the resources necessary to compete effectively, which may cause consumers to prefer
the products of our competitors. As a result, we could experience a decrease in revenues, which
would have an adverse impact on our business and operations.


   Our future success is dependent upon the success and expansion of our franchise program.

     A portion of our revenues is attributable to the fees we collect from our franchisees. To
improve our revenues in the future, we have developed a growth strategy that includes increasing
our number of franchised points of sale. This growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our
ability to attract, retain and contract with qualified franchisees and the ability of these
franchisees to open and operate their Bobs points of sale successfully. In addition, our continued
growth will depend in part on the ability of our existing and future franchisees to obtain
sufficient financing or investment capital to meet their market development obligations. If we
experience difficulty in contracting with qualified franchisees, if franchisees are unable to meet
their development obligations or if franchisees are unable to operate their points of sale
profitably, the amount of franchise fees paid to us by our franchisees would decrease and our
future operating results could be adversely affected.


   We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements applicable to the food service
industry.

     Both our franchisees and we are subject to regulatory provisions relating to the wholesomeness
of food, sanitation, health, safety, fire, land use and environmental standards. Suspension of
certain licenses or approvals due to our or our franchisees failure to comply with applicable
regulations could interrupt the operations of the affected restaurant and inhibit our or their
ability to sell products. Both our franchisees and we are also subject to Brazilian federal labor
codes, which establish minimum wages and regulate overtime and working conditions. Changes in such
codes could result in increased labor costs that could cause a reduction in our operating income.
We are also subject to Brazilian federal franchising laws applicable to franchise relationships and
operations. Changes in these or any other regulations may contain requirements that impose
increased burdens on our business, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to deal successfully with any potential new or amended regulations.

 Risks Relating to Brazil 


   Our operations are subject to changes in Brazils economy.

     Our business is very sensitive to the economic activity, and is highly affected by consumersconfidence, population average income and employment.

     In Brazil, these three factors have been limited by an economic growth that has averaged 2.0%
p.a. in the last eight years, what is a mediocre rate in comparison to other developing countries.
To blame there are Brazils tax burden, which accounts for an estimated 38% of GDP, and real
interest rate, which, at around 11% p.a., is among the highest in the world. In addition, Brazilian
economic activity has been highly volatile: short periods of expansion alternating with
contraction. Even though, monetary policy has been consistent for all these years, inflation rates
have exceeded the inflation target fixed by the National Monetary Counsel.

     Tax burden and interest rates pressure our business by depressing our margins and increasing
our cost of capital. Also, inflation pressure our business because, although inflation is often
reflected on food products and packing material we purchase, as well as, on utility service and
occupancy expenses we incur, to pass on higher costs is not always possible due to Brazilian low
consumerspurchase power.

Besides, higher inflation can pressure labor costs and increase unemployment, which has
an adverse effect on our business, since it spurs informal business, such as moveable food vendors
at the street.


   Our business may be affected by political and constitutional uncertainty in Brazil.

     High levels of uncertainty have marked the Brazilian political environment since the country
returned to civilian rule in 1985 after 20 years of military government. Brazils democracy
structure still lacks of solid political institutions, committed political parties and fair
judicial system.


   Controls on foreign investments may limit our ability to receive capital from our Brazilian
operating subsidiary

     Brazil generally requires the registration of foreign capital invested in Brazilian markets or
businesses. Thereafter, any repatriation of the foreign capital, or income earned on the foreign
capital investment, must be approved by the Brazilian government. Although approvals on
repatriation are usually granted and we know of no current restrictions on foreign capital
remittances, there can be no assurance that in the future approvals on repatriation will be granted
or restrictions or adverse policies will not be imposed. If the Brazilian government delays or
refuses to grant approval for the repatriation of funds or imposes restrictions on the remittance
of foreign capital, the ability of our Brazilian operating subsidiary, Venbo Comercio de Alimentos
Ltda., to transfer cash from our operations out of Brazil may be limited.

 Risks related to our common stock and shareholders agreement 


   Common stock.

     Our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market on March 11, 2002. As a result,
our common stock is now quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may reduce the already thin trading
market of our common stock. In addition, the delisting from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market may
significantly impair our ability to raise additional funds to operate our business.


   Shareholders agreement.

     On August 11, 1997, we entered into a stockholdersagreement with AIG Latin America Equity
Partners, Ltd., referred to herein asAIGLAEP, and our then-current executive officers and
directors and certain of their affiliates. The stockholdersagreement provided that if w ©2007 - 2012 HotStocked.com - All rights reserved.
