assistance programs - heating costs, phone bill, food, etc.
 I thought I&apos;d start this thread, in light of all the grim economic news. If anyone has info on additional programs, please share! Thanks.

LIHEAP - credit towards your heating costs
An insert in my electric&amp;gas bill said that income limits have been raised, I don&apos;t know if this happened in all states.

Lifeline / Linked In - credit towards your phone bill

Helped us find food banks, pay electric bills and utility bills and also paid some of our rent when we were down on our luck. You have to wait on hold for a while, but they are really an awesome group. They can also help with free dr. visits and pregnancy problems or birth control.

I just got home from the eye doctor, they did cover the cost of my eye exam and I am happy. Didn&apos;t cover glasses, but that&apos;s ok, I saved a bit and I really needed an eye exam and I qualified. Reply With Quote 04-27-2009,  02:05 AM #8 HUERTA53

 Registered User Join Date May 2008 Location PA Posts 365 Does anyone know of any programs for low income dental help? I don&apos;t qualify for assistance because I&apos;m alittle above poverty level but I desperately need to have some work done because of bad infection in my mouth that is affecting my health. I can not afford to get it taken care of and medical insurance I have (Medicare plan Today&apos;s Option due to disability) won&apos;t cover it because it is considered dental work. Anyone know of anywhere that might be able to help? I live in PA. Not sure if they have any available programs or not. Thank you in advance. Reply With Quote 04-30-2009,  05:51 PM #10 katland

 Registered User Join Date Oct 2006 Posts 16,913 I posted some info here on dental programs that may help you
 http://www.freesamplesite.com/ydf/sh...ghlight=dental 

You can double-check whether you qualify for assistance here http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/ServicesP.../003671559.htm 

Also, check any dental schools you live near, they usually offer low-cost or sliding-fee services
Univ of Penn (they have a clinic as well as a community outreach program) http://www.dental.upenn.edu/patients/index.html 
Temple U dentistry links page, not sure if they have a clinic http://www.temple.edu/dentistry/links.htm 
Univ of Pittsburgh (school-based clinic) http://www.dental.pitt.edu/patients/index.php 

Depending on where you live, you might be near one in a neighboring state, check the American Dental Asso&apos;s website listing of dental schools http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/programs/..._ddsdmd_us.asp 

If none of that helps, try googling low-cost dental care in PA, something like that.

HTH

Edited to add: also call your local hospital(s), especially ones in an urban or low-income area. The ADA&apos;s site shows only 1 dental school in NJ, but I know of 2 large hospitals that also have dental clinics. Last edited by katland; 04-30-2009 at 05:53 PM . Reply With Quote
