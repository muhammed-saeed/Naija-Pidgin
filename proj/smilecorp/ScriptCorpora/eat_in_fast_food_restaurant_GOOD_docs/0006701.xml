Take me away to a heavenly place only Scoop knows! Holy Strawberry Balsamic. Mmmmmm, I&apos;m so wanting some right now and I cannot because I live in California and was only able to taste the sweet, creamy confections from Scoop once during my visit recently. Which! Is totally ok, because I am now motivated to make my own delicious ice cream and get it down close to what I had here. When you start making your own desserts, you know something had to be that good.

I think having this cart right near the entrance of the food carts serves it good. I knew right away after seeing the chalkboard menu, which ice cream I was going to have after I ate from a nearby cart.

Had a scoop with a sugar cone and devoured it with pure joy. Did I mention that was my second day in a row having ice cream?

The first time I had Scoop was at this year&apos;s Eat Mobile.  And boy, was I impressed!  Move on over Fifty Licks, Scoop is going to give you a run for your money!!!  Oops, did I say that out loud??  They were serving samples (good sized ones, I might add) of strawberry balsamic and salted caramel.  Oh man, pure blissful indulgence.  I think I had four samples.  Oops, did I say that out loud again?

Anyways, today I stopped by the N. Station food pod to try a new flavor.  One of their late summer seasonal flavor is cherry amaretto and it turned out to be an excellent choice.  It had a great cherry amaretto flavor with chunks of real, fresh cherries and chopped almonds.  I also took home a pint of salted caramel.   A scoop of ice cream is $3 and it&apos;s well worth your money considering it&apos;s ice cream from a food cart.  The ice cream is homemade with a wonderful creamy texture and chock full of natural ingredients.  Plus,  I love how their advertising/design is straightforward, authentic, and simple without trying to be overly chic or yuppie-ish.  They also serve delicious sounding sorbets for vegans like basil pineapple and marionberry dark chocolate.

I&apos;m already looking forward to my next flavor; triple threat ginger.  It has my name all over it!!

Salted caramel, hot fudge, whipped cream - What can I say? I&apos;m a glutton for dessert!

We were actually looking for a gelato place but I did not come away disappointed from this cart. We went to the pod on 50th and Division and got our fix.

That&apos;s the scoop!

This place is kinda tucked away, but as soon as you see it you should get there as fast as possible because the ice cream is creamy, unique, and oh so good! I got two HUGE scoops of ice cream (the &quot;small&quot; size!) for just $4! I tried wine-scented apricot and blueberry cinnamon, and they were both packed with flavor and sweet enough to satisfy (this isn&apos;t one of those places where the ice cream is sickeningly sweet-- you feel great after eating it!) My dad got bourbon pecan, which was SO good and had buttery chunks of pecan in it. Yum!

The girl who served us seemed a tad distant, but she was still friendly and offered to let me sample the apricot one because I was afraid the wine would be too strong (it was a perfect balance, which was a pleasant surprise). This is a great place to take someone, especially if you want creative flavors (they offer vegan options, too!) and a nice local feel.

Came here (A La Carts Food pod location) after having some fish and chips one cart over.

Salted Caramel.

Oh my. It is the perfect balance of sweet and salty goodness.

There was an oatmeal flavored ice cream but I didn&apos;t care much for it. Seriously, I am so glad to finally have an ice cream place within walking distance that has a salted caramel flavor.

I don&apos;t know if they got a second cart or simply moved but I found this cart at the pod on 50th and Division.
I have to tell you as strange as it sounds for an ice cream flavor their Brown Sugar and Oatmeal ice cream is to die for! The stuff is strangely addictive! The sweet but not too sweet brown sugar and the mild a chewy oats. It works in a way I would never imagine.
Like you would expect from an Ice Cream shop you can get little sample spoons of each flavor. The Brown Sugar and Oatmeal was strange enough I almost didn&apos;t even try it. I am so glad I did. While I keep thinking I might get a different flavor next time it is always the Brown Sugar and Oatmeal I go back for.

You should go and give them all a try. Decide for yourself which one is the best!

After eating an awesome dinner at Bete Lukas, I decided it would be in my best interest to follow up with some ice cream. My brother and I walked across the street to the cart pod on 50th and Division and guess what we found?! Either they moved or opened a second cart but I either way, there they were... waiting just for me!

I was torn between the salted caramel and the espresso... both were RIDICULOUS!! Man so good. I went with the salted caramel (I know I know... obvious choice right).  Probably the best salted caramel ice cream I have ever had the pleasure of eating. So so good.. Justin had the white wine poached apricot with toasted hazelnuts, also delicious if that&apos;s the kind of thing you&apos;re going for. There were a lot of nuts so be ready for chunks.

Thank you, thank you for bringing your ice cream to my neighborhood! For some reason, Southeast had been left out of the recent surge of boutique ice creameries, so when I saw that the Scoop cart had popped up at the pod at 50th and Division, I was ECSTATIC! I am an ice cream fanatic. I&apos;ve had the Salted Caramel and the Oatmeal&amp;Brown Sugar. Both were excellent and eaten in silent reverence. They also have gluten free cones, which is extra awesome - now my sweetie can come along and have a cone instead of a cup. I am thinking of biking over there tonight...

Before placing my order, as I do with every ice cream establishment, I like to try several flavors:

Pumpkin Chocolate Chip: Obviously a seasonal flavor. I loved the chocolate chips here, and they did attempt to take over the pumpkin flavors here, but the important thing is that I still tasted the pumpkin on my sample. A great ice cream for fall!

Sweet Potato Pie: Again, another seasonal (fall) flavor. Honestly, this one really tasted like pumpkin pie, and I&apos;m cool with that. Simple flavors here (not too sweet) and very satisfying.

Oatmeal and Brown Sugar: I liked the textural aspects here, catching some oats on my sample. Again, not an overly sweet ice cream (but it&apos;s there so you get your sweet craving fix).

Triple Threat Ginger: The ginger came through loud and clear on this one, but the other sugary components of the ice cream prevented the ginger from overwhelming the palate.

In the end, I went with a mini scoop ($2.75) of one of Scoop&apos;s most popular flavors: Salted Caramel Stracciatella. It&apos;s their signature salted caramel ice cream with chocolate shavings blended in.

The salted caramel exploded with flavor in my mouth, perhaps the most intense salted caramel ice cream I&apos;ve ever had (and yes, I&apos;ve had it at several ice cream shops and carts). But the chocolate shavings really took this ice cream to unforeseen levels. If I had a party, I&apos;d probably want about a gallon of this ice cream all to myself. Yeah, I&apos;d put on a few pounds, but whatever...that&apos;s what the gym is for!

Scoop is closing for the winter on October 30. It&apos;s unfortunate that ice cream food carts may do that (doesn&apos;t take a genius to figure out why). But I&apos;m glad I got to try Scoop&apos;s ice cream before it was too late. They are a must-try, in my opinion, and hopefully people in  the Portland area have time to go get their fix!

Wow, that salt &apos;n&apos; caramel really threatened to become  a tasty sensation overload. Fortunately I happened to have the Madagascar Vanilla as a second scoop in my cup. This helped balance out the powerful flavors of the caramel w/o bastardizing them, completely.When I heard that &quot;scoop&quot; had moved the portable cart down to SE, while retaining its ferocious tag-team status w/pizza depakos, what else to say but, &quot;You got to move it, move eeet!&quot;

As of just prior to the writing of this review, I had handed out six 5-star ratings out of the 147 reviews I have written.  In addition, I had given ten 1-star reviews.  Two of those 5-star reviews were for restaurants, and one of them was a fast food restaurant.  So, you may be able to see that I take 5-star ratings very seriously.

Scoop gets one of those rare 5-star reviews.  It seems wrong to say that I&apos;ve never had better ice cream, but I can&apos;t think of a time that I have.  I don&apos;t think the waffle cone was homemade, so that would normally stop a perfect review, but the ice cream was just too good to have that bring it down. (I have since been informed that the waffle cone was homemade - then I&apos;ve had much better homemade waffle cones, but that doesn&apos;t change anything)  While it made me full and sleepy, the Madagascar vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate scoops of ice cream were perfect on a warm, cart tour day.  The service (I&apos;m guessing from the owner) was also great.  This place was my #2 of 12 carts for the day.  There was one that was even better that I have yet to review, but when I want ice cream again, I&apos;ll want to come back here.

You must try the Salted Caramel Ice Cream. OMG. It is great. It is the best tasting ice cream I have had in a while.
I&apos;m already planning my next walk to there,

Oh, Scoop. I&apos;m writing you a love letter from the last stretch of winter. Remember the good times we had last summer? Let&apos;s have a date again when it&apos;s warm enough to crave it all again. You. Me. Summertime and heat bouncing up off the asphalt and exposed toes wiggling in the sun, watching all the dog people. Or the way you get around and show up at the Interstate Farmers&apos; Market, too. You with the best salted caramel ice cream in town. Or the brown sugar oatmeal ice cream (also outstanding), or watermelon sorbet if I&apos;m in the mood for something light. The peach ice cream was a let down, which surprises me (how did you go wrong?). But everything so dense and velvety smooth.

I think I love you, Scoop. It doesn&apos;t hurt that one of your workers seems to scoop a *little* more generously to the big girly girls, either. Lipstick and ice cream just go together.

My first one star - oh how I hate to use you.  Alas, it is not for the ice cream, but the experience...

Ms. Scoop, what are you thinking?  These amazing reviews taunt me with your deliciousness, yet you refuse me?  Let me explain.

An out-of-towner, I am scrambling to find you.  I follow the scent of Tahitian vanilla and salted caramel to Killingsworth.  Finally, I see your tent sign and arrow - I am close, I am HERE!  Your window sign says &quot;OPEN&quot; and four others are behind us, eager to experience your offerings.

We six ogle over the short list of flavors on the whiteboard; we are watching as you are presumably mixing up a batch just feet away from us.  My eyes drift to the hours sign which tells me I have 10 minutes to spare (oh joy, I may get seconds!).  Yet, you refuse us.

At exactly 8:52 pm, 4 minutes after we arrived, you come to the window and say you are closed.  Not that you are so wonderful that you have enjoyed the luxury of selling out, but that on your watch it must already be 9 pm - forget the 3 signs that indicate your openness - the 6 potential customers are brutally disappointed.  The gentleman behind asks you to turn your signs around, and you seem to laugh and close your window... nothing more, or less, it is over before it ever began.  We return to the car and watch as all of your open signs remain... on open.

There is good and bad to this, though.  The arrogance with which we were turned away burned like dark chocolate on a sunny day.  If I lived in the area, would I return?  Normally no, but your reviews must be tested on my delicate tastebuds.  And I would be eager to rescind and revise this one star for the heavenly treats I&apos;m sure were within our grasp.

Unfortunately for you, I live far away and it will be some time before the opportunity to revisit will come again.  On this trip, another food stand operator shared a story about passion and striving to rise above the competition in such a crowded market.  He realized early on that a superior product alone is not enough for success.  There is an important lesson here: two groups, six people - are we the first?

Sadly, until we meet again...

I found out about this place because a friend of mine is friends with the owner and has been helping out at the cart. That said, I do not know the owner and there is absolutely no bias in this review.

I have to admit, I am that weirdo who does not go all cuckoo for cocoa puffs over ice cream. This ice cream made me go cuckoo and I find myself craving it! I have had vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, my boyfriend has had all those plus hazelnut and banana chocolate chunk. Everything we have had has been so delicious, fresh, creamy and just downright heavenly. My boyfriends actual words last weekend, &quot;I think this is some of the best ice cream I have ever had.&quot;

It&apos;s a cart, it&apos;s homemade, so flavor options are limited, but still a good selection, and just flat out yummy. So get on out to North Portland, support a local business and enjoy a scoop (or 4!) of heaven!

Getting to Scoop can be quite an adventure by public transportation.  I recommend driving here, but you can use a variety of the MAX and public transit to get over here.  The novelty of organic ice cream from a food cart was my mission in mind, and I was not disappointed.  I highly recommend getting the waffle cone, as it tastes like it is homemade.  I got the Thai Iced Tea, and it tasted very much like Thai Iced Tea milk, and the taste of the Tea flavors went very well with the waffle cone.  I got to sample a few flavors, and I was not impressed too much by the Salted Caramel, but it might be that everyone has different taste bud preferences.

Great ice cream. The salty caramel is delightful, if a bit squishy. It&apos;s soft, so even though you want to finish your cone with it, it is not the best foundation. Sometimes taste has to trump structural soundness - lick carefully. The new espresso ice cream is the best take on a coffee ice cream I have yet come across.

This is the best ice cream that you can find in Portland. The salted caramel is a must try as is the pumpkin. Anything chocolate is good as well. You pretty much can&apos;t go wrong.

Scoop can be found in the food cart pod at the corner of N. Greeley and Killingsworth along with other very legit food options.

I love this ice cream-food cart! I go there over 5 times a year (which is quite a bit for me since I don&apos;t eat that much ice cream).  Every time I go, I have the same dilemma of trying to figure out what flavors to order.  But, I have never done bad, everything I&apos;ve ordered has been delicious! I&apos;m a big fan of the salted caramel, but I did get to try the Pumpkin Chocolate Chip flavor before the cart got winterized in October, and it was AMAZING.  I loved it.  ANd, the home-made cones are really tasty too!

The best ice cream that I&apos;ve had.  The Triple Ginger Threat with chunks of candied ginger, ginger chocolate, and creamy ginger ice cream is a must-try.  The oatmeal flavor is awesome, and so comforting.  Also, as everyone says, the salted caramel is incredible.  Scoop is all over town now too, on Sundays at the Montavilla Farmer&apos;s market, Tuesdays at the OHSU Farmer&apos;s Market, Wednesdays at the Interstate market, and others I&apos;m sure.

I joined Yelp specifically to review this place. Cute stand, friendly and informative workers, and DELICIOUS ICE CREAM. For such premium stuff the price is good, too. I had the Oatmeal and Brown Sugar which was incredible. It tasted like oatmeal cookie dough, but not overwhelmingly sweet. One of my friends had the Strawberry which was fresh and delicious and tasted like the real strawberries they obviously used to make it, and my other friend had Avocado which was exactly what you&apos;d expect. Creamy and... avocado-y. We all loved our choices and I&apos;m dreaming of going back soon. Maybe today?

Scoop Organic Ice Cream is in my mind the best place to get ice cream in the Portland area.  Scoop now has a food cart at the Montivilla farmers market on Sundays and is well worth the trip!

I tried the ginger ice cream and thought it was delicious. The flavor was not overpowering, just slightly spicy. The ice cream is rich and creamy and had tiny flecks of chocolate. yummy!

I have tried many of the flavors at Scoop&amp;am always impressed&amp;amazed at the quality&amp;creativity of flavors. My personal favorite which is just outstanding is the cinnamon--creamy, spicy, delectable. Also interesting are the fruit sorbets combined with different alcohol ingredients, like blackberry cabernet or raspberry champagne. Scoop is a truly local business and all-organic. I love the attention to detail in ingredients&amp;flavors.
