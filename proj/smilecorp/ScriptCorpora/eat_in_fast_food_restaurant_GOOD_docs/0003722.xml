 Burger King , in their own words, hold the distinction of being known as the second largest fast food restaurant, a reputation of which they should be proud. Coming second to the largest of the fast- food chains , McDonalds, is no shame, but rather suggests an admirable success story that deserves recognition.

With more than 11,000 outlets in 69 countries and US territories, Burger King is no small fry and has risen in strength and reputation since it&apos;s small beginnings in Miami, Florida way back in 1954.
 

The strength of the corporation is evidenced in sales for the year 2007, a staggering $13.232 billion system wide.

Burger King estimate that they receive more than 11 million visitors to their restaurants worldwide on a daily basis. The growth of the company in just over 50 years is massive. A company that was founded in 1954 by James McLamore and David Edgerton, and with it&apos;s corporate headquarters still in Miami, Florida, is now a worldwide concern.
Burger King has of course become known for The WHOPPER, first introduced in 1957 and which has quickly became one of the best-known burgers in the world. According to the Burger King website, &quot;there are 221,184 possible ways for a guest to order an Original WHOPPER sandwich&quot;.

Their mission statement is presented on their website in these words:

&quot;The Burger King Corporation moves proudly into the future with over 50 years of experience tucked safely under our belt. As a brand, our company has never been stronger. We&apos;ve got millions of customers, who we love to bits. And our Executive Team, along with each of our individual employees, ensure our customers always receive exceptional, consistent service (as well as burgers, fries and drinks.)&quot;

Burger King as company, accept and advertise themselves as the second largest fast-food restaurant chain in the world, a fact they can be proud of. As a company, they have come a very long way since 1954.
