 Bringing home fewer plastic bags from stores 
 Posted on April 28, 2012 by sachadevbellman 
Although I’ve been good about bringing my canvas and other reusable bags to the grocery store each week, I still end up with an overflow of plastic bags from all the other shopping I do. A quick trip to the drug store will get me one or two, a trip to Target can get me three or four easy and a visit to my favorite clothing store will usually give me at least one bag.

And although we use them for smaller trash cans in the house, we still end up with an overflowing bag holder that spills over until we use them up.

 So I was thrilled last week on Earth Day when Target gave me a small version of a shopping bag with my purchase. It’s a cute little bag with the words“Fill, Refill, Repeat and the recycling symbol on it. It’s about two-thirds the size of the shopping bags sold at most grocery stores for $4 or $5. I have some of those, but they just seem too bulky to drag along to stores.

Since I’ve gotten the small Target one, I already used it at the drug store, where it fit as much as would have in one plastic bag. Although I’ve tried bringing shopping bags to stores before, I hope this cute one will make it more fun to bring along. It’s all about forming a new habit.

 New recycling can for your kitchen 
 Posted on April 14, 2012 by sachadevbellman 
My eye caught a new recycling bin by Rubbermaid at the grocery store last week. It’s called the 2-in-1 recycler and even though it is a little pricey ($43.99 on the Rubbermaid website and $49.99 in the store), it makes recycling look pretty and organized. 

Yes, it does mean having a second can in your kitchen, but it surely beats the two different places I currently recycle. I have a basket for paper and boxes in my dining room and a wire basket with a bag liner under my sink for the cans and plastic.

The information on the store’s website says the bin has two units to separate recycling. The top has 5.8 gallon capacity and can be pulled out like a bucket to be emptied in your garage recycling bin. The bottom area holds 7.4 gallons and is a tilt-out bin that has handles for a liner. Having two areas also allows you to use one for recycling and one for trash if you are short on space.

Not only was I excited to spot it because I’d like it for my own house, but also because it means more companies are rethinking products to encourage recycling. We all know that recycling takes effort and anything to make it easier like this bin is a welcome addition.

 Donating clothes is recycling too 
 Posted on March 30, 2012 by sachadevbellman 
One way to keep my closet from busting at the seams is that I try to get rid of one piece of clothing each time I buy a new one. Oftentimes, I get rid of a shirt that shrunk or a pair of pants that never quite fit right. But they are still usable items. Usually I donate these items, along with all the clothes my sons have outgrown, to a local or national charity.

Donating clothes is really recycling. The charities will sell these items at their thrift shop or send them to an area hit by a natural disaster. They will be worn once again by someone who still has use for them.

The City of New York’s Waste Less, Recycle More program recently started a campaign where they place bins for clothing and linen donations in public and large apartment buildings. They call it“re-fashion NYC”and  hope that by donating the items to charity, it will help keep them out of landfills a little longer. Check out their link at re-fashionNYC. 

But you don’t need a bin. Just start your own bag or box in your closet and once it is full,  take it to Good Will or St.Vincent de Paul. They will take care of the rest…And fewer items will clog your closet or the landfills.

 Recycling computers 
 Posted on February 3, 2012 by sachadevbellman 
I have two of them in my basement. Computers that went bust and are now gathering dust. Hate to fill the landfill with them, but how do you dispose of them? One of my readers asked me whether computers can be recycled.  I discovered they can be.

Several websites give advice about recycling electronics, but the easiest way to recycle computers that I found online is to simply take your laptop or desktop to Best Buy. In Ohio, Best Buy will take up to three electronic items per day for recycling. Staples also will take some of your technology for free, but charges $10 to recycle a monitor or printer. Office Depot charges between $5 and $15 per box of recyclable electronics.

Manufacturers of computers also have recycling programs, but most programs require shipping the equipment. It’s much easier just to stop by your local store and dispose of it.

So dig those monitors, keyboards and towers out of your basement and drop them off. It requires a little work, but it will feel good to get those dust collectors out of your house.

 Resolving to waste less 
 Posted on January 1, 2012 by sachadevbellman 
Happy New Year! I resolve to drink more water this year, without using more plastic water bottles. I have the habit of grabbing a water bottle from the garage on my way out to work or to exercise. And while I do recycle the bottles once used, I always feel like I am doing a bad thing.

According to statistics by environmentalists, only a fraction of plastic drink bottles are recycled. That brings a dilemma. Drinking more water is good. But using too many plastic water bottles is not good.

So I resolve to use the many reusable water bottles that currently clutter my kitchen counter—the one from the cruise, the one that the Y gave me for Christmas, the one we got as a promotional freebie. And one of the two on my desk at work—one with the name of my University and the metal one I prefer.

The new trick I will add to my arsenal this year is Mio’s drink mix and Wyler’s singles. I just don’t like the taste of tap water and really prefer bottled water. But adding a little flavor to my water bottle will make it go down smoother. I also plan to carry a Mio’s canister in my purse to use at restaurants—one of my husband’s cousins does that already.

So I resolve to drink more water to improve my health; save money by using tap or water fountain water; but mosts importantly, save more plastic bottles from hitting the recycling bin, or worse, the garbage can.

 Recycling Christmas trash 
 Posted on December 26, 2011 by sachadevbellman 
As I’ve started digging out from the Christmas haze, it’s obvious that we create a lot of trash from celebrating the holidays. The EPA reports that between Thanksgiving and Christmas, trash taken to landfills goes up 25 percent.

Luckily, I have done a pretty good job of separating carboard and other packaging materials and have added the recyclables to my paper recycling basket that I keep in my dining room. My sons have emptied it into my recycling can twice already this week. The basket is halfway full again. Rolls from wrapping paper, boxes from video games and other electronics as well as packaging from the food I’ve prepared have all found its way into the basket. Before I’m all done cleaning up, I may add a couple of shirt boxes that have seen its better days as well as the Amazon boxes that are still holding the presents we brought home from the in-laws’house. The best part is, I just took out one bag of garbage from the last few days. Just one bag!

As we move toward the new year, I hope to do an even better job of recycling in 2012. Each piece that goes to the recycling plant instead of the dump is a small victory. It’s a matter of changing your habits. Won’t you add recycling more to your new year’s resolutions?

 Little ways to conserve 
 Posted on August 4, 2011 by sachadevbellman 
The lady at the fast food restaurant asked me what size drink I wanted with my meal? Apparently, you could get any size without extra cost.“The biggest one”was my first instinct in this 90-degree heat, but I quickly amended my statement“the biggest one that is not plastic.”She handed me a styrofoam cup, which I then switched for the largest paper one.  It may not seem like a big deal, but if all of us chose the paper cup instead of the styrofoam or plastic, it would really help. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  the styrofoam cup used today will still be in a landfill 500 years from now.

At another luncheon, I went to this new-age sandwich shop which prided itself on using cups with recycled material. They were light plastic, but biodegradable. The drink tasted fine, so I was intrigued

During these dog days of summer, how many cups of soda do we buy? How many bottles of water do we drink? Please be vigilant and try to use the ones packaged in recycled material or at least paper, which is biodegradable. Yes, a styrofoam cup may be bigger, but nothing these days is really free.
