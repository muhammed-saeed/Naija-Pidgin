 EATING OUT 
 Part of the secret of success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside. Mark Twain 
As I have intimated previously, if theres a pastime that Americans love to engage in more than any other, it has to be eating. I hate to label, or indeed perhaps libel, a whole nation in that way, but ask any British person who has holidayed in the USA and they will give witness to the fact that, with the possible exception of Germans at a free buffet, no one can trough like the Americans.
It will probably come as little surprise then if I tell you that the restaurant sector is the American nations largest private employer, and according to figures I read, it accounts for 11.6 million employees or roughly 8% of the working population. A 1999 survey by the National Restaurants Association revealed that a typical US household spent $2116 per annum on food eaten away from home. This includes simple snacks and sandwiches bought from stores as well as take away food and meals in restaurants, but does not include any food people may prepare for themselves for eating outside of the home.
The figure equates to an average of $846 per person per annum, which does not sound that much if you think of it in terms of spending 10 per week on catered food. What you have to consider though is that this is a national average and many people at the lower end of the social spectrum may not spend anything at all on eating out. In wealthier places like Southern California however it is much more the norm. I can certainly vouch for the fact that in my wifes office she was the only person who took in a lunch box, though she probably wouldnt have done if I hadnt been such a good Mr. Mom and made it for her. Everyone else either went out for lunch to a restaurant for a meal or bought a sandwich from the local deli.
The eating statistics across the USA do vary somewhat. The following table shows information as at the year 2000, for the four states with the most food and drink outlets and by way of a comparison at the other end of the scale, I have included Alaska.

 State Numberof Eating/Drinking Places Employees Approx. Annual Sales California 80131 926K $38M New York 50725 453K $18M Texas 45516 629K $4.6M Florida 34536 453K $19M Alaska 1811 17K $0.9M 

This table rather suggests that people in Texas need to get out more, but the total annual sales figures in the states of California, New York and Florida, as well as reflecting the relative affluence of these areas, no doubt has much to do with the additional contribution from visiting tourists.
Those of you who have visited the USA, be it Florida, California, Las Vegas, New York or wherever, may have already experienced some or all of the differences and local customs appertaining to eating out in America. If that is the case, hopefully you will be able to nod your head in agreement with what I am about to tell you, although Im sure that some of you will be sitting there thinking, Well that never happened when I went to Florida and allowing yourselves a feeling of self-satisfaction at having caught me out.
But, for those of you who have not yet ventured to Americas fair shores, I trust that this will allow you a foretaste of what to expect and perhaps prevent you from having embarrassed moments of 
non-communication when attempting the apparently simple, but invariably daunting task of ordering food in a foreign environment.
 What do you call that ? 
Once again dear friends the differences in terminology between the British and American languages come to the fore where food is concerned. To begin with, as you may be aware there are slight differences with regard to the names of the meals. Being a humble Northerner, I was brought up to call the three basic mealtimes, breakfast, dinner and tea. Americans however tend to use terminology more attuned to the English middle and upper classes, preferring the terms breakfast, lunch and the evening meal being dinner.
In Britain, if we intend to go out to eat in the evening, we would probably say that we were going out for a meal. Americans taking in an evening meal would usually say they were going out to dinner. I also used to get curious stares from neighbours when I went out to call my kids in from play saying 
Your teas ready !. Im sure many of them had images of a silver service tea pot and china cups together with a selection of dainty cakes arranged on an ornate doily covered plate, of the kind that you are offered at the Ritz and which costs you more than a meal for 10 at McDonalds. Little did they know that what was on offer was more likely to be sausage and chips and a can of coke.
 Types Of Eating Establishments 
Did I mention before that America is a big country ? I think I might have. I also think I made mention of it being somewhat culturally diverse once or twice. Taking these facts as read, it pretty much goes without saying that in America you can find just about any type of cuisine you want. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Italian, Spanish, and most other nations on earth are represented on the culinary map of the USA. You can even find British owned pubs and restaurants serving steak&amp;kidney pie, treacle pudding and custard and very drinkable hand pulled beers. I would stress though that you may have to travel a reasonable distance to find your particular favourite unless you happen to be living or staying in a community which has similar tastes to your own.
As I am not aiming be a competitor to Egon Ronay, I will not be giving you the low down on individual restaurants. Also, on the basis that we only ever ate within a 50 mile radius of our home in Tustin, a glowing report about a restaurant in Orange County, California is not going to be of much value to you as a visitor to, or resident of Florida, unless you happen to like taking a 5000 mile round trip for dinner.
Wherever you go in the USA there are of course many individually owned, or small groups of restaurants catering for all kinds of tastes, whose prices vary according to their location, reputation and menu. These kind of establishments are what I would regard as special occasion venues, though some people of course, do have the wherewithal to eat at those restaurants on a regular basis.
I think its fair to say though that the restaurant business in America tends to be dominated by larger corporate entities whose outlets may be spread throughout a state, or indeed the whole country, adopting a fairly uniform menu, dcor and image. This applies equally to Fast Food and to what I would call the Family Restaurant sector. I believe the Americans refer to the latter as Casual Dining.
America is of course the birthplace of the Fast Food industry and the Drive Thru concept, which has now spread throughout the world, either through expansion or franchising of globally known names such as McDonalds, or by imitators of the American pioneers. Whether you consider the globalisation of fast food to be a blessing or a blight will depend to an extent on your eating habits or maybe on how many fast food restaurant childrens parties you have had to live through.
An American friend of mine said it was her aim to try to visit as much of Europe and the rest of the world as possible before everywhere ends up looking like America. When you drive around some of the American-style out of town shopping malls in England and see the landscape dominated by signs for McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut and the rest, you begin to see what she was getting at.
Before I go on to detail whats on offer at the various restaurant chains, let me cover two basic points. Firstly, as I outlined in the shopping chapter, most states in the USA operate a local sales tax which will be added to the advertised cost of your food. These taxes vary from state to state but are usually in the region of 7 8 %, so dont forget to factor this in when assessing the cost of your meal.
Secondly, we in Britain tend to give fizzy drinks the general title Pop. In America fierce arguments rage over this most important matter, but the issue remains unresolved as to whether the general descriptive term for carbonated drinks should be Soda, Pop or would you believe Coke.
If for example, you are in California, Las Vegas or New York , the vast majority of people will call it Soda. In the state of Colorado they prefer the term Pop, but in Texas they use Coke as the generic term for all fizzy drinks. Just to confuse matters completely, in the state of Florida they use the terms Soda and Coke in fairly equal measure. So if you ask your waitress or server for a Coke and they ask what kind of Coke, dont think they are about to offer you some illegal substance. The other thing to remember with fizzy drinks, is that lemonade in America is a still drink more like lemon barley water. If you want something that resembles what we know as lemonade you need to ask for a brand name such as Seven Up or Sprite.
 Fast Food and Quick Service Restaurants [ Generally take away food, although many have eat in facilities] 
One of the first lessons to learn about American fast food restaurants is, if you are ordering inside the establishment and you want to take your food home to eat, you need to ask for it To go . I can almost guarantee that if you ask for it To take out they will not understand the request, as it is outside their range of pre-programmed instructions. Also, be prepared to order everything with your best attempt at an American accent, otherwise you will either be there a long time or youll end up with an order which barely resembles what you thought you asked for.
The communication issue is particularly relevant at those drive thrus where there is no initial face to face contact and you are required to communicate with a talking box. Given that the sound quality from the speakers is like a 1960s transistor radio trying to pick up a North Sea pirate radio station, plus the fact that you will be unfamiliar with the messages emanating from the box, its as well to be confident about what you want to order. My suggestion would be not to try the drive thru piste until you have first had a few practice runs on the nursery slopes inside the restaurant.
In common with most British fast food outlets, your soda [pop or coke] cup will be so full of ice that there is hardly room for any liquid. If you try asking for your drink without ice, they of course will oblige, but be prepared for one of those Whos the weirdo ? type looks. No one in America takes a cold drink without ice. Even Eskimos.
 McDonalds 
Like so many of the fast food chains which now dominate America and the globe, the McDonalds empire effectively began from a single restaurant. Dick and Mac McDonalds hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California was already doing rather well, when in 1954 an enterprising businessman called Ray Kroc seeking further opportunities to market his Milk Shake Mixing Machines suggested to the McDonalds that they should open more restaurants to capitalise on their successful format. The good Mr Kroc could hardly have imagined that half a century later his suggested expansion plan would result in the current tally of around 12,800 McDonalds outlets across the USA and an overall total of around 28,000 in 121 countries. I wonder if he sold milk shake machines to them all ?
I am assuming that, unless you are living on the planet Zurg and have just found this website in cyber space, you will know the kind of fare on offer at McDs, so I wont go through the menu. Certainly, if you have children or grandchildren, you will have been fortunate in the extreme to have avoided a visit to one of their establishments. Even if the kids dont like the food, they just have to have the latest Happy Meal toy. Our house is cluttered with scores of miniature plastic figures and beanie toys, collected over the years which it is more than my lifes worth to try throwing away en bloc. I have had to resort to covert operations whereby the offending articles are smuggled one at a time from the toy pile and hidden in the darkest reaches of my sock drawer until such time as I am sure they will no longer be missed. Then and only then, is it safe to consign them to the care of the local authority cleansing department.
Incidentally, the Big Mac was introduced system wide to McDonalds in 1968 having being devised by one of their franchisees Jim Delligatti, and the Happy Meal came into existence in 1979.
As far as the USA is concerned you can expect the service experience to be pretty much as it is in the UK. The staff have just as much acne and if you ask only for an order of fries they are just as likely to ask you do you want fries with that ? .
 Burger King 
Another of the familiar giants of the fast food industry, Burger King was the creation of James McLamore and David Edgerton who opened their first restaurant in Miami, Florida in 1954. Although not as numerous as McDonalds, they have over 11,000 locations in 58 countries and are represented in all 50 US states, so if a BK burger is what youre after, then you shouldnt be disappointed.
We made good use of our local BK in Tustin and I even got bold enough to use the drive thru when theyd got used to my English/ American accent. My kids also liked to eat inside, as they enjoyed the novelty of free refills of soda. The actual drinks machines were even located on the customer side so you could just help yourself. This is a concept I couldnt ever imagine being adopted in Britain without the privilege being totally abused by people smuggling empty pop bottles in under their coats and taking a weeks supply at once.
Free refills are much more common in the USA, but do not apply to every fast food restaurant, so do please check that the extra drinks are free before running up a $100 soda tab and then blaming it on some idiot writer in England.
 Dairy Queen 
Although Dairy Queen has international outlets in some 20 countries, this is a name which is unlikely to be known to you unless you have visited America or some of the middle eastern or far eastern countries where it is represented.
Although there was a Dairy Queen in Tustin, it is not a restaurant that we got to visit, but with over 5000 outlets across America it is certainly one of the nations favourites.
Once again, this huge organisation had relatively humble beginnings. It was in Illinois in 1938 that ice cream store owner Sherb Noble was persuaded by a local father and son to try their latest ice cream dessert. I dont know if you can say that ice cream sold like hot cakes but apparently it did. The ice cream success story continued apace after the war as the idea was franchised across the USA.
Todays Dairy Queen outlets still have a tempting range of sumptuous sundaes on their menu, but they also serve most of the standard fast food fare : chicken strips, hamburgers, pizza, fries and salads to name but a few. Im also told they do a pretty good malt or milk shake too.
 Wendys 
Still on the hamburger trail, another well known chain in America which has not yet hit the High Streets of Britain is Wendys. The Wendys story began in Columbus, Ohio in the mid 50s. Dave Thomas was managing a restaurant owned by Phil Clauss, but in 1956 he and Phil met with the now famous Colonel Sanders, who was then in the process of establishing his Kentucky Fried Chicken empire throughout the country. Clauss was given the opportunity by Sanders to purchase four 
under-performing restaurants in Columbus. Clauss took on the restaurants and entrusted the management to the young Dave Thomas. Thomas set about cutting down the menu items to focus on what are now KFC standard products of fried chicken and fries. The four restaurants became extremely successful and when they were sold back to the KFC group, Daves share of the profit made him a millionaire.
Rather than rest on his laurels Dave Thomas decided to invest his funds in a traditional market, opening his first Wendys Old Fashioned Hamburger Restaurant in 1969. The name Wendy came from a nickname given to his daughter Melinda. At the time many people thought he had made a wrong move, but with his personal drive behind the corporation Wendys is now one of the best known and best liked hamburger chains in the USA. Through extremely successful franchising there are now over 5000 Wendys outlets in 34 countries. Dave Thomas remains one of the most recognisable figures in the US fast food industry, still appearing in many of the company adverts on TV. A bit like Ronald McDonald but with a touch less make up.
The menu includes the usual hamburger and fries standards, but you will also find potatoes, chilli, chicken sandwiches and, more recently, stuffed pittas. Wendys has been a winner of many fast food awards and their burgers certainly got the Haley Snr. and Jnr. seal of approval as one of our favourites.
 In N Out 
This one is strictly a West coast favourite with all the current In n Out restaurants being based in California, Nevada and Arizona states, so dont spend all night looking for one in Orlando. I feel it is worth a mention though for anyone who is bound for the West. When we first moved to California, I asked a local resident what he thought was the best place for burgers he opted straight for In n Out.
This particular chain is a true family business which to date has not resorted to franchising to expand the empire. In n Out began when Harry and Esther Snyder opened their first hamburger restaurant in Baldwin Park, California in 1948. Their philosophy was to focus on a basic hamburger, fries and milk shake menu but to only use the freshest and best quality ingredients. To this day, the basic menu has remained the same with all In n Out burgers cooked to order, and no frozen food or microwaves are used. The fries are also the nearest you are likely to get to an English chip in an American fast food outlet, being made from hand diced potatoes. I understand also that Harry and Esthers original restaurant was the first drive thru to use the two way speaker system for food ordering. So theyre the ones to blame.
Having sampled the goods on many occasions, if all you are looking for is a good burger and some tasty fries, I can recommend the produce wholeheartedly. You may have to wait a little longer than you might expect for a fast food order, but thats the trade-off you make for freshly cooked food.
Harry, Esther and their sons Rich and Guy built this business to its current level of 140 locations mainly in California. Sadly Harry, Rich and Guy are no longer with us, but I believe that Mom Esther is still involved.
 Jack In The Box 
Disappointing as it may be to adolescents of the seventies like me, this particular chain was not named after the Clodagh Rodgers Eurovision song contest entry of the same name. It is however a good excuse to revisit my mental image of Clodagh in her hot pants and long leather boots. Sorry about that. Where was I ? Ah yes, Jack in the Box..
This is another no frills hamburger purveyor established in 1951 in San Diego, California by 
Robert O. Peterson. The Jack in the Box name tied in with the corporate image which was a 
Jack-in-the-box type clown called, believe it or not, ..Jack.
Jacks image adorned the speaker boxes from which the drive thru orders were made. According to their web site they also lay claim to be the innovators of the drive thru system. As I have no wish to get involved in the middle of a corporate argument Ill happily include all the claims and hope that nobody really cares.
Jack, the corporate clown image, represented JITB until 1980 when he was dramatically blown up in a TV advertisement as part of the companys wish to appeal more to the adult market. Amazingly though, Jack returned from the dead in 1995, not only become the corporate logo again, but also to assume the mantle of fictional founder and Chief Executive Officer. If only Railtrack had known he was available they may not have gone belly up. To this day Jack remains a bit of a cult figure with his cute ping pong ball head, big smile and jauntily tipped pointy hat. There became somewhat of a craze a few years back in the USA to put Jack on top of your car antenna [aerial] and around 17 million antenna tops of Jack in various guises were sold.
Although mainly located in California, Arizona and Texas, there are a total of 1634 JITB outlets in 15 states and if you are lucky enough to get to Hawaii, youll find Jack there too. As well as traditional burgers, the menu includes chicken sandwiches, fish, tacos, breakfast items, shakes and desserts.
JITB also have a reputation for regular discounted items, such as 99c burgers which proved very popular with some of my hungry bargain seeking American friends. From my own perspective, if you like straightforward burgers etc. the food is perfectly good and with the more adult slant you dont tend to end up with a cupboard full of replica plastic cartoon characters.
 Kentucky Fried Chicken 
If, like me, you thought that the homely old Colonel Sanders was a marketing executives creation you may be surprised to learn, as I mentioned in the Wendys story above, that the good Colonel did in fact exist and was indeed the founder of KFC.
Colonel Harland Sanders story goes back to 1930 when he opened his first restaurant in Kentucky specialising in his own fried chicken recipe. His Kentucky restaurant remained successful through the war years and it was for his service to the community during the war that he was awarded the title of Colonel. The expansion story of KFC began in earnest from 1952 when Colonel Sanders took to the road, touring the country by car, selling his chicken recipe and method of cooking to restaurant owners on a franchise basis. The deal was that he got 5c per chicken sold. By 1964 there were 600 outlets across the USA selling his secret recipe brand of chicken and it was then that the Colonel sold out his interest for $2 million.
From the Colonels legacy a huge corporation has grown with 5230 outlets in the USA and a total of around 10800 worldwide in 82 countries.
The Colonels image is one of the best known and recognisable marketing logos around the world and Im sure you dont need me to tell you about his finger lickin good products.
 Koo Koo Roo 
Whilst were in chicken mode, I thought I would mention Koo Koo Roo, for no other reason than this has to be one of the weirdest names for a restaurant that you could imagine. Ive always assumed that the name is some sort of attempt to sound like a rooster and as I know of no alternative explanation to contradict this, Ill stick to my theory. If however you know different please feel free to let me know.
KKR would probably object to being included under a fast food heading as their primary products are roasted chicken and turkey, or as they put it flame broiled, and these are not quick cook items. As most of their outlets also have caf style seating, one could argue that they are partly a family restaurant.
KKR began life in 1988 in Los Angeles with a restaurant founded by two brothers who shall remain nameless as their corporate history on their website doesnt name them. The aim was to create a healthy alternative to fast food hamburgers. Im not going to get into the argument as to which foods are the most healthy so please dont sue me - Im only the messenger. Nevertheless KKR does provide a welcome change to the usual fast food staples.
Unlike KFC, they dont go in for fried chicken in breadcrumbs, but you can pick up a pretty good chicken or turkey dinner with a range of vegetables, including real mashed potatoes and gravy. This is about as close as you get to a British Sunday Dinner in a convenience restaurant setting, but it goes without saying that the gravy just isnt as good as your mum used to make, and dont expect any Yorkshire puddings. They also offer other menu alternatives such as soups and salads, to name but two.
KKR comes into its own at Thanksgiving celebration time for those who either cant be bothered to roast their own turkey, or find the prospect of cooking for the whole extended family gathering too daunting. We attended a couple of thanksgiving dinners catered a la Koo Koo Roo and enjoyed the food, especially as someone else was picking up the tab.
KKR is headquartered in Irvine, California and at present only has 43 outlets in California and Nevada, but apart from the off beat name I thought I would include it in case you happen to be visiting that area and you end up with mashed potato withdrawal symptoms. Good mash is hard to find.
Whilst were on the vegetable trail, I ought to make mention of squash. As well as being a game played by people who enjoy sweating and chasing small balls around in confined spaces, and a cordial type drink, squash is also a popular staple food item in America. My first experience of squash was as a one of the assembled vegetables with our KKR Thanksgiving dinner. It was mashed, orange in colour and tasted rather like sweet turnip. As I understand it though, squash is not one particular vegetable so much as a collective name for a number of products which are technically fruits, though generally treated in culinary matters as vegetables.
At the risk of confusing you further, I believe there are two basic kinds of squash, which go under the general headings summer and winter squash. Within these groupings are various different varieties such as zucchini, being a summer squash, and pumpkin, being an example of a winter squash. Whether its a fruit or a vegetable, squash has been around in the Americas since about 9000 BC and has long been a staple food of Native American Indians.
 Boston Market 
Like KKR, Boston Market is another in the quick convenience food, rather than true fast food, category. They provide a wide range of dinner items including rotisseried chicken and turkey. In addition youll find ham, meatloaf, sandwiches, salads and soups. Whilst you can eat in at most locations, they tend to cater for the takeaway food market.
This particular chain started life in 1985 under the name Boston Chicken, with the first restaurant in Newton , Massachusetts. They were taken over in the year 2000 by the McDonalds Corporation and currently have around 700 locations in 28 states of the USA.
Although they do have outlets in California, this is one of the food retailers I never got around to trying personally, so Im not qualified to give you an opinion. Actually Im not sure Im qualified to give you an opinion on any of the others either, but you dont know that. Or at least you didnt until I just told you.
 El Pollo Loco 
There must be something about chicken restaurants that leads their owners to consider oddball names. This particular cookie translates from Spanish as The Crazy Chicken. Where will the peculiar name fad end ? Will it be restricted to chicken joints ? [apologies for unintended pun] Or could we yet live to see new franchises along the lines of The Barmy Burger, The Potty Pizza or The Half-Baked Potato ?
El Pollo Loco [ pronounced El, Po-Yo, Lo-Co] started life in 1975 as a Mexican roadside chicken stand run by Juan Francisco Ochoa [ a.k.a. Pancho]. Panchos secret for success lay with a family recipe for flame broiled chicken, marinated in a special mixture of herbs, spices and citrus juices. Within 4 years Panchos chicken was being served in 85 El Pollo Loco restaurants across Northern Mexico. The first EPL on American soil was opened in Los Angeles in 1980 and to date there are a total of 275 restaurants with most of the American outlets located in the states of California, Arizona, Nevada and Texas. Pancho actually sold out to the Dennys restaurant chain in 1983 but I believe they are now part of a larger corporation.
As well as broiled chicken, the menu includes most of the usual Mexican /American standards such as burritos and tacos plus a selection of Spanish rice and bean dishes.
Now I realise that we Brits have become so cosmopolitan in our food tastes that many Mexican foods are routinely found on our supermarket shelves, but on the off chance that there are some of you who still think a tortilla is a female tortoise, here are a few brief descriptions of the regular Mexican fast food offerings. I ought to point out that these are Americanised versions of what the Mexicans call Antojitos, being corn and tortilla based dishes. They do not by any means represent the full spectrum of Mexican cuisine any more than Chinese food is adequately showcased by the menu at Jimmy Wongs Chop Suey takeaway in Wigan.
Firstly, I suppose I should explain that a tortilla is a thin, flat, unleavened cornmeal or flour cake.
Burritos: Usually consists of a shredded or dried meat filling, often mixed with chilli sauce, wrapped in a large thin flour tortilla.
Chalupa: Tortilla dough pressed into an elongated shape with a ridge along the edge resembling a canoe [or chalupa in Spanish] sometimes fried in oil and topped with shredded meat, cheese etc.
Enchilada: Corn tortilla softened in hot oil, sometimes dipped in chilli sauce, wrapped around a filling of either meat or cheese and garnished with more sauce and cheese.
Gorditas: Tortilla dough, sometimes with wheat flour or potato, divided into 2-3 inch circles, sometimes deep fried. Beans, meat, cheese and the like are placed in the pocket which occurs when the dough puffs up.
Quesadilla: Usually corn tortilla folded over a filling of cheese, meat etc, cooked on a griddle until cheese melts and tortilla is crisp.
Taco : Crisp corn or soft flour tortilla wrapped around cheese, meat, beans etc filling often with shredded lettuce.
Fajitas: Various recipes, such as grilled marinated steak, roasted onions, peppers, tomatoes, cheese, rice and fajita sauce in a warm soft flour tortilla.
Nachos: Crisp spicy tortilla chips [ like our crisps] often eaten with cheese sauce dip.
If you spotted a certain similarity in all these definitions, you would not be too wide of the mark. It seems to me that, as most of the fillings revolve around meat, cheese and beans, the only difference appears to be the shape or flexibility of the tortilla. It ought to be said also, that this is the greasy end of the market and if your cholesterol levels are a concern then steer clear of Mexican fast food.
 Taco Bell 
In 1946, San Bernardino was obviously the place for up and coming fast food chain entrepreneurs as Glen Bell began plying his trade as a hot dog stand owner in the same town as the McDonald brothers started their dynasty. By 1952 Glen had progressed to a hamburger and hotdog unit but was increasingly interested in the possibility of adding new items to his menu. His particular interest was in Mexican food and he developed his own recipe for chilli sauce and began selling chilli dogs. By 1962 the idea of a full Mexican fast food outlet came to fruition and the first Taco Bell restaurant was born.
The concept was a major success and by 1975 when Glen Bell sold out to the Pepsi Corporation there were 868 restaurants in operation. Taco Bell is by far the leader in the US quick service Mexican food market with a market share of around 70% and over 6500 locations in the USA plus around 250 others worldwide.
The menu includes all the antojitos options I detailed already in a variety of different recipes. If you like Mexican food youll probably find much to enjoy at Taco Bell at reasonable prices. Just dont tell your doctor.
 Del Taco 
This is not the latest dodgy venture by Del Boy Trotter of Peckham, but one of the smaller players in the market dominated by Taco Bell. Del Taco originated in Barstow, California in 1964. There are currently around 400 units, mainly in the South Western states.
As well as serving all the regular Mexican fast food favourites they also cater for the burger, chicken and fries market and have a range of milkshakes and breakfast options. They insist on using no microwaves and all food is made fresh to order. No personal experience of their produce Im afraid, but I believe they are a strong player with 100 million customers per annum, so they must be doing something right.
 Panda Express 
When British people refer to Asians, we are generally talking about people from the Indian subcontinent, whereas in America they include in their definition the far eastern countries such as China, Japan, Taiwan etc. So when Americans speak of Asian food its generally assumed theyre talking about food of an oriental nature.
With so many immigrants from the Far East and a genuine desire from the public for new and interesting forms of cuisine, the Asian food market is very strong across the USA and there is a seemingly limitless choice of restaurants and fast food outlets catering for that need. As yet theres no real dominant player of the McDonalds or Del Taco level but Panda Express is probably one of the largest Asian fast food organisations in America.
Owner Andrew Cherng opened his first restaurant under the name Panda Inn in Pasadena, California in 1973 and built up a reputation for quality Mandarin Chinese food. Recognising the changing tastes of the quick service food market he opened his first Panda Express outlet in Glendale, California in 1983 and has expanded steadily since to a level of over 400 locations in 36 states, including Hawaii. Andrew remains in control of the business and is keen to expand further.
No personal experience but Panda Express is a well established favourite in the USA.
 Pick Up Stix 
In another remarkable story, the founder of this chain, Charles Zhang arrived in the USA in 1980 with $20 to his name. Charles worked hard as an employee at various restaurants and saved until he was able to open his own restaurant, Shanghai Charlies in Laguna Niguel, California in 1984. Between 1984 and 1989 he owned or managed seven restaurants before hitting on the formula for Pick Up Stix.
Realising that 70% of his previous restaurant trade was for take home food, he decided to set up Pick Up Stix to cater for that specific market. He did not wish to compromise on quality however by 
pre-cooking food, so he devised an open plan kitchen layout for his units where, although the customer has to wait while the food is cooked fresh to order, they can watch the chefs cooking it at their woks.
So, fast food its not, but having consulted my wife who is more of an Asian food fan than I, the quality was very good. As well as all the traditional Chinese favourites they also serve soups and salads. Most of the stores have seating but the vast majority of their business is take home.
There are currently 53 outlets mainly in Southern California, but since the acquisition of Pick Up Stix by the Dallas based Carlson Restaurants Worldwide group, who also own other restaurant groups such as TGI Friday, there are plans for significant expansion in the future.
 Arbys 
If youre looking for a hot sandwich but youre completely burgered out, then Arbys may have the answer in the form of a hot roast beef sandwich.
Arbys was founded in 1964 by Forrest and Leroy Raffel. The two Raffel brothers had already established a fairly successful food services consultancy business, but saw the potential of fast food and were looking to build a new franchise operation on something other than hamburgers.
Their quest was ended one damp Halloween evening when the two brothers entered a Boston sandwich store to join a line of folk waiting patiently to buy hot roast beef sandwiches. Having been given the inspiration, they then decided on the name for their proposed restaurant. Unfortunately their first choice Big Tex was already in use and the owner wasnt prepared to sell the name to them, so they settled on Arbys, which was derived from the initials of their existing business Raffel Brothers, though many people now assume that the R.B. stands for roast beef. The Raffels dont care as long as people keep eating their product.
The first Arbys restaurant was opened in Boardman, Ohio in 1964 serving only roast beef sandwiches, potato chips [crisps] and a beverage. From that single store there are now around 3000 Arbys worldwide. The menu has expanded somewhat to include chicken, ham and turkey sandwiches, salads fries, baked potatoes, breakfast items, shakes, sodas, tea and coffee.
I well remember my first ever visit to an Arbys restaurant. We had gone in out of the midday sweltering heat and had decided to opt for one of their trademark roast beef sandwiches. When it came to drinks however I had decided that I would take a hot tea. I say hot tea as most restaurants in the US serve iced tea more frequently than the hot version. When I asked the server for my tea however, she looked at me unbelievingly and said hot tea ? in such a tone as to suggest Did I hear you correctly mister or did you just ask for a hot tea when the temperature outside is in the 90s ?. I affirmed my selection and with a shrug she proceeded to get me my tea, but Im certain I heard her muttering hot tea ?? as she did so.
When I saw how she made the drink, filling a polystyrene cup with some hot but not boiling water, dropping a tea bag on a string into it and then offering me a small sachet of coffee type cream to go in it, I could understand why they didnt sell a lot of hot tea.
Nevertheless, the beef sandwiches were excellent and I would recommend Arbys as a welcome change from hamburgers.
 SUBWAY 
Subway began in 1985 when a 17 year old would-be college student, Fred DeLuca was seeking a means of earning sufficient money to pay for his own college education. The answer to his problem came from a family friend who lent him $1000 and suggested that he opened a sandwich shop.
Its hard to believe that from that initial idea, merely 15 years later, Subway is now the giant of the sandwich store industry with almost 16000 outlets in 74 countries throughout the world.
Subways formula is very simple. All sandwiches are freshly made to order allowing customers to select the meat, fish, salad and dressing ingredients of their choice and piling this high within a huge submarine shaped bread roll. Subway sandwiches come in either 6 inch, being a half sized roll or the full size 12 inch monster. I just cannot believe how people can eat a foot long sandwich crammed with enough food to fill a dinner plate, but they do.
Working on the basis, as I always do, that size isnt everything, I tended to opt for the 6 inch version and I can heartily recommend a subway sandwich as a really satisfying lunchtime snack. If you go in during the lunch hour though, let me warn you that you need to have your wits about you. As the sandwiches are all individually made to order, at peak times the shops get very busy but with three of four servers behind the counter they really do try to shift the customers through quickly.
This is all very well for the locals who know exactly what they want and can order it in 10 seconds flat. If youre an outsider with an English accent and youre not really sure whats on offer or how to ask for things, you are going to get a little stressed. If youre one of those lucky people who likes all kind of salad items and dressings, then just bowl right in and say Ill take a 12 inch pastrami with everything on and youve got it made.
As for me, Im a bit more picky about my sandwich concoctions, so I used to find it a bit of a bind having to ask for this, that and not so much of the other, and then having to repeat myself three times because they didnt catch my accent and then end up coming out of the shop picking the bits out of the sandwich that I hadnt requested. In the end I chickened out of Subway [ no pun intended again] and used to get my sandwiches from the Deli counter at the local supermarket where it was rather less busy and the Deli manageress was accustomed to my strange English accent.
But dont let my personal inadequacies and hang-ups put you off. Subway do great sandwiches, so enjoy them please. They also do sandwich wraps, cookies, potato chips [crisps] and soft drinks.
 Togos [ Pronounced Tow-Goes] 
Id always thought that this chain was called To Gos as in the American version of To Take Out but it appears I was being too clever, though Ive yet to find out why it got to be called Togos either.
Nowhere near as big as Subway, but has the student link, in that this chain was also founded by a student, named Michael Cobler. Michael decided to start his own sandwich restaurant on the basis that he was tired of the campus food on offer at college. His philosophy was to offer hearty sandwiches with generous portions which were likely to appeal to poor hungry students.
He opened his first shop in 1971 and by 1974 was opening his second location. By 1977 he decided that franchising was the best option for expansion and in 1997 he sold out to Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants. There are now close on 400 Togos in 19 states.
The menu may vary a little from location to location, but the main hot options are beef, chicken and pastrami. The cold sandwich selection includes tuna, cheese, ham, chicken and vegetarian options. In addition youll find salads, soups, chips[ crisps] and cookies.
 Pizza Hut 
Think of America and fast food and pizza quickly come to mind. Theres a joke that did the rounds in the USA that things got so bad with crime that the pizza delivery got to you quicker than the police. Certainly pizza delivery is big business in a country where people have oversized kitchens but dont seem to be that keen on cooking in them. An American friend of ours insisted that her husband would eat any food at all as long as it didnt involve using cutlery. Way to go, Steve Eades !
Pizza Hut came into being in 1958 when two college students, who presumably prefer to be nameless[ not named on the website], started their first pizza outlet in Wichita, Kansas with a $600 loan from their mother. By 1969 they had adopted the famous red roof logo and by 1977 they had made their fortune and the business was bought out by the Pepsi company.
Pizza Hut is now the largest pizza company in the world with 12,000 units in 88 countries and on that basis Im going to assume you dont need me to tell you what youre likely to find on their menu.
 Dominos Pizza 
Another name youre probably familiar with, Dominos was started by two guys named Tom and James Monaghan who bought their first pizza store in 1960 for $500. Now, I dont know about you but its really peeing me off to keep relating all these tales about people starting mega-international businesses with the equivalent of what I paid for the first old banger car I ever bought. They ended up millionaires and I ended up with a heap of rust and a string of garage bills. But then I guess they must have worked hard, or at least I hope they did otherwise Im even more peed off.
Having got that bout of jealousy off my chest, I ought to mention that Dominos now has over 7000 stores across the world and they do of course make very good pizza.
 Chuck E. Cheese 
Whether the owners of Chuck Es would consider themselves more of a family restaurant than a quick service outlet I dont know, but on the basis that its a self service type environment serving a fast food style menu of hot dogs, pizza, sub sandwiches, fries and salads, Im going to conclude the 
quick service / fast food section of this chapter with this most American of institutions.
Chuck E Cheeses not only serves food, they also regard themselves as an entertainment business. The entertainment on offer is however mainly aimed at kids and takes the form of a whole range of noisy arcade and funfair type games assembled in large warehouse sized buildings. The kids play the games and attempt to win tokens, which they then collect, and when they have saved up about 1000 they get to choose the cuddly toy of their dreams. In reality of course most kids only win enough tokens in one visit to get one of those plastic bead necklaces or a handful of candy, but what the hell. They enjoy it.
The idea is of course that the games bring in the kids and they and their parents spend money on the food and because the kids get hooked on collecting the tokens, and they bring Mom or Dad back time and time again, until they have enough tokens for a meaningful prize.
Personally, I found that one visit was one too many, but you might not be such a miserable old grouch and may actually enjoy trying to shoot balls through hoops and the like to help win prizes for your kids. Alternatively, if you are one of those people who can switch off to the surrounding mayhem, Chuck E Cheeses is the ideal place to take your kids and let them annoy other people, whilst you have an in depth discussion with your neighbour Brenda about her impending hysterectomy.
Aside from my jaundiced opinion, since its inception in 1977, Chuck E Cheeses has become one of the most well known outlets in the USA despite only having a total of 395 restaurants. Chuck E. Cheese himself is the mouse mascot of the organisation and believe it or not, in some polls, he has proved to be better recognised than Mickey Mouse. At one point there was also a national debate as to whether this particular rodent was a rat or a mouse. Fortunately for the marketing men, they managed to convince the nation that Chuck E. was definitely a mouse. Somehow I couldnt see having a rat as an eating establishment mascot working very well.
 Family Restaurants 
If youre in search of nouvelle cuisine, cordon bleu or other gastronomic delights then the typical American family restaurant is probably not for you. If on the other hand you appreciate somewhere that provides a range of good simple food, value for money and excellent service then America is going to spoil you for choice.
If theres one aspect of a visit to the USA that brings a genuinely favourable response from British people, its the experience of eating in American family restaurants. Things have definitely improved in the last decade in Britain as far as restaurant service is concerned but we still have some way to go to reach the consistency of American standards . Its fair to say that whatever your request in an American restaurant, they will go out of their way to try to accommodate your wishes, whilst in Britain I believe theres still a bit of the old attitude of Im sorry, thats not on the menu. I also always want to cringe and hide under a table when a British waitress tells an American visitor Im sorry we dont have any ice. To an American thats almost like saying Weve run out of food.
Now before I get the British restaurant trade in a tizzy, let me qualify my opinion and state that not every restaurant in America is good and not every restaurant in Britain is bad. Also in my time in America I did not find anything to rival the atmosphere of a typical British Country Pub restaurant. Having said all that, our experiences of eating out in family style restaurants are amongst our most positive memories of America and whenever we visit we just cant wait to get back to some of our favourite haunts.
Before I give you the short list of our favourite eating places, for those of you who have yet to visit the USA and those Florida trippers who never ventured out of their Disney World hotel, here are a few observations on how things differ from British restaurants.
 Smoking 
If you are a smoker please be aware that many restaurants in America do not allow smoking, so if you cant get through a meal without a swift drag, it would be as well to ask whether smoking is allowed before you enter. In fact, smoking has been banned in all bars and restaurants in California from January 1998. The California ban was an extension of a previous law, which banned smoking in the workplace, to cover restaurants and especially bars.
Although most restaurants have complied with the law quite readily, many bar owners have either failed to actively enforce the ban or indeed have completely ignored it for fear of losing business. Whilst bar owners and customers both risk fines for smoking offences, the law is proving difficult to enforce, but its as well that you are aware that you may be breaking the law by lighting up in California, even if those in the bar around you may be smoking.
As yet, this law does not apply in all states, but the anti smoking trend is on the increase, so if in doubt, ask before you smoke.
 Waiting 
As I indicated somewhat earlier in this book, there is a perception amongst British people that Americans will not stand for waiting in queues and that they insist on immediate attention. Its certainly true that the demanding nature of the American people has driven up service standards in private sector businesses, but Americans do sometimes have to wait to eat and are quite prepared to do so if they can see that a restaurant is busy.
Typically what happens when you enter a restaurant is that you are greeted by a host or hostess who will ask you how many are in your party and, if there remains a choice, whether you want a smoking or non-smoking table. Depending on the restaurant you may also be offered the choice of a booth or a table. A booth is generally a little more private, with bench type upholstered seats surrounding your table, and often these will be around the perimeter of the restaurant or maybe by a window. Ordinary tables will generally be toward the centre of the room and these have dining chairs. Normally the booths are more popular, so if there is a queue of people waiting to be seated, you may shorten your wait if you are prepared to go for either option.
If they cant accommodate you immediately you will usually be asked to take a seat in the waiting area and they will call you as soon as your table is available. If you ask how long the wait is likely to be, then I would advise you to double the answer given. Its rare that a restaurant host will tell you its going to be much longer than 20 minutes, as that may lead you to consider trying somewhere else. They know that after youve waited the initial 20 minutes, even if you still havent been seated, youre more committed to sticking with it, having invested so much waiting time already.
If youve plenty of money and cheek then you can try bribing your way past the queue. I realise that this its a most un-British thing to consider queue jumping, but I have seen it work. My brother in law once bought us out of a very long line for lunch at a theme park restaurant by slipping a $20 bill into the hosts hand. A vacant reserved table suddenly became available just for us. Corruption rules OK.
 Entertaining the Kids 
Once you get to your table and youve ordered your food, most family restaurants are attuned to the fact that waiting for your order to be prepared can be frustrating for families, so they often provide puzzle sheets, activity books, crayons or simple toys to play with. When the novelty of these has worn off, you can pass them on to your kids for them to play with.
 Water 
Most restaurants in California provide glasses of iced water as a matter of course as soon as you are seated, which we really appreciated on hot summer days. I noticed however on our most recent visit that some restaurants are now only providing water as and when requested, to cut down on wastage of what is a precious resource in Southern California. If you do want a glass of water at any time though, please dont hesitate to ask and theyll happily provide it.
You will however need to ask in an American accent along the lines of, Could I get some war-der ?
If you say, Could I have some wart -er in your best English accent youll spend the next five minutes with the waitress saying, Sorry ? and you repeating the question until you eventually resort to pointing to the water on the adjoining table.
Whilst on that matter, I always find it odd that Americans say, Can I get. when they really mean 
Could you get me. If someone asked a waitress in a British restaurant Could I get a glass of 
water ? theyd probably be told, No its all right, Ill get you some.
 Cutlery 
Another oddity of eating in regular American restaurants is that you only tend to get one set of cutlery. Now I dont know about you but Im not that keen on eating my dessert with the same implements that I used for my starter and main course, but it doesnt seem to worry them. Many Americans of course only use a fork anyway, if they use cutlery at all. Also when you see the kind of things they mix together on their breakfast plate, like eggs and bacon together with pancakes and syrup, you perhaps begin to realise why they dont bother with fresh silverware between courses.
 Alcohol 
Not every family restaurant serves alcohol, although most do, so if youre someone who likes a beer or a glass of wine with a meal, do ask when you enter. The choice of beers and other alcoholic drinks may also be fairly limited and theyre not particularly cheap. Some eating places have adjoining bars and these restaurants tend to have a better choice of drinks, but in the main youll be looking at bottled lager type beers such as Budweiser, Miller or Heineken. As someone who is not fond of lager or bottled beers, I tended to go for bottles of Samuel Adams beer if available, which is a little darker and actually tastes of beer. Depending on where you go in the USA you may also be lucky enough to find some English draught beers, such as Bass. Remember though that in America a pint is only 16 fluid ounces rather than 20, so dont think theyre trying to sell you short measure by using smaller pint glasses.
 Value for Money 
Im not going to attempt to make any price comparisons between British and American restaurants because there are so many variables involved. As a general rule of thumb, I would say that the average price of a meal per person in an American family restaurant is around $7 for breakfast, $10 for lunch and $15 for dinner. These are year 2000 figures and are only a guideline. Generally speaking, we considered the food on offer to be good value for money but its not any cheaper to eat out in America, contrary to what many of our English friends seem to think
Our experience is that portions of food in America can be quite large, so if your kids are picky eaters you might want to consider them sharing a meal between two. Thats if youve got co-operative kids who like the same kind of food, which we dont ! The restaurants we ate in, had no problem with bringing you an extra plate if you wanted to share food like this.
If youre visiting Las Vegas then different rules apply. Because most restaurants are attached to hotels with gambling facilities, they use the food as a loss-leader to get your into their hotel in the hope that you will then stay and play on their slot machines or go into their casino. Some places even have you playing games like Keno [American type Bingo] whilst you are eating. You will find then that eating in Las Vegas can be very cheap indeed. When we visited Vegas we made a game of trying to find the best quality meal we could for the cheapest price. $2.99 will often get you a very good, all you can eat buffet meal. A grand place for frugal Yorkshire folk to visit.
 Waitresses, Tips&amp;Ordering Food 
With very few exceptions indeed, our experience of American restaurants is that the servers are the most polite, friendly, helpful and exuberant you are ever likely to encounter. Partly this is due to the outgoing nature of Americans and the expectation of high quality service within the US restaurant sector.
The other motivating factor is that waitresses [ and waiters] incomes are often related to overall sales achieved, either individually or in teams, or by the restaurant as a whole. In addition to this, significant tips are very much the norm in America with diners usually leaving a tip which equates to 
between 10 15% of the total amount of the bill. It is therefore very much in the servers interests that you are happy with the food and the service, because the happier you are, the more likely you are to spend more money on extra food and drink and the bigger their tip will be.
All of this may sound quite cynical, but I wouldnt want to give the impression that all of the friendliness shown is false. Im sure that many of these hardworking people just genuinely enjoy their work.
The one thing you can never do with an American waitress is get in the last word. No matter how many times you say Thank you, theyll come back with Youre welcome or No, I thank you !. That conversation can go on as long as you like.
 Ordering Food 
Ordering a meal in an American restaurants is a kind of game of one-upmanship for the locals. The aim of the game is to be able to order your food without the waitress being able to come back with a question. Youll find therefore that many Americans have learned their order by heart and they rattle it off with remarkable efficiency, wasting as little eating time as possible.
As a visitor or recent immigrant however, you stand little chance of getting the upper hand. Take ordering breakfast for example. The menus are usually helpfully illustrated with pictures of the different breakfast options and they often assign them names like Country Skillet, Mega Breakfast and the like which ought to make it easy to order you would think. All you have to do is ask for the named breakfast or even point to it on the menu ? Well, not quite. Let me illustrate.
You decide to go for the Mega Breakfast featuring bacon, eggs, sausage, and buttermilk pancakes.
Your waitress then asks you :
 Would you like bacon or Canadian ham ? 
 Bacon. 
 How would you like that cooked ? 
 Crisp please. [ Thats just as well because thats about the only way bacon comes in America thin strips of streaky fat with slight traces of meat oh what wed have given for some nice, succulent middle or back rashers !]
 Would you like link sausage or patty ? [Links are sausage shaped, patties are burger shaped, in case youre in any doubt]
 Link please. 
 How would you like your eggs ? 
 What choices are there ? 
 Scrambled, boiled, poached, over easy, sunny side up. 
 Whats over easy ? 
 Thats a regular fried egg, flipped over for a few seconds in the pan before serving. 
 Ill take my eggs over easy. [You think you sound just like an American now]
 Would you like hash browns or country fried potatoes ? [ Hash Browns are generally crispy fried shredded potato Country Fried are often diced potatoes fried, maybe with onions and peppers]
 Ill take the hash browns. [ Getting bolder now but no idea what you just ordered]
 Shall I get you some syrup for your pancakes ? 
 What kind of syrup ? 
 We have maple, wild blueberry, whole blackberry or raspberry. 
 Err..maple please. 
 That breakfast comes with a choice of toast, waffles or English muffin ? [ Dont be fooled by the English muffin itll be like no muffin you ever experienced in England]
 Ill take the toast please. [ You think you took the easy option]
 What kind of toast ? 
 What kinds are there ? 
 We have white bread, whole-wheat, rye or sourdough. 
 Whole-wheat please. [ You go for some healthy bread to accompany this cholesterol loaded feast]
 Would you like some jelly with your toast ? 
 Errrno I dont think so [ She was talking about jam of course, but you didnt realise and the thought of jelly with your breakfast didnt sound too appetising]
[At which point having got one order she turns to your wife]
 Yes, maam what can I get for you ? [ The whole thing starts again]
By the time four of you have ordered breakfast, youll have worked up one hell of an appetite let me tell you.
Whilst on the subject of ordering, there are likely to be occasions where you want to order menu items but you would prefer them to leave something off. For example, if you would prefer your sandwich without mayonnaise then the accepted way to get the message across would be to say
Ill take a chicken club sandwich, but could you hold the mayo . It may sound a little odd but it gets the message across in a manner they understand.
 The Box 
Bearing in mind the large portions and the fact that whatever you order always seems to have some accompanying side dish, such as salads which look like a meal on their own, or slices of garlic toast or a bowl of sliced fruit, you may find it difficult to finish what you started.
If you have left over food on your plate at the end of your meal, be prepared for the question from the waitress Would you like a box for that ? A box is usually a polystyrene food container, being what we would refer to as a doggy bag.
Americans take the view that you have paid for the food so its perfectly acceptable to ask for it to be boxed up for you to take it home to eat later. Its not something we did very often, but many Americans do. The reason we didnt do it often was nothing to do with the embarrassment that many British people feel in taking home food from restaurants, but rather that when we did opt for the box, we would never get around to eating it and it would just sit there, taking up space in the refrigerator.
Whilst it may seem like a good idea at the time to take home the remainder of your seafood risotto, the reality is that having eaten risotto for lunch, you probably wont then want to eat it at tea time. So it would get left for supper, but at supper time you may well not be hungry, having eaten out at lunch. By the next day the prospect of using up the risotto starts to become rather less appealing. Restaurant food is great when its freshly cooked, but rather loses something when its been congealing in the fridge for a day or two.
But having taken the trouble to bring it home you dont want to throw it away, so it sits there in the fridge. The days go by. Every time you go in the fridge its there in the box saying Are you going to eat me or not ? and the smell of the seafood is beginning to pervade everything else. You hope your wife will eat it. Shes hoping you will. The kids definitely wont eat it, but they wish one of you would as the smells very off-putting when they go in for the milk. You wish you had a dog. By the end of the week you decide that, much as it pains you and your waste not principles, its no longer fit for consumption, even by a dog if you had one. So in the bin it goes.
Take my advice. If they ask you if you want a box, say no and deal with the guilt there and then.
 Strange Food Terminology 
If in doubt about a menu item, its better to ask than assume. I remember one occasion when my sister came to visit us in California and she ordered chicken fried steak which she expected to be chicken, but which actually turned out to be steak, fried like chicken in breadcrumbs. You live and learn.
There are many different terms for food in America some of which , such as Melts or Club Sandwiches, have come into regular usage in Britain as many American restaurant chains have opened up on our shores and some of our own restaurants and cafs have sought to Americanise their menus.
There are though some things on American menus which may look familiar, but are not quite what they seem. Weve covered the chips and fries, jelly and jam issues, but you may be perplexed or revolted, to see breakfast menus including Biscuits&amp;Gravy. This is one that I never felt motivated to try, but its not quite as disgusting as it first appears. Biscuits can vary somewhat depending on local recipes but they are a kind of cross between a bread bun and a scone.
Biscuits and gravy is a real cowboys breakfast, although you will find variations on the theme served in many restaurants around the USA. The biscuits are usually a basic flour and baking powder dough, baked so that the outside is brown and crisp, and the inside is soft. There are numerous recipes for the gravy, [but not Bisto] some of which are made with whole or evaporated milk. So if youve a fancy for doughy bread and white coloured gravy, youre welcome to give the cowboy style breakfast a try.
On the subject of cowboy food, you may also come across Beef Jerky and wonder what the hell that is. I didnt see it often in restaurants but it was for sale in the supermarkets. Basically it is thin strips of beef which have been soaked in brine, seasoned and left to dry for days. I believe people eat it cold as a snack or use it to cook with, crumbling it to form the basis for a meaty gravy. If you find yourself being cajoled into trying some cowboy familys home made jerky, Id suggest that you ask them where they hung the jerky out to dry, as that might just colour your judgement on whether you want to give it a go.
Cornbread or corn muffins are another regular breakfast add on, or side dish. Usually served warm from the oven with butter, I quite liked the golden coloured corn muffins, which were more like an English cake than anything else I ate in America purporting to be cake. It did feel odd though to be eating a sweet cake amongst my bacon and eggs. As I explained already, Americans are quite happy to eat their pancakes and syrup on the same plate as their fry up, but I had to separate the two parts of the meal along the lines of a savoury and sweet course.
Grits is another menu item that you dont hear too much of in Britain. Grits are made from the milling of corn kernels. After cleaning and processing, the kernels are rolled and the large-size granules are the grits; the smaller ones becoming cornmeal and corn flour. Grits are eaten in a variety of forms and rather remind me of porridge, for which reason alone I never felt motivated to try them.
French toast also appears on many breakfast specials and is bread dipped in egg mixture and usually fried. Although this is a firm favourite with my family, American restaurants normally serve it with a dusting of powdered sugar. If, as we do, you prefer it plain, then ask them as you order.
If youve always wondered what the Carpenters were blathering about when they were sang of Jambalaya and Fil Gumbo you are about to be moderately enlightened. These are both dishes associated with the Cajun area of Louisiana and are firm favourites in most of the Southern States. There are many different recipes but Jambalaya is essentially a rice based dish, where the rice is cooked in a seasoned and spiced stock containing seafood, chicken, game or sausage or maybe all of these.
A Gumbo is a cross between a soup and a stew and uses similar ingredients such as chicken, shrimps, sausage, ham, onions and peppers, but without the rice. The ingredients are cooked in a stock and usually mixed with a roux, made from flour and cooked in fat until it is dark brown. To call it a soup would be a bit of an insult as its much more of a meal than that.
Family Restaurants [ Casual Dining]
Having given you an inkling as to how they operate, heres some more information on a selection of some of the larger family restaurant chains which we frequented during our time in California.
 Red Robin 
Always top of our list of favourite family eating places, Red Robin specialises in Gourmet Burgers which sounds rather an oxymoron, but in fact they are, in our opinion, the best burgers we have come across. Theres a long and varied list of different burger options, as well as other sandwiches, salads, soups, seafood and pasta dishes .
Their burger meals come with their trademark chunky steak fries which they will continue to top up, free of charge, as long as you can eat them. Personally, after having one of their monster size burgers and a basketful of thick fries, I never felt like asking for an extra serving of fries but if you have a bottomless pit of an appetite and an unhealthy liking for fried potatoes, youll get good value here.
Another nice touch about Red Robin is that, in common with many American restaurants they provide unlimited free top ups of soft drinks and coffee. Sadly the free top ups didnt apply to my beer. Our local Red Robin had a pretty good range of beers [ for an American restaurant, that is ] and they also specialise in exotic Del Boy style alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails.
Red Robin began life in 1969 in Seattle, Washington and now has around 180 locations in 16 states of the USA and Canada. At present most of the restaurants are in Western states, with only one outlet in Florida, but I feel sure that the chain will continue to grow. We always find Red Robin a fun place to visit as they seem to place a lot of emphasis on their staff being bright and cheerful, if not even a little manic, which is right up our street.
Its a popular place too for kids birthday parties. After serving everyone in the birthday party with their meal, a group of the serving staff parade out with the birthday cake bedecked with sparkling candles, and gather round the table to sing their own barmy version of Happy Birthday. Not for those who are easily embarrassed.
 CoCos 
Nothing to do with the clown, CoCos is a Bakery&amp;Restaurant as they specialise in their own baked fruit pie desserts, which you can either have as part of your meal or buy to take home. If youre looking for a recommendation on the pie front, Key Lime Pie was always my favourite.
CoCos was one of our regular haunts and is good for breakfast, lunch or dinner with a fairly broad range of items on their menu. The group began as a single snack shop in the seaside town of Corona Del Mar in California in 1948 and now has over 180 locations in California, Arizona, Indiana, Missouri and Washington states.
 Dennys 
Dennys is another firm family favourite of ours, along the same line as CoCos, serving breakfasts, lunches and dinners. This is yet another restaurant chain that began in California. What started as Dannys Donuts in 1953 in Lakewood has now grown into the largest family restaurant chain in America with over 1800 outlets across the country.
 IHOP [International House of Pancakes] 
As the name rather implies, this particular outfit specialises in pancakes, be they savoury or sweet. There is a great range of options to choose from and they provide a welcome change from the usual family restaurant menu choices.
As well as the pancake specialities, they do also provide most of the regular breakfast, lunch and dinner options.
IHOP have nearly 1000 locations in 41 states of the USA and Canada. You will perhaps not be surprised to learn that IHOP began in 1958 in California.
 Rubys 
If youre looking for a fairly authentic American Diner then Rubys is for you. The first Rubys was opened in 1982 as a 1940s style diner at Balboa Pier, Newport Beach, California taking its name from the mother of one of the owners.
Rubys restaurants typically have traditional bright red vinyl booth seats, white formica tables, soda fountains and colourful 1940s poster art. Im not sure how many locations they have but they are mainly located in West coast states.
Their menu has developed from the traditional diner fare of hot dogs, hamburgers and melts to include breakfasts, salads, sandwiches, lunches and dinners.
I used to enjoy going to Rubys for a change of scenery, though my wife reckoned that had something to do with the rather short and skimpy red striped uniforms worn by the waitresses, which of course is complete nonsense. I hardly noticed them at all.
 Mimis 
Another restaurant providing good quality breakfast, lunch and dinners options, Mimis is themed on a French, New Orleans style dcor which gives it a bit more of a European restaurant atmosphere. Their menu options are also a little more varied than some of the regular family restaurants, although I wouldnt want to give you the impression that its a French menu. We always enjoyed visits there.
Their first restaurant opened in West Hollywood in 1974 and they now have about 40 locations throughout California. There are also a few other Mimis currently in Arizona, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Nevada. I believe that they are looking to expand further.
 Benihana 
Although Im not a fan of Japanese or Chinese food, my wife is, and one of her favourite restaurants is Benihana. They specialise in Teppanyaki and Sushi style menus, both of which are extremely popular across America and in California particularly. If you do go there, dont ask to speak to Beni. Benihana is, I believe, named after a Japanese red flower.
Rocky Aoki opened the first Benihana restaurant in New York in 1964 mixing cooking with entertainment by having the chefs cook the food to order at the guests tables. Diners get to enjoy watching the skills of the chefs chopping and flipping the food, as well as eating the end product.
Sushi is a very popular food choice in California and if youve never tried it but you like Asian food, you are pretty sure to enjoy the experience. Sushi comprises a range of ingredients often involving some form of seafood and seasoned rice, wrapped in seaweed. The Japanese eat sushi with their fingers although many Americans prefer to make it more difficult by using chopsticks. The sushi rolls are dipped into pickled ginger and wasib, which is Japanese horseradish powder, then into soy sauce and are eaten in one or two bites. I understand its bad form to put a half eaten sushi back on the plate, so be warned.
Benihana is probably the leading Asian restaurant chain across the USA with about 70 locations. As well as traditional Japanese fare, they also serve steak, poultry, sea food and vegetable entrees.
 Steak Restaurants 
Believe it or not, we never got around to visiting a steak restaurant, mainly because as a family we dont really like steak, which is as good a reason as youre likely to find. Its not that were healthy eaters, nor that we were worried about BSE as America was free of wobbly cow syndrome. I think were just too lazy to chew the meat.
Nevertheless, if you are a steak fan theres no better place for you than the USA. Some of the largest operators in that market are Sizzlers, which is a worldwide organisation , Golden Corral with 465 restaurants in the USA and Western Sizzlin with 265 American outlets. These restaurants dont only serve steaks of course, but thats their forte. Mooo.
 The Final Word 
That, ladies and gents, concludes my brief guide to eating out in America. I hope that some of the foregoing will have been of interest to you if you intend to visit America. The USA truly is a country where eating out is the norm and cooking in the home is generally a bind.
As Cyra Mc Fadden confesses on behalf of the nation I no longer prepare food or drink with more than one ingredient .
