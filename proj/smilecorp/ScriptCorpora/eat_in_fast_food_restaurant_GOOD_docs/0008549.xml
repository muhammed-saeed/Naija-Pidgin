 Don’t Shoot—It Will Cost You 
 Posted on October 24, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 An Intentional Act Is Not an“Accident” 

 Lawyers for policyholders are creative people. Even when the clear and unambiguous language of an insurance policy eliminates coverage a lawyer will bring suit against the insurer seeking coverage that should not exist. In Home-Owners Insurance Company v. Elias Chammas, Chammas, Inc. D/B/A Paradise Mini Mart, and Corey , No. 299412 (Mich.App. 10/18/2011) a person who was shot twice sued for his injuries and the shooter and his employer sought defense and indemnity from its insurer to the suit brought by the person shot. The trial court refused summary judgment for the insurer and Home-Owners Insurance Company (“HOIC”) appealed the trial court’s order denying plaintiff’s motion for summary disposition.

 FACTS 

This case arose out of an altercation that occurred at the Paradise Mini-Mart in Flint, Michigan. Elias Chammas, the owner and operator of the Paradise Mini Mart, refused to serve Christopher Jones after noticing on surveillance footage that an individual who had entered the store with Jones earlier that evening had stolen a case of beer. Jones returned to his apartment and informed his brother, Corey Parks, that Chammas had kicked him out of the store and called him a racial slur. Parks, who had consumed several beers, went to the Paradise Mini Mart to confront Chammas. Parks and Chammas engaged in a heated verbal confrontation.

 Parks left the store and lingered outside as Chammas observed him on a security camera. Parks kicked over some milk crates outside the store and threw one in the direction of Chammas’s car. Chammas walked outside toward the parking lot, where security camera footage shows him pulling out a handgun and firing two shots. Both shots hit Parks, the first shattering Parks’s femur just above the knee and the second getting lodged in his wallet. Some evidence indicated that the second bullet might have hit Parks on a ricochet. Chammas maintained that he did not intend to shoot Parks, but only wanted to get him off the property.

In separate a criminal action, Chammas pleaded guilty to careless, reckless, or negligent use of a firearm resulting in death or injury to a person. Parks filed a civil suit against Chammas and Chammas, Inc. HOIC, as insurer for both Chammas individually and Chammas, Inc., moved for summary disposition arguing that plaintiff had no duty to defend or indemnify the insured parties. Plaintiff asserted that no issue of material fact existed regarding whether the shooting was a covered“occurrence”under the language of the insurance policy, nor was there any issue of material fact regarding whether the injury was“expected or intended”under the language of the policy. 

On June 28, 2010, the trial court held a hearing on plaintiff’s motion for summary disposition. The trial court found in favor of Chammas, holding that an issue of material fact existed regarding whether Chammas intended to harm Parks. The trial court entered an order denying plaintiff’s motion for summary disposition on July 12, 2010.

First, plaintiff alleges that the shooting of Parks was not an“occurrence”under the language of the policy, and therefore is excluded from coverage.

 ANALYSIS 

When the language of an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous on its face courts must apply the terms as written. Section I, 1b(1) of the insurance policy reads as follows:
 
 b. This insurance policy applies to“bodily injury”and“property damage”only if: 

 (1) The“bodily injury”or“property damage”is caused by an“occurrence”that takes place in the“coverage territory”… 
 
The policy defines an“occurrence”as an“accident,”but the term“accident”is not further defined.

The Michigan Supreme Court has held that when an insured’s intentional actions create a direct risk of harm, there can be no liability coverage for any resulting damage or injury despite the lack of an actual intent to damage or injure. Therefore, even in the absence of intent to cause bodily injury, an injury cannot be deemed to be caused by an accident if the insured’s intentional acts created a direct risk of harm.

The Michigan Court of Appeal, conclude that since there was no question that Chammas intentionally fired two shots in Parks’s directio n, hitting him twice and causing bodily injury and fired both shots intentionally that clearly created a direct risk of harm or bodily injury, the shooting cannot be deemed an“accident.”Even if Chammas could establish a lack of subjective intent to cause injury at trial, because the shooting is not an“accident”under the language of the policy, it cannot be deemed an“occurrence,”and is not covered by the policy.

HOIC also argued in the alternative that coverage is excluded under the“Expected or Intended Injury”exclusion of the policy. Because the court resolved the issue that the claim against Chammas individually did not arise from an“occurrence,”the Court of Appeal concluded it  need not decide the“Expected or Intended Injury”exclusion to the policy.

Because the bodily injury in this case was not the result of an“occurrence”as defined by the unambiguous language of the insurance policy at issue, the trial court erred in finding the existence of an issue of material fact.

The court sent the case back to the trial court to make findings concerning the corporate defendant. 

 LESSON 

In Michigan an “accident” or an “occurrence” must be fortuitous and the subjective intent of the insured to not cause harm is irrelevant if the intentional actions of the insured created a direct risk of harm and eventually causes harm it is not an accident and there can be no coverage.  Not all states will agree but one must wonder why someone shooting a person in the back twice for kicking a few milk crates is the type of accident or fortuitous act that insurance is designed to protect against.

 Stupid Facts Make For Interesting Law 
 Posted on October 21, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance is a Contract of Personal Indemnity 

 Insurance policies do not insure property. Insurance policies do not insure cars. Insurance policies, much to the surprise of the uninitiated, insures people against certain risks of loss specified in a policy. Therefore, if a person has an automobile insurance policy that insures under the Michigan no-fault statutes, the policy insures the person not the car identified in the policy.

Two insurance companies in Michigan were faced with a truly unusual and essentially stupid set of facts that caused them to argue which, if any, insurer owed no-fault benefits to an injured driver. In Citizens Insurance Company of America v. Genevieve Schumacher and Michelle Estelle Ramirez , No. 299549 (Mich.App. 10/18/2011) Secura Insurance appealed the trial court’s grant of summary disposition to Citizens Insurance Company of America.

 FACTS 

The facts started out in a usual fashion when, on October 26, 2005, Timothy Johnson sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Johnson was driving a 1993 Cadillac Seville with the permission of Genevieve Schumacher. Schumacher was at work at the time, and Johnson was driving the Cadillac to an auto shop so that a mechanic could look at the car’s transmission.

There should have been no problem in getting no-fault benefits to Mr. Johnson except for a dispute over who was the owner of the Cadillac when the accident occurred. The car was registered to Schumacher with the Secretary of State’s Office and hers is the only name on the title. However, Schumacher testified that, in September 2005, she sold the Cadillac to her daughter’s boyfriend, Jeremy Qualls, and she cancelled the insurance coverage on the vehicle that she had through Secura Insurance. Schumacher also owned a Buick LeSabre that was insured by Secura and that was in full force and effect at the time of Johnson’s accident.

When Schumacher purportedly sold the Cadillac to Qualls she signed the title assignment section on the back of the vehicle title and she printed her address, a selling price of $1, and the date of September 14, 2005. Schumacher gave the title to Qualls, though she did not write his name or address on the title as the purchaser of the vehicle, she did not disclose the odometer reading, and she did not remove her license plate from the car.

It is undisputed that Qualls never paid Schumacher any money for the Cadillac, he never signed the title as the purchaser, he never transferred the title to himself at a Secretary of State’s Office, and he never insured the vehicle.

Schumacher testified that, when she sold the Cadillac to Qualls, her daughter Michelle Ramirez was in jail. When Ramirez was released, she and Qualls ended their romantic relationship. At around that time, Ramirez learned that Qualls never transferred the vehicle title to himself. On the basis of that information, Schumacher instructed Ramirez to“get the car”back. The record reflects that Qualls did not challenge Schumacher’s right to take back the car. Indeed, he denies that he ever agreed to buy the Cadillac from Schumacher and he testified that Schumacher merely let him use the car while he was dating Ramirez. In any case, Qualls told Ramirez he would leave the vehicle in his driveway with the keys inside. Ramirez picked up the car and the keys and title were inside. At the time, the car’s transmission was slipping and the heating system was blowing cold air. Schumacher testified that she intended to pay for repairs to the Cadillac and drive the car herself. A couple of days after Ramirez retrieved the Cadillac from Qualls, Johnson was driving it to the mechanic and was involved in the auto accident. Schumacher testified that she intended to insure the Cadillac, but she had not done so by the time the accident occurred.

Johnson sought no-fault benefits from Secura, but, because Schumacher cancelled coverage on the Cadillac in September, Secura denied his claim. Johnson had no other insurance coverage, so he filed a claim with the Assigned Claims Facility, which assigned the claim to Citizens. Thereafter, Citizens paid no-fault benefits to Johnson.

Citizens then filed this action against Secura, Schumacher, and Ramirez. With regard to Secura, Citizens argued that Secura is the higher priority insurer and that it must reimburse Citizens for the no-fault benefits paid to Johnson. The trial court ultimately agreed and granted summary disposition to Citizens. 


 ANALYSIS 

The no-fault act states that“[t]he owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state shall maintain security for payment of benefits under personal protection insurance, property protection insurance, and residual liability insurance.”The act further provides that“an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, subject to the provisions of this chapter.”

Under the no-fault act, the Assigned Claims Facility represents the insurer of last priority. The  person injured may make a claim to the assigned claims facility if no personal protection insurance is applicable to the injury, no personal protection insurance applicable to the injury can be identified, the personal protection insurance applicable to the injury cannot be ascertained because of a dispute between 2 or more automobile insurers concerning their obligation to provide coverage or the equitable distribution of the loss.

If, as here, the injured person has no insurance coverage, he may then seek benefits from the insurer of his spouse or, if his spouse is not insured, to the insurer of a relative who lives at the same residence.  It is undisputed that Johnson did not have auto insurance and that he had no other coverage available under the statute. The statute provides, in part:
 
 [A] person suffering accidental bodily injury arising from a motor vehicle accident while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority: 

 (a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied. 

 (b) The insurer of the operator of the vehicle occupied. 
 
 On the basis of the plain language of the statute if Schumacher was the owner or registrant of the 1993 Cadillac, Johnson was entitled to recover no-fault benefits first from Schumacher’s insurer regardless of the fact that the car involved is not identified on the policy. It was undisputed that Schumacher cancelled the Secura policy on the Cadillac before Johnson’s car accident. However because Schumacher owned the Cadillac and because she maintained a Secura policy on her Buick LeSabre, Secura is the“insurer”of Schumacher as the owner or registrant of the Cadillac.

Pursuant to the plain language of the statute, all that is required for an insurer to be first in priority to pay no-fault benefits is to insure“the owner or registrant of the motor vehicle involved in the accident.”The statute does not require that the vehicle be insured since the Legislature understood that insurance is a contract of personal indemnity.

Because Qualls was never listed as the purchaser of the vehicle in the initial transaction, and because he did not sign the title as the purchaser, the title continued to show Schumacher as the registered owner of the vehicle, which reflected the intent of the parties when Schumacher regained possession.

While the unusual facts in this case and certain technical failures by Schumacher and Qualls make it difficult to assign liability for no-fault benefits, all of the testifying witnesses agree that it was everyone’s intent and understanding that Schumacher regained ownership of the vehicle just before the accident occurred and that her ownership continued through the time the accident occurred. Schumacher, was the“owner”of the motor vehicle had actual possession of the vehicle, the title was in her name, the car remained officially registered with the Secretary of State in her name and, as compared to Qualls, she had the exclusive use and custody of the vehicle.

Regardless of the failure of Schumacher and Qualls to fulfill the requirements of a change of title there is no question that the vehicle at the time of the accident was owned by Schumacher. Because Secura covered Schumacher Secura was the priority insurer for purposes of Johnson’s injuries and the trial court correctly granted summary disposition to Citizens.

 ZALMA OPINION 

Auto insurers who insured people in Michigan under the no-fault law should make clear that the policy insures the “insured” against the risks of loss imposed by the no fault law for all vehicles owned by the insured, without limitation. Prudent underwriting requires that the insurer obtain information about all of the vehicles owned, all vehicles where the “insured” is registered with the state as owner of the vehicle, or operates a vehicle not owned or registered to the “insured” and base premium effectively. This will required a more detailed application than the standard ACORD application form.

 NO ERISA PREEMPTION FOR UNFAIR INSURANCE PRACTICES 
 Posted on October 20, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 ERISA Preemption in Montana 

 In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court decided Pilot Life Insurance Co. V. Dedeaux , 107 S. Ct. 1549, 481 U.S. 41 (U.S. 04/06/1987) that held that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 1001 et seq preempted the plaintiff’s state common law claims because the conflicted with the federal statute. It also concluded that the claims against an insurer operating an ERISA plan are  not rescued by the savings clause in the ERISA statutes. In so doing Pilot Life destroyed many bad faith claims brought against insurers who wrote programs within the ambit of ERISA.

Before Pilot Life the denial of a claim under an ERISA program would result in a suit in state court seeking damages for unfair insurance practices and for the tort of bad faith thereby giving each plaintiff the opportunity to collect the benefits of the insurance policy and punitive and exemplary damages. The U.S. Supreme Court, noting that the ERISA statute only allowed for suits for contract damages, the federal government preempted the state causes of action and gave the insurers an absolute defense to each ERISA based bad faith suit.

 ERISA PLAN AND INSURANCE 

The Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, sometimes known as the “Circuit of Reversal” decided that although there is an ERISA preemption involved in a suit against Blue Cross and Blue Shield, it’s claim for unfair insurance practices fell within an exception to ERISA preemption.

Every plaintiffs’ lawyer in the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction should cheer because their practice may soon increase logarithmically.

 THE LITIGATION 

 In Dale Fossen; D and M Fossen v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of, No. 10-36001 (9th Cir. 10/18/2011) the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals was asked to resolve whether a provision of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), preempts Montana’s“little HIPAA”law, Mont. Code Ann. § 33-22-526(2)(a), for purposes of both conferring federal subject matter jurisdiction and defeating state-law causes of action on the merits. The federal and state HIPAA provisions at issue prohibit certain health insurers from charging different premiums to“similarly situated”participants on account of a participant’s“health status-related factor”and whether, even if preempted, a suit for breach of a fair claims handling statute the plaintiffs may sue their insurer for damages.

 BACKGROUND 

Plaintiffs-Appellants (collectively, Fossens) are three brothers, Dale, Larry, and Marlowe Fossen, their three corporations (which they jointly own with their spouses), and Fossen Brothers Farms (a partnership of the three corporations). In 2004, Fossen Brothers Farms applied to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana (Blue Cross) to obtain health insurance coverage for the Fossen Brothers Farms’s three employees. 

From 2004 through May 2009, Blue Cross provided coverage to Fossen Brothers Farms through the Associated Merchandisers Inc., Health First Plan (Associated Merchandisers Plan), and from June 2009 through the time this lawsuit was filed, Blue Cross provided coverage through the Montana Chamber Choices Group Benefit Plan (Chamber Choices Plan).

In 2006, Blue Cross informed the Fossens that their premium was increasing by over 20%. The Fossens learned that Blue Cross was imposing different increases (and even decreases in some cases) on other plan members. After the Fossens complained to the Montana Insurance Commissioner, Blue Cross reduced the proposed increase to 4%. For the 2008 plan year, however, Blue Cross increased the Fossens’premiums over 40%. The Fossens complained again to the insurance commissioner, but apparently to no avail. They then filed a lawsuit in state court in September 2009.

The Fossens’complaint asserted three substantive causes of action. First, they alleged that Blue Cross’s 40% premium increase violated a provision of Montana’s“little HIPAA”statute that prohibits“group health plan[s]”(and insurers offering coverage through group health plans) from imposing a“premium or contribution that is greater than the premium or contribution for a similarly situated individual”on account of“any health status-related factor of the individual . . . .”Second, the Fossens asserted that Blue Cross’s premium increase violated a provision of Montana’s Unfair Trade Practices Act. Third, the Fossens claimed that the premium increase constituted a breach of their contract with Blue Cross, which allegedly incorporated by reference both the Montana HIPAA provision and the unfair practices provision.

 The complaint sought two forms of relief-declaratory relief that Blue Cross violated the law and restitutionary relief through a return of overcharged premiums-and sought certification as a class action.

Blue Cross timely removed the complaint to federal court, asserting that the Fossens’little HIPAA claim was completely preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) Federal HIPAA, which is part of ERISA (as amended), contains a provision similar to the Montana HIPAA statute raised in the complaint. Blue Cross argued that ERISA’s“complete preemption”doctrine conferred federal jurisdiction over the Fossens’nominal state-law claims. The district court agreed with Blue Cross, and denied the Fossens’motion to remand. The court then granted Blue Cross’s motion for summary judgment. The court noted that all of the Fossens’claims were premised on an underlying violation of federal HIPAA, and, finding no violation of that statute, the court held that the Fossens’claims failed as a matter of law.

 DISCUSSION OF PREEMPTION 

There are two strands of ERISA preemption: (1)‘express’preemption under ERISA § 514(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a); and (2) preemption due to a‘conflict’with ERISA’s exclusive remedial scheme set forth in [ERISA § 502(a),] 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a).  HIPAA contains an additional express preemption provision relevant to this case. All of these preemption provisions defeat state-law causes of action on the merits. State-law claims may be removed to federal court if the“complete preemption”doctrine applies.

The Ninth Circuit created a two-part test for determining whether a state-law claim is completely preempted by ERISA § 502(a) that establishes a state-law cause of action is completely preempted if:

 an individual, at some point in time, could have brought the claim under ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B), and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant’s actions. 

Express preemption under ERISA § 514 is also governed in relevant part by a two-prong test. ERISA broadly preempts“any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any [covered] employee benefit plan . . . .”But this broad preemption provision is tempered by a savings clause in § 514(b), which spares“any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.”To fall under this savings clause, a regulation must satisfy another two-part test:

 The state law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance. It must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured. 

In addition to these generally applicable preemption provisions, ERISA also contains a HIPAA-specific preemption clause. Under that clause, federal HIPAA does not“supersede any provision of State law which establishes, implements, or continues in effect any standard or require-ment solely relating to health insurance issuers in connection with group health insurance coverage except to the extent that such standard or requirement prevents the application of a requirement of federal HIPAA. The provision’s plain terms appear to permit state laws that are, generally speaking, more favorable to the insured.

The Fossens could have brought suit under HIPAA. They are suing for restitution of premiums they allegedly overpaid in violation of Montana’s HIPAA statute. As the district court correctly recognized, the Fossens’claim under Montana HIPAA could also have been brought under federal HIPAA, because the relevant state and federal HIPAA provisions are identical.  The individual Fossens are the participants in the ERISA plan, and they are suing Blue Cross (the plan’s third-party insurance company) to enforce rights that are provided by ERISA.

Because the Fossens could have brought their claim under ERISA § 502(a) the Fossens’state-law HIPAA claim is identical to the federal-law HIPAA claim they could have filed. The state-law claim, although purportedly separate and distinct from ERISA,“falls squarely within the ambit”of federal HIPAA. The Fossens’state-law HIPAA claim exists only because of Blue Shield’s administration of ERISA-regulated benefit plans.

Because the Fossens’state HIPAA cause of action could have been brought under ERISA § 502(a), and because that cause of action is identical to and expressly dependent upon ERISA, the district court properly denied the Fossens’motion to remand and exercised jurisdiction over this case.

Because the Fossens’state-law HIPAA claim is conflict-preempted by § 502(a), it fails on the merits. Because the Fossens never requested that the district court recharacterize their state-law claim in this manner, the court need not have taken this extra step; it simply could have granted summary judgment for Blue Cross on account of § 502(a) conflict preemption. 

 UNFAIR INSURANCE PRACTICES 

The Fossens contest the district court’s grant of summary judgment on their statutory unfair insurance practices claim.

To determine whether the Fossens’state-law unfair insurance practices claim is preempted by ERISA on the merits, we must consider express preemption under ERISA § 514 and conflict preemption under ERISA § 502(a).

The statute is plainly directed at insurance companies because it regulates insurance rates and premiums, and, in fact, the statute appears in a section of the Montana Code entitled“Insurer’s Relations with Insured and Claimant”. Moreover, the statute affects the risk-pooling arrangement because it regulates insurers’ability to obtain a premium that accurately reflects the risk being insured.

With respect to conflict preemption, the unfair insurance practices statute does not run afoul of § 502(a) because the Fossens seek relief (restitution) that is consistent with ERISA’s enforcement scheme

Unlike the state-law HIPAA claim, the unfair insurance practices statute applies without regard to the existence of an ERISA plan. Also, the unfair insurance practices statute creates a right that is separate from and could not possibly be remedied under ERISA. Whereas HIPAA (both the state and federal versions) prohibits plans and their insurers from charging different premiums on account of“health status-related factor[s],”the unfair insurance practices statute applies more broadly to bar“any unfair discrimination”with respect to premiums.

Because these statutes are not identical in scope (as is the case with the state and federal HIPAA provisions), they are not conflict preempted.

 CONCLUSION 

The district court properly exercised jurisdiction over this matter because the Fossens’Montana HIPAA claim is completely preempted by ERISA § 502(a). The Ninth Circuit reversed with regard to the unfair insurance practices claim and remanded the case to the district court so that the district court may address the state unfair insurance practices claim in the first instance.

 ZALMA OPINION 

 State statutes mandating fair claims handling are designed to be enforced by the state departments of insurance.  When a fair claims practices statute is allowed to create a private right of action it is subject to abuse. In California the Supreme Court’s decision in Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1979) 23 Cal. 3d 880 [153 Cal. Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329] that allowed such a private right of action resulted in abuse by litigants sufficiently that the Supreme Court, less than ten years later, reversed itself by Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Companies, 46 Cal. 3d 287, 758 P.2d 58, 250 Cal. Rptr. 116 (Cal. 08/18/1988) that held that California’s Unfair Claims Statute does not allow a private right of action.

The Ninth Circuit seems to believe that Montana’s statute allows for a private right of action so that even though the plaintiffs’ suit was barred by preemption it allows them to go forward with the unfair insurance practices action. They should reconsider, read Moradi-Shalal and determine that there is no private right of action and that ERISA preempts the suit.

Although the Ninth Circuit noted the existence of the Pilot Life case it found the unfair insurance practices action to be exempted from the ERISA preemption. Hopefully the Supreme Court will take the case and reverse or Montana will make clear by statute that its Unfair Insurance Practices statute does not provide a  private right of action.

 APPRAISAL IS MANDATORY IN AN INSURANCE DISPUTE 
 Posted on October 19, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Appraisal Must Establish Loss Before Suit Against Insurer May Proceed 

 Since the first standard fire insurance policy was mandated in New York in the 19th Century insurers and insureds who disputed the amount of loss had available the appraisal process where a panel of three appraisers (limited arbitrators) to establish the amount of loss. Today appraisal clauses are uniformly included in most forms of property insurance policies. Virtually every property insurance policy for both homeowners and corporations contains a provision specifying “appraisal” as a means of resolving disputes about the “amount of loss” for a covered claim. The appraisers make no decisions with regard to coverage but only to the quantum of the loss.

A Standard Fire Insurance Policy provides: 
 
 In case the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss, then, on the written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of such demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; and failing for 15 days to agree upon such umpire, then, on request of the insured or this company, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property covered is located. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item; and failing to agree, shall submit their differences, only, to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed with this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss. Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally. 
 
Lawyers don’t like appraisals because they can limit the amount of loss and are usually decided by a panel of appraisers who are not trained in the law. They will try to avoid appraisal by arguing waiver or some other action by the insurer. Texas insureds, like those in every state in the United States, acquire property insurance policies with an appraisal clause almost identical to the provision in the  19th Century New York Standard Fire Policy. The Texas Court of Appeal was called upon to resolve a dispute over the right to appraisal in a case called In Re Certain Underwriters At Lloyd’s , No. 10-11-00263-CV (Tex.App. Dist.10 10/12/2011) after a hurricane damaged plaintiffs’ property. 

 Factual Background 

 The case involves an insurance claim made by the Andersons with regard to their house located in New Waverly, Texas, which was damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008. The Andersons alleged that the roof of their house sustained extensive damage and that water damaged the ceilings, walls, insulation, and flooring of the house. The Andersons further alleged that, immediately after the storm, they filed a claim with Lloyd’s, their insurance company. Thereafter, Lloyd’s sent an adjustor to the Andersons’home to inspect the damage. The Andersons note that the adjustor only spent ten to fifteen minutes at the house and did not get on the roof.

Upset by what they perceived as an inadequate inspection, the Andersons called Lloyd’s and requested that a different adjuster inspect the property. The Andersons’property was re-inspected, and the second adjustor’s inspection resulted in the insurer’s conclusion that the extent of the damage to the property did not exceed the $750 deductible associated with the homeowner’s policy covering the house.

Lloyd’s denied the claim and in a letter dated December 5, 2008, Lloyd’s told the Andersons: “If you disagree with or have a question about the enclosed property damage estimate, please call Quality Claims Service. Should you have any questions concerning the above, or if you have any additional information that would help Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s re-evaluate your claim, please do not hesitate to call.” 

In response to Lloyd’s’s December 5, 2008 letter, the Andersons repeatedly called to complain about the adjuster’s poor investigation of their damages and their disagreement with Lloyd’s’estimate of the claim and eventually filed suit.

 The Litigation 

In their lawsuit, which was filed on August 25, 2010, the Andersons asserted causes of action against Lloyd’s for: (1) violations of the insurance code, including unfair settlement practices and the failure to promptly pay claims; (2) fraud; (3) conspiracy to commit fraud; (4) breach of contract; and (5) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. In their original answer and in a separate motion to compel, Lloyd’s requested that the proceedings be abated and that the matter be sent to appraisal, as allowed by the underlying homeowner’s insurance policy.

On November 8, 2010, the trial court denied Lloyd’s’s appraisal request. 

 The Request for a Writ of Mandate 

 Lloyd’s asked the Court of Appeal to issue a writ of mandate compelling that the appraisal go forward. Accompanying its mandamus petition was an emergency motion to stay the trial court proceedings. Upon receiving the filings, the Court of Appeal granted Lloyd’s’emergency motion to stay the trial court proceedings and requested a response. The Andersons filed a response to Lloyd’s’ petition on September 2, 2011.

Today, mandamus review of significant rulings in exceptional cases may be essential to preserve important substantive and procedural rights from impairment or loss, allow the appellate courts to give needed and helpful direction to the law that would otherwise prove elusive in appeals from final judgments. Mandamus can spare private parties and the public the time and money utterly wasted in unnecessary litigation.

Appraisal clauses, commonly found in homeowners, automobile, and property policies, provide a means to resolve disputes about the amount of loss for a covered claim. These clauses are generally enforceable, absent illegality or waiver. Appraisals can provide a less expensive, more efficient alternative to litigation, and the courts of Texas recently held that they should generally go forward without preemptive intervention by the courts.

Though appraisals have proceeded for well over a century with little judicial involvement, in rare cases, a court may conclude that a party has waived its right to enforce the appraisal provision. In the absence of fraud, accident, or mistake, the parties having agreed that the amount of loss shall be determined in a particular way, the courts are constrained to hold that the appraisal provision is valid. 

In deciding whether a demand for appraisal was made within a reasonable time, and consequently has not been waived even if suit was filed before the demand was made, courts have considered the timeliness of the demand in light of the circumstances as they existed at the time the demand was made. Pertinent circumstances include (1) the time between the breakdown of good faith negotiations concerning the amount of the loss suffered by the insured and the appraisal demand; and (2) whether there would be any prejudice to the other party resulting from the delay in demanding an appraisal.

Delay alone is not enough to prove waiver. To prove waiver a party must also demonstrate prejudice. The Court of Appeal found it difficult to see how prejudice could ever be shown when the policy, like the Lloyd’s policy, gives both sides the same opportunity to demand appraisal. If a party senses that impasse has been reached, it can avoid prejudice by demanding an appraisal itself. This could short-circuit potential litigation and should be pursued before resorting to the courts. 

 Conclusion 

The Court of Appeal concluded that Lloyd’s has shown that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by:

 failing to enforce the appraisal clause of the underlying homeowner’s insurance policy; and concluding that Lloyd’s had waived this right. 

Deciding that mandamus relief is appropriate to enforce an appraisal clause because denying the appraisal would “vitiate the insurer’s right to defend its breach of contract claim.” Because the Court of Appeal held that the appraisal provision was not waived by Lloyd’s it held that Lloyd’s was entitled to mandamus relief.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal directed the trial court to grant Lloyd’s’motion to compel appraisal. 

 Lesson 

 Appraisal is an important tool to help both the insured and the insurer resolve disputes over the amount of loss. Once that issue is resolved more often than not the entire dispute is resolved and litigation between the parties can be avoided. Even if litigation is not avoided the proof required at trial will be limited and the parties and courts will save a great deal of time and money.

It is incumbent on every insurer and insured to elect the right to appraisal promptly or risk losing it altogether. It is usually best to tender the amount the insurer believes it owes and advise the insured that, if the insured disputes the decision of the insurer, the insured has the right to demand appraisal. It should advise the insured that if the award is more than that paid it will pay the difference promptly and if the award is less than that paid it expects to be reimbursed.

 When Title Proved No Case Against Title Insurer 
 Posted on October 18, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Title Insurance Can’t Change Title 

 Title insurance is a specialized type of insurance that is limited in its coverage and ability to respond to claims. It indemnifies the person(s) insured against certain enumerated risks of loss as a result of a defect in title. It does not, nor should it, help an insured to increase property rights above that stated in the title documents. In Robel Fekade v. First American Title Insurance Co , No. H034391 (Cal.App. Dist.6 10/12/2011) the plaintiff tried to get, through a suit against his title insurer, a right to maintain a gate on an easement even though the title documents granting the easement never mentioned a gate and no one questioned the easement for ingress and egress to Fekade’s property.

 Factual Background 

Robel Fekade was involved in a dispute with a neighbor over a gate on an easement for ingress and egress over the neighbor’s property. Fekade tendered a claim to his title insurer, First American Title Insurance Co. (First American), which denied it after an investigation. Fekade brought this action against the neighbor, First American, and others. First American obtained summary judgment on the grounds that, as a matter of law, the claim was not covered by its policy and it had acted reasonably in denying it. 

In October 2006, appellant and his uncle, Habtom Ghile, purchased certain vacant land in Santa Cruz County from John and Judy Krueger. First American issued a policy insuring Fekade’s title in the property. It is undisputed that First American originally issued a CTLA policy designed to insure title to residential property, rather than to unimproved land like Fekade’s. On July 9, 2007, after discovering its mistake, First American issued a substitute ATLA policy effective the same date as the original policy.

The ATLA policy insured, among other risks, against loss or damage sustained or incurred by the Insured by reason of:

1.     Title to the estate or interest described In Schedule A being vested other than as stated therein;

2.     Any defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title;

3.    Unmarketability of the title; or

4.     Lack of a right of access to and from the land.

First American also agreed to pay the costs, attorneys’fees and expenses incurred in defense of the title, as insured to the extent provided in the policy wording.  Among the estates or interests described in Schedule A was“Parcel Five,”described as an“easement for ingress and egress for road purposes”situated on an adjoining property. 



 Initial Dispute 

 Fekade declared that when he purchased the property he was told that it included a gated driveway. Keys to the gate were given to him both by the listing agent and by the title company at close of escrow. On February 16, 2007, however, the owner of the adjacent land, Holly Reed, wrote to Fekade stating that the gate was located on her property and demanding that it be removed. She stated that Fekade’s seller had constructed the gate without her knowledge in May 2006; that she had then demanded that he remove it; that he had said“he was protecting valuables on the property and would remove it later”; and that he had given her a key“in the meantime.”

While the letter demanded the gate’s removal, it did not contest Fekade’s right to use the driveway for ingress and egress. On the contrary, it acknowledged that the“drive”on which the gate was situated constituted an“easement . . . for access to the parcel below mine, which you have recently purchased.”

Both Reed and Fekade engaged surveyors, who determined that the gate was on Reed’s land. Fekade, however, continued to assert a right to maintain the gate. In May 2007, he and his uncle wrote to First American tendering a claim under the policy. They stated that when they were shown the property, they were told that the entire driveway including where the green gate is located is in Fekade’s property. 

Claims Counsel Steven Kahn was assigned to investigate Fekade’s claim on behalf of First American. He recounted his investigation in a declaration which appears not to have been controverted in any material detail. In that account, when he examined Reed’s letter of February 16, he observed that her only objection to Fekade’s use of the easement was his keeping a gate on it. In his initial reply to Fekades’tender, Kahn explained that it appears Ms. Reed acknowledged the Fekades’ right to use the driveway easement.

Ms. Reed had counsel demand removal of the gate and Fekade refused and was charged with trespassing on Ms. Reed’s property.

Based apparently on this letter, Fekade e-mailed Kahn on July 24, 2007, advising that Ms. Reed claims he is trespassing and offered to convey the letter from Reed’s lawyer. Around August 1, 2007, Reed caused the gate to be removed. She testified that she accepted a neighbor’s offer to bulldoze it. On August 13 Fekade’s attorney wrote to Kahn supplying a copy of the survey map prepared by Lea&amp;Braze, whom Fekade had engaged in March to determine the location of the gate vis a vis the property line. The map depicts the gate as situated on Reed’s land, but within Fekade’s easement.

On August 31, 2007, Kahn stated that First American had completed its investigation and had concluded that the policy did not cover Fekade’s claim. He concluded that the dispute fell outside the coverage of the policy because there was no challenge to title to the Insureds’property and Reed acknowledged the Insureds’easement rights. He based his conclusion on the premise that none of the policy’s insuring provisions insure the right to install or maintain structures within an easement on a neighboring property, even if that easement is insured by the policy.”

On October 3, 2007, Fekade and his uncle sued Reed, the seller Krueger and his wife, the agent in the purchase transaction, and First American. The first amended complaint asserted 11 causes of action. As against First American it asserted claims for declaratory relief (first cause of action),“bad faith denial of coverage”(seventh cause of action), and“tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing”(eighth cause of action). On these causes of action the prayer sought declaratory relief, attorney fees, and compensatory and punitive damages. No claim was asserted for breach of contract.

 Trial Court Decision 

 First American moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the claim for declaratory relief would not lie against it because it asserted no interest in the real property as to which an adjudication of rights was sought; (2) as to the remaining claims, the dispute as to which Fekade sought coverage was not in fact covered by the policy; (3) if there was a colorable dispute about coverage, First American’s denial of coverage, and conduct in regard thereto, was reasonable; and (4) there was no evidence of the malice, fraud, or oppression required to sustain Fekades’prayer for punitive damages.

At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court stated its tentative view that there was no coverage under the policy because there is no dispute regarding whether Fekades have title to the easement, or whether they have the right to use the easement. The sole question is whether the proposed use exceeds the scope of the grant, and that’s not a title issue nor is it a marketability issue. The trial court concluded that since there was nothing in the grant that expressly gives Fekades the right to erect a gate or otherwise prevent others from using the easement, it’s not a title issue, and for that reason the Court found no coverage under the policy.

 Decision 

The Court of Appeal concluded that although it was not easy to unravel the tangled skein of assertions, but having done so to the best of its ability the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the trial court’s analysis of this case was entirely correct and that it did not err by granting summary judgment in First American’s favor. 

A title insurer undertakes two basic duties. The first is to“indemnify the insured for losses incurred as a result of defects in or encumbrances on the title. The second is to defend the insured against attempts to establish defects in, or encumbrances on, the title as insured. The second duty is broader than the first in the sense that it embraces potentially covered claims. However, where there is no possibility of coverage, there is no duty to defend.

Fekade never presented any evidence of any defect or encumbrance asserted in derogation of his title by any other person. His only real attempt to identify such a defect is a claim that the dispute between himself and Reed was not limited to his right to maintain a gate but extended to“the existence of the easement”on which the gate was constructed.

The easement arose by grant, and its extent is defined in the property description, in relevant part, functionally: the easement is granted“for ingress and egress for road purposes.”The“terms of the grant”said nothing about any right by the dominant owner to erect a gate. Where the easement is founded upon a grant only those interests expressed in the grant and those necessarily incident thereto pass from the owner of the fee. An exclusive easement is an unusual interest in land amounting almost to a conveyance of the fee. To exist as an exclusive easement it must affirmatively appear in the grant of title and cannot be inferred. Even if Fekade succeeded in establishing such a right the Court of Appeal noted it would not follow that First American must bear the expense of his doing maintaining or erecting the gate. The interest First American insured was an easement for ingress and egress. Fekade failed entirely to offer any basis for the imposition of such a duty. Accordingly he failed to establish any colorable liability in First American to indemnify or defend him with respect to the maintenance of the gate.

The policy only insured Fekade against claims by others in derogation of his title as described in the policy – not claims by him seeking to enlarge his estate beyond that description, and to derogate the record title of others.

 Lesson 

Insurance is a contract. Whether the policy is described as property, casualty, life, health or title insurance, it is a contract limited to its terms. The mistake Fekade made was when he bought the property to make sure the right to the gate was part of the grant of title he received and negotiate an amendment to the easement. He did not. The insurer insured his right to the easement and since the easement, as written, was not breached.

 An Intentional Act Can Still Be An“Occurrence” 
 Posted on October 17, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 “Occurrence”Must Relate to the Insured 

 When an insured in good faith hires an employee who turns out to be a child molester and molests a child who was a guest at the hotel where the employee worked his action—by definition—cannot be an occurrence since child molestation is always an intentional act. However, when the employer is sued for negligent hiring of the molester, can its actions still be an occurrence? In Holiday Hospitality Franchising, Inc v. Amco Insurance Company, No. 33A01-1103-CT-104 (Ind.App. 10/13/2011) the Indiana Court of Appeal was called upon to resolve a dispute that arose after the insurer obtained a summary judgment on its obligation to defend or indemnify the hotel.

Holiday Hospitality Franchising, Inc. (“Holiday Hospitality”) appealed the trial court’s grant of Amco Insurance Company’s (“AMCO”) motion for summary judgment. Holiday Hospitality raised two issues for appellate review:

 Whether an“occurrence”took place for the purposes of the insureds’ insurance policy, and whether a hotel guest is“in the care, custody or control”of the hotel. 

 Facts and Procedural History 

In May of 2007, Michael Forshey, an employee of Holiday Inn Express of New Castle, LLC (“Holiday Inn”), molested R.M.H., a fifteen-year-old guest at the Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn, along with its parent company Holiday Hospitality, was insured by AMCO under the same policy. The insurance policy provided for bodily injury and property damage liability coverage, personal and advertising liability coverage, and a duty to defend. The pertinent provisions of the policy are as follows:

In September of 2008, S.H., individually and as parent and next friend of R.M.H., filed a twelve-count complaint against the following: Forshey; an individual member of the Holiday Inn limited liability company; Holiday Inn; and Holiday Hospitality. Holiday Hospitality filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether it could be held vicariously liable for the actions of Forshey.

 Concluding Forshey’s misconduct occurred while he was outside the scope of his employment, the trial court granted the partial summary judgment as to all underlying defendants. The only remaining claims in the underlying litigation are for negligent hiring, retention, and/or supervising.

In 2009, AMCO filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking the trial court’s determination that AMCO’s policy with Holiday Inn does not provide coverage to any of the defendants in the suit brought by S.H. AMCO then filed a motion for summary judgment, and, following a hearing, the trial court granted AMCO’s summary judgment motion on March 21, 2011.

 

 Discussion 

Holiday Hospitality first argued the trial court mistakenly concluded the molestation was not an“occurrence”as that term is defined in the policy.

Noting prior cases in which the Indiana Court of Appeal defined accident as an unexpected happening without an intention or design concluded that the property damage is alleged to have arisen from American’s hiring and retention of the employee. These acts, even if proven to be careless and negligent, were intentional, not accidental.

Holiday Hospitality contended that an occurrence did take place. First, it asserted the separation of insureds provision requires a determination of whether coverage was triggered for Holiday Hospitality separately from the same determination for Forshey. 

Second, Holiday Hospitality argued that ambiguities exist in AMCO’s policy as applied to the facts of this case, and, given Indiana’s construction of ambiguous insurance policies against insurance companies, the court should construe Holiday Hospitality’s policy against AMCO.

Third, Holiday Hospitality argues that AMCO did not present evidence demonstrating that the alleged negligent conduct of Holiday Hospitality was not accidental, and the court should conclude an occurrence took place.

The insurance company presented no evidence other than the intentionality of the conduct of the employee to refute that an occurrence gave rise to the injuries. AMCO’s insurance policy contained a separation of insureds provision. Indiana state appellate courts have not specifically addressed whether an employer’s negligent hiring or supervision of an employee could be accidental. In determining whether an“occurrence”took place, the Indiana Supreme Court concluded in an earlier decision that although a battery was not accidental a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether resulting injuries were accidental.

Applying Indiana law, the court concluded that no evidence was designated showing the defendant hotel intended or expected the employee to molest the minor. A separation of insureds provision allows the finding of an“occurrence”regarding Holiday Hospitality’s action even if Forshey’s actions do not amount to an accident. Without evidence that the employer intended or expected the sexual misconduct to result, the court concluded that the action of the hotel cannot reasonably be deemed intentional, but rather, it is accidental.

 Care, Custody&amp;Control 

While Holiday Hospitality acknowledges the parties’ policy contains an exclusion from coverage for injuries arising out of abuse or molestation and specifically from coverage for liability due to negligent employment, supervision, or retention of the perpetrator of such abuse or molestation, Holiday Hospitality argued the policy provisions require that the person injured by the perpetrator be“in the care, custody or control of any insured”and that R.M.H. was not“in the care, custody or control”of an insured.

A duty of reasonable care relates to the actions of Holiday Inn and governs the responsibility given it to reasonably protect business invitees and to keep the business property in a reasonably safe condition. Being in the care, custody, or control of someone, however, requires more than a mere business invitee status. In the context of a hotel, it would require something additional, such as a minor being supervised by hotel employees. AMCO, therefore, failed to demonstrate that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

 Conclusion 

The Court of Appeal concluded that an“occurrence”took place for the purposes of the hotel insureds’ insurance policy, and a genuine issue of material fact remained regarding whether R.M.H. was“in the care, custody or control”of Holiday Inn. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court and sent the case back for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.

 Lesson 

 Courts across the country have struggled with “occurrence” and its meaning when intentional acts give rise to the damage. In this case there was no question that the hotel employee, Forshey committed an intentional act by molesting a minor. As to him there was no issue.

The hotel hired Forshey and put him in a position to commit the wrongful act. The plaintiffs alleged that the hotel was negligent and should not have hired Forshey so that he could be in a position to molest the minor. To prove that the hotel acted intentionally the insurer needed to produce evidence that the hotel knew Forshey was a molester and that they did something to allow or encourage the molestation. That they failed to do and will try to do at trial.

 More Fraud Attempts Fail 
 Posted on October 16, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 

 Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter—October 15, 2011 

C ontinuing with the twentieth issue of the 15th Year of publication of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter (ZIFL) its author, Barry Zalma, reports that he has posted more than 253 articles on his blog “Zalma on Insurance” http://zalma.com/blog which will be a regular supplement his new e-book “ Zalma on Insurance .”

ZIFL also reports on the a decision of the California Court of Appeal where it upheld the denial of a suspected insurance fraud because the insured refused to produce documents and answer questions at examination under oath; reports on a Washington state trial court verdict where Safeco Insurance defeated a fraudulent claim and received almost $10 million judgment against its insured; reports that the blog, Zalma on Insurance has been nominated as one of the 50 top insurance blogs in the country; lists the funds available from the California Department of Insurance to local prosecutors to prosecute insurance fraud; reports on the launch of the World Risk and Insurance News web site; a man bites dog story where State Farm successfully sued fraudulent medical and health care professionals and received an $11.4 million verdict; and chapter 29 of the serialized novel, Arson for Profit.

The issue closes, as always, with dozens of reports on convictions for insurance fraud across the country making clear the disparity of sentences imposed on those caught defrauding insurers and the public with sentences from probation to many years in jail.

 Health Insurance Fraud Convictions 

 From the Next Issue of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter 

The following are excerpts from the next issue, 10/15/2011 of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter which is always available free at http://www.zalma.com/ZIFL-CURRENT.htm . 

 33 Months For Medicare Fraud 

 Bassey Monday Idiong, 32, of Humble, Texas, the owner and operator of a Houston durable medical equipment (DME) company was sentenced October 12, 2011 in Houston federal court to 33 months in prison for his role in a Medicare fraud scheme, announced the Department of Justice. Idiong was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore.   In addition to his prison term, Idiong was sentenced to two years of supervised release and was ordered to pay $527,023 in restitution. 

 Idiong pleaded guilty on March 1, 2010, to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and five counts of health care fraud.  Idiong owned and operated B.I. Medical Supply LLC. 

 According to court documents, Idiong paid patient recruiters kickbacks in exchange for the names of beneficiaries for whom bills could be submitted to Medicare.  B.I. Medical billed Medicare for expensive, rigid orthotics and braces that were packaged together and referred to as an “arthritis kit,” at a cost of approximately $4,000 per kit.   B.I. Medical then supplied the beneficiaries with different, less expensive products that were not medically necessary.  Court documents indicate that in one instance, B.I. Medical billed Medicare for an arthritis kit that included two knee braces for a beneficiary who had only one leg.  In total, B.I. Medical submitted approximately $846,000 in fraudulent claims to Medicare. 

 Pill Mills in Florida Result in Multiple Convictions 

 J eff George ran lucrative prescription drug mills. Theodore Obermeyer’s ordered doctors to“Keep the patients happy.”The favored amounts–180-240 oxycodone per month–would keep customers from deserting them for competing pill mills that offered more generous supplies of the powerful painkillers, federal prosecutors on Wednesday said Obermeyer told physicians. 

 If the doctors, often recruited on Craigslist, were stingy, Obermeyer would badger them to prescribe more. Faced with stacks of evidence of the key role he played in the illicit operation, the 30-year-old West Palm Beach man pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of racketeering conspiracy. George, who tapped him to manage clinics in West Palm Beach and Hallandale, pleaded guilty to the same charge last week. In return, prosecutors dropped three other felonies against them. 

 George and Obermeyer also face charges in state court in connection with the multi-million-dollar operation that prosecutors said is linked to more than 50 deaths. George pleaded guilty in August and Obermeyer will soon plead guilty to state charges according to his attorney. 

 However, unlike George, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in state court, Obermeyer faces multiple drug trafficking charges. While the charges carry a maximum 200 years in prison, he is expected to get far less. Obermeyer faces 20 years in prison and $250,000 fine when he is sentenced on the federal charge January 6. 

 According to a deal George made with prosecutors, he will serve less than 20 years in prison on both the state murder and federal racketeering charges. While 16 of the 32 people arrested in August as part of“Operation Oxy Alley”have accepted plea deals. Two doctors, who are among 14 physicians charged in the operation, joined Obermeyer in federal court Wednesday. 

 Dr. Jacobo Dreszer, 70, of Aventura, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He worked at American Pain, which had clinics on Dixie Highway in Lake Worth and Federal Highway in Boca Raton. In addition to prescribing large doses of oxycodone without medical justification, he lied on documents to pharmaceutical suppliers to keep the drugs flowing, prosecutors said. He faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced Jan. 6. 

 Dr. Robert Meek, 36, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Meek, of Davie, worked at Executive Pain, prescribing a“predetermined cocktail”of drugs, including oxycodone, the anti-anxiety drug Xanax and the muscle relaxant Soma to patients at the clinic on Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach. He faces a maximum 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced Jan. 6. 

 Dr. To Serve One Year and 3 Months for Treating Dead Patients 

 Dr. Robert Williams, 77, an Atlanta doctor who admitted filing more than $2 million in bogus Medicare and Medicaid claims, asserting he treated patients who turned out to be dead and others he never saw, was sentenced October 12, 2011 to 1 year and 3 months in federal prison. 

 Williams also was ordered to serve three years’ supervised release and to pay nearly $1 million in restitution – $771,596 to Medicare, and $227,846 to Georgia Medicaid, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Williams pleaded guilty June 6 to federal health care fraud charges. 

 From about July 2007 through October 2009, the doctor contracted with a medical services company to provide group psychological therapy to elderly nursing home patients in the Atlanta area, authorities said. During that time, more than 55,000 claims were submitted to Medicare using Williams’ provider number. Williams sought more than $2 million in reimbursement, and Medicare ultimately paid him more than $750,000. At the same time, more than 40,000 Medicaid claims using Williams’ provider number caused Georgia Medicaid to pay out more than $225,000. 

 An investigation by the FBI, Georgia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and the Inspector General’s Office of the Georgia Department of Community Health showed, however, that in many cases the patients were dead, or were hospitalized at the time of service and therefore could not have received care at a nursing home, as Williams had claimed. 

 Feds Collect $995,000 In Civil Damages from New York Doctor and Hospitals 

 On October 5, 2011, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced the simultaneous filing of a Complaint and a settlement of the charges in a civil health care fraud lawsuit against the Trustees Of Columbia University (“Columbia”), New York Presbyterian Hospital (“Presbyterian Hospital”), and Dr. Erik Goluboff (“Dr. Goluboff”). 
 Dr. Goluboff is a urologic oncologist, former Director of Urology at the Allen Pavilion of the New York Presbyterian Hospital, and former Associate Professor of Clinical Urology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. The Complaint alleged that between 2003 and 2009, Dr. Goluboff violated Medicare regulations by conducting medically unnecessary diagnostic tests and then seeking improper and excessive reimbursement amounts from Medicare.  Moreover, Dr. Goluboff was charged with submitting bills for a number of daily procedures that the Complaint alleges he was physically unable to achieve. 

 The Complaint did not solely single out Dr. Goluboff but further alleged that rather than having been unwitting participants in this scheme, Columbia and Presbyterian Hospital were aware of his fraudulent practices, failed to stop those practices, and caused his claims to be submitted to Medicare.  Pointedly, an internal Columbia memo characterized Dr. Goluboff’s conduct as “alarming compliance issues.”  Despite having known or at least having been on notice of these alarming issues, it does not appear that substantive steps were taken by the hospitals to shut down any of the cited  fraudulent practices.  Consequently, it is alleged that Columbia and Presbyterian Hospital benefitted financially from the fraud. 

 The settlement, approved by the federal court on October 4th,  required Columbia to pay $995,000 in civil damages under the False Claims Act 

 Medicaid Fraud to Buy a Mercedes Results in Guilty Plea 

 Joye Strong, a Charlotte, NC woman pleaded guilty to defrauding Medicaid through her company in order to purchase a Mercedes. U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins announced that 43-year-old Strong faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 per count in the case. In total, she was charged with eight counts of health care fraud and two counts of money laundering. 

 Strong’s company, Advocating for America, provided mental and behavioral health services in the Charlotte area. For about five months in 2009, Strong fraudulently billed Medicaid for services the company never performed. Prosecutors say the claims resulted in $83,000 worth of fraudulent payments, which Strong used to buy a Mercedes and make a large cash withdrawal from the company. 

 Guilty of 25 Counts of Medicaid Fraud 

 Deborah D’Anna, 57, of Ocala, Florida, the former medical director of Palmer Health Center in Detroit, Michigan was found guilty in Ingham County Circuit Court of 25 counts of Medicaid fraud and one count of racketeering for her role in a Medicaid fraud scheme. 
 Deborah D’Anna, 57, of Ocala, Fla., submitted thousands of fraudulent Medicaid claims and collected more than $3.3 million of taxpayer dollars to finance a lavish lifestyle in Florida. 

 Court documents showed that D’Anna used her access to Palmer Health Center records to bill Michigan Medicaid for millions in services never actually rendered by its clinics in Detroit and Romulus, which had closed 2005. Until 2005, Palmer Health Center had been a legitimate medical clinic hat employed doctors to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries, including children in the Wayne County juvenile system. But D’Anna, who had been Palmer’s CEO, continued to bill Medicaid on her own. 
 In 2006, after the clinic had shut its doors, D’Anna maintained the list of provider identification numbers — or PINs — for two doctors who had been employed at the clinic and a list of Medicaid beneficiaries that the clinic had formerly treated. The PIN numbers and beneficiary list allowed D’Anna to continue to submit fraudulent Medicaid claims on behalf of Palmer Health Center as if the clinic were still open. 

 In Ocala, D’Anna used the stolen money to buy a luxurious home with cash, undeveloped land, a Cadillac Escalade, a Mercedes sedan, as well as jewelry and other merchandise. The scheme was unearthed when one of the physicians previously employed by Palmer Health Center reported Medicaid billings being submitted under his PIN for services he did not provide. 

 D’Anna is expected to be sentenced October 27. She could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years. 

 Pharmacist to Spend 51 Months in Federal Prison 

 John Love, a former Terre Haute, Indiana pharmacist was sentenced to m ore than four years in federal prison for his role in an Indiana Medicaid fraud investigation. Love pleaded guilty in March to filing false claims for prescriptions that were never given to patients. In October Love told Judge William Lawrence that he wants to make restitution for the $3.5 million he used to purchase property, vehicles and for personal ex penses. 

 Love admitted to defrauding the government from 2006 through September 2010 when state and federal investigators seized records at the Terre Haute Prescription Shop on South Seventh Street as part of their investigation. Judge Lawrence sentenced Love to 51 months in prison, followed by 3 years of supervised probation, and ordered him to repay the $3.5 million. Love has forfeited property, vehicles and other assets to the government to pay back a portion of the funds taken. 

 133 Months in Prison for $4 million Medicare Fraud 

 Alfredo Rasco, 52, of Pembroke Pines, Florida, was sentenced to almost 11 years in federal prison for his role in a scheme to defraud Medicare of more than $4 million through a Broughton Street clinic. 

 Rasco must serve 133 months in prison followed by three years on supervised release and faces deportation for the period of supervised release, U.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr. ruled in October. Rasco must report by 2 p.m. on October 28 to a prison facility to be designated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons for his custody. 

 Also sentenced to three years on probation was his wife, Niurka Rasco, 50. As part of their sentences, the Rascos must forfeit $1.3 million and the 42-foot yacht “Thank You, God,” seized by investigators in the case. 

 Alfredo Rasco pleaded guilty August 30, 2010, to charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and aggravated identity theft by unlawfully using a doctor’s identification in April 2006. His wife pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, a misdemeanor that she filed document claiming to be owner-operator of United Medical which her husband owned. 
 Prosecutors said Rasco received some $4 million in Medicare payments, pocketing $2.5 million, for services that were not provided as billed, not medically necessary and not entitled to reimbursement by Medicare. The indictment charged he billed Medicare $5.6 million in fraudulent claims for therapy not provided between September 2005 and April 2008.

 Insured and Insurer May Select Who Are Insured 
 Posted on October 13, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Who Is The Insured? 

Insurance is a contract between an insurer and the person who sought to be insured. It is a contract of personal indemnity. “An insurance company is entitled to determine for itself what risks it will accept…It has the unquestioned right to select those whom it will insure and to rely upon him who would be insured for such information as it desires as a basis for its determination to the end that a wise discrimination may be exercised in selecting its risks [citations].” [Imperial Casualty&amp;Indemn ity Company v. Levon Sogomonian, 198 Cal. App. 3d 169 (1988)].

When a person insured acquires insurance he or she enters into an agreement with the insurer and makes certain choices including who is to be insured by the policy. In Jennifer Helgeson and Andrew Helgeson v. Viking Insurance Company of Wisconsin A Foreign Corporation, D/B/A , No. 41371-0-II (Wash.App.Div.2 10/11/2011) the Washington Court of Appeal decided whether an insurer and insured have the right to limit who the policy will insure under an uninsured and underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) policy.

 FACTS 

On October 5, 2008, Jennifer Helgeson renewed her personal automobile insurance coverage through Viking for the period of October 5, 2008, to April 5, 2009. Jennifer’s policy provided definitions for terms used throughout the policy. CP at 36. It stated:
 
 “You”and“your”mean the person shown as the named insured on the Declarations Page and that person’s spouse if residing in the same household. You and your also means any relative of that person if they reside in the same household, providing they or their spouse do not own a car. 
 
“Relative”was defined as“a person living in your household related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption, including a ward or foster child.”The broad form“named”driver endorsement in Jennifer’s automobile policy replaced the policy’s general definition of“you”and“your,”stating,“‘You’and‘your’mean the person shown as the named insured on the Declarations Page.”Jennifer was the only named insured on the declarations page. The endorsement also amended the policy’s liability coverage to state:
 
 We will pay damages for which you are legally liable because of bodily injury and/or property damage caused by a car accident arising out of your use of your insured car. We will settle any claims or defend any lawsuit which is payable under the policy, as we deem appropriate. 
 
The endorsement further stated that the policy provided the named insured medical payment coverage while“occupying your insured car,”“as a pedestrian when struck by a motor vehicle or utility trailer,”or“any other person while occupying your insured car while the car is being used by you.”The endorsement’s UIM portion included coverage for: 
 
 (A) You. 
 (B) Any other person occupying your insured car with your permission. 
 (C) Any person for damages that person is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to you or another occupant of your car. 
 
On February 3, 2009, a motor vehicle struck Andrew while he was skateboarding in Kingston, Washington. Andrew was transferred by ambulance to a hospital and he was treated for fractures of his right leg. Andrew and the driver’s insurer settled all claims Andrew had against the driver for $50,000, the driver’s policy’s claim limit. When Jennifer applied for UIM coverage under her insurance policy for the remainder of Andrew’s damages, Viking“disclaim[ed] and deni[ed] any and all liability or obligation”to provide UIM coverage to Andrew. Viking stated that“the policy of insurance covers only‘you’[Jenn ifer], as the named insured. Andrew . . . does not meet the definition of‘you’under your policy and, therefore, there is no coverage under the [UIM] Coverage.”

Andrew and Jennifer sued Viking, asserting that Viking breached its contract and violated the Insurance Fair Conduct Act. On the same day that Andrew and Jennifer filed their complaint against Viking, Viking filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, asking the trial court to rule that Viking did“not have a duty to pay any benefits under the UIM coverage of [Jennifer&apos;s][p]olicy.”The two cases were consolidated.

Both parties filed summary judgment motions. The trial court granted Viking’s summary judgment motion, declared that Andrew was not entitled to UIM benefits under Jennifer’s policy with Viking, and dismissed with prejudice the Helgesons’claims. The Helgesons appeal.

 ANALYSIS 

The criteria for interpreting insurance contracts in Washington are well settled. Courts must construe insurance policies as contracts and consider the policy as a whole. Courts must also give the policy a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given to the contract by the average person purchasing insurance. Most importantly, if the policy language is clear and unambiguous, the court must enforce it as written; the court may not modify it or create ambiguity where none exists.

The Helgesons argued that the UM statute in Washington has a definition of“insured”different from that in the policy and should have bee incorporated into the underinsured motor vehicle and requires Andrew, as Jennifer’s seventeen year old son, to be included as an insured person under Jennifer’s insurance policy even if he is not a“named”insured. They argued that Viking must pay Andrew’s underinsured motorist claim under Jennifer’s policy.

The Court of Appeal, rather than dealing with a contract emotionally, disagreed with the Hegelsons, and concluded that parties to an insurance policy are free to d etermine who is insured by the policy. The issue raised by the Helgesons has long been resolved by Washington’s Supreme Court that held the UM/UIM statute does not mandate any particular scope for the definition of who is an insured in a particular automobile insurance policy.

Because Andrew was not insured under Jennifer’s policy for his injuries sustained when an underinsured motor vehicle injured him while he was skateboarding, the Court of Appeal held that the trial court did not err in finding that the Helgesons were not entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under Jennifer’s policy with Viking.

 Lesson 

 Jenifer Hegelson attempted to save money by limiting the scope of her UM/UIM policy of insurance by limiting the coverage on her policy to only her since a 17-year-old driver would have probably caused a serious increase in premium. After her son was injured she attempted to argue that her choice was not proper and that the state should force her insurer to insure a risk it did not agree to take. The Washington Court of Appeal in an opinion that is not officially published, refused to buy her arguments and enforced the contract as written.

 New California Statutes 
 Posted on October 12, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
The California Department of Insurance reports that Governor Brown has signed the following statutes that will be in effect on January 1, 2012:

 AB 315 authored by Assembly Insurance Committee Chair Jose Solorio on“Surplus Lines Insurance Marketplace Reform”(Chapter 83, Statutes of 2011). This urgency law adds uniformity and simplicity to California’s regulatory law as it pertains to the surplus lines insurance marketplace and the state’s surplus lines tax collection activities. It conforms state law to mandatory changes mandated in the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act provisions of last year’s federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in order to avoid preemption by the federal government. AB 624 jointly authored by Assembly Speaker John A. Pérez and Assembly Budget Committee Chair Bob Blumenfield on the“California Organized Investment Network (COIN) Program Community Reinvestment Extension Act”(Chapter 436, Statutes of 2011). This new law extends the sunset date to January 1, 2015 on the California Organized Investment Network’s (COIN) Tax Credit Program, which was set to expire at the end of this year. Extending the COIN program ensures that this successful partnership between insurance companies and community based organizations can continue to provide funding for important projects in underserved communities throughout the state, an effort that is especially important in these difficult economic times. While California continues to pull itself out of the recession, programs like COIN are vital to facilitating that momentum by providing new capital for small businesses throughout the state, spurring growth in our neighborhoods, and, most importantly, creating more badly needed jobs for Californians. The COIN program, in partnership with Community Development Financial Institutions, has invested more than $100 million into underserved communities. AB 689 authored by Assembly Budget Committee Chair Bob Blumenfield on“Landmark Annuity Suitability Reform”(Chapter 295, Statutes of 2011). This new law establishes landmark consumer protections in the annuities marketplace to protect the public, particularly seniors, from fraudulent activities involving these complex insurance products. For far too long, seniors have been victimized through the aggressive marketing and sale of annuity products that are simply unsuitable for them. Consumers unwittingly buy these products not realizing that their invested funds will not be available to them or their funds are terribly expensive to recover if they want to withdraw their money to pay for immediate expenses, which can be financially devastating to seniors on a fixed income. With Californians spending $20.7 billion on annuities in 2010 alone, this new law requires insurers, agents, and brokers to verify that an annuity purchase, exchange, or replacement is appropriate for the consumer based on an evaluation of his or her age, income, financial objectives, and other important factors. It also authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to revoke an insurance agent’s license, impose fines, and restore money lost to the consumer when suitability standards are violated. AB 793 authored by Assembly Banking&amp;Finance Committee Chair Mike Eng on the“Prohibition of Insurance Product Cross-Selling with Reverse Mortgage Lenders”(Chapter 223, Statutes of 2011). This new law limits insurance agents’and brokers’ability to“cross-sell”reverse equity mortgages and annuities. The growth of the reverse mortgage business has been accompanied by aggressive marketing and predatory abuse, especially when reverse mortgages are marketed along with insurance products or financial investment vehicles. AB 1416 authored by the Assembly Insurance Committee on“Insurance Code Reforms”(Chapter 411, Statutes of 2011). This new law makes several necessary changes to various Insurance Code sections regarding agent licensing, training, and previously enacted legislation. It also permits the Insurance Commissioner to remove a life agent’s authority to transact variable life insurance contracts upon learning that the agent is no longer registered to transact securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The current process is time consuming, leaving the door open for a life agent to continue selling these insurance products when they are no longer authorized to do so. Timelier removal of a life agent’s variable contract authority better protects consumers from agents who are not authorized to sell annuities or other complex variable life contract products. SB 51 authored by Senator Elaine Alquist on“Medical Loss Ratio Enforcement”(Chapter 644, Statutes of 2011). This new law requires health insurers and HMOs to put a larger share of the money they collect from consumers into actual medical care instead of overhead and profits. While it does not control or limit health insurance rate increases, this new law reinforces what is required in President Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which requires HMOs and health insurers to have a medical loss ratio (MLR) of 85% for large group health insurance and 80% for small group and individual health insurance–meaning that insurers and HMOs have to put 85% of what they collect from large employers and 80% of what they collect in premium from individuals and small employers into actual medical care versus that portion of the premium which goes to insurer or HMO overhead and profit. SB 599 authored by Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Christine Kehoe on“Retained-Asset Account Consumer Choice and Disclosure Reform”(Chapter 423, Statutes of 2011). This new law requires life insurers to obtain a beneficiary’s written declaration as to how he or she wants to receive their benefit payment. Instead of sending life insurance beneficiaries a check for the full amount of benefits owed, many life insurance companies automatically deposit the benefits into a Retained Asset Account (RAA). This issue first came to the attention of Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones when military families complained that they had not been asked for permission before the life insurance benefits of loved ones who died in military service were put into a RAA by life insurers. Now, military families as well as all Californians will be able to decide for themselves how they want their life insurance benefits to be paid by requiring insurers to get their permission, based on strong consumer disclosures, before putting their benefits into a retained asset account controlled by the insurer. This new law is part of a two bill package with newly-enacted SB 713, a companion RAA-disclosure bill (Chapter 130, Statutes of 2011). SB 621 authored by Senate Insurance Committee Chair Ron Calderon on“Discretionary Clause Prohibition”(Chapter 425, Statutes of 2011). This new law protects consumers of life, health, and disability insurance from“discretionary clauses”in their insurance policies, which give the insurer the sole discretion to decide if a beneficiary has become disabled, even if the consumer has a doctor certify that they are disabled. Discretionary clauses have been increasingly relied upon by insurers to reject legitimate claims for disability insurance when a consumer becomes disabled–insurers know that many consumers will give up their claim and that those who challenge the claim denial face a very high legal burden to overcome the denial since the discretionary clause vests sole discretion in the insurer to decide if the consumer is disabled. This new law levels the playing field and gives consumers an even chance to prove that they are entitled to disability and other insurance, by making the“discretionary clauses”that insurers have been putting into their insurance policies as void and unenforceable. SB 684 authored by Senate Majority Leader Ellen Corbett on“Mandatory Out-of-State Workers’Compensation Insurance Arbitration Disclosure”(Chapter 566, Statutes of 2011). This new law protects California’s businesses by preventing workers’compensation insurers from unilaterally forcing California businesses to other states like New York or Delaware to resolve disputes, without the California business’s consent. It protects California businesses by requiring that there be disclosure up front at the time a quote is provided as to where the insurer proposes to resolve disputes and by making explicit that California businesses can decline to agree to being forced to arbitrate or otherwise resolve disputes in other states than California. This new law reduces costs for California businesses associated with having to fly managers and lawyers to places like New York or Delaware to resolve disputes that could just as easily be resolved here in California. 

All bills go into effect on January 1, 2012, with an exception to SB 684, which applies to workers’compensation policies issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2012.

 The Attorney Client Privilege is Not Absolute 
 Posted on October 12, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 When An Attorney Aids A Fraud The Communication is Not Privileged 

 Lawyers Should Not Participate in Insurance Fraud 

 Insurance fraud, especially when it involves No fault insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government run medical services is rampant and convoluted. Lawyers, doctors, chiropractors, and other professionals find the amounts available to steal and the ease with which fraud can be successfully perpetrated is so tempting that lawyers join with doctors and others in the crime. In United States of America v. Aron Chervin, et al , No. 10 CR 918 (S.D.N.Y. 09/21/2011) an indictment involving multiple health insurance fraud perpetrators attempted to keep from their criminal trial wire tap conversations that seem to establish the crime.

By motion dated June 1, 2011, Defendant Michael Lamond (“Lamond”) moved to suppress nineteen telephone conversations between himself and Defendant Aron Chervin intercepted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) pursuant to court-authorized wiretaps. Defendant argued that the communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege because Aron Chervin was a client. 



 Background – The Criminal Charges 

On October 6, 2010, a Grand Jury indicted Defendants Aron Chervin, et al., charging Defendants with conspiracy to engage in a scheme to commit mail fraud and healthcare fraud, conspiracy to sell confidential patient information, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment alleges that the Defendants’scheme sought to“systematically defraud no-fault insurance carriers by submitting fraudulent claims for medical services and equipment.”In furtherance of the scheme, patients were recruited to fraudulent clinics nominally controlled by a medical professional but ultimately operated by Defendants.  The alleged conspirators recruited patients who they knew were recently involved in car accidents and paid hospital employees to provide patient information of individuals recently involved in accidents.  Once at the clinic, participating doctors would subject the patients to excessive, unnecessary, or fraudulent tests to generate false claims for treatment and equipment to be submitted to the no-fault insurance providers.

Additionally, Defendants are charged with creating wholesale and retail shell corporations to perpetuate the fraudulent sale of Durable Medical Equipment (“DME”) to obtain inflated reimbursement from no-fault insurance providers, and financing their scheme through the sale of fraudulent receivables of the clinics to investors who benefitted from the inflated reimbursement generated by the fraud even though New York State prohibits medical professionals from sharing fees for medical services with non-medical professionals.

The sophisticated schemes also utilized the services of lawyers to represent patients, to facilitate payments, and to prevent the insurance companies from detecting the possibility of fraud.

The indictment also alleges that the scheme involved billing for invoices generated by the medical professional corporations and submitted to no-fault insurers through the Law Office of Akiva Ofshtein, P.C., which employed Defendant Lamond and Def endant Vadim Chervin.  Defendant Lamond is allegedly an attorney licensed to practice in New York State and an expert in the submission of no-fault insurance claims. The indictment alleges that Lamond’s services were used to draft contracts with financiers and to prevent“unwanted scrutiny”from insurers.  Furthermore, the indictment alleges that Lamond allowed use of his attorney’s escrow account to receive monies from financiers purchasing the inflated receivables. This arrangement allowed members of the conspiracy to shield the fact that the insurance payments were received by certain members of the conspiracy rather than the relevant medical corporation. 

 The Attorney-Client Privilege and The Crime Fraud Exception 

The rationale for the attorney-client privilege is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice. Clients must feel free to disclose to their attorneys a full and fair rendering of their past wrongdoings so that attorneys will best be able to provide competent and skillful legal assistance. The privilege, however, is not an unbridled license which protects all communications between attorney and client. One of these exceptions to the privilege is commonly referred to as the crime-fraud exception. Under this exception, the privilege ceases to operate at a certain point, namely, where the desired advice refers not to prior wrongdoing, but to future wrongdoing. Nor can the privileged communications between an attorney and client be carried on with the purpose of furthering or enabling a crime or fraud. 

It is well-settled that the party asserting the attorney-client privilege bears the burden of establishing that all the elements of the privilege are present.The attorney-client privilege is found to exist“(1) where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal advisor in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal advisor .”In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated September 15, 1983, 731 F.2d 1032, 1037 (2d Cir. 1984).  The Court assumed as true Lamond’s points that an attorney-client privilege was established with Defendant Aron Chervin.

 The Crime-Fraud Exception Does Not Require an Attorney to Knowingly Participate in the Crime 

The attorney-client privilege will not attach to any communications in furtherance of a crime or fraud regardless of the attorney’s lack of knowledge that he is being consulted in furtherance of that crime or fraud. The attorney may be innocent, and still the guilty client must let the truth come out. Therefore, Lamond’s knowledge of whether a fraudulent scheme was afoot is not relevant to the application of the crime-fraud exception to Lamond’s interactions with Aron Chervin. What is relevant is the nature of the Government’s evidence of Aron Chervin’s actions which Lamond assisted.

 The intercepted calls demonstrate that Aron Chervin used the services of Lamond and the Law Office of Akiva Ofshtein, P.C., to (1) submit fraudulent bills and collect money from no-fault insurers, (2) draft contracts with doctors and investors in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, and (3) launder monies garnered through the fraudulent scheme.

After reviewing all of the telephone taps the District Court concluded that the allegation of Lamond that the conversations he is seeking to suppress took place in his capacity as legal counsel to Mr. Chervin and involved consultations regarding financing, no-fault insurance collections and arbitration matters and that the conversations do show, however, that the Government has probable cause to believe that Aron Chervin intentionally and knowingly utilized the services of Michael Lamond to further Chervin’s illegal scheme to obtain funds by submitting fraudulent medical bills, traveling in interstate commerce, to no-fault insurance carriers.

 Conclusion 

The District Court concluded that there is probable cause to believe that Aron Ch ervin was knowingly involved in a complex mail or wire fraud scheme to defraud no-fault insurance providers and that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applies to this set of facts. Therefore, the District Court denied the motion to suppress.

 Lesson 

When prosecuting, whether criminally or civilly, a criminal enterprise do not consider the attorney client privilege to be absolute. The attorneys working with many of the insurance fraud perpetrators are likely to be involved – either with malice and intent or innocently – in assisting in the criminal activity. The Crime/Fraud exception to the privilege can be used to obtain and place in evidence what is ostensibly a privileged communication.

 An Effective Deterrent to Insurance Fraud 

 Insurance fraud has been estimated to take between $80 billion and $300 billion a year from the insurance industry in the United States. Every state has a statute making insurance fraud a crime including the federal crimes of mail and wire fraud and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO). RICO can also be a civil action which allows for treble damages or punitive damages.

Some insurer victims of insurance fraud have become proactive. In State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company; State Farm Fire and v. Arnold Lincow, D.O.; Richard Mintz, D.O.; Steven Hirsh; 7622 Medical , No. 10-3087 (3d Cir. 09/16/2011) the Third Circuit dealt with an appeal from State Farm’s successful trial against some doctors and clinics who defrauded it and those it insured.

 Facts 

 After a four-week jury trial plaintiff State Farm successfully convinced the jury that defendants, a number of health care providers (“Defendants”), engaged in various schemes to defraud State Farm by billing it for medical services that were either not provided or provided unnecessarily, and were illegal under RICO, fraud statutes, and common law fraud. Following trial, Defendants filed motions for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial or, in the alternative, to alter or amend the judgment. The District Court denied Defendants’ motions in their entirety.

Plaintiff alleged that Defendants were members of a conspiracy that sharply inflated the costs of medical care for car accident victims by prescribing tests and treatments, as well as prescriptions and medical equipment – whether medically necessary or not – and then routinely billed State Farm for additional treatments that were never provided. At trial, State Farm’s proof of Defendants’ fraud consisted of State Farm’s claim files and testimony of patients, physicians at Defendants’ medical facilities, Defendant physicians, and experts.
 
After a four-week trial, the jury awarded Plaintiff over $4 million against all Defendants jointly and severally, and individual Defendants were found liable for punitive damages totaling $11.4 million. The jury also found in favor of Plaintiff on Defendants’ counterclaims for unpaid bills for services.

 Analysis 

The Third Circuit’s reviews a district court’s order granting or denying a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion unless the court’s denial of the motion is based on the application of a legal precept, in which case the review is plenary.  A new trial may be granted on the basis that a verdict was against the weight of the evidence only if a miscarriage of justice would occur if the verdict were to stand.

State Farm noted that RICO is distinct because the members of the association-in-fact enterprise include all the defendants, there is a complete identity between the enterprise and the defendants and, therefore, no distinctiveness among the defendants.  As the District Court noted and State Farm urged, the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine is not universally accepted, and it is questionable whether the Defendant’s version is completely accurate.
 
The defendants argued that State Farm failed to prove: (1) the elements of an association-in-fact enterprise; (2) that defendant Mintz conspired with the other Defendants to defraud, as § 1962(d) requires; (3) that Mintz’s actions proximately caused State Farm’s injuries; (4) that Mintz’s conduct fulfilled the elements of common law fraud; and (5) that Mintz’s conduct fulfilled the elements of statutory fraud under Pennsylvania law. The Third Circuit rejected all of Mintz’s claims to the contrary and held that the weight of the evidence supports the jury’s finding against Mintz and the other defendants. Therefore, the Third Circuit concluded that to let the verdict stand would not result in a miscarriage of justice.

The Third Circuit agreed with State Farm’s assertion that a violation of the Insurance Fraud statute is a civil tort and that, as the jury found and the District Court upheld, the Defendants together contributed to State Farm’s injuries and are thus jointly and severally liable. Moreover, as the District Court correctly noted, there is no requirement for district courts to instruct juries to award damages against each defendant separately and individually. Because State Farm elected to receive treble damages the Third Circuit had no reason to address the contention that the punitive damages award should be reduced. 

 Lesson 

Insurers who are the victims of fraud cannot rely on police agencies to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of insurance fraud. Prosecutions are few and far between. As readers of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter, available FREE at http://www.zalma.com/ZIFL-CURRENT.htm , know prosecutions are increasing but are still anemic and those who are prosecuted and convicted usually receive minor punishments. By being proactive insurers can recover from the fraud perpetrators, like the doctors involved in this case, the insurer can recover what it lost, a bonus of three times the compensatory damages, and actually deter insurance fraud by hitting the perpetrators where it hurts them most, in their wallet.

It is time that insurers emulate the actions of State Farm and the few other insurers who are using civil suits to defeat insurance fraud by taking the profit out of the crime.

 The Policy Says Only What It Says 
 Posted on October 10, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Limits Are Limits 

Just because, after an accident, an insured wishes he had higher policy limits does not mean the insured can change the language of a policy. That does not stop them from trying. In Paul Davis and Sarah K. Davis v. Travelers Property Casualty Company of America , No. 10-2023 (1st Cir. 10/03/2011) the First Circuit, with retired Supreme Court Justice Souter sitting on the panel, ruled in favor of the insurer because the language of the Travelers’policy was clear and unambiguous.

The First Circuit described the appeal as follows: “This is a meritless appeal from the district court’s summary judgment for the defendant Travelers Property Casualty Company of America on an underinsured motorist coverage claim brought by Paul Davis and his spouse.”

 Facts 

Davis was the manager of b oth the Maine and New Hampshire offices of Oce USA Holding, Inc., a subsidiary of a multinational corporation. He lived in Maine, where he kept a company car that was insured under a multistate policy issued by Travelers, by the terms of which he was an insured. While driving in New Hampshire on his way to the company office there, a driver conceded to be underinsured under the policy definition smashed into him and caused severe injury. 



 The Policy 

The terms and extent of legally required or conventional coverage against damage by uninsured and underinsured drivers vary from state to state, and business policies addressing multistate activity deal with the variety by separate endorsements, subject to selection and application in a given case according to the terms of the policy. Here, if the Maine endorsement applies, coverage is limited to $100,000 (much less than Davis’s claims), whereas the New Hampshire endorsement would extend the dollar limit to $5,000,000.

On the thirtieth page of the 562 page policy, this term appears:
 
 ITEM TWO COVERAGE AND LIMITS OF INSURANCE UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE AND UNDERINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE 

 The LIMIT OF INSURANCE for the coverages shown below is the LIMIT OF INSURANCE shown for the State where a covered“auto”is principally garaged. Refer to the specific coverage endorsement for description of the coverage provided for each State listed below. 
 
The district court held that the Maine terms apply.

 Analysis 

It is undisputed that the insured car was garaged in Maine and undisputed that the limi t of coverage under the Maine endorsement is $100,000. Since the limit of coverage is the point of contention, that should be the end of the matter, but the Davises say that the policy is infected with an ambiguity that entitles them to the higher New Hampshire limit, under the familiar standard (about which there is no choice of law issue) that policy language means what a reasonable insured person would take it to mean, and that language reasonably susceptible to more than one reading should be read in favor of the insured.

The Davises’only other attempts to show the New Hampshire endorsement applicable boil down to asserting that Mr. Davis could naturally expect New Hampshire law to apply because his accident occurred there, and because he received benefits under the New Hampshire workers’compensation law. But it is enough to say that these two considerations have nothing to do with any term of the policy in question and engender no ambiguity in its key to coverage by reference to principal garage state.

The First Circuit concluded that there is no reasonable basis for the Davises’claim.

 Lesson 

When dealing with a multi-state policy it might be the best protection for a corporate client by having the same limit of liability for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage equal to that purchased to protect third parties and not limit it to a particular state’s minimum.

 No UM Coverage for Assault&amp;Battery 
 Posted on October 10, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Operation, Maintenance, or Use of an Automobile Is Required for UM Coverage 

 Sometimes creative theories to bring an uninsured incident within coverage works. Most of the time the creativity fails. Uninsured motorist coverage requires that the injury that occurs must occur from the operation, maintenance, or use of an automobile. If the injury is from some other cause, whether in, on or upon a vehicle, there is still no coverage.

In Florida, the Court of Appeal was faced with such a creative argument in Allstate Insurance Company v. Jonathan Adrab i, No. 3D10-1573 (Fla.App. 10/05/2011). Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) appealed from a final judgment requiring it to cover $32,000 in damages sustained by Jonathan Adrabi under the uninsured motorist (“UM”) provisions of Adrabi’s Allstate policy.

 Facts 

In August 2000, Adrabi was the victim of a carjacking during which he was substantially injured. On the night in question, Adrabi was dropped off at his Ford Mustang by friends after an evening out. As Adrabi drove out of the parking lot where his car had been parked, he stopped behind another car at a stop sign. After Adrabi stopped his car, the occupants of the car ahead of him got out of their car and accosted him, injuring him while pushing him against, and then while forcing him into, his own car. The assailants also hit him with the barrel of a shotgun, forced him into the trunk of his car, and then drove around at high rates of speed, periodically slamming on the brakes, banging him against the interior of the trunk. The assailants also repeatedly taunted him with threats of violence and death, repeatedly playing a song titled“Kill You”through the car’s compact disc player.

Adrabi, after escaping from the villains, sought to recover under the UM provisions of the Allstate policy insuring his car, arguing that his vehicle became a UM vehicle once under the control of his assailants. Allstate denied the claim, Adrabi sued and the trial court below determined that Adrabi’s injuries were covered by the policy, and he was awarded $32,000 for his injuries.

 Analysis 

 The UM provision provides, in part: “We will pay damages for bodily injury . . . which a person insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured auto. Injury must be caused by accident and arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an uninsured . . . auto.”

The Court of Appeal concluded that Adrabi’s injuries did not arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a uninsured vehicle. By his own testimony, the injuries claimed all occurred at the hands of the assailants both inside and outside his Mustang-an auto covered by his Allstate policy-not a UM vehicle at all-and as such, his injuries were not covered by this policy.

The Allstate policy defines the term“uninsured auto”as:“(1) a motor vehicle which has no bodily injury insurance policy in effect at the time of the accident; (2) a motor vehicle for which the insurer denies coverage; or (3) a hit-and-run motor vehicle.”Adrabi’s car, even after being stolen, was none of these, and could not be a UM vehicle even after it was carjacked.

Under the uninsured motor vehicle coverage, the Court of Appeal concluded that Adrabi  is clearly barred by the language of the policy which provides that the vehicle insured under that policy cannot be considered to be an uninsured motor vehicle.

The Court referred to Race v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 542 So. 2d 347, 351 n.1 (Fla. 1989) (emphasis added), clearly states:
 
 PIP insurance covers injuries which arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle; whereas automobile liability UM coverage contemplates injuries which arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the tortfeasor’s motor vehicle. 
 
There was simply no evidence in this case that Adrabi’s injuries arose out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the assailants’vehicle. UM coverage for accidents“arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an automobile”does not extend coverage in circumstances“where the automobile merely transports or contained the assailant”.

I n this case the Court of Appeal noted that even if a UM vehicle were involved, using a vehicle to inflict injuries at the receiving end of a beating or the vehicle’s trunk as a vessel of containment in no way goes to the inherent nature of the automobile and thus, to the Court of Appeal’s thinking, Adrabi’s vehicle was no more than a mere contributor to the cause of the condition which produced the injury.  Injuries caused by criminal assaults in and about an automobile, but which are not caused by the automobile itself, or do not arise out of the operation, maintenance, or use of an automobile, are not covered under a policy of automobile liability or uninsured motorist coverage.

 Lesson 

Uninsured motorist insurance is a limited insurance coverage. It covers a person hit by a car while sitting on a bus bench or crossing the street. It does not, nor should it, cover injuries incurred in a criminal attack unless the uninsured motorist uses his uninsured car to commit the criminal act.

 The Birth of The Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
 Posted on October 7, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Something Different 

Usually I write about new cases from U.S. Appellate courts. Today, we go back to the beginnings of insurance law and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 The essence of insurance is the spreading of risk from one person to many. To properly do so, it is necessary that all parties involved in the contract of insurance treat each other equally with good faith and fair dealing.

Modern insurance law holds that each policy of insurance incorporates an implied covenant or agreement that both the insured and the insurer will deal with each other in utmost good faith. The covenant of good faith and fair dealing is presumed and is usually not a written part of the policy. Seldom is the birth of the covenant mentioned or well understood.

 1.     The Historical Basis for the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 

Lord Mansfield recognized in 1766 the implied covenant of good fait h and fair dealing. Regardless of its age, the case established as a matter of law and precedent, that an insurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith. It is worth the time and a struggle with the ancient language to study this case of first impression. I make no commentary and present the decision in full. As you read it see if it tracks with your understanding of US insurance law.
 
Carter v. Boehm S.C. 1 Bl. 593, 3 Burr 1906, 11th May 1766 

 This was an insurance cause, upon a policy underwritten by Mr. Charles Boehm, of interest, or no interest: without benefit of salvage. The insurance was made by the plaintiff, for the benefit of his brother, Governor George Carter. 

 It was tried before Lord Mansfield at Guildhall and a verdict was found for the plaintiff by a special jury of merchants. 

 On Saturday the 19th of April last, Mr. Recorder (Eyre,) on behalf of the defendant, moved for a new trial. His objection was, “that circumstances were not sufficiently disclosed.” 

 *** 

 Lord Mansfield reported the evidence — That it was an action on a policy of insurance for one year: viz. from 18th of October 1759 to 18th October 1760, for the benefit of the Governor of Fort Marlborough, George Carter, against the loss of Fort Marlborough in the island of Sumatra in the East Indies, by its being taken by a foreign enemy. 

 The event happened: the fort was taken, by Count D’Estaigne, within the year. 
 The first witness was Cawthorne, the policy broker, who produced the memorandum given by the governor’s brother (the plaintiff) to him: and the use made of these instructions was to shew that the insurance was made “for the benefit of Governor Carter, and to insure him against the taking of the fort by a foreign enemy.” 

 Both sides has been long in Chancery: and the Chancery-evidence on both sides was read at the trial. 

 It was objected, on behalf of the defendant, to be a fraud, by concealment of circumstances which ought to have been disclosed: and particularly, the weakness of the fort, and the probability of its being attacked by the French: which concealment was offered to be proved by two letters. The first was a letter from the governor to his brother, Roger Carter, his trustee, the plaintiff in this cause: the second was from the governor to the East India-Company. 
 The evidence in reply to this objection consisted of three depositions in Chancery, setting forth that the governor had 20,000 £, in effects: and only insured 10,000 £ and that he was guilty of no fault in defending the fort. 
 The first of these depositions was Captain Tryou’s: which proved that this was not a fort proper or designed to resist European enemies: but only calculated for defense against the natives of the island of Sumatra: and also that the governor’s office is not military, but only mercantile: and that Fort Marlborough is only a subordinate factory to Fort St. George. 

 There was no evidence to the contrary. And a verdict was found for the plaintiff by a special jury. 

 After his Lordship had made his report, — The counsel for the plaintiff proceeded to shew cause against a new trial. 

 They argued that there was no such concealment of circumstances (as the weakness of the fort, or the probability of the attack,) as would amount to a fraud sufficient to vitiate this contract: all which circumstances were universally known to every merchant upon the exchange of London. And all these circumstances, they said, were fully considered by a special jury of merchants, who are the proper judge of them. 

 And Mr. Dunning laid it down as a rule — “that the insured is only obliged to discover facts; not the ideas or speculations which he may entertain, upon such facts.” 

 They said, this insurance, was in reality, no more than a wager; “whether the French would think it their interest to attack this for: and if they should, whether they would be able to get a ship of war up the river, or not.” 

 Sir Fletcher Norton and Mr. Recorder (Eyre) argued, contra, for the defendant (the under-writer). 

 They insisted, that the insurer has a right to know as much as the insured himself knows. 

 They alleged too, that the broker is the sole agent of the insured. These are general, universal principles, in all insurances. Then they proceeded to argue in support of the present object. The broker had, they said, on being cross-examined, owned that he did not believe that the insurer would have meddled with the insurance, if he had seen these two letters. 
 All the circumstances out to be disclosed. 

 This wage is not only “whether the fort shall be attacked:” but “whether it shall be attacked and taken. 

 Whatever really increases the risk ought to be disclosed. Then they entered into the particulars which had been here kept concealed. And they insisted strongly, that the plaintiff ought to have discovered the weakness and absolute indefensibility of the fort. In this case, as against the insurer, he was obliged to make such discovery, though he acted for the governor. Indeed, a governor ought not, in point of policy, to be permitted to insure at all: but if he is permitted to insure, or will insure, he ought to disclose all facts. 

 It can not be supposed that the insurer would have insured so low as 41 per cent if he had known of these letters. 

 It is begging the question to say, “that a fort is not intended for defence against an enemy.” The supposition is absurd and ridiculous. It must be presumed that it was intended for that purpose: and the presumption was “that the fort, the powder, the guns&amp;c. were in good and proper condition.” If they were not, (and it is agreed that in fact they were not, and that the governor knew it,) it ought to have been disclosed. But if he had disclosed this, he could not have got the insurance. Therefore this was a fraudulent concealment: and the under-writer is not liable. 

 It does not follow, that because he did not insure his whole property: therefore it is good for what he has judged proper to insure. He might have his reasons for insuring only a part and not the whole. 

 *** 

 Lord Mansfield now delivered the resolution of the Court. 

 This is a motion for a new trial. In support of it, the counsel for the defendant contend, “that some circumstances in the knowledge of Governor Carter, not having been mentioned at the time the policy was underwrite, amount to a concealment, which ought, in law, to avoid the policy.” 

 The counsel for the plaintiff insist, “that the not mentioning these particulars does not amount to a concealment which ought, in law, to avoid the policy: either as a fraud: or, as varying the contract.” 

 1st:  It may be proper to say something, in general of concealments which avoid a policy. 

 2dly: To state particularly the case now under consideration. 

 3dly: To examine whether the verdict, which finds this policy good although the particulars objected were no mentioned, is well founded. 

 First. Insurance is a contract upon speculation. 

 The special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only: the under-writer trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the under-writer into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risk, as if it did not exist. 

 The keeping back such circumstance is a fraud, and therefore the policy is void. Although the suppression should happen through mistake, without any fraudulent intention; yet still the under-writer is deceived, and the policy is void; because the risk run is really different from the risk understood and intended to be run, at the time of the agreement. 

 The policy would equally be void against the under-writer, if he concealed: as, if he insured a ship on her voyage, which he privately knew to be arrived: and an action would lie to recover the premium. 

 The governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. 

 Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. 

 But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon…. 

 This definition of concealment, restrained to the efficient motives and precise subject of any contract, will generally hold to make it void, in favour of the party misled by his ignorance of the thing concealed. 

 There are many matters, as to which the insured may be innocently silent — he need not mention what the under-writer knows…. An under-writer can not insist that the policy is void, because the insured did not tell him what he actually knew: what way soever he came to the knowledge. 

 The insured need not mention what the under-writer ought to know: what he takes upon himself the knowledge of: or what he waves being informed of. 
 The under-writer needs not be told what lessens the risk agreed and understood to be run by the express terms of the policy. He needs not to be told general topics of speculation: as for instance — The under-writer is bound to know every cause which may occasion natural perils: as, the difficulty of the voyage — the kind of seasons — the probability of lightning, the hurricanes, earthquakes,&amp;tc. He is bound to know every cause which may occasion political perils: from the ruptures of States from war, and the various operations of it. He is bound to know the probability of safety, from the continuance of return of peace: from the imbecility of the enemy, through the weakness of their counsels, or their want of strength,&amp;tc. 

 If an under-writer insures private ships of war, by sea and on shore, from ports to ports, and places to places, any where — he needs not be told the secret enterprises they are destined upon: because he knows some expedition must be in view, and, from the nature of his contract, without being told, he waves the information. If he insures for three years, he needs not be told any circumstance to shew it may be over in two: or if he insures a voyage with liberty of deviation, he needs not be told what tends to shew there will be no deviation. 

 Men argue differently, from natural phenomena, and political appearances: they have different capacities, different degrees of knowledge, and different intelligence. But the means of information and judging are open to both: each professes to act from his own skill and sagacity; and therefore neither needs to communicate to the other. 

 The reason of the rule which obliges parties to disclose, is to prevent fraud, and to encourage good faith. It is adapted to such facts as vary the nature of the contract; which one privately knows, and the other is ignorant of, and has no reason to suspect. 

 The question therefore must always be “whether there was, under all the circumstances at the time the policy was under-written, a fair representation; or a concealment; fraudulent, if designed; or, though not designed, varying materially the object of the policy, and changing the risks understood to be run.” 
 This brings me, in the second place, to state the case now under consideration. 

 The policy is against the loss for Fort Marlborough, from being destroyed by, taken by, or surrendered unto, any European enemy, between the 1st of October 1759, and 1st of October 1760. It was under-written on the 9th of May 1760. 

 The under-writer knew at the time, that the policy was to indemnify, to that amount, Roger Carter the Governor of Fort Marlborough, in case the event insured against should happen. The governor’s instructions for the insurance, bearing date at Fort Marlborough the 22d of September 1759, were laid before the underwriter. Two actions upon this policy were tried before me in the year 1762. The defendants then knew of a letter written to the East India Company, which the Company offered to put into my hands; but would not deliver to the parties, because it contained some matters which they did not think proper to be made public. 

 An objection occurred to me at the trial, “whether a policy against the loss of Fort Marlborough, for the benefit of the governor, was good;” upon the principle which does not allow a sailor to insure his wages. 

 But considering that this place, though called a fort, was really but a factory or settlement for trade: and that he, though called a governor, was really but a merchant — considering too, that the law allows the captain of a ship to insure goods which he has on board, or his share in the ship, if he be a part-owner; and the captain of a privateer, if he be a part-owner, to insure his share — considering too, that the objection did not lie, upon any ground of justice, in the mouth of the under-writer who knew him to be the governor, at the time he took the premium — and as, with regard to principles of public convenience, the case so seldom happens, (I never saw one before,) any danger from the example is little to be apprehended — I did not think myself warranted, upon that point, to nonsuit the plaintiff; especially too, as the objection did not come from the bar. Though this point was mentioned, it was not insisted upon, at the last trial; nor has it been seriously argued, upon this motion, as sufficient, alone, to vacate the policy: and if it had, we are all of opinion that we are not warranted to say it is void, upon this account. 

 Upon the plaintiff’s obtaining these two verdicts, the underwriters went into a Court of Equity; where they have had an opportunity to sift every thing to the bottom, to get every discovery from the governor and his brother, and to examine any witnesses who were upon the spot. At last, after the fullest investigation of every kind, the present action came on to be tried at the sittings after last term. 

 The plaintiff proved without contradiction, that the place called Bencoolen or Fort Marlborough is a factory or settlement, but no military fort or fortress. That it was not established for a place of arms or defence against the attacks of an European enemy; but merely for the purpose of trade, and of defense against the natives. That the fort was only intended and built with an intent to keep off the country blacks. That the only security against European ships of war, consisted in the difficulty of the entrance and navigation of the river, for want of proper pilots. That the general state and condition of the said fort, and of the strength thereof, was, in general well known, by most persons conversant or acquainted with Indian affairs, or the state of the Company’s factories or settlement; and could not be kept secret or concealed from persons who should endeavor by proper inquiry, to inform themselves. That there was no apprehensions or intelligence of any attack by the French, until they attacked Nattal in Feb. 1760. That on the 8th of February 1760, there was no suspicion of any design by the French. That the governor then bought, from the witness, goods to the value of 4000£ and had goods to the value of above 20,000£ and then dealt for 50,000£ and upwards. 

 That on the 1st of April 1760, the fort was attacked by a French man of war of 64 guns and a frigate of twenty guns under the Count D’Estaigne, brought in by Dutch pilots; unavoidably taken; and afterwards delivered to the Dutch; and the prisoners sent to Batavia. 

 On the part of the defendant — after all the opportunities of inquiry, no evidence was offered, that the French ever had any design upon Fort Marlborough, before the end of March 1760; or that there was the least intelligence or alarm “that they might make the attempt,” till the taking of Nattal in the year 1760. 

 They did not offer to disprove the evidence, that the governor had acted, as in full security, long after the month of September 1759; and had turned his money into goods, so late as the 8th of February 1760. There was no attempt to shew that he had not lost be the capture very considerably beyond the value of the insurance. 

 But the defendant relied upon a letter, written to the East India Company, bearing date the 16th of September 1759, which was sent to England by the “Pitt,” Captain Wilson, who arrived in May 1760, together with the instructions for insuring; and also a letter bearing the 22d of September 1759, sent to the plaintiff by the same conveyance, and at the same time (which letters his Lordship repeated). 

 They relied too upon the cross-examination of the broker who negotiated the policy, “that, in his opinion, these letters ought to have been shewn, or the contents disclosed; and if they had, the policy would not have been underwritten.” 

 The defendant’s counsel contended at the trial, as they have done upon this motion, “that the policy was void.” — 

 1st: Because the state and condition of the fort, mentioned in the governor’s letter to the East India Company, was not disclosed. 

 The latter letter (to his brother) owns that he is “now more afraid than formerly, that the French should attack and take the settlement; for, as they can not muster a force to relieve their friends at the coast, they may, rather than remain idle, pay us a visit. It seems, that they had such a intention, last year.” And therefore he desires his brother to get an insurance made upon his stock there. 
 2dly: Because he did not disclose, that the French, not being in a condition to relieve their friends upon the coast, were more likely to make an attack upon the settlement, rather than remain idle. 

 3dly: That he had not disclosed his having received a letter of the 4th February 1759, from which it seemed that the French had a design to take this settlement, by surprise, the year before. 

 They all contended, that the opinion of the broker was almost decisive. The whole was laid before the jury; who found for the plaintiff. 
 Thirdly — It remains to consider these objections, and to examine “whether this verdict is well founded.” 

 To this purpose, it is necessary to consider the nature of the contract, at the time it was entered into. 

 The policy was signed in May 1760. The contingency was “whether Fort Marlborough was or would be taken, by an European enemy, between October 1759 and October 1760.” 

 The computation of the risk depended upon the chance, “whether any European power would attack the place by sea.” If they did, it was incapable of resistance. 

 The under-writer at London, in May 1760, could judge much better of the probability of the contingency, than Governor Carter could at Fort Marlborough, in September 1759. He knew the success of the operations of the war in Europe. He knew what naval force the English and French had sent to the East Indies. He knew, from a comparison of that force, whether the sea was open to any such attempt by the French. He knew, or might know every thing which was known at Fort Marlborough in September 1759, of the general state of affairs in the East Indies, or the particular condition of Fort Marlborough, by the ship which brought the orders for the insurance. He knew that ship must have brought many letters to the East India Company; and, particularly, from the governor. He knew what probability there was of the Dutch committing or having committed hostilities. 

 Under these circumstances, and with this knowledge, he insures against the general contingency of the place being attacked by an European power. 
 If there had been any design on foot, or any enterprise begun in September, 1759, to the knowledge of the governor, it would have varied the risk understood by the underwriter; because not being told of a particular design or attack then subsisting, he estimated the risk upon the foot of an incertain operation, which might or might not be attempted. 

 But the governor had no notice of any design subsisting in September, 1759. There was no such design in fact: the attempt was made without premeditation, from the sudden opportunity of a favourable occasion, by the connivance and assistance of the Dutch, which tempted Count D’Estaigne to break his parol. 

 These being the circumstances under which the contract was entered into, we shall be better able to judge of the objections upon the foot of concealment. 

 The first concealment is, that he did not disclose the condition of the place. The underwriter knew the insurance was for the governor. He knew the governor must be acquainted with the state of the place. He knew the governor could not disclose it, consistent with his duty. He knew the governor, by insuring, apprehended at least the possibility of an attack. With this knowledge,without asking a question, he underwrote. 

 By so doing, he took the knowledge of the state of the place upon himself. It was a matter as to which he might be informed various ways: it was not a matter within the private knowledge of the governor only. 

 But, not to rely upon that — The utmost which can be contended is, that the underwriter trusted to the fort being in the condition in which it ought to be: in like manner as it is taken for granted, that a ship insured is sea-worthy. 

 What is that condition? All the witnesses agree “that it was only to resist the natives, and not an European force.” The policy insures against a total loss; taking for granted “that if the place was attacked it would be lost.” 

 The contingency therefore which the under-writer has insured against is, “whether the place would be attacked by an European force; and not whether it would be able to resist such an attack, if the ships could get up the river.” 

 It was particularly left to the jury, to consider, “whether this was the contingency in the contemplation of the parties:” they have found that it was. 
 And we are all of opinion, “that, in this respect, their conclusion is agreeable to the evidence.” 

 In this view, the state and condition of the place was material only in case of a land attack by the natives. 

 The second concealment is — his not having disclosed, that, from the French not being able to relieve their friends upon the coast, they might make them a visit. 

 This is no part of the fact of the case: it is a mere speculation of the governor’s from the general state of the war. The conjecture was dictated to him from his fears. It is a bold attempt, for the conquered to attack the conqueror in his own dominions. The practicability of it in this case, depended upon the English naval force in those seas; which the underwriter could better judge of at London in May, 1760, than the governor could at Fort Marlborough in September, 1759. 

 The third concealment is — that he did not disclose the letter, from Mr. Winch, of the 4th of February, 1759, mentioning the design of the French, the year before. 

 What that letter was; how he mentioned the design, or upon what authority he mentioned it; or by whom the design was supposed to be imagined, does not appear. The defendant has had every opportunity of discovery; and nothing has come out upon it, as to this letter, which he thinks makes for his purpose. 

 The plaintiff offered to read the account Winch wrote to the East India Company: which was objected to; and therefore not read. The nature of that intelligence therefore is very doubtful. But taking it in the strongest light, it is a report of a deign to surprise, the year before; but then dropt. 

 This is a topic of mere general speculation; which made no part of the fact of the case upon which the insurance was to be made. 

 It was said — If a man insured a ship, knowing that two privateers were lying in her way, without mentioning that circumstance, it would be a fraud — I agree it. But if he knew that two privateers had been there the year before, it would be no fraud, not to mention that circumstance: because, it does not follow that they will cruise this year at the same time, in the same place; or that they are in a condition to do it. If the circumstance of “this design laid aside” had been mentioned, it would have tended rather to lessen the risk, than increase it: for, the design of a surprise which has transpired, and been laid aside, is less likely to be taken up again; especially by a vanquished enemy. 

 The jury considered the nature of the governor’s silence, as to these particulars: they thought it innocent: and that the omission to mention them did not vary the contract. And we are all of opinion, “that, in this respect, they judged extremely right.” 

 There is a silence, not objected to at the trial nor upon this motion; which might with as much reason have been objected to, as the two last omissions; rather more. 

 It appears by the governor’s (22d September 1759) letter to the plaintiff, “that he was principally apprehensive of a Dutch war.” [his words are — “and in case of a Dutch war, I would have it (the insurance) done at any rate.”] He certainly had, what he thought, good grounds for his apprehension. Count D’Estaigne being piloted by the Dutch, delivering the fort to the Dutch, and sending the prisoners to Batavia, is a confirmation of those grounds. And probably, the loss of the place was owing to the Dutch. The French could not have got up the river without Dutch pilots: and it is plain, the whole was concerted with them. And yet, at the time of underwriting the policy, there was no intimation about the Dutch. 

 The reason why the counsel have not objected to his not disclosing the grounds of this apprehension, is, because it must have arisen from political speculation, and general intelligence; therefore, they agree, it is not necessary to communicate such things to an underwriter. 

 Lastly — Great stress was laid upon the opinion of the broker. But we all think, the jury ought not to pay the least regard to it. It is mere opinion; which is not evidence. It is opinion after an event. It is opinion without the least foundation from any previous precedent or usage. It is an opinion which, if rightly formed, could only be drawn from the same premises from which the Court and jury were to determine the cause: and therefore it is improper and irrelevant in the mouth of a witness. 

 There is no imputation upon the governor, as to any intention of fraud. By the same conveyance, which brought his orders to insure, he wrote to the company everything which he knew or suspected: he desired nothing to be kept a secret, which he wrote either of them or his brother. His subsequent conduct, down to the 8th of February 1760, shewed that he thought the danger very improbable. 
 The reason of the rule against concealment is, to prevent fraud and encourage good faith. 

 If the defendant’s objections were to prevail, in the present case, the rule would be turned into an instrument of fraud. 

 The underwriter, here, knowing the governor to be acquainted with the state of the place; knowing that he apprehended danger, and must have some ground for his apprehension; being told nothing of either; signed this policy, without asking a question. 

 If the objection “that he was not told” is sufficient to vacate it, he took the premium, knowing the policy to be void; in order to gain, it the alternative turned out one way; and to make no satisfaction, if it turned out the other: he drew the governor into a false confidence, “that, if the worst should happen, he had provided against total ruin;” knowing, at the same time, “that the indemnity to which the governor trusted was void.” 

 There was not a word said to him, of the affairs of India, or the state of the war there, or the condition of Fort Marlborough. If he thought the omission an objection at the time, he ought not to have signed the policy with a secret reserve in his own mind to make it void; if he dispensed with the information, and did not think this silence an objection then; he cannot take it up now, after the event. 

 What has often been said of the Statute of Frauds may, with more propriety, be applied to every rule of law, drawn from principles of natural equity, to prevent fraud — “That it should never be so turned, construed, or used, as to protect, or be a means of fraud.” 

 After the fullest deliberation, we are all clear that the verdict is well founded: and there ought not to be a new trial: consequently, that the rule for that purpose ought to be discharged. 

 The end of Easter term, 1766, 6 G. 3.

 Additional Insured Coverage Established by Executed Contract 
 Posted on October 6, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Additional insured coverage results in litigation on a regular basis. Insurers add additional insureds without individually underwriting the risk posed by the additional insured. Since most builders want to shift the risk of loss to those building structures they will require the subcontractor to have its insurer name the builder and owner as an additional insured. The litigation is often between multiple insurers all of whom insured the same risk, either as direct insurers or as insurers of additional insureds.

Failure to shift the risk of loss by means of an additional insured endorsement deprives the subcontractor of the work and unable to pay premium. In Evanston Insurance Company v. Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company ; et al, No. 10-36133 (9th Cir. 10/03/2011) the Ninth Circuit dealt with whether an agreement to add an additional insured was an “executed” contract that bound Westchester to defend the owner.

American Guarantee&amp;Liability Insurance Company (“American Guarantee”) appealed from the district court’s judgment, following a bench trial, in favor of Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company (“Westchester”) and Royal Insurance Company (“Royal”), in this“additional insured”insurance coverage dispute.

The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law that is reviewed by a court of appeal as if it were the trial court.

 Facts 

The district court concluded that Northwest Tower Crane Services (“N orthwest”), a subcontractor at a large construction site, did not enter into a contract requiring Northwest to add Bellevue Master LLC (“Bellevue Master”) as an additional insured on Northwest’s liability insurance policies.

Bellevue Master sent a fax to Northwest on February 22, 2001 that offered to allow Northwest to continue working as a subcontractor at the construction project provided it complied with Bellevue Master’s insurance requirements. Northwest contacted its insurance broker and requested that the broker issue the insurance certificate to Bellevue Master. In common law the fax was an offer, the request for the certificate was an acceptance and doing the work passed consideration between Bellevue Master and Northwest which created a contract.

The contract for insurance between Northwest and Bellevue Master was fully executed prior to loss, as was required for Bellevue Master to be covered under the Westchester and Royal policies. 

 Analysis 

 An executed contract is one written and signed or a contract that has been fully performed by both parties. Under Washington law, undefined contractual terms must be given their“plain, ordinary, and popular”meaning. Because Bellevue Master made an offer which Northwest accepted through performance, the Ninth Circuit concluded that contract was executed.

The additional insured coverage of the Westchester policy applies only to liability arising out of Northwest’s“ongoing operations”performed for Bellevue Master. Washington courts have interpreted such clauses and have found that“the endorsement evinces an intent to provide coverage to the additional insured only for liability that arises while the work is still in progress,”such as in the“course of construction work site accident involving bodily injury or property damage.”[Hartford Ins. Co. v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 189 P.3d 195, 201--02 (Wash. Ct. App. 2008).]

The manlift work at issue occurred in the course of Northwest’s work at the same construction project involved in Northwest’s and Bellevue Master’s earlier contracted work. Therefore, the work was covered by the“ongoing operations”clause of the Westchester policy.

Bellevue Master contacted Northwest directly to perform the work at issue. Northwest accepted the offer, performed the work, and was paid directly by Northwest. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the district court erred when it concluded that Northwest did not agree in a contract to make Bellevue Master an additional insured and reversed the judgment of the trial court. 





 Lesson 

If all the policy requires to make a person an additional insured – as do many CGL policies – before refusing to defend or indemnify the insurer should conduct a thorough investigation and determine if there is a contract whether in writing signed by all parties involved or an “executed” contract formed by multiple documents and the actions of the parties.

 Compliance With Conditions Must Be Proved 
 Posted on October 5, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Failure to Prove Compliance With Conditions&amp;Answer Investigative Questions 

I f insurance fraud is suspected and the insurer demands examination under oath and production of documents it is the obligation of the person insured to cooperate fully. A suit against an insurer requires that the insured prove the contract and that the insured complied with all the conditions of the contract. In Lisa Fletcher v. Progressive Casualty Insurance Company , No. C066145 (Cal.App. Dist.3 10/03/2011) the Court of Appeal granted a non suit because of the failure to prove the contract of insurance and compliance with the policy conditions.

Lisa Fletcher challenged the trial court’s order dismissing her claim for breach of contract against her automobile insurance carrier, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (Progressive). Fletcher sued to recover the value of her 2003 Land Rover, which had been found burned. Progressive considered the circumstances of the vehicle’s loss to be suspicious and denied Fletcher’s claim after she refused to produce financial documents.

Fletcher contended that the trial court erred by

(1)     granting Progressive’s motion for non-suit,
(2)     denying her motion to file a supplemental complaint,
(3)     denying her motion to amend her complaint to conform to proof adduced at trial, and
(4)     denying her motion to tax costs based on a bad faith settlement offer by Progressive made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998.

 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

 Fletcher’s Claim and Progressive’s Denial 

At 1:44 a.m. on May 22, 2006, the Sacramento Fire Department received a call about a fire. When the fire department arrived at the scene, they found Fletcher’s Land Rover fully engulfed in flames.

On May 23, 2006, Fletcher met with Rita Sharma, a fire and theft claims adjuster for Progressive. Fletcher asserted that the Land Rover had been stolen and presented a claim for the vehicle in the amount of $50,719.44.

In June 2006, Sharma discussed the claim with her supervisors because it seemed suspicious. Sharma’s supervisors, Kelly Dobbins and Eric Snitzler, agreed that some red flags appeared in Sharma’s investigation. The claim raised suspicions for several reasons, including Fletcher’s past due payments on the vehicle, her attempts to sell the vehicle prior to its loss, the condition of the vehicle when it was located, and the lack of tampering with the vehicle’s ignition. Moreover, Progressive’s initial investigation revealed several misrepresentations by Fletcher. Fletcher first denied any attempt to sell the Land Rover, but later admitted listing it for sale during a 10-day period. Progressive discovered that the vehicle had been advertised for a lower price than Fletcher reported. Fletcher stated that she called the police immediately after she discovered the vehicle missing, but her cell phone records indicated that the call had been made“much later.”And, Fletcher’s account of discovering the vehicle to be missing differed from what Progressive learned during its initial investigation.

Sharma and her supervisors reached the conclusion that Progressive needed to investigate Fletcher’s claim further. Thus, Sharma called Fletcher on June 23, 2006, to explain that a field investigation would be conducted. Dobbins referred the claim to Progressive’s coverage counsel, Teresa Starinieri, for additional investigation and to take Fletcher’s examination under oath. Starinieri requested some financial documents but Fletcher’s attorney refused to provide them. Consequently, Progressive was unable to complete its investigation of the claim. Progressive supervisors disc ussed Fletcher’s claim and concluded that it should be denied.

On January 2, 2007, Progressive mailed to Fletcher’s attorney an 11-page letter in which it denied the insurance claim. Among the grounds listed for the denial of the claim were Fletcher’s material misrepresentations to Progressive and her refusal to provide the requested financial documents.

In May 2009, Fletcher filed a complaint alleging a single cause of action for moneys due under an auto insurance policy.

 Progressive’s Motion for Non-suit 

A jury trial commenced on July 20, 2010. After calling Sharma and Dobbins as witnesses, Fletcher rested her case. Progressive moved for non-suit on grounds that Fletcher had not proven an element of her cause of action, namely that she performed all the conditions of the insurance policy. Progressive argued that Fletcher’s refusal to produce financial documents at Progressive’s request violated the express terms of the auto insurance policy. Fletcher’s counsel opposed the motion but acknowledged, in an amazing blast of truth, that Fletcher“didn’t live up to the duties of the policy, and that’s fair enough.”The trial court then granted Fletcher’s motion to reopen her case.

Fletcher testified on her own behalf, recounting that she and her husband had been on vacation in Canada from May 14 to 21, 2006. On the evening of May 21, their son picked them up from the airport. The next morning, Fletcher discovered that her Land Rover was missing. The vehicle was gone despite the fact that both sets of keys were still in her kitchen drawer. Thinking that she might have left the Land Rover at her place of employment, she drove one of her husband’s trucks to check. When she did not see the Land Rover at her workplace, Fletcher immediately reported the theft to the police. Fletcher acknowledged that her cell phone records listed no call to the police but asserted that the records did show a later call to the Yuba County Sheriff’s department.

 Fletcher admitted that she and her husband filed for bankruptcy in November 2009. However, she claimed that her attempt to sell the Land Rover in 2006 was not motivated by financial necessity. Following her testimony, Fletcher rested her case a second time.

Progressive again moved for non-suit. The court indicated its inclination to grant the motion as follows:“[T]here’s been no dispute that there were records that, and I’m not talking about records in possession of the third party, I’m talking about records in the possession of [] Fletcher that she did not provide before her [examination under oath]. She, apparently, based on the testimony, she—they weren’t provided after the [examination under oath], and there was an ongoing objection, and she relied on advice of counsel, which this case says that you cannot rely on advice of counsel in this context. And the coverage—or the claim was subsequently denied. There was no additional information given after the denial.”

At the court’s request, the parties submitted written briefing on the motion for non-suit. After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion for non-suit.

At some point Fletcher moved for a new trial and Progressive opposed the motion. The trial court denied the motion for new trial on the same grounds as its granting of Progressive’s motion for non-suit.

 Analysis 

When testifying on her own behalf, Fletcher admitted that“the policy provides that it authorizes the insurance company to have access to your business and personal records as often as the insurance company reasonably requires.”Fletcher also acknowledged that the policy stated,“We may not be sued unless there is full compliance by you or an insured with . . . all the terms of this policy.”

As part of Progressive’s investigation, its coverage counsel requested that Fletcher bring specified financial documents with her to her examination under oath. Fletcher’s attorney objected on grounds of privacy and relevance. After Fletcher’s examination under oath, Progressive again requested the financial documents. The parties never resolved the dispute over production of Fletcher’s financial information. Fletcher conceded that she also did not“provide anything to Progressive after [she] got this letter [denying her claim] and before [she] filed the lawsuit against the insurance company two or two and a half years later.”

The trial court granted the non-suit because plaintiff was unable, despite being permitted to reopen her case, to demonstrate an element of her cause of action, cooperation in the investigation of her claim by the carrier and cited to Abdelhamid v. Fire Ins. Exchange (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 990.

“The duty to cooperate with the carrier’s investigation was a condition precedent to the commencement of the action, i.e., an element of the cause of action. Under Abdelhamid, the carrier was entitled to request the financial documents the plaintiff refused to produce, and, under that case, reliance on advice of counsel in refusing to cooperate does not obviate the refusal to cooperate. The relevant period for determining whether there was evidence of cooperation is the period during which the claim was being evaluated, that is, before it was denied. Because plaintiff refused to cooperate with the carrier, she failed to establish that element of her cause of action.”

 The trial court granted the motion for non-suit based on Fletcher’s failure to introduce evidence showing her compliance with the insurance policy’s requirement to cooperate with an investigation of a claim. A plaintiff’s compliance with the terms of the insurance policy constitutes an element of the breach of contract claim asserted by Fletcher. The standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom. Based on Fletcher’s noncompliance with the terms of the insurance policy, she could not prove the second element of her breach of contract claim.

In Abdelhamid, a similar case involving a law suit by a policyholder for breach of contract after the insurance carrier denied a claim for loss of a house that had been subject to arson, this court upheld the insurance carrier’s denial of a claim based on the policyholder’s non-cooperation in the investigation of the claim, including the policyholder’s refusal to submit a completed claim form, answer material questions, and produce requested financial information. As this court explained, an insured’s compliance with a policy requirement to submit to an examination under oath is a prerequisite to the right to receive benefits under the policy.  A refusal of the insured to answer material questions at an examination under oath (provided for in the policy), shows a failure to give to the insurer that degree of cooperation required by the provisions of the policy and is a violation of the agreement of the insured to submit to such examination under oath.

Where the insurer has reason to suspect arson, it is relevant and material to inquire into the financial condition of the insured because an insurer is entitled to develop circumstantial evidence of the insured’s involvement in the suspected arson. 

As in Abdelhamid, the plaintiff in this case failed to satisfy the insurance policy condition to cooperate with an investigation of a claim for loss. The trial court correctly noted that Fletcher’s own testimony established her inability to prove that she satisfied the policy requirement to cooperate with an investigation by Progressive. On the witness stand, Fletcher conceded that the insurance policy required her cooperation, that Progressive repeatedly requested her financial information, and that Fletcher’s attorney refused to hand over the documents. This testimony established Fletcher’s failure to prove an element of her breach of contract claim, i.e., her performance of all terms of the insurance policy. ( Abdelhamid, supra , 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 999.) For lack of proof, the trial court correctly granted Progressive’s motion for non-suit.

Fletcher attempts to distinguish Abdelhamid on grounds that the prejudice in that case was not present here. The documentation that the insurer sought with respect to plaintiff’s claimed losses was essential to a determination of the extent of her claim. The insurer’s requested documentation and queries regarding her financial status were, however, even more fundamental. The financial information sought went to the heart of its investigation of whether there was circumstantial evidence of plaintiff’s involvement in the arson of her Land Rover or whether there was a reasonable explanation for the many suspicious circumstances uncovered by the insurer’s investigation. This addressed the very validity of her claim.
 
The Court of Appeal rejected Fletcher’s attempt to distinguish Abdelhamid by asserting that Progressive did not conclude she was complicit in the vehicle’s loss. Progressive was unable to conclude anything about the loss because it was unable to complete its investigation. Fletcher’s refusal to cooperate with Progressive’s investigation constituted the obstacle. Her financial condition was directly relevant to the investigation and was called into question by her own misrepresentations to Progressive and by the“red flags”surrounding the vehicle’s loss.

Fletcher recovered nothing in trial or on appeal because the deficiencies in plaintiff’s proof of loss were a far cry from minor defects and no reasonable trier of fact could conclude she substantially performed her obligations or complied with the condition of her insurance contract requiring her to provide a proof of loss with supporting documentation.

An insurer’s offer to consider additional evidence in a denial letter did not “reopen” the door to its obligations and duties under the policy by making this offer.  On the stand, Fletcher admitted that she had not given Progressive any additional evidence since the denial of her claim. Thus, Progressive had no reason to reevaluate the claim after its thwarted investigation.

The order dismissing Lisa Fletcher’s case was affirmed. Progressive Casualty Insurance Company shall recover its costs on appeal.

By refusing to cooperate in Progressive’s investigation of her claim, a condition of the insurance policy, Fletcher cannot allege all the elements for a breach of contract action. Fletcher’s attempt to file a tort cause of action in a supplemental complaint fails because the action is time barred. Similarly, Fletcher’s motion to amend her complaint to conform to proof at trial fails because the additional allegations for her contract cause of action did not excuse her non-cooperation in Progressive’s investigation of her claim and her attempt to add a tort-based cause of action is time barred. Finally, Fletcher’s appeal of the trial court’s denial of her motion to tax costs is deemed forfeited for lack of an adequate appellate record.

 Lessons 

When faced with a suspicious claim insurers are required to conduct a thorough investigation which is required by the California Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations and California law to include a demand for production of relevant documents, a demand for a sworn statement in proof of loss and the examination under oath of the insured. If the insured refuses to provide the documents demanded or answer questions at examination under oath that are material to the investigation, the claim should be denied.

Counsel representing an insured should not refuse to produce relevant or material documents including financial documents. California Insurance Code Section 2071 requires the insurer shall inform the insured that tax returns are privileged against disclosure under applicable law but may be necessary to process or determine the claim. Therefore, the insured may even be required to produce tax returns. Counsel should be very careful before advising the insured to refuse to produce documents.

 Misrepresentation of Material Fact Allows Insurer to Rescind 
 Posted on October 4, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Don’t Lie to Your Insurer 

 Almost every liability policy or errors and omissions policy issued in the United States asks if the potential insured knows of a claim that has been asserted against the potential insured. A false answer to that question whether made with an intent to deceive or made unintentionally or innocently, provides the insurer with the right to rescind the policy issued based on an application that deceived the insurer. In Admiral Insurance Company v. Pif High Yield Fund Ii, Formerly Known As Wm Trust High Yield Fund, No. 10-15830 (9th Cir. 09/29/2011), the Ninth Circuit, in a not officially reported decision affirmed a rescission because of a material misrepresentation.

 Facts 

A group of holders of notes issued by now-defunct SONICblue, Inc. (the“1996 Bondholders”) appeal the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Admiral Insurance Company (“Admiral”) on the basis of rescission, and the district court’s denial of the 1996 Bondholders’cross-motion for summary judgment. Admiral cross-appealed, challenging the district court’s denial of the alternative bases for relief contained in its motion for summary judgment.

The meaning and construction of an insurance policy is a question of law reviewed de novo . Words used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning that a layperson would attach to them.

The November 14, 2002 letter from the 1996 Bondholders constituted a written demand for money or services. The Ninth Circuit concluded that SONICblue should have revealed the letter to Admiral in response to a specific question in the application for the Admiral policy. As a result, rescission is warranted in this case citing to Nieto v. Blue Shield of Cal. Life&amp;Health Ins. Co ., 181 Cal. App. 4th 60, 75-78 (2010); Mitchell v. United Nat’l Ins. Co. , 127 Cal. App. 4th 457, 468-69 (2005).]

Although not a decision that is appropriate as precedent this case applies clear California law that a misrepresentation of a material fact – like a pending claim – is a strong basis for rescission.

 Lesson 

When presenting an application for insurance it is the duty of every applicant to be certain that each question on the application for insurance are answered correctly, honestly, and without nuance. Failure to provide honest responses gives power to the insurer to declare the policy void from its inception if it can prove the materiality of the false answer with the individual underwriter who accepted the risk.

 CGL Provides No Uninsured Motorist Coverage 
 Posted on October 4, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Arizona Court Refuses to Create Insurance Not Purchased 

 When people fail to insure themselves they often attempt creative litigation to obtain coverage from others.  Sometimes the injured and their lawyers forget that the purpose of the Uninsured Motorist statute is to guarantee that responsible drivers will have an opportunity to protect themselves and their loved ones as they would others.

When a person was injured by an uninsured motorist in Arizona while being driven by a mechanic’s employee the injured person attempted to change a business owners policy (“BOP”) into an uninsured motorist policy because the Uninsured Motorist (“UM”) coverage was not offered and the UM coverage of the auto policy was not sufficient. The effort failed in A nthony Jackson and Leticia Jackson, A Married Couple v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, A Foreign Insurance Company, No. 2 CA-CV 2011-0001 (Ariz.App.Div.2 09/30/2011).

 Facts 

Anthony and Leticia Jackson appealed from the trial court’s grant of Appellee Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company’s motion for summary judgment and the denial of the Jacksons’ motion for new trial in this declaratory action against Nationwide and its subsidiary AMCO Insurance Company (collectively “Nationwide”). The Jacksons’ argued the court erred in concluding that Arizona’s Uninsured Motorist Act (UMA), did not require Nationwide to offer uninsured motorist coverage under the Businessowner’s Policy it had provided to an automobile service and repair station. Anthony Jackson sustained injuries while riding as a passenger in his own vehicle, when it was being driven by a service station employee and was struck by another vehicle. 

In January 2005, Anthony Jackson had mechanical problems with his automobile and stopped at a Chevron repair station. Jackson had planned to leave his vehicle at the station, but, as the parties stipulated, a Chevron employee “offered to show Jackson how to drive the [vehicle] with its mechanical problems.” Jackson accepted, and the employee drove Jackson’s vehicle with Jackson in the passenger seat. After Jackson’s vehicle entered a roadway adjacent to the Chevron station, it was struck by another vehicle driven by Eduardo Martinez and Jackson was injured. Neither Martinez, who was at fault, nor his vehicle was insured.

Chevron carried two insurance policies, a Business Auto Policy (BAP) issued by Nationwide and a BOP issued by AMCO. The policies were issued by the same agent at the same time as part of the same transaction, and were effective for the same time period. The BAP provided coverage for a wide range of risks for motor vehicles used in Chevron’s business. Under the policy, Nationwide provided liability coverage for bodily injury or property damage caused by an accident involving a “covered “auto.” The policy also contained an uninsured motorist (UM) endorsement under which Nationwide agreed to “pay all sums the ‘insured’ is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an “uninsured motor vehicle.”

 After the Jacksons recovered damages under the UM endorsement to Chevron’s BAP, they filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a judicial determination that UM coverage should be imputed to the BOP. The Jacksons and Nationwide filed motions for summary judgment and stipulated that the only issue to be decided was “whether [Nationwide] was required to offer UM coverage to [Chevron] on the BOP.” After a hearing, the trial court granted Nationwide’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Jacksons’ motion. The Jacksons filed a motion for new trial, in which they argued the court erred in finding Nationwide was not required to offer UM coverage on the BOP and essentially reurged the arguments they had made on summary judgment. The court denied the motion.

 Analysis 

The trial court concluded the BOP was a general commercial liability policy that provided excess liability coverage and was not a primary automobile liability insurance policy. On appeal, the Jacksons contend the court erred, arguing the BOP was a primary motor vehicle insurance policy subject to the requirements of the UM Statute.

The Arizona statute provides:
 
 Every insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies shall make available to the named insured thereunder and by written notice offer the insured and at the request of the insured shall include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage which extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy. The selection of limits or rejection of coverage by a named insured or applicant on a form approved by the director is valid for all insureds under the policy. . . . 
 
 Because the Arizona UM statute mandates that an insurer offer UM coverage for every automobile liability policy issued to an Arizona insured, the proper remedy for failing to do so is “to include the coverage in the policy by operation of law.” However, the legislature excepted from this provision “any general commercial liability policy, excess policy, umbrella policy or other policy that does not provide primary motor vehicle insurance.”

The UM statute was created to guarantee that responsible drivers have an opportunity to protect themselves and their loved ones as they would others. To carry out this purpose the statute mandates that insurers offer UM coverage to their insureds in the form of “written notice.” Failure to give the notice will result in a court imputing the coverage existed.

The BOP issued to Chevron provided typical commercial general liability coverage. The BAP, issued at the same time, provides the type of coverage typically found in a motor vehicle liability policy, including UM coverage. The BAP was issued to Chevron at the same time as the BOP, it covered the same policy period and the insured was offered UM coverage in connection with the transaction.

Because the BOP is a CGL policy not intended to be the first or only source of insurance coverage, it does not provide primary motor vehicle insurance, and falls within the exception created by the statute. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded that the policy was not subject to the written notice requirement of the statute and UM coverage may not be imputed based on Nationwide’s failure to offer UM coverage.

 Lesson 

 Remember the purpose of UM coverage is to guarantee that responsible drivers will have an opportunity to protect themselves and their loved ones as they would others. It does not guarantee coverage if the “responsible drivers” fail to exercise the opportunity and act irresponsibly. The Jacksons owned the vehicle that was involved in the accident and had the opportunity to obtain UM coverage. The decision of the Court of Appeal is unclear but it appears that the Jacksons’ either had no UM coverage or inadequate coverage.

The Jacksons learned the hard way that their failure could not be cured by trying to create coverage where none existed.  Every suit against an insurer, no matter how creative, does not result in a judgment in favor of an injured person.

This case teaches that every person with an auto insurance policy should obtain at least the same amount of uninsured motorist coverage as we buy to protect those you might injure. If the Jacksons had accepted the fact that the lack of sufficient insurance was their own fault they would have saved a great deal in legal expenses and costs.

 Concurrent Cause Raises Possibility of Coverage and Requires Defense 
 Posted on October 3, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Anti-Concurrent Cause Language Should Apply to Entire Policy 

Ever since the California Supreme Court decided State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Partridge (1973) 10 Cal. 3d 94 [109 Cal. Rptr. 811, 514 P.2d 123] established the “concurrent cause” doctrine courts across the country have struggled with policy interpretation when more than one cause combines to create a loss. As the California Supreme Court observed in Garvey v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. , 48 Cal. 3d 395, 770 P.2d 704, 257 Cal. Rptr. 292 (Cal. 03/30/1989), a first party insurance policy provides coverage for loss or damage sustained directly by the insured (e.g., life, disability, health, fire, theft, and casualty insurance) while a third-party liability policy, in contrast, provides coverage for liability of the insured to a third party. The concurrent cause doctrine applies to third party coverages but not to first party coverages.

Until Garvey insurers attempted to avoid the problem by placing wording in the policy that eliminated the concurrent cause analysis. In Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company v. Jeffrey Crispo&amp;Another, No. 10-P-1299. (Mass.App. 09/26/2011) a Massachusetts appellate court found coverage for an insured in a liability policy issue when one cause of loss was covered and another was not because the insurer failed to make its anti-concurrent-cause language in apply to the liability section of the policy as it had in the property section.

 Facts 

At approximately 9:10 P.M. on Saturday, August 13, 2005, a ferry operated by a company doing business as Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) struck two stationary boats tied together and anchored in Boston Harbor, sinking both. One of the two boats was a power boat owned by the defendants Jeffrey and Nicole Crispo (the Crispos). The other was a lobster boat owned and operated by Jeffrey’s brother, Steven Crispo. The Crispos and Steven (in separate actions) sought to recover damages from BHC, and BHC in turn asserted claims for indemnification and contribution against the Crispos, contending that the Crispos’negligence caused the accident.

The Crispos sought personal liability coverage under their homeowner’s insurance policy (the policy) issued by the plaintiff, Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Quincy Mutual), which filed this action seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify against BHC’s claims. Under the policy, losses arising out of the Crispos’use of the power boat are excluded from coverage, but losses arising out of their use of the lobster boat are excepted from that exclusion.

On August 13, 2005, the Crispos were aboard their power boat, the MSJC69, and were towing the lobster boat, the Laina Lou, which had lost its propulsion due to transmission trouble. As the two vessels neared Quincy Yacht Club, the MSJC69′s propeller shaft became entangled on a mooring line. After cutting loose from the mooring line, the Crispos were unable to restart the MSJC69, its battery dead. The Laina Lou dropped its anchor and the two boats remained attached by the tow line. Due to the dead battery, the MSJC69′s running lights were not on. Approximately ten minutes later, the Nora Vittoria, a ferry boat operated by BHC, collided with the two vessels.

Steven Crispo and Dana Gagne, who were both aboard the Laina Lou, later sued BHC in United States District Court, and the Crispos sued BHC in Superior Court, seeking recovery for personal injuries and property damage. In the Federal action, BHC brought a third-party complaint against the Crispos, alleging that the Crispos were responsible for the Federal plaintiffs’damages by failing to take appropriate action to prevent the collision. In the Superior Court action, BHC counterclaimed against the Crispos for indemnification and contribution on the same grounds.

 The Policy 

The Crispos sought coverage from Quincy Mutual under the policy. In the section of the policy providing for personal liability coverage, the policy states that Quincy Mutual will defend and indemnify as to a claim brought against an insured for bodily injury or property damage caused during the policy period by an accident. The policy lists certain exclusions to liability coverage, including, in relevant part, the following:
 
 “Personal liability…[does] not apply to‘bodily injury’or‘property damage’…“g. Arising out of: 

 “(1) The ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of an excluded watercraft described below… 

 “Excluded watercraft are those that are principally designed to be propelled by engine power or electric motor, or are sailing vessels, whether owned by or rented to an‘insured.’ 

 “This exclusion does not apply to watercraft: 

 “(1) That are not sailing vessels and are powered by: (a) Inboard or inboard-outdrive engine or motor power of 50 horsepower or less not owned by an‘insured’; (b) Inboard or inboard-outdrive engine or motor power of more than 50 horsepower not owned by or rented to an‘insured’; (c) One or more outboard engines or motors with 25 total horsepower or less; (d) One or more outboard engines or motors with more than 25 total horsepower if the outboard engine or motor is not owned by an‘insured’….” 
 
It is undisputed that the Crispos’use of the MSJC69 would fall within the watercraft exclusion, and that their use of the Laina Lou, a nonsailing vessel powered by an inboard engine of more than fifty horsepower and not owned by the Crispos, would fall within the exception to the watercraft exclusion. Quincy Mutual’s policy form had provided for an optional endorsement for watercraft liability, which the Crispos declined to purchase as part of their coverage.

Quincy Mutual initially defended the Crispos against BHC’s claims while reserving its right to deny coverage pending the outcome of a declaratory judgment action. On September 14, 2007, Quincy Mutual filed this action seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the Crispos in the Federal court action.

On September 19, 2008, Quincy Mutual moved for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action and, shortly thereafter, ceased its defense of the Crispos. The Crispos cross-moved for summary judgment.  On February 11, 2009, the Crispos and BHC settled the underlying actions, on terms by which the Crispos bore no liability and owed no money to BHC. At that point, the only issues remaining in this action were the existence and breach of Quincy Mutual’s duty to defend. Summary judgment rulings issued in the Crispos’favor on those questions. Following the entry of final judgment, Quincy Mutual appealed.

 Analysis 

The sole issue before the court is whether Quincy Mutual had a duty to defend the Crispos against BHC’s claims. The court was called upon to decide whether the losses alleged in BHC’s complaints against the Crispos, which allegedly arose out of the Crispos’use of the MSJC69 as well as the Laina Lou, created a potential for coverage that triggered Quincy Mutual’s duty to defend. In other words, does a claim trigger a duty to defend when the alleged loss“arises out of”both a use that is excluded from coverage and a covered use. Also it needed to answer whether a defense is required if there is a use that, due to an exception to the exclusion, is not excluded?

Quincy Mutual argued that so long as a use that is excluded from coverage is alleged as a cause of the loss, the existence of a causal contribution by another use that is covered under the policy does not give rise to a duty to defend.  It is settled in Massachusetts, as well as the U.S., that a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against any claims that create a potential for indemnity. If the allegations of the complaint are‘reasonably susceptible’of an interpretation that they state a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense. The complaints need only state a claim that gives rise to a possibility of recovery under the policy, rather than a probability of such recovery.

The complaints alleged that the Crispos’negligence in using the MSJC69 and the Laina Lou caused the vessels to be struck by the ferry. The complaints do not distinguish between the Crispos’use of the two vessels with respect to which use caused the accident. The allegations of the underlying complaints raise the possibility that the claims against the Crispos arose from their use of the Laina Lou.

The policy includes a so-called“anticoncurrent cause”provision in section I of the policy but contains no such provision in section II (liability coverage) of the policy that is the part decided by this case. Where an anticoncurrent cause provision is included with reference to exclusions in one part of the policy, and omitted with reference to exclusions in another part of the policy, Massachusetts courts have interpreted the absence of such provision to mean that a loss caused by a risk excluded in the section without the provision will be covered if a covered risk also contributed to the loss. Quincy Mutual could have included an anticoncurrent cause provision in the liability section of the policy had it intended to provide coverage only when a covered activity was the sole cause of the loss.

Massachusetts courts have accorded a broader meaning to“arising out of”than to“proximate cause.”But the“arising out of”language used in the exclusionary provision in the liability section of the policy, without more, reasonably should be understood as denying coverage for damages connected to the insured’s simultaneous undertaking of an excluded risk and a risk specifically excepted from that exclusion, both alleged to have caused a third-party’s loss.

Quincy Mutual argued that the allegations of the complaints against the Crispos do not allege separate and independent uses contributing to the loss, nor do they attribute the loss primarily to use of one vessel or the other. Where the loss in the underlying complaints was alleged to arise out of the Crispos’use of a covered vessel and an excluded vessel, the policy’s exclusion for one vessel did not make clear that coverage was precluded even though the other vessel, which was covered under a specific exception to the exclusion, also contributed to the loss.

The court concluded that in this context, the“arising out of”language in the liability section’s exclusionary provision does not convey the same import as an anticoncurrent cause provision like that appears in section I of the policy. In fact, the court concluded that an objectively reasonable insured, reading the exclusion and its exception, would expect that to be the case.

The Court of Appeal noted that its decision is narrow. It is derived from the policy language, the broad sweep of the complaints, and the unusual series of events that led to the losses and concluded that the allegations in the complaints raised the possibility of a covered loss by alleging that both an excluded risk and a risk specifically excepted from exclusion simultaneously contributed to the accident.

 Lesson 

If an insurer wishes to avoid the concurrent cause doctrine in the interpretation of an insurance policy it must make the anti-concurrent-cause language applicable to the entire policy, not just the first party property section. If it does not do so it would be prudent to defend the insured when there are concurrent causes, one of which is covered, and not waste the funds needed to bring a declaratory relief action like that brought by Quincy Mutual.

 Insurance Fraud Conviction Upheld in Ohio 
 Posted on September 30, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Arson for Profit Fails 

 An arson for profit, to be profitable, must be well though out and prepared. Most amateur arsonists believe that a fire will destroy everything in a house and leave no evidence. Because of that amateur arsonists will store valuable property and family heirlooms away from the structure to be burned so that they can profit from the claimed destruction and keep the property. It is such an amateur that is caught, convicted and jailed. In the S tate of Ohio v. Linda L. Hebb , 2011 -Ohio- 4566. (Ohio App. Dist.5 09/08/2011) Linda L. Hebb (Hebb) was convicted of insurance fraud and appealed from her convictions and sentences in the Ashland County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas for two counts of Insurance Fraud and one count of Possession of Criminal Tools a felony.

 FACTS 

Hebb’s home had been for sale for several years. On August 3, 2008 Hebb’s home was destroyed by fire. Hebb’s daughter, Maggie Hebb, who lived at the residence with Hebb initially told the police that someone had come into the home assaulted her and then set the house on fire. Hebb was camping when the fire occurred on August 3, 2008. 

Hebb had claimed that she, Maggie and a man named Terry had planned to take a camping trip. However, Terry did not show-up, and Maggie decided not to go, so Hebb found another individual to drive her motor home to the campground in Findley, Ohio.

On September 3, 2008 Maggie Hebb confessed to the police that she made up the story of an intruder and in fact she had started the fire. Hebb denied knowing that her daughter had set the fire that had destroyed their home. During the course of the investigation, the police developed information that Hebb had an enclosed trailer removed from her property prior to the fire. When asked, Hebb denied any knowledge concerning the trailer. Maggie informed the police that there was a trailer, that it contained items from the house, and that it was moved from the house to another location prior to the fire. She assisted law enforcement officers to find the trailer which was parked between two buildings on the farm of Alvin Yoder.

The trailer had a license plate that returned to Hebb. Inside the trailer were clothing, artwork and personal mementoes; some boxes had Maggie’s name, while others had Hebb’s name marked on the outside. Hebb never told the police she had stored any personal items away from the house before the fire.

 The Insurance Investigation 

 Gregory Warren was the head investigator for Grange Insurance, with which Linda Hebb had a homeowner’s policy. He interviewed Hebb on August 12, 2008 at her neighbor’s house. Hebb told Warren she had not removed any property out of the house prior to the fire. Hebb received $5,000.00 cash advance for living expenses from the insurance company, and she filled out a sworn proof of loss statement and submitted it to Grange Insurance. Hebb’s claim was initially rejected by Grange because it had no amount stated for the value of the claim, and it was resubmitted by Hebb at the insurance company’s request with a blanket estimate of the fire damage of“$750,000.00.”Hebb submitted a 28-page list of contents lost with her first claim but it had no values assigned to any of the items claimed destroyed in the fire.

Grange Insurance paid First Merit Bank, with whom it had a separate contract, called a union mortgage clause, for the home equity loan outstanding on the property of approximately $213,000.00. This amount was not for the burned home; it was merely the amount of the home mortgage loan to the homeowner.

The loss to the home was valued at over $400,000.00. The insurance company hired an attorney to depose Hebb on October 14, 2008, which Investigator Warren attended. She had lowered the sale price on her home so she could sell it and get away. 

Investigator Warren testified that he noticed similarities between the contents of the trailer and the items claimed lost in the fire by Hebb. Mr. Warren asked Hebb if she moved any personal property out of the home before the fire and if she had anything in storage anywhere. Hebb denied that she had moved any personal property out of the home before the fire and that she had anything in storage anywhere when asked by Mr. Warren during the August 12, 2008 interview.

 Trial Court Decision 

The jury convicted Hebb as charged in the indictment. The trial court sentenced Hebb to a term of two years on each count of Insurance Fraud, and a term of twelve months on the count of Criminal Tools with all sentences to be served concurrently. The trial court further imposed restitution to Grange Insurance Company in the amount of $213,134.72 on Count One.

 Analysis 

 Each of Hebb’s assignments of error required the Court of Appeal to review the evidence.

A court of appeals must determine whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The inquiry by the Court of Appeal requires the court to follow two steps:

First the court must consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution. A court of appeals may not usurp the role of the finder of fact by considering how it would have resolved the conflicts, made the inferences, or considered the evidence at trial. Rather, when faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences a reviewing court presumes, even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record, that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.

Second, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the reviewing court must determine whether this evidence, so viewed, is adequate to allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The second step protects against rare occasions in which a properly instructed jury may convict even when it can be said that no rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the record contains sufficient evidence Hebb purposely intended to use the enclosed trailer to commit the offense of Insurance Fraud. Larry Bates, an independent witness, testified that the trailer had been on the Hebb’s property prior to the fire which consumed her residence. He further testified that Hebb had made arrangements to have the trailer relocated to the farm of an Amish man. Hebb paid Mr. Bates to move the trailer for her to the new location where it would be stored between two buildings. 

Hebb did not disclose to investigators after the fire that she had stored valuable property in a trailer off site. Further when asked by Investigator Warren she specifically denied having moved any property off-site prior to the fire, and that she had any property in storage. Both the record of the inventory of the trailer completed by the sheriff’s office and the list of property which the Hebb had reported to the insurance company was lost in the fire were submitted to the jury. Hebb argues that the insurance company was not defrauded and only paid the mortgage lien on the home to the mortgage holder. Hebb argues that the insurance company was obligated under the policy to pay off the mortgage regardless of any statement Hebb may or may not have made. In this case Hebb was attempting to collect for personal property that was inside the home and was destroyed by the ensuing fire.

A fundamental premise of the criminal trial system is that‘the jury is the lie detector’and an appellate court will not impose its judgment over that of the jury unless it is blatantly, exceptionally and obviously wrong. Although Hebb cross-examined the witnesses and argued that she did not claim any of the items in the trailer on her insurance claim form as being destroyed in the fire, and further that she had packed the items in anticipation of moving to Tennessee, the weight to be given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are issues for the trier of fact. The jury was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by the parties and assess the witness’s credibility.

After reviewing the evidence, the Court of Appeal concluded that it could not say that this is one of the exceptional cases where the evidence weighs heavily against the convictions.  Rather, it  concluded that the trier of fact, in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, did not create a manifest injustice to require a new trial.

 Both the record of the inventory of the trailer completed by the sheriff’s office and the list of property which the Hebb had reported to the insurance company was lost in the fire were submitted to the jury. The intent with which an act is committed may be inferred from the act itself and the surrounding circumstances, including acts and statements of a defendant.

The Court of Appeal, as did the jury, concluded that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Hebb had committed the crime of Insurance Fraud with respect to her statements denying that she removed property or had any property in storage. The statements at issue concern Hebb’s October 14, 2008 deposition. This deposition occurred after Hebb’s daughter had confessed to setting fire to the home. The statements upon which the second insurance fraud count is based on statements made by Hebb concerning her daughter’s involvement in starting the fire and Hebb’s interview with the police.

Hebb argued that her statements occurred after the insurance company was aware that her daughter had confessed to starting the fire and, therefore, could not be defrauded. Accordingly, Hebb maintained, the insurance company did not rely on Hebb’s statements when deciding whether to pay the claim. The State was required to show that Hebb had a purpose, an intention, to defraud, i.e., to benefit herself. The argument failed because the state was not required to prove that she actually received a benefit or that the insurance company actually suffered a detriment.
 
The intent with which an act is committed may be inferred from the act itself and the surrounding circumstances, including acts and statements of a defendant. The Court of Appeal concluded that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Hebb had committed the crime of Insurance Fraud with respect to her statements denying that she had any knowledge of her daughter’s confession to setting the fire.

In the case at bar, the trial court based the amount of restitution to be paid by Hebb on the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report. The trial court noted that the insurance company had obtained a civil default judgment against Maggie Hebb, Hebb’s daughter.

To the extent that any of the insurance company’s losses include amounts for which the insurance company has already been granted a civil judgment, that duplication constitutes a double recovery and an impermissible economic windfall for the insurance company, and for that reason the amount of restitution ordered is not supported by competent, credible evidence that demonstrates to a reasonable degree of certainty the actual net economic loss suffered by the insurance company as a direct and proximate result of Hebb’s offenses.

Hebb’s Eighth Assignment of Error was sustained to the extent that the trial court is to determine the actual economic loss suffered by the victim and to taking into account any offsets to the victim’s economic loss and any mitigation of damages in the form of compensation received for the loss from, for example, insurance, civil judgments against the defendant or civil judgments against any party responsible for any part of the loss.

 Lesson 

 Insurance fraud is both a defense to a false claim and a crime. Those who wish to commit insurance fraud should not, as did Ms. Hebb, leave evidence that proves that the claim presented was for personal property that was not—in fact—destroyed.

The insurer that is faced with a potentially fraudulent claim must conduct a thorough investigation as did Grange, including an examination under oath of the insured. When an insured swears falsely at examination under oath and in a sworn proof of loss the insurer must refuse to pay the claim and the state, when presented with the evidence, must prosecute. It is not, nor should it ever be, a defense to a prosecution for fraud, that the defendant failed in the effort to defraud.

Although an insurer is required to pay a mortgagee it can take an assignment of the mortgage and recover its payments as the owner of the mortgage by declaring a default and foreclosing on the property.

 Avoid Litigation By Thorough Communication 
 Posted on September 29, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Condo Association Must Communicate With Its Members About Insurance 

 People who live in condominium associations are similar to a family made up of people unrelated by blood or marriage. Like all families it is almost impossible to reach a consensus of all members of the association. This is especially so when the association is a high rise building with hundreds of members. Individual members want to spread the risk of loss over all of the members of the association even when all of the members do not have an interest in the risk. In Alan K. Roberts, et al v. Nine Island Avenue Condominium Association, Inc., Etc, No. 3D09-371 (Fla.App. 09/21/2011) litigation between some thirty six members of an Association who had an interest in a marina attached to the high rise wanted the entire association to pay for the repair and replacement of the marina and charged that the association board failed in its duty to insure the marina. The twelve year effort failed.

The dispute between Nine Island Avenue Condominium Association (Association) and unit owners of boat slips (slip owners) at Nine Island was litigated over who is responsible for the cost of reconstruction of the marina and boat slips, destroyed by Hurricane Irene in 1999. After the hurricane, the Association assessed each slip owner a proportionate share of the $701,050 reconstruction. Some of the slip owners paid the special assessment and others refused. In 2002, eighteen slip owners, about half the total number, filed a declaratory action asking the trial court to exonerate them from the obligation of the special assessment on the ground the Association failed to place and keep the marina and docks insured. 

The Association countered with foreclosure counterclaims against those slip owners who had not paid the special assessment. The dispute spawned other disagreements between the parties, all of which revolve around which party is responsible for the costs and expenses related to the marina.

After an evidentiary final hearing, the trial court concluded the slip owners solely were responsible for the costs pertaining to the marina.

The Florida Court of Appeal believed that its decision was intuitively obvious. However, it found it necessary to explain its decision by traveling through what it called “the not-so-intuitively-obvious interstices of the Florida Condominium Act and the Declaration of Condominium, to which these parties are contractually bound…”

 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 

 There is no serious dispute over the material facts of this case. In 1982, two years after Nine Island Condominium was constructed, the developer built a marina, including thirty-six docks, behind the condominium building and sold the right to use the dock spaces to thirty-six of the unit owners. The dock slips are limited common elements.  The Declaration of Condominium allows the“owner”of a dock space to sell or transfer his right of use of his assigned space, but only to another unit owner.

Hurricane force winds from Hurricane Irene destroyed the marina in mid-October of 1999. The property manager at the time testified that a preliminary study of the marina, completed by a local structural engineering firm just before Hurricane Irene, concluded the marina had outlasted its useful life. On June 2, 2000, the property manager advised the slip owners of this finding.

 CONTENTIONS 

The slip owners’contention on appeal was that the Association left them high and dry in 1999 by not insuring the marina property prior to the storm. The slip owners argued that both the Florida Condominium Act and the Declaration of Condominium required the Association to insure the marina.

Article XI of the Declaration of Condominium delineates the Association’s responsibilities relating to insurance. It required that: “Insurance shall be carried and kept in force at all times…”
 
The slip owners argued that the language of the Article, requiring the Association to“purchase and carry . . . [c]asualty insurance covering the Building and other improvements of the Condominium, including, without limitation, Units (including the bathroom and kitchen fixtures initially installed into Units by the Developer) and Common Elements . . . exclusive of excavation and foundation,”is“clear and unambiguous with regard to what coverage the Association is required to‘purchase and carry,’”namely that the Association must secure windstorm coverage on the marina and dock spaces as well as the Building and Common Elements.

The Court of Appeal agreed with the slip owners that the insurance article is clear and unambiguous. It did not, however, agree with the interpretation proposed by the slip owners. Rather, as the trial court did the insurance article in the Declaration does not require the Association to purchase and maintain insurance coverage on the docks because:

1.    The plain language of the insurance provision requires the Association to purchase insurance only on the Building and other improvements of the Condominium, including the Units and Common Elements.

2.    The word“Building”is a defined word in the Declaration, meaning“the [twenty-five]-story high rise building constituting the principal improvement located on the land.”

The reference in Declarations to“Units”and“Common Elements”is clearly a reference to the land-based elements of the“Condominium Property”–itself a more inclusive, defined term found in the definitional provisions of the Declaration.

 Article III of the Declaration, entitled“Description of the Condominium Property,”includes separate paragraphs delimiting and distinguishing the“Common Elements”of the Condominium Property from the“Limited Common Elements.”The boat slips are expressly stated to be“Limited Common Elements”under Article III, section E.6 of the Declaration. If“Limited Common Elements”were to be included in the“Required Coverage”section of Article XI of the Declaration, it would have been a simple matter for the drafters to have included the phrase“Limited Common Elements”after the term“Common Elements.”

The sole focus (and purpose) of the“Required Coverage”section of Article XI of the Declaration is to require the Association to purchase and carry casualty insurance on the land-based elements of the Condominium Property, the Building, the Units, and the Common Elements is fully and finally demonstrated by the fact the drafters carefully excluded one land-based element,“excavation and foundation costs,”from the Association’s insurance procurement obligations.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the“Required Coverage”section of the insurance article in this Declaration is reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation, that the Association was not required by the terms of the Declaration to purchase and carry a policy of windstorm insurance on the marina and boat docks.

 Evidence at trial established that the Association insured the marina until 1994, when its insurer, Travelers Insurance Company, non-renewed the Association policy, and the only available insurer, a“state sponsored”insurer of last resort, advised the Association there was“no way of getting insurance on [the marina] because of its age.”According to Goldstein, it was not until 2002, after the marina was rebuilt, that insurance on the marina once again was available.

 LESSON 

Condominium owners and condominium associations must carefully read the Declarations of Condominium, the Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of the Association, and the insurance requirements of both the agreements between the owners and the local applicable statutes. In this case the Marina, and its slips, were separate from the high rise building and only a small proportion of the unit owners were users of the marina. If the thirty six slip owners desired insurance it was the obligation of the thirty six to buy it. They did not and attempted to have the cost of repair to the hurricane damaged property passed to all of the owners rather than just the 36 who had the right to use the slips.

 The Court of Appeal decision is unclear on the issue but it appears that the long running litigation arose out of a failure of the condominium association to communicate with all members. It should have, when it was determined that the marina and slips had outlived their useful life and were uninsurable, advised the thirty six slip owners of the fact, determined the cost of repair and replacement of the marina and slips, and assessed the thirty six to accomplish the repairs. Since insurance was unavailable, perhaps even from the insurer of last resort, the slip owners should have been advised that there was no insurance and no insurance would be available until the marina and slips were repaired.

The Association made the correct decision after Hurricane Irene. The slip owners, according to the Court of Appeal, had no cause of action against the Association where it felt its decision was intuitively obvious. Being right is not always best. The Association and the 36 slip owners spent a great deal of money on lawyers to fight this lawsuit for twelve years. Money and court time that could have been put to a better use if the parties simply communicated in detail before the hurricane.

 An Installment Fee Is Not a Premium 
 Posted on September 28, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance Takes Certain Enumerated Risks 

 Many insurers allow people they insure to pay either the full amount of the premium at inception or to pay in monthly installments. For those who pay in monthly installments the insurers charge the insured a fee to cover the cost of administering the monthly charge. Most people dislike paying finance charges, whether to an insurer, a bank or a credit card company. Insureds in New Mexico filed a class action suit alleging that the finance charges imposed by Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona (“Farmers”) charged were part of the premium, as such was a violation of New Mexico law, and entitled the class to a return of fees paid. The New Mexico Court of Appeal was asked to resolved a factual and legal“twist”in a series of class action cases challenging the manner in which insurance companies document and collect charges imposed when insureds opt to pay their premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. In Lydia and Patrick Nellis, For Themselves and All Others Similarly Situated v. Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona , No. 29, 295 (N.M.App. 09/20/2011) the New Mexico Court of Appeal refused and reversed a trial court decision.

 THE FACTUAL SETTING 

Farmers provides automobile insurance coverage to its customers. The parties agree that Farmers’standard practice is to offer policies with a six-month term and to require payment of the premium in a lump sum for the entire term. Customers who prefer, for any reason, to pay in smaller increments must make arrangements to pay their premium through Prematic Service Corporation (Prematic). It is“not possible for a Farmers’insured to pay”premiums on a monthly basis without going through Prematic.

The parties agreed that insureds who choose to pay through Prematic must pay a monthly service charge or fee. The issues in the case revolve around the nature of this service charge or fee:

(1)    Is it a premium?

(2)    Is imposing the fee, whatever its nature, allowable under the terms of the insurance policy Farmers issues?

 Fees for Payment Over Time Is Not a Risk Taken by an Insurance Policy 

 The Class is composed of persons who chose to pay their premiums on a monthly basis during the class period, which commenced in April 1997. The mechanics of how insureds enter into a Prematic agreement have changed over the years. The most dramatic change occurred in February 2001. Prior to that date insureds signed a written payment plan agreement with Prematic. Signature of the written agreement and payment of two months of premiums led to assignment of a Prematic account number which was in turn noted on the Declarations sheet of the insured’s policy.

Starting in February 2001 a written agreement was no longer required and thereafter rarely used. Instead, insureds were enrolled“in the Prematic monthly premium payment plan program by entering the insured’s information utilizing the Farmers policy processing computer system.”In both scenarios, the entire process was handled by Farmers agents. Once the insured’s information was entered into the computer, the system assigned a Prematic account number which, as before, appeared on the insured’s Declarations sheet labeled as such. But the first time the insured would see a Prematic Monthly Plan Agreement under the new procedure was with the first monthly bill. The monthly bills reflected the service charge as an amount separate from and in addition to the policy premium.

The policy premium reflected on the initial bills was an amount equal to one-sixth of the six-month premium shown on the Declarations sheet. The Declarations sheet only included the six-month premium and a reference to“Prematic”next to the spot where“Total”premium would otherwise appear. The spot next to the line for“Fees”was blank.

Whether the Prematic arrangement was embodied in a written document or simply noted in a computer program, the parties agree that the agreement was-in fact, had to be-in place before a Farmers agent would issue a policy of insurance. 

Once an insured made arrangements to pay monthly, Farmers issued a policy that included endorsement E0022, somewhat oddly titled the“Monthly Payment Agreement.”On its face, endorsement E0022 purports to amend the policy period to“one [c]alendar month”continuing for“successive monthly periods if the premium is paid when due.”Monthly premiums are subject to future adjustment to match the“then current rate on the semi-annual or annual anniversary of the policy.”Endorsement E0022 also includes an integration clause:“This endorsement is part of your policy. It supersedes and controls anything to the contrary. It is otherwise subject to all other terms of the policy.”

The complaint alleged that Farmers’insureds who“buy insurance on a monthly basis must pay service charges”to Prematic as agent for Farmers. The complaint also alleged that the service charges“are designed to cover the additional administrative expense generated”by buying insurance on a monthly basis. As such, the“service charges are a portion of the total cost of the insurance purchased”by Class members. There is no assertion in the complaint that Class members were not informed about the service charges before or at the time they agreed to buy insurance coverage from Farmers.

 The complaint asserted that imposition of the service charges is a breach of contract because the“[p]olicies do not specify any service charge to be paid by a policyholder who buys insurance on a monthly basis.”The only mention of“fees”in the policy is on the Declarations sheet and, according to the complaint, it provides“that there are no‘Fees’payable with respect to the Policies.”Thus, the Class members“have been charged premium (i.e. service charges) in addition to the premium specified in the Policies.”

In addition, the complaint asserts that the service charges constituted premium under New Mexico and Arizona statutory provisions which require that“premiums”be specified in the policy itself.

The Class articulated three points in support of its position that the service charges constituted premiums. First, the Class refined its argument that the service charge was designed to pay for the“additional administrative and overhead expenses associated with monthly billing,”thereby increasing the cost of insurance. Second, the Class argued that as a matter of contract law there could be no consideration supporting imposition of the service charges, given that the policy allowed-or required-a month’s premium for a month’s worth of coverage. Third, the Class argued that Farmers could not escape liability simply because the service charges were paid to Prematic.

Farmers argued that: (1) the service charges were not premium either under the provisions of the policy itself or under New Mexico’s statutory definition and thus could not be considered consideration for insurance coverage, and (2) the Prematic invoices-which are referred to on the Declarations sheet-”are incorporated by reference into the policy documents and clearly and separately set forth the service fees which Plaintiffs claim were not set forth in the policy documents.”

 The Trial Court’s Decision 

Analyzing the case as framed by the parties-including the notion that the policy is not ambiguous-the district court found in favor of the Class. The district court correctly identified“[t]he primary areas of disagreement between the parties [to be] whether service fees are incorporated into the contract and whether they are considered‘premium.’”The district court first concluded that“the payment plan that imposes a service charge is not part of the insurance contract.”The district court rejected Farmers’argument that the monthly invoices from Prematic, which did reflect the service charges, were or could be incorporated into the policy given that the invoices were not attached to the policy when delivered. Rather, the invoices were mailed some ten days after a policy is issued. 

The district court noted that the space next to the word“Fees”on the Declarations sheet is blank and concluded that this blank space“means there are no fees associated with this policy.”The district court rested its decision on three grounds, each in response to Farmers’argument. First, the charges could not be installment fees because the policy as issued was for only one month, with no obligation to pay past each month. Second, the district court held that Farmers could cancel a policy for failure to pay service charges. As a result,“it would appear that the service charge is consideration for the insurance contract.”Last, the service charges had the effect of increasing the cost of purchasing insurance and, as such, constituted premiums.

 The Motion for Reconsideration 

Farmers asked the district court to reconsider its ruling after this Court decided Nakashima v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 2007-NMCA-027, 141 N.M. 239, 153 P.3d 664,. Farmers altered its argument considerably to match the Nakashima approach to the issues, emphasizing for the first time the significance of the Prematic agreement. Farmers noted that all of its insureds desiring to pay on a monthly basis had to enter into a Prematic agreement, including payment of an associated service charge, before a policy would be issued and argued that the Prematic agreement was a contract separate from the policy.

The district court denied the motion to reconsider without a hearing, distinguishing Nakashima on its facts and reading it to be limited to the language of the policy at issue in that case.

 ANALYSIS 

 The Court of Appeal started its analysis with a review of Nakashima a case with similar, though not identical, facts in which the Court of Appeal agreeded with the district court’s conclusion that the plaintiff there“expressly agreed to the installment fees by entering into a separate contract with [the d]efendant to pay her premium in installments and further that the fees associated with paying in installments are not premium.”

 Installment Payment Fees Are Not Premiums Under the Insurance Code. 

Mirroring the argument made by the plaintiff in Nakashima , the Class asserts that Farmers’collection of the Prematic installment charges is contrary to the Insurance Code. Specifically, the Class argues that the Code’s definition of“premium”in Section 59A-18-3 covers installment fees. Nakashima squarely rejected this argument stating:

The installment fees are associated with the privilege of paying a premium in installments and are not for the actual purchase of insurance itself.

The most salient aspect of Nakashima ‘s approach is its recognition of a process by which insureds can enter into separate enforceable agreements for payment of premiums in a mode other than in a lump sum. 

 There Is Consideration to Support the Prematic Service Charges 

In Nakashima , State Farm and its insured apparently agreed on an insurance contract-usually for a six-month term-and the associated premium before any installment arrangements were made. The installment fee and the monthly premium in Nakashima were not stated in the policy but were included in the installment plan form signed by the insured. The Declarations page of the policy referenced the payment plan once the plan was approved. Though Nakashima does not say explicitly, we infer that the policy continued to be for a six-month term even after an installment plan was approved. 

Farmers’Prematic agreement takes a different approach. The parties agree that a Prematic agreement must be entered into before Farmers will issue a policy that allows monthly payments. Once the Prematic agreement is in place, Farmers issues a policy which, pursuant to E0022, is for successive one-month terms. The practical effect of this approach is that Farmers’insureds pay for the“privilege of purchasing coverage in smaller quantities”rather than for deferring payment.

The Class, like the plaintiff in Nakashima , argues that the installment fees cannot be collected because the policy as issued reflects the installment plan and allows monthly payments and as a result, there is no consideration to support the Prematic agreement. In response to the first argument, Nakashima makes the common sense observation that“if Plaintiff had not entered into a separate agreement to pay her premium in installments, such references to a payment plan would not have appeared on her policy.”

In response to the second argument, we held that the insurer’s agreement to forgo a lump sum payment and the insured’s gain of the right to pay monthly in exchange for a fee was adequate consideration.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the differences between the installment plan dealt with in Nakashima and the Prematic agreement are not material and do not demand a different result. The plans are structured differently but achieve the same ends for the same conceptual price.

As a general matter, our courts have long recognized the value of extrinsic evidence to aid in the interpretation of contracts. New Mexico abandoned the strict plain meaning,“four-corners”approach to contract interpretation in 1991 when the New Mexico Supreme Court held that the parol evidence rule did not preclude the introduction of extrinsic evidence designed to determine the circumstances under which the parties contracted and the purpose of the contract.

Rather, it is more plausible that the parties intended the merger clauses to accommodate the Prematic agreement either:

(1)     as a separate agreement dealing with the payment of premium and accompanying monthly service charges-a view that would square with Nakashima ‘s treatment of installment plans in similar circumstances; or

(2)     as a separate agreement that is actually part of a larger comprehensive arrangement between the parties that should be construed together.

The Court of Appeal did not decide which approach is analytically preferable because it found either will suffice.

 Lesson 

To avoid the type of problem incurred by the insurer in this New Mexico case—even though its procedure was found proper—is to enter into a separate contract with the insured for monthly premiums and not to change the terms and conditions of the policy. It should be the same as a credit card purchase with a minimum payment each month. Like premium finance agreements issued by banks the insured can be required to assign to the lender—Prematic in this Farmers case—the right to cancel the policy in the insured’s name if the insured fails to make a monthly payment.

 Eight Corners Rule Defeats Coverage for Intentional Global Warming 
 Posted on September 27, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Intentional Torts Can’t Be an“Occurrence” 

 Liability insurance, by definition, only insures against fortuitous events. An intentional tort, standing alone, can never be fortuitous since an intentional tort requires the tortfeasor to intend the action and the resulting damage. In The AES Corporation v. Steadfast Insurance Company, Record No. 100764, the Court of Appeals of Virginia, on September 16, 2011 decided that a suit seeking damages for intentional conduct by a power generating company for adding to global warming was not fortuitous, not an accident, and therefore the insured did not owe a defense to AES.

Virginia makes coverage decisions based on the eight corners rule by only reviewing the four corners of the suit and the four corners of the policy when making a decision on the right of an insured to a defense. Justice, S. Bernard Goodwyn, writing for the court was called upon to decide a declaratory judgment action, whether the circuit court erred in ruling that a civil complaint filed against The AES Corporation (AES) did not allege an“occurrence”as that term is defined in AES’s contracts of insurance with Steadfast Insurance Company (Steadfast), and that Steadfast, therefore, did not owe AES a defense or liability coverage.

 Background 

AES is a Virginia-based energy company that holds controlling interests in companies specializing in the generation and distribution of electricity in numerous states, including California.

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and City of Kivalina (Kivalina), a native community located on an Alaskan barrier island, filed a lawsuit (t he Complaint) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against AES and numerous other defendants for allegedly damaging the village by causing global warming through emission of greenhouse gases. AES requested Steadfast provide a defense and insurance coverage, pursuant to the terms of the CGL policies, for the claims alleged in the Complaint. Steadfast provided AES a defense under a reservation of rights and filed a declaratory judgment action, which is the subject of this appeal, in the Circuit Court of Arlington County.

In the declaratory judgment action, Steadfast claimed that it did not owe AES a defense or indemnity coverage for damage allegedly caused by AES’s contribution to global warming based on three grounds:

(1)     the Complaint did not allege“property damage”caused by an“occurrence,”which was necessary for there to be coverage under the policies;

(2)     any alleged injury arose prior to the inception of Steadfast’s coverage; and

(3)     the claims alleged in the Complaint fell within the scope of the pollution exclusion stated in AES’s policies.

 The circuit court denied AES’s motion for summary judgment and granted Steadfast’s motion for summary judgment, holding that the Complaint does not allege an“occurrence”as that term is defined in the CGL policies, and thus, the allegations in the Complaint are not covered under those policies.

The Insurance Policies

In each of the CGL policies AES purchased from Steadfast, Steadfast agreed to defend AES against suits claiming damages for bodily injury or property damage, if such damage“is caused by an `occurrence.’”The policies define“occurrence”as follows:”`Occurrence’means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful condition.”The policies specify that Steadfast has no duty to defend or indemnify AES against damage suits to which the policies do not apply.

 The Complaint 

Kivalina is located on the tip of a small barrier reef on the northwest coast of Alaska, approximately seventy miles north of the Arctic Circle. As pertinent to this appeal, in the Complaint, Kivalina alleges that AES engaged in energy-generating activities using fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and that the emissions contributed to global warming, causing land-fast sea ice protecting the village’s shoreline to form later or melt earlier in the annual cycle. This allegedly exposed the shoreline to storm surges, resulting in erosion of the shoreline and rendering the village uninhabitable. 

The Complaint alleges that AES“intentionally emits millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually.”The Complaint further alleges that AES“knew or should have known of the impacts of [its] emissions”of carbon dioxide, but that“[d]espite this knowledge”of the“impacts of [its] emissions on global warming and on particularly vulnerable communities such as coastal Alaskan villages,”AES“continued [its] substantial contributions to global warming.”(Emphasis added.) Kivalina then dedicates sixteen pages and sixty-six paragraphs of its sixty-nine page Complaint to explaining global warming.

The Complaint then states three claims for relief against AES. Two causes of action are for nuisance and the other is for concert of action. The first claim for relief is entitled“Federal Common Law: Public Nuisance.”

 Analysis 

Both AES and Steadfast agree that it is a well-established principle, consistently applied in this Commonwealth, that only the allegations in the complaint and the provisions of the insurance policy are to be considered in deciding whether there is a duty on the part of the insurer to defend and indemnify the insured. This principle is commonly known as the“eight corners rule”because the determination is made by comparing the“four corners”of the underlying complaint with the“four corners”of the policy, to determine whether the allegations in the underlying complaint come within the coverage provided by the policy.

The relevant policies provide coverage for damage resulting from an“occurrence,”and define an occurrence as“an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful condition.”The terms“occurrence”and“accident”are synonymous and refer to an incident that was unexpected from the viewpoint of the insured.

The Virginia courts have held that an“accident”is commonly understood to mean an event which creates an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means employed and is not intended, designed, or reasonably anticipated.

 Kivalina alleges that AES intentionally released tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as part of its electricity-generating operations. In Virginia, and every other state, an intentional act is neither an “occurrence” nor an “accident” and therefore is not covered by a CGL.  An insurer has no duty to defend where a complaint alleged only intentional torts since an intentional tort, by definition, cannot be a fortuitous event.

However, even though the insured’s action starting the chain of events was intentionally performed, when the alleged injury results from an unforeseen cause that is out of the ordinary expectations of a reasonable person, the injury may be covered by an occurrence policy provision. The dispositive issue in determining whether an accidental injury occurred is not whether the action undertaken by the insured was intended, but rather whether the resulting harm is alleged to have been a reasonably anticipated consequence of the insured’s intentional act. Applying the“eight corners”rule, the Virginia Court of Appeal considered the terms of the relevant insurance policies and the allegations in the Complaint. The relevant policies only require Steadfast to defend AES against claims for damages for bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence or accident.

In the Complaint, Kivalina plainly alleges that AES intentionally released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a regular part of its energy-producing activities. Whether or not AES’s intentional act constitutes negligence, the natural and probable consequence of that intentional act is not an accident under Virginia law.

Allegations of negligence are not synonymous with allegations of an accident, and, in this instance, the allegations of negligence do not support a claim of an accident. Even if AES were negligent and did not intend to cause the damage that occurred, the gravamen of Kivalina’s nuisance claim is that the damages it sustained were the natural and probable consequences of AES’s intentional emissions.

When the insured knows or should have known of the consequences of his actions, there is no occurrence and therefore no coverage. If an insured knew or should have known that certain results would follow from his acts or omissions, there is no“occurrence”within the meaning of a comprehensive general liability policy. The Complaint alleges, from the viewpoint of AES, that AES should have anticipated the damages resulting from its emitting carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases. Even if AES were actually ignorant of the effect of its actions and/or did not intend for such damages to occur, Kivalina alleges its damages were the natural and probable consequence of AES’s intentional actions.

The Court of Appeal concluded, therefore, that Kivalina did not allege that its property damage was the result of a fortuitous event or accident. Such loss is not, nor can it be, covered under the relevant CGL policies.

 Lesson 

When dealing with a state that applies the “eight corners” or the “four corners” rule it is imperative that the plaintiff – if the funds of the defendant’s insurer is needed – must draft its complaint to include bodily injury or property damage cause by a fortuitous event. AES failed to get coverage for the defense of the global warming suit because the plaintiffs’ lawyers decided to couch their entire suit in terms of intentional tort.

The Restatement of Contracts, Section 291, cmt a (1932) states:
 
 [A] fortuitous event is an event which, so far as the parties to the contract are aware, is dependent on chance. It may be beyond the power of any human being to bring to pass; it may be within the control of third persons, provided that the fact is unknown to the parties. The thrust of the definition is that the occurrence be unplanned and unintentional in nature. 
 
This is not a case making a decision on global warming as some might think. It is a case about fortuity and the fact that the plaintiffs suing AES failed to allege a fortuitous event.  Facts might exist that would lead to the conclusion that the events complained of were fortuitous but they were not alleged. This case may have had a different result if it was brought where the original tort suit was filed because California allows the court to use extrinsic evidence in addition to the four corners of the complaint and four corners of the policy.

 Wager On Life Is Void 
 Posted on September 26, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance Requires Insurable Interest 

It is the essence of insurance that for insurance to exist the person insured must have an insurable interest in the property or life insured.

Life insurance insurable interest can be defined as an interest based upon a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage through the continued life, health, or bodily safety of another person and consequent loss by reason of that person’s death or disability or a substantial interest engendered by love and affection in the case of individuals closely related by blood or law. An individual may have an unlimited insurable interest in his or her own life, health, and bodily safety and may lawfully take out a policy of insurance on his or her own life, health, or bodily safety and have the policy made payable to whomsoever he or she pleases, regardless of whether the beneficiary designated has an insurable interest. It is the life of the person taking out the insurance who must have an insurable interest.

Insurance is also, by definition, the taking of a risk of a contingent or unknown event. It is not a gamble. Gambling on life has been illegal for more than 300 years because the life insured by the gambler would be at risk of murder to collect the funds.

The United States District Court, faced with making a decision concerning claims on a life insurance policy that was alleged to have been purchased as a wager on a life rather than a true insurance policy sought direction from the Delaware Supreme Court. In PHL Variable Insurance Company v. Price Dawe 2006 Insurance Trust, By and Through Its Trustee, No. 174, 2011 (Del. 09/20/2011) the Delaware Supreme Court, before STEELE, Chief Justice, HOLLAND, BERGER, JACOBS and RIDGELY, Justices constituting the Court en banc, answered the District Court’s questions.

 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

The Price Dawe 2006 Insurance Trust is a Delaware statutory trust that Price Dawe formed in December 2006 with a family trust as the beneficiary. Dawe was the beneficiary of the family trust. PHL Variable Insurance Co. (Phoenix) issued a $9 million Delaware life insurance policy on Dawe’s life with an issue date of March 8, 2007. The Dawe Trust was the owner and beneficiary of the policy.

The policy contains an incontestability provision stating that“[t]his policy shall be Incontestable after it has been in force for two years from the Issue Date, except for fraud, or any provision for reinstatement or policy change requiring evidence of insurability.”Dawe died on March 3, 2010. On June 9, 2010, the Dawe Trust made a claim to Phoenix for the death benefit. Phoenix first contested the policy by filing this lawsuit on November 10, 2010, approximately 3 1/2 years after the policy issue date. These facts are undisputed and constitute the official record for our purposes.

 Stranger Originated Life Insurance (“STOLI”) Scheme Improper 

 In its original complaint, Phoenix contended that Dawe did not qualify, and had no legitimate need, for a $9 million life insurance policy. The insurance company claims Dawe misrepresented his income and assets in his application and that he was financially induced into participating in the transaction as part of a stranger originated life insurance (“STOLI”) scheme.  Phoenix more specifically contends that on or about May 14, 2007, less than two months after the policy went into force, GIII formally purchased the beneficial interest of the Dawe Trust from the Family Trust for $376,111, and did not file a change of ownership or change of beneficiary form with the company. After Dawe died, Phoenix received two competing claims for the death benefit, leading to an investigation that allegedly revealed the true nature of Dawe’s life insurance transaction. Phoenix then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in order to obtain a declaration that the policy is void. After denying the defendant Trust’s motion to dismiss, the district court certified three questions of Delaware law to this Court, which we accepted.

 The Questions Asked 

1) Does Delaware law permit an insurer to challenge the validity of a life insurance policy based on a lack of insurable interest after the expiration of the two-year contestability period required by 18 Del. C. § 2908? 

2) Does 18 Del. C. § 2704(a) and (c)(5) prohibit an insured from procuring or effecting a policy on his or her own life and immediately transferring the policy, or a beneficial interest in a trust that owns and is the beneficiary of the policy, to a person without an insurable interest in the insured’s life, if the insured did not ever intend to provide insurance protection for a person with an insurable interest in his or her life?

3) Does 18 Del. C. § 2704(a) and (c)(5) confer upon the trustee of a Delaware trust established by an individual insured an insurable interest in the life of that individual when, at the time of the application for life insurance, the insured intends that the beneficial interest in the Delaware trust would be transferred to a third-party investor with no insurable interest in that individual’s life following the issuance of the life insurance policy?

 ANALYSIS 

 I.    CERTIFIED QUESTION ONE: CONTESTABILITY 

The first certified question, shared by both Dawe and Schlanger, concerns whether an insurer may claim that a life insurance policy never came into existence, on the basis of a lack of insurable interest, where the challenge occurs after the insurance contract’s mandatory contestability period expires. As certified by the district court in Dawe:“Does Delaware law permit an insurer to challenge the validity of a life insurance policy based on a lack of insurable interest after the expiration of the two-year contestability period required by 18 Del. C. § 2908?”

The Supreme Court answered question one:“YES.”

 An incontestability clause is a contractual provision wherein the insurer agrees that, after a policy has been in force for a given period of time, that it will not contest the policy based on misrepresentations in the insurance application. The insurance industry has used incontestability clauses for more than 100 years to encourage customers to purchase insurance.

Incontestability clauses provide security in financial planning for the insured, while also providing an insurer a reasonable opportunity to investigate any misrepresentations in the application. These provisions essentially serve the same function as statutes of limitation and repose. By the early twentieth century, life insurance policies included incontestability clauses as a matter of industry practice.

 Certain agreements, however, are so egregiously flawed that they are void at the outset 

As with all contracts, fraud in the inducement renders a life insurance policy voidable at the election of the innocent party. Certain agreements, however, are so egregiously flawed that they are void at the outset. These arrangements are often referred to as void ab initio, Latin for“from the beginning.”A court may never enforce agreements void ab initio, no matter what the intentions of the parties. Under the common law of contracts, there is a distinction between fraud in the inducement and fraud in the execution. Fraud in the execution occurs when a party makes a misrepresentation that is regarded as going to the very character of the proposed contract itself, as when one party induces the other to sign a document by falsely stating that it has no legal effect. If the misrepresentation is of this type, then there is no contract at all, or what is sometimes anomalously described as a void, as opposed to voidable, contract. 

If the fraud relates to the inducement to enter the contract, then the agreement is“voidable”at the option of the innocent party. The distinction is that if there is fraud in the inducement, the contract is enforceable against at least one party, while fraud in the factum means that at no time was there a contractual obligation between the parties. [ New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Caruso , 535 N.E. 2d 270 (N.Y. 1989)]

Under Delaware common law, contracts that offend public policy or harm the public are deemed void as opposed to voidable. A life insurance contract that lacks an insurable interest at inception is void ab initio.

Therefore, an insurer can challenge the enforceability of a life insurance contract after the incontestability period where a lack of insurable interest voids the contract. For this reason the Supreme Court answered Question one affirmatively.

 CERTIFIED QUESTION TWO: INTENT TO TRANSFER 

The second certified question concerns whether the statutory insurable interest requirement is violated where the insured procures a life insurance policy with the intent to immediately transfer the benefit to an individual or entity lacking an insurable interest.

The Supreme Court answered:“NO”but only so long as the insured procured or effected the policy and the policy is not a mere cover for a wager. Therefore, if the fraud alleged is proved and the policy purchase was a mere cover for a wager, there is no cover.

I n England, dead pools and the use of insurance to wager on strangers’lives actually became a popular pastime. In response, Parliament enacted the Life Assurance Act of 1774 which prohibited the use of insurance as a wagering contract unlinked to a demonstrated economic risk.

More than a century ago, the United States Supreme Court concisely articulated the public policy behind the insurable interest requirement:
 
 [T]here must be a reasonable ground, founded upon the relations of the parties to each other, either pecuniary or of blood or affinity, to expect some benefit or advantage from the continuance of the life of the assured. Otherwise the contract is a mere wage, by which the party taking the policy is directly interested in the early death of the assured. Such policies have a tendency to create a desire for the event. They are, therefore, independently of any statute on the subject, condemned, as being against public policy. [Warnock v. Davis, 104 U.S. 775, 779 (1881). See also Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U.S. 149, 154 (1911) (&quot;A contract of insurance upon a life in which the insured has no interest is a pure wager that gives the insured a sinister counter interest in having the life come to an end.&quot;).] 
 
Over the last two decades, however, an active secondary market for life insurance, sometimes referred to as the life settlement industry, has emerged. This secondary market allows policy holders who no longer need life insurance to receive necessary cash during their lifetimes. The market provides a favorable alternative to allowing a policy to lapse, or receiving only the cash surrender value. The secondary market for life insurance is perfectly legal. Indeed, today it is highly regulated. In fact, most states have enacted statutes governing secondary market transactions, and all jurisdictions permit the transfer or sale of legitimately procured life insurance policies. 

Virtually all jurisdictions, nevertheless, still prohibit third parties from creating life insurance policies for the benefit of those who have no relationship to the insured. These policies, commonly known as“stranger originated life insurance,”or STOLI, lack an insurable interest and are thus an illegal wager on human life.

In approximately 2004, securitization emerged in the life settlement industry. Under this investment method, policies are pooled into an entity whose shares are then securitized and sold to investors. Securitization substantially increased the demand for life settlements, but did not affect the supply side, which remained constrained by a limited number of seniors who had unwanted policies of sufficiently high value. As a result, STOLI promoters sought to solve the supply problem by generating new, high value policies.

The Delaware Constitution prohibits all forms of gambling unless it falls within one of the enumerated exceptions.  A life insurance policy procured or effected without an insurable interest is a wager on the life of the insured the Delaware Constitution prohibits. For nearly one hundred years, Delaware law has required an insurable interest as a way to distinguish between insurance and wagering contracts.

One of the tests as to the validity of the contract is to determine by whom the premiums are to be paid. If the one taking the insurance pays the premiums, the transaction is generally upheld. But there is a strong, though not universal, tendency to condemn contracts in which the premiums are paid by the beneficiary who holds no insurable interest.

Delaware allows an insured to take out an insurance policy on his own life, but the law prohibits persons other than the insured from procuring or causing to be procured insurance, unless the benefits are payable to one holding an insurable interest in the insured’s life.

 Insurable Interest Requirement Prevents Speculation on Human Life 

 The insurable interest requirement serves the substantive goal of preventing speculation on human life.  At issue is whether a third party having no insurable interest can use the insured as a means to procure a life insurance policy that the statute would otherwise prohibit. The Supreme Court answered no  because if that third party uses the insured as an instrumentality to procure the policy.

If a third party financially induces the insured to procure a life insurance contract with the intent to immediately transfer the policy to a third party, the contract lacks an insurable interest. Stated differently, if an insured procures a policy as a mere cover for a wager, then the insurable interest requirement is not satisfied.

Payment of the premiums by the insured, as opposed to someone with no insurable interest in the insured’s life, provides strong evidence that the transaction is bona fide. Life insurance policies, however, do not come into effect without premiums, so an insured cannot“procure or effect”a policy without actually paying the premiums. Procuring or effecting a policy has to be something more than simply applying for a policy or providing written consent to the policy’s issuance. Therefore, if a third party funds the premium payments by providing the insured the financial means to purchase the policy then the insured does not procure or effect the policy. Third parties are prohibited from procuring or causing to be procured insurance contracts on the life of the insured unless the policy benefits are payable to someone with an insurable interest.

In summary, the insured’s subjective intent for procuring a life insurance policy is not the relevant inquiry. The relevant inquiry is who procured the policy and whether or not that person meets the insurable interest requirements.

 CERTIFIED QUESTION THREE: THE TRUST’S INTEREST 

The third certified question conce rns whether the relevant statutory provisions confer upon a trustee an insurable interest in the life of the individual insured who established the trust if the insured intends to transfer the beneficial interest in the trust to a third-party investor with no insurable interest. As certified by the district court: “Does 18 Del. C. § 2704(a) and (c)(5) confer upon the trustee of a Delaware trust established by an individual insured an insurable interest in the life of that individual when, at the time of the application for life insurance, the insured intends that the beneficial interest in the Delaware trust would be transferred to a third-party investor with no insurable interest in that individual’s life following the issuance of the life insurance policy?”

The Supreme Court answered question number three:“YES,”but only so long as the individual insured actually established the trust. If, however, the insured does not create and fund the trust then the relationship contemplated by the statute is not satisfied.

The Supreme Court answer is limited to life insurance procured for a legal purpose and not as a cover for an illegal wager contract. In cases where a third party either directly or indirectly funds the premium payments as part of a pre-negotiated arrangement with the insured to immediately transfer ownership, the policy fails at its inception for lack of an insurable interest.

 Lessons 

 Gambling on a person’s life is wrong and gives the owner of the gambling contract a perverse incentive to kill the person whose life is insured. It is not unusual for a person to insure the life of a stranger and then kill the stranger for th e life insurance proceeds. In that regard consider the black widows in California who were recently convicted [ http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/15/national/main4262995.shtml reporting on their life sentences.] If the policies were purchased, and the insurer knew how they were purchased, in Delaware the policies would have been void and the crime would have failed.

Delaware made no decisions on the facts of the purchase of the insurance policy so it will be up to the Federal District Court to determine who actually effected the policy. If it was the deceased then Delaware allows the sale of a policy but does not allow a person to purchase a policy on the life of another. If the beneficiary made all of the premium payments its actions were a violation of the law of Delaware and that of almost every state. If the insured effected the policy and paid the premiums until he decided to sell the contract was valid and the insurer will need to pay.

 When Proof Of Fraud Exists—Defend 
 Posted on September 23, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Admission of Fraud Should Not Be Kept From Trier of Fact 

 Sometimes courts try too hard to protect litigants against insurance companies. When an insurer obtained evidence, clear and unambiguous, that an action by a health care provider had billed it for services the patient testified he did not receive, the trial court refused to allow the testimony to be read to the jury. Filing suit to collect for medical services never provided is, by definition, insurance fraud and an insurer should be allowed to present the evidence of the fraud to the jury. In State Farm Fire&amp;Casualty Insurance Company, Inc v. Best Therapy Center A/A/O David Valera, No. 3D10-2862 (Fla.App. 09/21/2011) the Florida Court of Appeal recognized the error at the trial and intermediate appellate court and sent the case back.

 Facts 

David Valera was involved in a car accident on Miami Beach, on August 4, 2004, and was insured by State Farm. Best Therapy Center (“Best Therapy”) brought this action against State Farm to recover for medical treatment that Valera allegedly received in connection with the accident. During discovery, Valera stated in a deposition that he did not receive any medical treatment from Best Therapy for the Miami Beach accident. 

On the morning of the trial, the court addressed Best Therapy’s motion to strike State Farm’s affirmative defense of fraud. The trial court granted Best Therapy’s motion and ruled that State Farm could not present any evidence of fraud because State Farm had not pled any fraudulent intent and because Best Therapy would have been prejudiced if State Farm were to have amended its pleadings on the morning of trial. The trial court reasoned that specific intent must be pled in order to present a defense of fraud, and that State Farm had not taken active steps to correct its pleadings when it was on notice that its fraud defense was insufficiently pled a year earlier when Best Therapy had originally filed its motion to strike. The court noted: 
 
 We question whether Best Therapy would have been prejudiced. Best Therapy was present when David Valera testified in deposition that he never had been treated by Best Therapy for his Miami Beach accident. Best Therapy also was put on notice in State Farm’s motion for summary judgment of State Farm’s allegation of insurance fraud. 
 
During trial State Farm was allowed to read Valera’s deposition to the jury, but, pursuant to the trial court’s order in limine, State Farm was not allowed to read the part of the deposition where Valera said he did not receive medical treatment from Best Therapy for the Miami Beach accident thereby emasculating State Farm’s defense. After all testimony was heard, the trial court dismissed the jury and granted a motion for directed verdict in favor of Best Therapy. State Farm appealed.

 Analysis 

 Acting in its appellate capacity, the circuit court upheld the trial court’s striking of State Farm’s fraud defense and prohibiting the jury from hearing that Valera had not received medical treatment from Best Therapy for the Miami Beach accident. The circuit court reasoned that State Farm had waived its fraud defense, and that the trial court properly used its discretion in denying State Farm leave to amend right before trial as Best Therapy would have been prejudiced.

The circuit court based its decision on the incorrect factual assumption that Valera’s deposition was read in its entirety to the jury, when, in fact, State Farm was not allowed to read the proffered part of the deposition where David Valera testified that he did not receive any medical treatment from Best Therapy for the Miami Beach accident.

Second tier certiorari in Florida may only be granted where the circuit court’s decision fails to afford procedural due process or departs from the essential requirements of the law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.  It was within the trial court’s discretion to strike State Farm’s affirmative defense, and the circuit court applied the correct law in reviewing the trial court’s ruling.

However, the circuit court’s affirmance of the trial court’s ruling prohibiting State Farm from reading Valera’s deposition in full to the jury on the incorrect basis that“the trial court did not limit State Farm’s reading of the deposition in any way”is a misstatement of the facts in the record. The trial court did, in fact, prohibit State Farm from reading that part of Valera’s deposition where he claims he was not treated by Best Therapy for the Miami Beach accident. Because the circuit court opinion was based upon the wrong record facts and the opinion’s holding is unsupported by evidence in the record on a key issue concerning the actual portion of David Valera’s deposition excluded from consideration by the jury, the circuit court decision warrants second tier certiorari review; we grant the petition of certiorari and quash the opinion below as the decision constitutes a miscarriage of justice.

Petition for writ of certiorari granted, opinion quashed, remanded for further consideration.

On remand, the appellate court should reconsider whether or not the trial court abused its discretion, in determining that Best Therapy would have been prejudiced by State Farm’s amendment of its pleadings to allow for a properly pled affirmative defense of fraud, in light of the fact that Best Therapy was aware of the affirmative defense since, at the very least, the time of the filing of State Farm’s motion to amend.

 Lesson 

Insurers in Florida, and any other state, where evidence of fraud is discovered in discovery, should immediately move for permission to amend their answer to include an unambiguous affirmative defense of fraud to avoid a judge ruling in favor of the insured or the insured’s vendors when evidence of fraud is clear and unambiguous.

When obvious fraud occurs – and what could be more obvious than sworn testimony from the patient that he had never been treated – the court is obliged to enter a judgment for the defense. The trial court in this case did the opposite and the Court of Appeal was correct in returning the case to the trial court.

 The story that follows is based on fact. It is, however, a work of fiction. The names, places and descriptions have been changed to protect the guilty. Any resemblance to real people is purely coincidental. This story was written for the purpose of providing insurers, those in the insurance business, and the insurance buying public sufficient information to recognize and join in the fight against insurance fraud. 
 
 Who’s Cheating Whom 

 Some people act too smart for their own good.  They want to commit a fraud but don’t know how.  In so doing they hurt themselves rather than help.

When I was a young insurance adjuster, thirty years ago, the company, I worked for insured a homeowner who owned a Capuchin monkey as a pet.  The monkey was a friendly sort.  He did not like confinement to the house.

One day, when the insured was not looking, the monkey escaped.  He was a pet and did not want to run away.  He just wanted out of the house.  His escape, therefore, led him to the roof of the next door neighbor’s house.

The next-door-neighbor had a tile roof.  The monkey’s sharp little toenails made an infuriating clicking noise as he ran back and forth on the tiles.  The neighbor, unable to stand the noise, came out of the house and saw her neighbor’s monkey on her roof.  The insured was not home.  The noise was unbearable.  Not only did he scratch his nails on her roof but he chattered incessantly.  She yelled at him without success.  She picked up stones from her yard and began throwing them at the monkey.       The claimant did not know how aggressive little wild animals can be.  The monkey took offense when hit by a stone.  He jumped to her shoulder sinking his claws through her thin cotton shirt and taking a bite out of her neck.

Shortly, the insured returned home at about the same time, patiently removed the monkey from her neighbor’s neck and applied first aid.  The insured reported the incident to her insurance company and I was assigned to adjust the claim.  I met the neighbor who informed me that she was a good woman.  She said she did not wish to take advantage of her neighbor.  She had gone to her doctor who applied anesthetically and a bandage.  The doctor told her to clean the wound out daily with hydrogen peroxide and place on it new dressings for a week.  She wanted only to be paid her doctor’s $100 office visit charge $5.00 for the bottle of peroxide and $1.00 for the bandages.

Since liability appeared clear, I readily accepted her offer of settlement. The claimant did not ask for any recovery for her pain and suffering.  She did not ask to be paid for the trouble and inconvenience she went through to have her wound bandaged.      I thought I had an excellent settlement.  I told the claimant I would send her a check and asked, only, that she allow me to complete my file by sending me the doctor’s bill and the receipts for the peroxide and bandages.

The check, with the release printed on the back, went in the mail that day.  It was negotiated by the claimant immediately.  The receipts and billing from the doctor appeared the next day in my office.

Normally they just would have been filed without a glance, the file closed and put away.  This time, I was waiting for a telephone call from a private lawyer to settle a $100,000 case and had time on my hands.  I looked at the doctor’s bill she sent me and found that it was an original carbon.  The doctor kept the original bill and gave the claimant a carbon copy.  On the carbon for the office visit charge were the numbers one and zero in blue followed by an additional zero in black ballpoint.

 The claimant, who for an injury of her type, could have easily talked me into paying her $1,000 to $3,000 thought she had cheated me by changing a $10.00 doctor bill to $100.00 bill.  In so doing she gained $90.00 and lost $3,000.

Her fraud was a success.  We did nothing.  We reported the fraud to no one.  The insured owed the claimant much more than the $106.00 we paid her.  The claimant probably thought she committed a brilliant fraud.  This time the person actually damaged by the fraud was the claimant, not the insurance company.

Adjusters must always keep in mind that when they receive a claim that seems too good to be true there is a very high probability that it is, in fact, too good to be true.

 The Eight Corners Rule Is Unfair 
 Posted on September 21, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Texas Court of Appeal Avoids Unfair Eight Corners Rule 

 The “Eight Corners Rule” and the “Four Corners Rule” of insurance contract interpretation followed in Texas and many other states will often result in strange and unfair decisions. When the decision on coverage is based only on the words alleged in the law suit, regardless of the existence of evidence that the allegations are false, the evidence and law is placed at the mercy of the lawyer who drafts the suit. The rule allows a plaintiff’s lawyer to carefully word a lawsuit to deprive an insured who is entitled to coverage of a defense and to force an insurer to defend a party who is not entitled to a defense.

The weakness of the Eight Corners Rule is that a lawyer knowledgeable about insurance and insurance law can phrase a suit in such a way to compel an insurer to defend the defendant even if the facts that will be proved at trial are such that there would never be the availability of defense or indemnity to the insured defendant. Similarly, as in a case of which I have personal knowledge, a lawyer was instructed to draw a complaint solely in words of intentional tort to cause the insured person to pay for his own defense. 

Counsel do so to squeeze a settlement from a defendant’s insurer or deprive the insured of insurance for an expensive defense. In Reeves County, Texas and v. Houston Casualty Company , No. 08-09-00256-CV (Tex.App. Dist.8 09/14/2011) the Texas Court of Appeal was faced with an Eight Corners Argument but still found in favor of the insurer because the defense asserted by the insurer was found within the eight corners of the Suit.

 THE TRIAL COURT DECISION 

Houston Casualty Company (“Houston Casualty”) received summary judgment in a declaratory action that Houston Casualty did not have a duty to defend and indemnify Reeves County and Sheriff Gomez  (the “insured”) under a non-profit organization liability policy. Reeves County and Sheriff Gomez appealed.

The insured contend the trial court erred in granting Houston Casualty’s motion for summary judgment.

 FACTS 

 In 2001, Mr. Pascual Olibas brought action against the insured in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (“2001 suit”). In this suit, Mr. Olibas alleged the defendants“violated [his] civil rights by interfering with his ability to operate as a bail bondsman in Reeves County in retaliation for [his] exercising certain constitutionally protected rights, including his right to freedom of speech and to seek redress of grievances under the First Amendment.”The 2001 suit was settled in 2002, and the insurance carriers who provided a defense to the insureds were named as third-party beneficiaries.

In December 2004, Houston Casualty issued a non-profit organization liability policy naming Reeves County as insured (“the Policy”). This“claims-made”policy covered certain types of claims“first made”against the insured between the policy period of December 1, 2004 and December 2005. In 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Olibas brought action against the insured in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (“2005 suit”). Thereafter, Reeves County and Sheriff Gomez offered the Olibases’complaint in the 2005 suit to Houston Casualty, and requested insurance defense and indemnity under the Policy. Houston Casualty refused to provide coverage for this claim.

In May 2007, the insured sued its insurers and requested a declaration from the trial court that Houston Casualty and Lexington Insurance Company (the “insurers”) owed them a defense and indemnity under their insurance policies. In October 2007, the insured filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their claims for defense and indemnity, and Houston Casualty filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’claims for defense and indemnity. 

The insured objected to the Motion for Summary Judgment on the basis of the“eight corners”rule, specifically as to Mr. Olibas’s complaint in the 2001 suit, the settlement agreement between Mr. Olibas and the Appellants in 2002, and a portion of an exhibit which included Reeves County’s application for the Houston Casualty policy, as well as Reeves County’s financial statement and independent auditor’s report from December 31, 2003.

The trial court granted Houston Casualty’s motion for summary judgment, denied Reeves County and Sheriff Gomez’s motion for partial summary judgment, and overruled the Appellants’objections to Houston Casualty’s summary judgment evidence.

 ANALYSIS 

Because the trial court’s order did not specify the ground(s) on which Houston Casualty’s summary judgment was granted, and because there were multiple grounds on which summary judgment may have been granted in the instant case, the insured must negate all grounds on appeal.

 The insured argued that the trial court erred in granting Houston Casualty’s motion for summary judgment as to their claims that it had a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify.

Both parties moved for summary judgment on the duty to defend. Houston Casualty argued the Olibases’complaint in the 2005 suit failed to allege a covered claim that would trigger its duty to defend or indemnify the insured because the 2005 suit resulted from a dispute involving the operation of the Reeves County jail, and did not occur during the policy period, but arose in 2001, and were“mere continuations of the 2001 Litigation, a lawsuit that was settled. Houston Casualty also noted that the Policy did not cover the operation or activities of any jail or detention facility.

The insured argued that Houston Casualty’s duty to defend was triggered because the insurance coverage was a“claims-made policy,”rather than an occurrence coverage, and the Olibases made their“claim”within the policy coverage period.

The insured bears the initial burden to establish that its claim falls within the scope of coverage provided by the policy. Should the insured establish a right to coverage, the burden then shifts to the insurer to demonstrate that the claim is subject to a policy exclusion. If the insurer is able to establish that an exclusion applies, the burden shifts back to the insured to show that an exception to the exclusion brings the claim back within the terms of the policy.

The Court of Appeal agreed with Houston Casualty. This provision was listed apart from the fourteen exclusions as set forth under Section V of the Policy; instead, it was listed under Section VII, entitled“Other Conditions and Agreements.”Therefore, it was not an exclusion, and so the insured had the initial burden to show their claim falls within the scope of coverage provided by the Policy.

In Texas, and everywhere else, insurance policies are interpreted according to the general rules of contract construction.  The primary concern in interpreting a contract is to determine the true intent of the parties. The Texas Supreme Court has held that in construing the terms of an insurance contract, courts“must read all parts of a contract together.” 

Generally, the duty to defend is dependant on the type and scope of coverage provided by the policy agreement. An insurer’s duty to defend is determined according to the“eight corners,”or“complaint allegations”rule in Texas. The insurer’s duty to defend is determined entirely by the allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy. All that is needed to invoke the duty are factual allegations which support a claim potentially covered by the policy. Any doubt that the facts alleged give rise to the duty are resolved in favor of the insured. Facts outside the pleadings, regardless of how easily they can be found or validated, are not ordinarily considered. In Texas the duty to defend does not depend on what the facts are, or what might be determined finally by the trier of the facts. It depends only on what the facts are alleged to be. Applying the eight-corners rule, a reviewing court interprets the allegations in the petition liberally, and resolves any doubts in favor of the duty to defend. The insured need only show that a reasonable reading of the allegations would allow evidence of a claim that is covered by the policy, not that the claim itself be clearly demonstrated by the language of the pleadings. In addition, the reviewing court must read the underlying petitions in light of the insurance policy’s provisions, and focus the analysis on the“origin of the damages rather than on the legal theories alleged.”In the present case, Section I of the Policy states: 
 
 The Company shall pay on behalf of the INSURED all LOSS and DEFENSE COSTS that the INSURED becomes legally obligated to pay solely because of a CLAIM first made against the INSURED during the POLICY PERIOD, or the Extended Reporting Period if in effect, for a WRONGFUL ACT committed or allegedly committed by the INSURED. 
 
Section VII concerning the Policy’s other conditions and agreements state under“Interrelated Acts”:
 
 A CLAIM or CLAIMS by one or more claimants made against one or more INSUREDS which arise out of the same WRONGFUL ACT or interrelated WRONGFUL ACTS shall be deemed to be a single CLAIM and shall be deemed to have been made when the first of such CLAIMS is made. Any interrelated WRONGFUL ACTS shall be deemed to have been committed when the first of any such WRONGFUL ACTS was committed.“Wrongful act”is defined under the Policy as: 

 [A]ny error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect or breach of duty committed, attempted or allegedly committed or attempted, by any INSURED, individually or otherwise, in an INSURED capacity, including WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES, PERSONAL INJURY or THIRD PARTY DISCRIMINATION. 
 
 The Policy did not define the term“interrelated wrongful acts.”Moreover, the Policy itself did not indicate that any particular definition, or a limited or restricted definition, should be used to replace the plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning of“interrelated.”No Texas appellate court, or the Fifth Circuit, has interpreted the term“interrelated wrongful act.”Texas courts have had occasion to interpret the term“related”in an insurance policy. Our sister court gave the term“related”its ordinary and generally accepted meaning.  Citing the Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, that court concluded that“related”meant“having a logical or causal connection.”As such, we will construe“interrelated”according to its ordinary meaning.

The Texas Supreme Court has never recognized an exception to the strict eight-corners rule so as to allow courts to examine extrinsic evidence in determining an insurer’s duty to defend. Houston Casualty concedes this in its brief. However, Houston Casualty points out that regardless of whether the trial court considered the 2001 complaint, the complaint in the 2005 suit contained sufficient facts about the 2001 suit“to demonstrate the two suits allege interrelated wrongful acts.”In 2005, the 2005 complaint alleged in part that:
 
 In 2001, in Cause No. EP-01-CA-0371-DB, Plaintiff Pascual Olibas sued Defendants Gomez and Reeves County, Government Defendants herein, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, El Paso Division, alleging that these Defendants had violated Plaintiff’s civil rights by interfering with his ability to operate as a bail bondsman in Reeves County in retaliation for Plaintiff exercising certain constitutionally protected rights, including his right to freedom of speech and to seek redress of grievances under the First Amendment. 

 The 2005 complaint also alleged the parties settled the 2001 suit in 2002, and the insurance carriers who provided a defense to Sheriff Gomez and Reeves County were named as third-party beneficiaries. The settlement agreement stated that Mr. Olibas and his bail bond company would“be accorded all the rights and privileges accorded generally to bail bondsmen in Reeves County, Texas,”and that all future Reeves County bail bond policies would be non-discriminatory in both content and application. 
 
Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the complaint in the 2005 suit alleged sufficient facts regarding the 2001 suit to establish the invocation of the“interrelated acts”provision. Based on the facts alleged in the underlying suits, the Court of Appeal agreed with Houston Casualty that this is not a case where only a slight or attenuated connection existed between two sets of wrongful acts.  The two suits both presented alleged facts as to Sheriff Gomez’s retaliatory actions. The Court of Appeal  concluded that the wrongful acts that formed the basis of the 2005 suit were interrelated wrongful acts under the plain meaning of the Policy language, and as such, the claims as to the 2001 and 2005 suits constituted a single claim under the Policy. Based on the plain language of the Policy, because the 2005 suit involved an interrelated wrongful act with the 2001 suit, and any such act occurred prior to the commencement of the policy period, which was on December 1, 2004, any claims related to the 2005 suit were not covered under the Policy.

Because the insured failed to satisfy their burden of establishing that the claims were first made during the policy period, and the claims in the 2005 suit were first made in 2001, no coverage exists as to the 2005 claims under the Policy.

Under the“eight corners”rule, the Court of Appeal did not need to address the other grounds raised in its motion as to this particular duty.

The insurer’s duty to indemnify depends on the facts proven and whether the damages caused by the actions or omissions proven are covered by the terms of the policy. Evidence is usually necessary in the coverage litigation to establish or refute an insurer’s duty to indemnify. This is especially true when the underlying liability dispute is resolved before a trial on the merits and there was no opportunity to develop the evidence.

 LESSON 

 If counsel intends to draw in the availability of insurance under the eight corners rule counsel must, before filing suit, obtain and read the insurance policy wording to determine the allegations necessary to force the insurer to defend, whether with reservation of rights or not.

Although the lawyer failed to compel Houston Casualty in this case more creative writing could have obtained coverage for the insureds. This case, and those it cites to explain the Texas Eight Corners rule make it clear that the rule is unfair and unreasonable and allows creative counsel to require an insurer to defend and, perhaps, indemnify an insured when it never agreed to take the risk that was the true basis of the suit. A creative lawyer suing a defendant who laid in wait for weeks and finally murdered the plaintiff’s decedent could obtain coverage for the defendant by alleging that the killing was an accident even after the defendant is convicted of premeditated murder.

It is more equitable if courts determine the duty to defend by considering more than the allegations in the underlying complaint. Rather, the duty to defend may be triggered if the insurer learns of facts from any source that create the potential for liability. ( CNA Casualty of California v. Seaboard Surety Co. (1986) 176 Cal. App. 3d 598, 606 [222 Cal. Rptr. 276].) Likewise, the insurer may produce undisputed extrinsic evidence that eliminates the possibility of coverage. (See Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Cour t (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 287, 304 [24 Cal. Rptr. 2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153].)

Trial lawyers should not be given the power to change the true meaning of an insurance policy by creative pleading.

 When A Farm Is Not a Farm 
 Posted on September 20, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance is Limited to Risk Taken 

 Farming is the operation of an agricultural or aquacultural enterprise. An operation in business for the production of food. When a farming operation includes a business that is not farming, the limitations of a farm owners policy can eliminate coverage for losses resulting from the non-farming operations. In G. Neil Tocher et al v. Sequoia Insurance Company , No. C066390 (Cal.App. Dist.3 09/15/2011), a not officially published case, the insured plaintiffs G. Neil Tocher and Missy Ann Tocher, doing business as Lone Rancher Enterprises, LP (the Tochers), attempted to stretch the meaning of “farming” and “aquaculture.” Their attempt failed and their insurer denied the Tocher’s claim. The Torchers sued Sequoia Insurance Company (Sequoia) after Sequoia denied the Tochers’tender of defense in an underlying arbitration proceeding and then appealed.

The Tochers contended on appeal that coverage existed under the personal injury liability provision of the Sequoia policy.

 BACKGROUND 

The Tochers own a 547-acre farm and cattle ranch (known as the Twin Valley Ranch) located near Whitmore, California (the property). The property has many lakes, watering ponds and pastures. 

On September 25, 2007, the Tochers entered into a written 45-year lease and land use agreement (the lease agreement) with Shasta View, Inc., doing business as T.V. Ranch Hydro Management (Shasta View). The lease agreement was“for the lease, licensing and utilization of California State Water Resource Control Board (SWRCB) Water Use Permit . . . for the purpose of [the] generation, sale and delivery of electrical energy for the mutual profit of [the Tochers and Shasta View] and in a manner which will not detract from the agricultural activities on [the property].”The lease agreement provided that the Tochers’and Shasta View’s names would be listed as co-owners on California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) water use permits and licenses and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exemptions and licenses, and for the equal sharing of all permit, licensing, and exemption fees. After signing the agreement twith Shasta View the ranch had two different operations, ranching and power generation.

 Under the lease agreement, Shasta View would pay the Tochers $400,000 and 35 percent of all monies Shasta View received from the sale of the hydroelectric power generated at the property, minus expenses for taxes on the improvements and equipment used in, and insurance for, the hydroelectric power operation. The lease agreement required the Tochers to make all water not used on the property available to Shasta View for power generation, and it required Shasta View to purchase, install, operate, and maintain new power-producing equipment at the powerhouse located on the property and to pay for any modification, maintenance, or repair to the forebay, penstocks, springs, or Murphy ditch. The lease agreement contained a mandatory arbitration provision.

Sequoia issued a policy of insurance to the Tochers covering farming operations on the property during the period August 23, 2008, to August 23, 2009 (Sequoia Policy). The Sequoia Policy provided first-party property coverage and third-party liability coverage. The farmowners policy declarations to the Sequoia Policy identified the Tochers as the named insureds and described the Tochers’business as“Grazing Land Leased to Others.”The farmowners policy did not describe the business to include power generation.

The Sequoia Policy covered damages because of“personal injury”if caused by an offense“[a]rising out of . . . operations usual or incidental to‘farming.’”(Emphasis added)

On December 1, 2008, the Tochers filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association against Shasta View. The Tochers alleged that Shasta View breached the lease agreement by authorizing the construction of modifications to the powerhouse and the penstock and installing power-producing equipment without notifying the proper government agencies and obtaining necessary permits, thereby exposing the Tochers to adverse actions by those government agencies.

Shasta View filed an answer and counterclaims against the Tochers in the arbitration proceeding, alleging that the Tochers wanted Shasta View to complete maintenance and improvement work on the forebay and the Murphy ditch because the Tochers wanted that system to irrigate their ranch, to their sole benefit and not because of any need of the hydroelectric power operation.

On January 21, 2009, the Tochers tendered the defense of the Shasta View counterclaims to Sequoia. The Tochers asserted that the counterclaims were covered under the“personal injury”liability and the“occurrence-based property damage”provisions of the Sequoia Policy. In particular, the Tochers asserted that the hydroelectric facility constituted an“aquacultural enterprise”and“farming.” 

On January 29, 2009, Sequoia denied the Tochers’tender of defense, claiming that it had no duty to defend because (1) the alleged“personal injury”did not arise out of the Tochers’“farming”operations, and (2) the Shasta View counterclaims were excluded under the“business pursuits”provision of the Sequoia Policy.

The Tochers sued Sequoia in Shasta County Superior Court, asserting causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief.

On December 23, 2009, the Tochers filed a motion for summary adjudication against Sequoia. The trial court granted Sequoia’s request that it take judicial notice that the term“aquaculture”meant“the cultivation of aquatic plants or animals in natural or controlled marine or freshwater environments, particularly for food.”The trial court concluded that even if Shasta View’s counterclaims against the Tochers satisfied the definition of“personal injury”under the Sequoia Policy, the policy only provided coverage for conduct arising out of operations usual or incidental to“farming,”and any“personal injury”alleged against the Tochers did not arise out of operations usual or incidental to“farming”because the parties’power-generation operation did not constitute an“agricultural”or“aquacultural”operation.  The parties noted that the ruling was dispositive even though Sequoia filed no motion to dismiss and stipulated to a judgment so the appeal could be heard.

 DISCUSSION 

 A liability insurer must defend its insured against claims that seek damages against the insured on any theory that, if proved, would be covered by the policy. California courts determine whether a duty to defend exists in a given case by examining the terms of the insurance policy, the allegations of the third-party claim, and all facts known to the insurer from any source, including facts extrinsic to the third-party claim and those facts the insurer might have ascertained had it diligently pursued the requisite inquiry into the details surrounding the tender of defense.

Pursuant to the unambiguous language of the Sequoia Policy, the first two counterclaims were not claims for“personal injury”within the meaning of the Sequoia Policy because they did not involve the oral or written publication of material that disparaged goods, products, or services. Moreover, the Tochers have not identified any facts that would show a“personal injury”in connection with these claims for damages. Accordingly, Shasta View’s counterclaims based on the Tochers’demand for work on the forebay and the Murphy ditch and demand to install a turbine and generator were not covered by the Sequoia Policy.

Regarding the counterclaim, the Tochers contend that Shasta View stated a“personal injury”claim because it accused the Tochers of disparaging Shasta View’s performance under the lease agreement in order to interfere with Shasta View’s efforts to complete its work on the hydroelectric facility. The Court of Appeal concluded that even if the court assumed that the counterclaim asserted disparagement of Shasta View’s goods, products or services and thus constituted a claim for“personal injury”as defined by the Sequoia Policy, the Tochers also needed to establish that the alleged disparagement arose out of operations usual or incidental to the Tochers’“farming”operations. 

The Sequoia Policy defined“farming”as“the operation of an agricultural or aquacultural enterprise.”The Court of Appeal found no California case interpreting insurance policy language similar to the particular language at issue here, i.e.,“[a]rising out of . . . operations usual or incidental to‘farming.’”

In other factual contexts, however, courts have interpreted the terms“farming”and“farming operations”in insurance policies to include the raising and grazing of animals, the sale of cattle by a cattle rancher, the preparation and sale of potato seed by a potato farming business, the sale of hay bales by hay farmers, and crop dusting that damaged another farmer’s crops.

G. Neil Tocher declared that he owned a“farm and cattle ranch”and maintained“stock ponds”on the property. But there is no evidence that Shasta View was engaged in any cattle ranching or other“agricultural”operation at the property or that Shasta View had any involvement with the stock ponds on the property. Hydroelectric power generation is not“aquaculture,”the cultivation of aquatic plants or animals. It only uses water to generate electricity by running generators through the flow of water.

Nonetheless, the Tochers argued that potential coverage exists because the required maintenance of the forebay and the Murphy ditch arose out of the Tochers’“farming”operations. In G. Neil Tocher’s reply declaration, the Tochers asserted that the forebay and the Murphy ditch had a dual purpose as part of the hydroelectric power system and also as part of the irrigation, water-conservation, erosion-control, flood-control and fire-suppression systems for the Tochers’ranch.

T he fact that the forebay and the Murphy ditch served a dual purpose does not establish that Shasta View was involved in farming activities. Instead, the record establishes that Shasta View was involved in power generation, not farming. The express purpose of the lease agreement was the“generation, sale and delivery of electrical energy”which could not“detract”from the agricultural activities on the property.

The lease agreement clearly differentiated between the purpose of the agreement—power generation—and the other farming activities on the property. Shasta View alleged in its counterclaims that the Tochers’demands concerning the forebay and the Murphy ditch breached the lease agreement because the demands did not pertain to power generation. Shasta View’s counterclaims mirrored the terms of the lease agreement, asserting that the hydroelectric power operation was for the parties’mutual benefit while the irrigation system was for the Tochers’sole benefit. The Tochers have not established that the alleged disparagement of Shasta View pertained to any farming activities by Shasta View.

Thus, although the Tochers’motive in requesting work on the forebay and the Murphy ditch may have related to their farming operation, the Shasta View counterclaims for which the Tochers sought insurance coverage related only to the hydroelectric power operation.

Finally, the Tochers asserted that the heart of the dispute with Shasta View was the allocation of water from the forebay to either the irrigation system or the hydroelectric facility. But the portions of Shasta View’s counterclaims cited by the Tochers do not establish a dispute over allocation of water on the property.

Courts should not, and the California Court of Appeal would not, indulge in forced construction so as to fasten liability on an insurance carrier which it has not assumed. (Johnson v. First State Ins. Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1083.) The evidence in the record shows that Shasta View’s counterclaims arose out of the hydroelectric power operation on the property and that such claims were not within the objectively reasonable contemplation of the“personal injury”liability coverage of the Sequoia Policy. Because the undisputed facts eliminate any possibility of coverage for Shasta View’s counterclaims under the Sequoia Policy, the trial court correctly determined that Sequoia did not owe the Tochers a duty of defense.

 LESSON 

Although the court may have admired the creativity of the claim that a hydroelectric facility was a type of aquaculture it refused to change the meaning of clear and unambiguous language to force coverage upon an insurer it did not intend to, nor did it, assume. This case teaches that insurers should, before agreeing to insure or not insure a particular insured, determine the risks that it is being asked to assume and should limit its exposure by using clear and unambiguous language and by placing within the policy full definitions of terms that may be subject to interpretation.

Those who would be insured for all of the risks of loss faced by their business should advise the insurer of the risks it wants the insurer to take. The Torchers might have avoided the suit and appeal if they merely described the risk they wished the insurer to take as “Grazing Land Leased to Others and a hydroelectric facility.”

 Vermont Limits Recovery of Continuing Loss to Time on Risk 
 Posted on September 19, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Pay Only for the Risk Taken 

In Vermont, a gas stations storage tanks leaked into the environment for at least 27 years. The state, who paid for the clean up of the pollutant sued Stonington Insurance Company (Stonington) to recover the cost of cleaning up the pollution. Stonington only insured the risk for 3 ½ years and argued that it should only pay its pro-rata share of the expense. In Bradford Oil Company, Inc. v. Stonington Insurance Company, 2011 Vt. 108 (Vt. 09/11/2011) the Vermont Supreme Court agreed.

The controversy in this appeal is between the State of Vermont, which runs the Vermont Petroleum Cleanup Fund (VPCF) and Stonington, which insured Bradford Oil, the owner of the underground storage tanks, for approximately a three-and-a-half-year period. The State appealed the trial court’s judgment limiting Stonington’s liability to a 4/27 share of past and future cleanup costs and awarding the State $45,172.05.

 The Contentions 

On appeal, the State unsuccessfully argued: 

(1)     this Court’s application of time-on-the-risk allocation in Towns v. Northern Security Insurance Co. , 2008 VT 98, 184 Vt. 322, 964 A.2d 1150, does not preclude joint and several liability under all standard occurrence-based policy language;

(2)     the circumstances here, including the reasonable expectations of the insured and the equity and policy considerations, support imposing joint and several liability on Stonington for all of the State’s VPCF expenditures; and

(3)     even if time-on-the-risk allocation would otherwise be appropriate, Stonington is not entitled to such allocation because it has failed to show sufficient facts to apply this allocation method in the present case.

Plaintiff Bradford Oil Company, Inc. (Bradford) owns a Mobil station in St. Johnsbury that is the site of the petroleum contamination at issue. According to the parties’experts, the contamination may have begun as early as the 1960s or as late as the end of the 1970s. The Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) placed the site on the Vermont Hazardous Waste Sites List when, in April 1997, petroleum contamination was discovered following the removal of three underground storage tanks.

In recent years, at the State’s direction, Bradford has been paying to investigate and clean up the contamination, and the VPCF has reimbursed most of Bradford’s expenses. Bradford initiated this case in 2006 to establish coverage for its cleanup liability under four commercial general liability policies from Stonington. The State cross-claimed seeking reimbursement to the VPCF from Stonington under the same policies. The coverage periods for the policies at issue began on July 18, 1994, and continued through December 1, 1997.

 Allocation Issues 

The allocation question arises because the coverage periods of Bradford’s Stonington policies cover only a portion of the total time that contamination was allegedly occurring and that other policies might have been triggered, if any others existed. Stonington filed a motion for partial summary judgment in October 2009, asserting that a simple time-on-the-risk allocation method should apply in this case and that the company should be held liable for damages only in proportion to the time it assumed the risk of loss. Under a time-on-the-risk allocation or“pro-ration by years”method, each triggered policy bears responsibility for damages in proportion to the time it was“on the risk,”relative to the total time of triggered coverage. Towns, 2008 VT 98, (quotation omitted). Stonington argued that the trial court should follow this Court’s decision in Towns, where we held that a simple time-on-the-risk allocation method was appropriate based on standard occurrence-based insurance policy language in the context of slowly occurring environmental contamination.

 Analysis 

The central question here is which of the two principal methods of allocating costs and damages is appropriate given the facts of this case. The first allocation method, advocated for by the State, is joint and several liability, in which“any policy on the risk for any portion of the period in which the insured sustained property damage . . . is jointly and severally obligated to respond in full, up to its policy limits, for the loss.” Towns , 2008 VT 98, ¶ 33 (quotation omitted). Under joint and several liability as argued by the State, Stonington would be liable for all cleanup costs up to its policy limits, irrespective of when the contaminant exposure occurred, but would have the right to obtain contribution from other insurers or the owner for the period in which there is no insurance based on a time-on-the risk analysis. The second method, advocated for by Stonington, and adopted by the trial court, is the time-on-the-risk or“pro-ration by years”method in which“each triggered policy bears a share of the total damages proportionate to the number of years it was on the risk, relative to the total number of years of triggered coverage.”Id. (quotation omitted). Under this method, Stonington is liable for only 4/27, or 15%, of the cleanup costs.

Specific policy language limiting coverage affects whether liability allocation should be joint and several or related to time on the risk.“Claims-made”policies generally restrict coverage to claims made during the policy period without regard to the timing of the damage or injury.“Occurrence-based”policies, on the other hand, provide coverage only for injury or property damage“which occurs during the policy period.”; see also Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., 913 P.2d 878, 892 (Cal. 1995) (holding that standard occurrence-based policy“was intended to provide coverage when damage or injury . . . occurs during the policy period”). In cases of contamination from continuing leakage of hazardous materials, courts have used the“continuous trigger”theory to find that damage from continuous exposure to contaminants during a policy period is an“occurrence”sufficient to trigger coverage under an occurrence-based policy.

 The court concluded that an objectively reasonable insured reading the relevant policy language would expect coverage for liability from property damage occurring outside the policy period.  Read as a whole, the policy neither makes nor implies a promise to pay one hundred per cent of Boston Gas’s liability for multi-year pollution damage occurring decades before or after the policy period. No reasonable policyholder could have expected that a single one-year policy would cover all losses caused by toxic industrial wastes released into the environment over the course of several decades. Any reasonable insured purchasing a series of occurrence-based policies would have understood that each policy covered it only for property damage occurring during the policy year.

To summarize, the reasonable expectation of the insured, if it controls at all, is too uncertain for the Supreme Court to rely upon when fashioning an allocation rule for insurers.

The State’s reasonable expectation arguments did not persuade the court to abandon Towns or to distinguish that decision in this case. In fact, there are multiple reasons why the evidence may show gaps in insurance coverage:

(1)     the landowner chose not to purchase insurance;
(2)     there is insurance, but the carrier is insolvent;
(3)     there is insurance, but the landowner cannot locate the policy or identify the insurer;
(4)     there is insurance, but the risk is covered by an exclusion;
(5)     insurance for the risk involved is unavailable.

 Time-on-the-Risk Allocation 

In general, courts that have adopted time-on-the-risk allocation have not deemed relevant why there is no effective insurance and have allocated orphan shares to the landowner. 

In conclusion, although the State argued that the decision in Towns can be distinguished, the Supreme Court concluded that this case fits squarely within the Towns holding. In order for the State to prevail, the Supreme Court would have to overrule much of the Towns holding. It declined to do so. The Supreme Court concluded that Towns does control and it was unconvinced by the State’s reasonable expectations, equity, and policy arguments to distinguish this recent decision.

 Fourth Circuit Refuses to Hear Challenge to Obamacare 
 Posted on September 19, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 When a“Penalty”is a Tax 

 The multiple cases running through the Federal Courts as a result of the“Affordable Care Act,”also known as Obamacare, have raised multiple views about the constitutionality of the act. The latest iteration was Liberty University, Incorporated, A Virginia Nonprofit Corporation v. Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, In His Official Capacity, No. 10-2347 (4th Cir. 09/08/2011) where the Fourth Circuit punted the issue of Obamacare’s constitutionality by refusing to decide by finding no jurisdiciton.

Because the suit brought by Liberty University, among others, constitutes in the opinion of the Fourth Circuit, a pre-enforcement action seeking to restrain the assessment of a tax, the Anti-Injunction Act strips them of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit vacated the judgment of the district court that found the law unconstitutional and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. As a result the Fourth Circuit refused to rule on the merits. Of course, the Fourth Circuit did not comment on the fact that the law does not mention the word “tax” and all of the pre-enactment argument by the President of the United States and the members of Congress claimed the Act was not a tax.

The Fourth Circuit, therefore, refusing to rule on the so-called “Affordable Care Act” has called the President and the Congress liars by concluding that the “penalties” imposed by the Act on those who do not fulfill the mandate to buy insurance, are taxes because the Affordable Care Act uses the Internal Revenue Code’s existing tax collection system to implement the penalty. Since only a“taxpayer”is subject to the penalty and the Code defines a“taxpayer”as“any person subject to any internal revenue tax”the“penalties”must be taxes.

Recognizing“that Congress has imposed”a potentially“harsh regime”on some taxpayers the question of whether these concerns“merit consideration”is a matter for Congress to weigh not, in the Fourth Circuit’s opinion, the courts.

Circuit Judge Davis dissented saying he thought they had jurisdiction but felt that the law was a proper exercise of the Commerce Clause power given Congress by the Constitution.

Hopefully, when this and other cases reach the U.S. Supreme Court next year it will resolve the issue and will not, as did the Fourth Circuit, punt by claiming lack of jurisdiction.

 California Court of Appeals Saves Lloyd’s Syndicate $12 Million 
 Posted on September 16, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Policy Wordings Must Be Read and Applied 

 Since posting this blog note the court of appeal ordered the case officially published. http://www.metnews.com/sos.cgi?1011%2FH035246 

 California Court of Appeals Saves Lloyd’s Syndicate $12 Million 

 Insurance policies are contracts that make promises to defend or indemnify the person insured for certain enumerated risks of loss. When the loss is major – in this case over $12 million – insureds and trial courts sometimes stretch the language of the policy wording to allow an insured to obtain indemnity that was not promised. The California Court of Appeal, in an important – albeit not authorized for publication and not citeable as precedent – case called Fresh Express Incorporated v. Beazley Syndicate 2623/623 At Lloyd’s et al, No. H035246 (Cal.App. Dist.6 09/08/2011) laid cold eyes upon policy wording and reversed a $12 million verdict against Beazley.

In September 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) issued an“alert”advising that“consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach”due to“an outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7″that was possibly linked to consumption of bagged fresh spinach. The FDA advisory disclosed that there had already been reports of 50“cases of illness”and“one death.”The FDA withdrew its advisory two weeks later after the source of the outbreak had been identified.

Plaintiff Fresh Express Incorporated (Fresh Express), which markets bagged fresh spinach and other leafy greens, was not the source of the E. coli outbreak, but it suffered a significant loss of business in the wake of the FDA advisory. Fresh Express sought to recover these losses under its“TotalRecall+”insurance policy issued by defendants Beazley Syndicate 2623/623 at Lloyd’s and QBE Insurance (Europe) Limited (collectively Beazley). Beazley denied Fresh Express’s claim, and Fresh Express filed a breach of contract action against Beazley. Fresh Express prevailed at trial and recovered the $12 million policy limit.

Beazley appeals and claims that, because the trial court erroneously defined the“Insured Event”under the policy as“the E. coli outbreak,”the court awarded Fresh Express damages for losses that did not come within the policy’s coverage for losses that were the“direct result”of an“Insured Event”of“Accidental Contamination.”Beazley also contends that the trial court’s alternative theory that Fresh Express’s losses arose from“Accidental Contamination”is not supported by substantial evidence.

 Factual Background 

 The Insurance Policy 

 Beazley’s policy took effect on August 29, 2005 and expired on September 29, 2006. The policy was identified as“Malicious Contamination, Accidental Contamination and Products Extortion Insurance.”Only the“Accidental Contamination”coverage was considered by the Court of Appeal. The policy, for which Fresh Express paid a premium of $300,054.79, had a liability limit for“Accidental Contamination”of $12 million“per Insured Event and in the aggregate.”

The policy’s“INSURING AGREEMENT”provided that Beazley would“reimburse [Fresh Express] for losses as specified in this Policy arising out of Insured Events . . . incurred by [Fresh Express] . . . only where such losses arise because of:- [¶] . . . [¶] Section Two: Accidental Contamination, covering: [¶] Pre-Recall Expenses, Recall Expenses, Customer Recall Expenses, Product Rehabilitation, Loss of Gross Profits and Increased Cost of Working”and“Crisis Response fees . . . .”

“Accidental Contamination”was defined by the policy as:“Error by [Fresh Express] in the manufacture, production, processing, preparation, assembly, blending, mixing, compounding, packaging or labeling (including instructions for use) of any Insured Products or error by [Fresh Express] in the storage or distribution of any Insured Products whilst in the care or custody of [Fresh Express] which causes [Fresh Express] to have reasonable cause to believe that the use or consumption of such Insured Pr oducts has led or would lead to: [¶] i) bodily injury, sickness, disease or death of any person(s) or animal(s) physically manifesting itself by way of clear, obvious or visible symptoms within 120 days of use or consumption or [¶] ii) physical damage to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Insured Products themselves).”“Insured Event”was defined by the policy as“Malicious Contamination, Products Extortion or Accidental Contamination.”

The policy provided for a number of exclusions. It excluded:“a) Any expenses incurred by [Fresh Express] or any loss of Gross Profit for any reason other than as a direct result of an Insured Event”;“g) Any governmental ban of or loss of public confidence in any Insured Product or any material or substance used in any Insured Products”; and“i) Loss or damage directly or indirectly occasioned by . . . the order of any governmental or public or local authority.”

 The September 2006 E. Coli 0157:H7 Outbreak And Its Aftermath 

 E. coli 0157:H7 is a“very virulent organism”and an“extremely dangerous pathogen”that causes“life-threatening”illness. Cattle are the primary source of E. coli 0157:H7 contamination, but the pathogen may also be spread by wild animals and birds. This pathogen can attach to fresh produce, and it cannot be removed in processing or washed off by the consumer. In 2006, Fresh Express was the largest bagged spinach producer, and Dole was the only other producer with a large market share.

Fresh Express did not own any farms. It purchased all of its produce. Fresh Express’s primary spinach supplier was Fresh Farms. Although Fresh Farms grew most of its own produce, it also sometimes made“spot purchases”from other growers.

On September 14, the FDA contacted Fresh Express and two other spinach processors, told them that the FDA would be issuing an advisory, and“recommend[ed] that [they] take steps to recall.”The FDA also sent investigators to the processing facilities of these three spinach processors. At that point, the FDA“had no idea which brands”were responsible for the outbreak, so it lacked the authority to do anything more than issue an advisory.

On September 14, the FDA issued a“no consumption advisory”which advised that“consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach”due to“an outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7″that was possibly linked to consumption of bagged fresh spinach. The FDA advisory received“extreme media coverage”and became“one of the major news stories in the United States . . . .”Within 24 hours, bagged spinach had been completely removed from grocery stores throughout the United States. The FDA had never before issued such a broad advisory regarding a commodity. A no-consumption advisory was issued because E. coli 0157:H7 could not be removed by washing the spinach. The FDA’s advisory did not prevent producers from legally marketing fresh bagged spinach. The FDA did not have the authority to ban the sale of spinach unless it could“show that a particular brand or particular lot is adulterated . . . .” 

Fresh Express notified Beazley on September 22, 2006 that it was making a claim under its“TotalRecall+”policy. At that point, the FDA was still investigating whether Fresh Express was linked to the outbreak. The CDC had just received and was still testing two bags of Fresh Express’s spinach, which had been submitted by state health officials who considered these bags“suspect.”The CDC had evidence that implicated NSF as the source of most of the cases, but it had not been able to eliminate other producers. Fresh Express had contacted the FDA“and said,‘We don’t think that our product is suspect,’and we [the FDA] disagreed with them, and told them, yes, in fact, that we were not going to exclude them from the advisory at that time.”Fresh Express’s“position was, because of their practices, they were confident that their product was not involved . . . in the outbreak, but [the FDA was] unconvinced”due to the patient reports in the Kentucky cases.

Nothing had changed as of September 25. By September 26, infections were reported in 26 states. Around this time, the FDA became convinced that the outbreak was narrower than it had first thought. On September 28, Fresh Express learned that it had been cleared in the Kentucky cases.

By September 29, the FDA had determined the source of the outbreak was a single ranch associated with NSF.

Beazley ultimately denied Fresh Express’s claim.

 The Litigation 

 Fresh Express filed an action against Beazley for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Fresh Express’s first amended complaint alleged that Fresh Express’s violations of its company policies in making the Braga Farms/Eade Ranch lot 4 and Seco Packing/Bloomfield Farms purchases were“Errors”under the policy which gave Fresh Express“reasonable cause to believe”that its products were“partially responsible for the E. coli outbreak.”

The action was tried to the court. Fresh Express’s two damages witnesses testified that Fresh Express had suffered $18.8 million in losses between September 2006 and December 2006“attributed to the E. coli outbreak,”which they“assum[ed]”was the“insured event.”

In August 2009, the trial court issued a written ruling finding that Fresh Express was entitled to recover $12 million from Beazley. The court made the following findings in its August 2009 ruling.“Fresh Express’Quick Response Team (‘QRT’) assembled immediately upon learning of the outbreak and conducted investigations that determined Fresh Express had violated its own food safety policies and protocols in acquiring and processing raw product used in its fresh bagged spinach products. Because of these errors, the QRT found reasonable cause to believe that Fresh Express spinach products had led or would lead to its consumers becoming injured.”

The court concluded that Beazley had breached the insurance policy because Fresh Express had established”‘errors’within the meaning of the policy in the form of purchases from Seco Packing and Braga Eade Ranch in August 2006.”“[S]ales of bagged fresh spinach without enforcing Fresh Express’GAP [good agricultural practices] standards through a food safety audit program would create an unacceptable risk of harm to others. Fresh Express’verification of GAP compliance through grower audits was an integral and inseparable part of its safe manufacturing practices.”The court found that Fresh Express had“reasonable cause to believe that these errors . . . had led or would lead to bodily injury.” 

As to Beazley’s affirmative defenses, the court found inapplicable the exclusion regarding“a‘governmental ban’”because the FDA advisory“was not a ban.”“Fresh Express’losses were not caused by the FDA Advisory or a loss of public confidence. Instead, it appeared that the ultimate cause of the losses suffered by Fresh Express was the 2006 E. coli outbreak, the‘Insured Event’in this case. To adopt [Beazley&apos;s] interpretation of the policy . . . would render the coverage provisions under the policy meaningless.”The court found that Fresh Express had proven“that it suffered losses in excess of the Policy’s 12 million cap, that those losses were caused by an Insured Event, here the 2006 E. coli outbreak, and that those losses are covered by the Policy.”The court rejected Fresh Express’s breach of the implied covenant cause of action and postponed deciding the issue of prejudgment interest.

Notwithstanding its express finding that“the ultimate cause of Fresh Express’losses was the E. coli outbreak itself,”the trial court alternatively found that,“even under [Beazley&apos;s] interpretation”of the policy, Fresh Express’s“expenses and losses would be covered”because (1) Fresh Express’s“errors prevented Fresh Express from seeking a full exemption from the FDA’s Advisory against eating all bagged spinach,”and (2) Fresh Express’s“errors were particularly serious and would have required a recall but for the FDA Advisory.”

On November 17, 2009, the court entered judgment for Fresh Express. Fresh Express recovered damages of $12 million. The court found that Fresh Express’s entitlement to prejudgment interest did not begin until the court’s August 2009 ruling. Beazley timely filed a notice of appeal. Fresh Express timely filed a notice of cross-appeal.

 Discussion 

The policy language unambiguously rebuts Fresh Express’s view. The policy provides that Beazley will only“reimburse [Fresh Express] for losses as specified in this Policy arising out of Insured Events . . . incurred by [Fresh Express] . . . only where such losses arise because of . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . Accidental Contamination [or another specified Insured Event].”(Boldface&amp;italics added.) Therefore, the only insured losses are those that arise from, and because of, an“Insured Event.”Only three“Insured Events”are covered by the policy, and the only“Insured Event”at issue here is“Accidental Contamination.”

“Accidental Contamination”is defined by the policy as“[e]rror by [Fresh Express] in the manufacture, production, processing, preparation, [or] assembly . . . of any Insured Products . . . which causes [Fresh Express] to have reasonable cause to believe that the use or consumption of such Insured Products has led or would lead to”bodily injury.

Since the policy equates“Insured Event”and“Accidental Contamination,”the policy restricts recoverable losses to those“arising out of”and“because of”an“Error by [Fresh Express] . . . which causes [Fresh Express] to have reasonable cause to believe”that use of the product will cause bodily injury. (Italics added.) The policy also explicitly excludes from recoverable losses“[a]ny expenses incurred by [Fresh Express] or any loss of Gross Profit for any reason other than as a direct result of an Insured Event.”

 Clearly and unambiguously the only recoverable losses are those which are the“direct result”of an error by Fresh Express. 

The trial court’s finding that the“Insured Event”was“the E. coli outbreak”is entirely inconsistent with the plain language of the policy. The only type of“Insured Event”covered by the policy that was at issue here was“Accidental Contamination.”In order for the trial court’s finding to be true, it would have to be the case that“the E. coli outbreak”was“Accidental Contamination.”However,“Accidental Contamination”is defined by the policy as an“[e]rror by [Fresh Express]”that reasonably caused Fresh Express to believe that the use or consumption of its products would lead to bodily injury. While“the E. coli outbreak”itself may have given Fresh Express cause to believe that its products were contaminated,“the E. coli outbreak”was not an“[e]rror by [Fresh Express]”so it could not qualify as“Accidental Contamination”and thereby an“Insured Event”under the policy. Similarly, while the trial court found that Fresh Express’s losses were the direct result of“the E. coli outbreak”and therefore recoverable under the policy, the policy restricted recoverable losses to those that were the direct result of an“[e]rror by [Fresh Express].”

 LESSON 

The Court of Appeal, unlike the trial court, actually read the wording of the policy and applied it to the facts of the case. While the E. coli outbreak event may have given Fresh Express cause to believe that its products were contaminated, the E. coli outbreak was not an “error by Fresh Express,” so it could not qualify as “accidental contamination” and thereby an “insured event” under the policy. The policy, in clear and unambiguous language, restricted coverage to losses that were a direct result of an error by Fresh Express. Since the E. Coli outbreak was not due to an error by Fresh Express there was no covered event.

The decision is important and perhaps unusual because the Court of Appeal thoroughly examined the express policy wording, applied that wording to the facts of the E. coli even, and determined that the policy was not triggered. The analysis and interpretation of the policy language by the California Court of Appeal is an important guidepost (although it has no formal precedential effect) not only for future court decisions but also for the insurance industry as it develops and refines coverage forms for unusual risks of loss like product recall coverage. Courts should, as did the Court of Appeal, resist the temptation to stretch policy wordings to find coverage to provide coverage for the insured at the expense of the insurer who did not accept the risk of loss.

 Fraud Continues Unabated 
 Posted on September 15, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter 

 September 15, 2011 

Continuing with the eighteenth issue of the 15th Year of publication of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter (ZIFL) its author, Barry Zalma, reports that he has posted more than 225 articles for this blog “Zalma on Insurance” http://zalma.com/blog.

 IT’S NOT NICE TO LIE TO YOUR INSURER—IT’S EXPENSIVE 
 Posted on September 14, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Rescission is an Equitable Remedy 

 When facts essential to a decision to insure or not insure a particular risk are misrepresented or concealed there is no basis for a contract of insurance and it can be, and should be, rescinded. Rescission is an equitable remedy that allows an insurer that has been deceived to return to the status quo since it would be unfair to require it to insure a person it would not have insured had it known the truth.

Insurance agents and brokers who place insurance for businesses in which they hold a financial interest may find that they are held to the duties of an agent for the insured rather than an agent for the insurer, even if the agent has an effective agency agreement with the insurer allowing it to bind insurance. In Mountain City Ford, LLC v. Owners Insurance Company and Auto-Owners Insurance Company , No. 2009-CA-002233-MR (Ky.App. 09/02/2011) the Kentucky Court of Appeal agreed that the misrepresentations made were material and that the agent – who was also an owner of the insured – acted as agent for the insured when it submitted an application for information that concealed and misrepresented material facts.

This case is also important because it shows how a third party liability insurer – faced with a potential rescission – should deal with its insured by adequately reserving its rights and resolving the claim before seeking relief from the court and return of money paid. 




 THE ISSUE 

Whether Mountain City Ford or Auto-Owners should bear the loss for $1,030,000.00 paid in settlement to the original plaintiffs for injuries, including the death of Joey Kirk. These injuries were incurred in a motor vehicle accident between a Mountain City Ford vehicle driven by Rick Gussler and another vehicle driven by Paul Justice. 

 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 

Auto-Owners’policy insuring Mountain City Ford was predicated upon an insurance application prepared by The Elite Agency, Inc. (Elite) and signed by Mountain City, but the policy did not list Gussler as a driver.

 All parties agreed that Auto-Owners never knew of Gussler’s existence as a driver of Mountain City vehicles. It was undisputed that Gussler was not listed anywhere on Mountain City’s application to Auto-Owners and the proof at trial was undisputed that had Gussler been listed, Auto-Owners would never have issued the policy to Mountain City Ford.

Mountain City Ford and Mountain City Chevrolet are two small dealerships in Inez, Kentucky, that are owned by James Booth; his daughter, Angela Wilson; and Craig Preece. When they purchased the dealerships they had separate garage insurance policies with Universal Insurance.

Elite is an independent insurance agency founded in 1989 by Jim Booth, Craig Preece, and two other investors. Elite entered into an agency contract authorizing it to write insurance contracts for Auto-Owners.

Auto-Owners is a regional insurance carrier headquartered in Michigan. Auto-Owners writes property and casualty insurance as well as other lines. In 2007, Auto-Owners had a regional office in Lexington, Kentucky.

Marlena Lafferty was a young insurance agent who worked in the Inez, Kentucky, office of Elite. When she heard that Craig Preece, as co-owner of Elite and Mountain City, had suggested that Elite try to write insurance for the Mountain City dealerships, she began gathering information for an application to CarPac, another insurance company, to compare premium prices. Ultimately, she submitted the CarPac application on October 19, 2007, for both Mountain City dealerships. Page 12A of the CarPac application was an“employee/non-employee list.”

On the CarPac application, Lafferty identified all 27 dealership employees and clearly disclosed that Rick Gussler was a salesman who was“not licensed.”Lafferty testified that this information came from e-mails with Mountain City Ford in the first half of October. She also testified that in a telephone conversation with Wellman, he told her both Rick Crum at the Chevrolet dealership and Rick Gussler at the Ford dealership were prohibited from driving dealership vehicles because they did not have driver’s licenses.

 THE AUTO-OWNERS APPLICATION 

 The person who completed the Auto-Owners application for the Mountain City dealerships admitted that he only had one phone call with the dealership about the dealerships’inventory but otherwise had no contact with the dealerships about the application. He testified that he never saw the revised page 12A of the final CarPac application that listed all 27 employees of the dealerships, their jobs, their driver’s license numbers, and whether they were furnished dealership vehicles. As a result, the list of 16 drivers Grim submitted to Auto-Owners was inaccurate, compared to the information the Mountain City dealerships had supplied to Lafferty for the CarPac application.

The Mountain City dealerships application was the first ever submitted to Auto-Owners. The broker at Elite calculated the premium for Auto-Owners based on total payroll for all employees except any clerical staff who never drove dealership vehicles. At the end of the year, Auto-Owners would audit the payroll and adjust the premium up or down. Even though Elited did not know who Gussler was, Gussler’s compensation was included as a salesman in the total payroll figures.

 Abby Douglass worked as an underwriter in the Lexington, Kentucky, underwriting office of Auto-Owners until January 2008. Elite never disclosed Gussler as a salesman without a driver’s license, even though such information was disclosed to CarPac. Unbeknownst to Craig Preece, the Elite employee who submitted the application was uninformed about both Gussler being an employee and the Eligibility Guidelines of Auto-Owners.

At trial, Auto-Owners defended Mountain City Ford and Rick Gussler, but did so under a reservation of rights. Despite its misrepresentation coverage defense, Auto-Owners settled the claims for a total of $1,030,000.00 and then pursued this action to void the policy and seek reimbursement from Mountain City and Elite under theories of material misrepresentation and negligence.

Auto-Owners sought rescission and reimbursement from the dealerships for material misrepresentation because Gussler was not listed on the list of“drivers”in the application prepared by Elite. Elite knew of the existence of the unlicensed salesman and had disclosed him on an application to another insurance company, CarPac, but omitted to inform Auto-Owners of his existence.
 
The jury found against Mountain City but found that Elite was not liable for its failure to list Gussler on the drivers list on the application to Auto-Owners. Mountain City filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that Elite was acting as Auto-Owners’agent under Kentucky law and, thus, that the policy should not be voided ab initio.

The trial court denied Mountain City’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, holding that Elite was acting as the agent of Mountain City or as a dual agent for both Auto-Owners and the dealerships when it submitted the application for insurance coverage. The trial court concluded that the “jury has made the factual finding to the effect that Richard Gussler was in fact a driver of insured vehicles; that the omission was material to the risk; and that the Auto Owners would not have issued the policy of insurance had that fact been known.”  Those facts, coupled with the extraordinarily close relationship between Mountain City Ford, LLC, and the Elite Agency, persuaded the Court of Appeal that Elite was acting either as the agent for Mountain City, LLC, or at the very least, was acting in the capacity as a dual agent, for both Mountain City Ford, LLC, and Auto-Owners in preparing and submitting the application for insurance, and then issuing a binder.

 Under Kentucky law, whether an insurance agency is an agent for the insured or the insurer when preparing and submitting an application, given alleged material misrepresentations in an application, no one factor is determinative. In Kentucky the fact of agency must be decided on a case by case basis.  The Court of Appeal noted that even if an agency was the insurer’s agent for binding purposes, it did not necessarily mean that it was the insurer’s agent during policy issuance.

The Court of Appeal concluded that Elite was the agent of the dealerships. Specifically, the proof was that Craig Preece, as CFO for Mountain City, signed and verified the application as required by Auto-Owners, and he had the full opportunity to review the application, even though he testified that he did not read the application.

The evidence also demonstrated extensive special circumstances to support a finding that Elite was acting as Mountain City’s agent during the application and policy issuance process. In fact, Mountain City and Elite had the long standing relationship where the companies shared common ownership. The Court of Appeal concluded that the special close relationship and circumstances between Elite and Mountain City Ford supported a finding that Elite was acting as Mountain City Ford’s agent when it bound coverage through Auto-Owners. 

 LESSON 

An insurance agent or insurance broker is professionally obligated to professionally represent its principal (whether the prospective insured, the insurer, or both) and be certain that the facts stated in the application for insurance are correct and complete. Failure to do so can place the agent or broker in a position of being held responsible for losses suffered by the insured. When the agent or broker is also an owner of the prospective insured it is imperative that the agent or broker read every word i n the application – unlike Mr. Craig Preece – and ascertain that the application is totally accurate.

In this case the insurer acted with the utmost good faith – more than the insured was entitled to receive – by providing a defense and settling the case against the insured while reserving its right to recover from the insured. Since the agent was also an owner of the insured its negligence in not providing accurate information to the insurer was sufficient to allow the insurer to rescind and recover the money it paid for the defense of the insured and for the settlement with those suing the insured.

It would appear that the agent, Elite, will be sued by the dealer who is now faced with a judgment of more than $1 million and will probably seek indemnity from Elite for its negligence even though the jury found Elite was not liable to Auto Owners for failing to list the unlicensed driver it may be found liable to the insured for breach of its duty of care.

 Coverage Denied 
 Posted on September 13, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 All Losses Are Not Covered 

 

Contrary to the arguments of creative lawyers for policyholders who expect insurers to pay for every problem that an insured faces, all losses are not covered. Insurance policies are limited and only provide coverage for the risks of loss they accept. When a policy requires that property damage occur during the policy period it matters not that the negligent act occurred during the policy period. Also, if the actual property damage occurs before a policy comes into effect the insurer cannot be responsible to indemnify the insured and even if the loss occurred during the policy period the “your work” exclusion applied because “intended use” means the entire building put to its intended use, not just a component Part. In The Selmer Company v. Selective Insurance Company of South Carolina , No. 2010AP1835 (Wis.App. 09/08/2011) the Wisconsin Court of Appeal sustained summary judgment for two insurance companies because the putative insured was unable to prove that insurance coverage applied to the loss.

The Selmer Company contended that there genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the insurance policies provided coverage and the case should come to trial. The insurance companies argued that their policies excluded coverage on the undisputed facts of this case.

 BACKGROUND 

Selmer entered into a contract with the United States Army Corps of Engineers for Selmer to construct a United States Army Reserve Center in Wausau, Wisconsin. Selmer entered into a subcontract with Premier Roofing, Inc., for Premier to do the roofing work on the project. Premier installed the roof in November and December 2006. In June 2007, Selmer’s project manager discovered that nail heads were sticking through the shingles on the roof.

Selmer had an insurance policy with Charter Oak. Premier had an insurance policy with Selective from March 31, 2006 to March 31, 2007, which named Selmer as an additional insured. Selmer brought this action for coverage under both policies for the costs of replacing the damaged roof.

Selective moved for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts established that the damage to the roof occurred in June 2007, outside of the coverage period under the policy it issued to Premier. Charter Oak also moved for summary judgment, arguing that an exclusion in its policy precludes coverage for Selmer’s claim. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the insurance companies. Selmer appealed.

 DISCUSSION 

 Selective Insurance Company 

 Selmer contends that summary judgment was improperly granted to Selective because there is evidence in the record that the roof was constructed during the policy period. Selmer contends that Wisconsin follows the“negligent act”rule, which requires insurance coverage when the negligent act causing the damage occurred during the policy period. It asserted that, under the negligent act rule, the fact that the roof was constructed during the policy period brings the damage to the roof within Selective’s coverage.

Wisconsin courts adopted the “negligent act” rule of insurance coverage. Wisconsin courts generally find that the negligent act (such as the negligent design and construction of the roof), as opposed to the resulting damage (the collapse of the roof), triggers coverage under the insurance policy. When an insurance policy uses the term“occurrence,”coverage is triggered by the negligent or wrongful act, not the resulting injury, unless the policy specifically states that the resulting injury must occur during the policy period.

Here, Selective asserts that its insurance policy contains specific language requiring that the property damage occur within the policy period to trigger coverage. Selective’s policy provides:

“This insurance applies to…‘property damage’only if: (1) The…‘property damage’is caused by an‘occurrence’…; [and] (2) The…‘property damage’occurs during the policy period.”

The Court of Appeal agreed with Selective that, by its plain language, Selective’s policy requires that the property damage occur during the policy period to trigger coverage. Unlike the insurance policies in cases cited by Selmer, which required that an occurrence or an accident happen within the policy period, but did not require that the resulting damage arose within the policy period, Selective’s policy expressly requires the property damage occur within the policy period. Because it is undisputed that the damage to the roof occurred in June 2007, outside the Selective policy period as we have discussed above, there are no material facts in dispute as to whether Selmer is entitled to coverage under the policy.

 Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company 

 Selmer contends that the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment to Charter Oak because there is a disputed issue of fact as to whether Charter Oak’s policy provides coverage for the damaged roof. Selmer concedes that the Charter Oak policy has an exclusion for“your work”that was incorrectly performed, which applies to the improperly constructed roof. Selmer contends, however, that there is evidence to support a jury finding that the roofing project falls within an exception to the exclusion.

The Charter Oak policy provides that the“your work”exclusion does not apply to property damage included in the products-completed operations hazard (PCOH). The PCOH includes property damages arising out of“your work”that occurs away from premises the insured owns or rents, but does not include work that has not yet been completed. It provides that work will be deemed completed under various scenarios, including“[w]hen that part of the work done at a job site has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the same project.”If the work is not completed under this definition, the PCOH exception to the“your work”exclusion does not apply. Selmer conceded that the Army Reserve Center, as a whole, had not been put to its intended use by anyone other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the building when the roof damage occurred yet still claimed the building had been put to its intended use – keeping the building protected from rain.

Selmer failed to point to court to any evidence in the record to support its argument that the Army Corps put the roof to any intended purpose once the roof work was finished. Instead, Selmer contends that the roof, by its very nature, protects the interior of a building, and that the Army Corps, as the owner of the building, had an interest in protecting the interior. However, by definition, any part of a structure that is completed is being put to its intended use as a component of the building, and the owner of the building will have an interest in that component being in place. 

Following Selmer’s reasoning, the Charter Oak policy would apply any time a component of a construction project was completed and then failed. This would effectively nullify the distinction between work that has or has not been completed, because any discrete part of a project, once installed, would be deemed completed. Although the argument was creative it was not convincing and the Court of Appeal affirmed the summary judgment in favor of both insurers.

 LESSON 

 Litigation against insurers often arises because insurers spend more time working to sell a policy of insurance with cute and humorous advertising than they spend in preparing a clear and unambiguous policy wording. Lawyers for policyholders are intelligent and creative professionals who can twist the language of a policy of insurance to create an issue of fact that requires trial. As creative as the lawyers were in Wisconsin they were unable to convince the court that there was a potential for coverage because the policies were fairly well written and the facts could not be changed to provide coverage.

A prudent insurer who insures subcontractors, contractors, and others in the construction trade should review their policies to avoid the “negligent act rule” by making sure that their policies use defining language like that used by Selective. Every policy should provide:“This insurance applies to ‘property damage’ only if: (1) The ‘property damage’ is caused by an ‘occurrence’; [and] (2) The ‘property damage’ occurs during the policy period.”Similarly, to avoid the argument made against Charter Oak it would be simple to add to the “intended use” language by making the language read “intended use by the owner, tenant or occupier for the use for which the work as a whole was designed whether the work consists of the entire project or only a component part.”

The words of an insurance policy are important. Definitions give precision to imprecise language. Insurers who wish to avoid litigation about coverage should spend more time on the wording of the policy than on the effort to sell it to a customer.

 From the Supreme Court of Canada 
 Posted on September 12, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Estoppel Denied in Canada 

 On September 8, 2011 an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Number C51114, 2010 ONCA 868, dated December 10, 2010, was dismissed with costs.

Mr. Lamadeleine, the insured, operated a business, R. Conrad Lamadeleine Courtiers/Brokers Inc., that sold investments in insurance companies.

In 2001, some of his clients, including several of the applicants, brought an action against him and the company following an investment in an insurance company that went bankrupt.  Mr. Lamadeleine subsequently declared bankruptcy, and the action against him was stayed.

Mr. Lamadeleine had malpractice insurance with Lloyd’s.  Shortly after giving evidence on an examination for discovery, Mr. Lamadeleine received a letter from the insurer refusing to insure him based on new facts that had arisen on discovery.  Those facts seemed to indicate that he had overstepped his professional mandate by selling shares without being licensed to do so.

The insurance policy covered only professional services relating to personal insurance for which Mr. Lamadeleine held the appropriate licences.  A motion by counsel for the insurer for removal as the lawyers of record allowed a default judgment rendered against the company, which had no counsel to represent it.  Mr. Lamadeleine’s right of action was subsequently assigned to the clients who had filed an application seeking indemnification from the insurer.

The clients argued that the principle of promissory estoppel prevented the insurer from denying coverage.  The Superior Court dismissed the application and the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The Supreme Court agreed.

 Lessons 

Insurance is a contract in Canada and in the US. When an insured breaches the contract, as did Mr. Lamadeleine, by selling products for which he was not licensed will have no coverage for the errors or omissions for the business he conducted he was not licensed. Estoppel is an equitable remedy and the Supreme Court of Canada understood that one who does not act fairly is not able to obtain insurance coverage by the force of equity applying the maxim that no one may profit from his own wrong.

 No Inequitable Apportionment of Loss 
 Posted on September 9, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Is Employer Liable Twice for Acts of Employee? 

 THE ISSUES 



A person injured by someone driving a car in the course of employment may sue not only the driver but that driver’s employer. The employer can be sued on two legal theories based on tort principles: respondeat superior and negligent entrustment. Respondeat superior, a form of vicarious liability, makes an employer liable, even without fault, for negligent driving by its employee in the scope of employment. The charge of negligent entrustment makes an employer liable for its own negligence in choosing an employee to drive a vehicle.

 In Dawn Renae Diaz v. Jose Carcamo et al, No. S181627 (Cal. 06/23/2011) the California Supreme Court made it impossible for a plaintiff to force an employer of a negligent employee to have liability assessed against it twice: once for the negligence of the employee and again for its negligence in hiring the employee.

When a plaintiff asserts both theories, and the employer admits vicarious liability for any negligent driving by its employee, the California Supreme Court was called on to decide if the plaintiff can still pursue the negligent entrustment claim. The Court of Appeal did not follow the Supreme Court’s decision in Armenta v. Churchill (1954) 42 Cal.2d 448 (Armenta) and concluded Armenta was inconsistent with this state’s current system of allocating liability for tort damages based on comparative fault – a system created by decisions of the Supreme Court in the 1970′s and by the California electorate’s later adoption of the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986 (Proposition 51).





 FACTS 

Plaintiff Dawn Renae Diaz was driving south on U.S. Highway 101 near Camarillo, Ventura County. Defendant Jose Carcamo, a truck driver for defendant Sugar Transport of the Northwest, LLC, was driving north in the center of three lanes. Defendant Karen Tagliaferri, driving in the center lane behind Carcamo, moved to the left lane to pass him. As Tagliaferri, without signaling, pulled back into the center lane, her vehicle hit Carcamo’s truck, spun, flew over the divider, and hit plaintiff’s SUV. Plaintiff sustained severe, permanent injuries.

Plaintiff sued Tagliaferri, Carcamo, and Sugar Transport. She alleged that Carcamo and Tagliaferri had driven negligently and that Sugar Transport was both vicariously liable for employee Carcamo’s negligent driving and directly liable for its own negligence in hiring and retaining him. In their answer, Carcamo and Sugar Transport denied any negligence.

Defendant-employer Sugar Transport offered to admit vicarious liability if its employee Carcamo was found negligent. That admission, Sugar Transport argued, would bar plaintiff from further pursuing her claims for negligent entrustment, hiring, and retention.

Over defendant-employer Sugar Transport’s objection, the trial court admitted evidence of Carcamo’s driving and employment history, as offered by plaintiff in support of her negligent hiring claim. Other evidence showed that Carcamo was in this country illegally and had used a“phony”Social Security number to obtain employment, that he had been fired from or quit without good reason three of his last four driving jobs, that he had lied in his application to work for Sugar Transport, and that, when Sugar Transport had sought information from Carcamo’s prior employers, the lone response gave him a very negative evaluation. 



 THE TRIAL COURT JUDGMENT 

The jury found that defendants Tagliaferri and Carcamo had driven negligently, that defendant Sugar Transport had been negligent in hiring and retaining Carcamo as a driver, and that the retention was a cause of plaintiff’s injuries. The jury allocated fault for the accident among all three defendants: 45 percent to Tagliaferri, 35 percent to Sugar Transport, and 20 percent to Carcamo. It awarded plaintiff over $17.5 million in economic damages and $5 million in non-economic damages. The trial court entered a judgment in the form required by the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986, enacting Civil Code sections § 1431.1-1431.5 and amending section 1431 (Proposition 51). Under the judgment, Tagliaferri and Sugar Transport were each jointly liable for all of plaintiff’s economic damages but only severally liable for part of her non-economic damages—Tagliaferri for 45 percent and Sugar Transport for 55 percent (its 35 percent plus its employee Carcamo’s 20 percent).
The Court of Appeal affirmed.

 ANALYSIS 

The respondeat superior doctrine makes an employer liable, irrespective of fault, for an employee’s tortious conduct in the scope of employment. Once an employer admitted vicarious liability for an employee’s tortious conduct within the scope of employment, it did not matter, for purposes of a plaintiff’s recovery, whether a trial court submitted to the jury a negligent entrustment claim against the employer along with the negligence claim against the employee. The employer would pay all of a judgment.

In 1975, the Supreme Court replaced the old all-or-nothing system of tort liability with a comparative fault system“under which liability for damage will be borne by those whose negligence caused it in direct proportion to their respective fault.”Under comparative fault principles, a plaintiff’s negligence no longer bars recovery, but reduces the damages awarded in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the plaintiff. Three years later, to ensure a similarly fair apportionment of damages among tortfeasors, the Supreme Court also eliminated the all-or-nothing character of the common law doctrine of equitable indemnity.

If, as in this case, all of a plaintiff’s causes of action depend on a contention that an employee’s negligent driving in the scope of employment was a cause of the plaintiff’s injuries, and if the defendant-employer offers to admit vicarious liability for its employee’s negligent driving, then that offer will remove from the case the issue of the employer’s liability for any damage caused by its employee’s negligent driving. The Supreme Court concluded that it makes no difference that the employer, Sugar Transport, offered to admit vicarious liability at trial instead of before.

The Supreme Court disagreed with the Plaintiff and the Court of Appeal and concluded that when an employer offers to admit vicarious liability for its employee’s negligent driving, then claims against the employer based on theories of negligent entrustment, hiring, or retention are superfluous. To allow such claims in that situation would subject the employer to a share of fault in addition to the share of fault assigned to the employee, for which the employer has already accepted liability.

 Therefore, assigning to the employer a share of fault greater than that assigned to the employee whose negligent driving was a cause of the accident is an inequitable apportionment of loss. The Supreme Court’s conclusion was supported by certain decisions of other state courts that have adopted or retained the majority rule that a defendant-employer’s admission of vicarious liability bars claims for negligent entrustment, hiring, or retention.

The California Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in Armenta that an employer’s admission of vicarious liability for an employee’s negligent driving in the course of employment bars a plaintiff from pursuing a claim for negligent entrustment.

Had the trial court excluded the prejudicial evidence and arguments presented by plaintiff’s counsel, and instructed the jury to divide fault between Carcamo and Tagliaferri alone—rather than including Carcamo’s employer, Sugar Transport, among the tortfeasors to whom it could allocate fault—the jury would have assigned to Carcamo alone less than the 55 percent share of fault that it assigned to both him and Sugar Transport together. Although Sugar Transport would still have been responsible for the share of fault assigned to Carcamo, the result would have been more favorable to Sugar Transport, because Sugar Transport would have had no additional, independent liability.

 LESSON: 

This decision is important to all employers and defendants who are faced with a suit for damages as a result of the negligent conduct of an employee. Although an employer is liable, without fault, for the acts of its negligent employee in the course and scope of employment it is often charged with its own negligence for hiring the negligent employee. The Supreme Court provided protection to the employer. If it accepts liability equal to that of the negligent employee the charge against the employer for negligent hiring goes away.

When an employee negligently causes injury to a third person in the course and scope of its employment and there is even a small amount of evidence that the hiring was negligent, it would be prudent for the employer to admit liability under respondeat superior to avoid becoming the victim of an unconscionable apportionment. Defense counsel should explain to each employer defendant, and its insurer, of the wisdom of accepting liability under respondeat superior. 

The opinion makes clear that defense counsel can attack the dual theories of negligent entrustment and vicarious liability by limiting a plaintiff’s claims to respondeat superior, there is a strong likelihood that damaging evidence can be excluded and that a more favorable verdict form can be submitted to the jury.

 Claims Made Policies 
 Posted on September 8, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Report Potential Claims Immediately 

 A claims made policy requires that for coverage to apply a claim must be made within the stated period of coverage. If the claim is first made before the inception of a policy the policy owes no duty to defend or indemnify the insured. Problems arise when a claim is made before the policy inception but is amended to allege new claims at a date within the policy period. In Feldman v. Illinois Union Insurance , H035316, http://www.metnews.com/sos.cgi?0911%2FG041507 Filed 9/6/11, the California Court of Appeal was called upon to determine whether an amended claim was new and distinct or a modification of the original claim.

David Feldman lost his claim for defense and indemnity at summary judgment entered in favor of Illinois Union Insurance Company, which had declined to defend or indemnify Feldman or his company, ZF Micro Solutions, against a cross-action by a third party. Feldman contended that the superior court erroneously found no potential for coverage under the liability policy issued to him and ZF Micro Solutions and therefore no duty to defend or indemnify him and other insureds. The Court of Appeal agreed with the superior court that the claims made by the third party during the policy period were excluded from coverage and affirmed the judgment.

 Background 

David Feldman is the president and chief executive officer of ZF Micro Solutions, Inc. (“ZF Solutions”). ZF Solutions is the successor company to ZF Micro Devices, Inc. (“ZF Devices”), replacing the latter as of March 1, 2002. ZF Solutions designs, markets, and sells semiconductor devices“into the embedded microprocessor market.”

 The Underlying Litigation 

On April 25, 2002 ZF Solutions sued National Semiconductor Corporation (NSC) for failing to produce devices for ZF Solutions in accordance with the parties’contract. On May 28, 2002, NSC filed a cross-complaint against both ZF Devices and ZF Solutions (as successor) for failure to pay for custom integrated circuits (chips) it had produced and sent to ZF Devices in accordance with the same contract.

NSC filed a first amended cross-complaint one year later, on April 25, 2003. In this pleading NSC added Feldman and two others as cross-defendants and asserted new causes of action against the cross-defendants, including breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer of assets from ZF Devices to ZF Solutions. In June 2004 the litigation between ZF Solutions and NSC culminated in a jury verdict finding both ZF Solutions and NSC liable to each other.

 The Insurance Litigation 

 From November 23, 2001 to July 1, 2002 ZF Solutions was insured by a liability policy issued by“certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London”(Underwriters). That policy covered directors and officers as well as the corporation. Respondent Illinois Union Insurance Company (Illinois Union) covered ZF Solutions and its directors and officers from July 1, 2002 to July 1, 2003.

On about March 28, 2003, Feldman tendered the defense of NSC’s amended cross complaint to Illinois Union through the insurance broker. Illinois Union denied coverage, asserting that NSC’s claim had originally been made on May 28, 2002, before the inception date of the Illinois Union policy. Illinois Union also asserted exclusions for claims involving a contract and claims involving fraudulent acts by any of the insureds. In a written request for reconsideration, the insurance broker pointed out that the claim that was tendered was not for breach of contract but only for breach of fiduciary duty and related allegations against new defendants, including Feldman. Illinois Union, however, adhered to its denial of defense and indemnity based on lack of coverage. This time the company invoked a policy provision that deemed“Interrelated Wrongful Acts”to constitute a single claim and which required such a claim to be made during the policy period. Under this provision, Illinois Union explained, NSC’s claim was made before the inception date of the policy.

The trial court determined that the policy definition of“Interrelated Wrongful Acts”encompassed both NSC’s original cross-complaint and its subsequent pleading, the first amended cross complaint.

 Discussion 

The Illinois Union policy was a“claims made policy”covering ZF Solutions and its directors and officers. Under the“Directors&amp;Officers”clause, Illinois Union agreed to pay“Loss resulting from any Claim first made against the Directors and Officers during the Policy Period for a Wrongful Act.”The term“Wrongful Act”was defined as“any actual or alleged error, omission, misleading statement, neglect, breach of duty or act”by any director or officer acting in that capacity.

The Court of Appeal was asked to determine whether the“Interrelated Wrongful Acts”provision of the policy applied to the facts to deprive Feldman of coverage.  That term was defined in the policy as“more than one Wrongful Act which have as a common nexus any fact, circumstance, situation, event or transaction or series of facts, circumstances, situations, events or transactions.”

 Examination of NSC’s Claims 

 NSC’s original cross-complaint stated the following facts. NSC twice agreed to an extension of the payment deadline for the products it had delivered to ZF Devices, because“ZF Devices was unable to pay the debt.”NSC further alleged that the assignment of its contract and the transfer of assets from ZF Devices to ZF Solutions was made“for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for ZF Devices’debts, particularly the debt to [NSC] under the Agreement.”Notwithstanding its allegations of fraudulent transfer, NSC’s cross-complaint contained only two causes of action: breach of contract against both ZF Devices and ZF Solutions, and“Successor Liability”against ZF Solutions. The amended cross complaint, however, expanded NSC’s theories of recovery and added Feldman, Kennedy, and the Kennedy Trust as defendants. Again NSC asserted that the“fraudulent transfer”of ZF Devices assets to Feldman and ZF Solutions, via the purported foreclosure and assignment to the Kennedy Trust, was made to“hinder, delay or defraud”creditors, including NSC.

The court found it apparent from a comparison of the cross-complaint and amended cross complaint that the later pleading included many new details of the events contributing to the alleged liability of Feldman, the Kennedy Trust, and Kennedy, as well as the ZF entities. But these details all pertained to the alleged fraudulent assignment and transfer of ZF Devices assets to ZF Solutions, made with the intent (and effect) of avoiding the former company’s $833,715.92 obligation to NSC. Thus, while NSC expanded its theories of recovery, three of the four new causes of action asserted against Feldman fraudulent conveyance and conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, and unfair business competition had“as a common nexus any fact, circumstance, situation, event or transaction or series of facts, circumstances, situations, events or transactions”in relation to the original cross-complaint. These claims were therefore properly deemed to constitute a single claim, which was originally made in April 2002, before the inception of the Illinois Union policy. 

The Court of Appeal agreed with the superior court that none of the claims NSC asserted in its amended cross-complaint was potentially covered under the Illinois Union policy. Consequently, Illinois Union had no duty of defense or indemnity toward Feldman. In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to determine the applicability of the policy’s insolvency exclusion.

 Lesson 

If possible and if available always buy an “occurrence” policy to avoid some of the problems raised by the claims made policy.

If an “occurrence” policy is not available (and they are not for many risks) the insured and its risk manager must be careful to read and understand the policy wording and its requirements. If a claim is made or if the insured is aware of a potential claim that might be made in the future, it must be ready to advise all insurers of claims made or potential claims as soon as the insured learn of them. Failure to do so can place the insured into a the same position of Mr. Feldman who was unable to obtain either defense or indemnity from his insurer.

Insurance is a contract and both parties to the contract must fulfill its terms and conditions. Regardless of the creativity of the lawyer for the claimant coverage cannot be made by argument but must be based on reality.

 Good Faith Settlement Destroys Insurer’s Indemnity Rights 
 Posted on September 7, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Equitable Indemnity Claims 

 When a person or entity sued for tort damages believes that another is more responsible it will file a cross-complaint seeking equitable indemnity. In California a statute, designed to promote settlement of litigation, destroys all claims of equitable indemnity if the trial court finds that the settlement was made in good faith. The statute, however, has no effect on a contractual right of Indemnity. In Pacificare of California et al v. Bright Medical Associates, Inc, No. G041507, http://www.metnews.com/sos.cgi?0911%2FH035316 (Cal.App. Dist.4 09/02/2011) the California Court of Appeal caused PacifiCare to lose its right to indemnity because it did not obtain a contractual right of indemnity from its vendor, Bright Medical Associates, Inc. (Bright).

 Factual Background 

Plaintiffs Jerry Jay Martin, Jerry Lloyd Martin, Tressa Brown, and Lisa Vindell (collectively the Martins) filed the underlying action against defendants and cross-complainants PacifiCare of California doing business as Secure Horizons and PacifiCare Health Systems, LLC (collectively PacifiCare). The Martins asserted claims for insurance bad faith based on delays their wife and mother, Elsie Martin (Elsie), experienced while seeking out-of-network treatment for a cerebral aneurysm. The aneurysm ruptured and Elsie died before receiving the necessary care. 

Elsie’s primary care physician belonged to cross-defendant Bright Medical Associates, Inc. (Bright), the health care provider who contracted with PacifiCare to deliver medical services to PacifiCare subscribers. Although Bright made all the decisions that delayed Elsie’s medical care, the Martins did not file a claim against Bright. Instead, PacifiCare joined Bright in this action by filing a cross-complaint seeking indemnity. During jury selection, Bright settled with the Martins for $300,000, conditioned on the trial court finding Bright and the Martins settled in good faith. PacifiCare appeals from the trial court order granting Bright’s good faith settlement motion and dismissing PacifiCare’s cross-complaint against Bright.

The Martins alleged PacifiCare’s conduct in designing and implementing its health care service plan contributed to the delays in Elsie’s medical care. Because a good faith settlement may be sought in any action in which two or more parties are“alleged”to be“joint tortfeasors”(Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(a)(1)), the Court of Appeal concluded the trial court had authority to grant Bright’s good faith settlement motion.

 Elsie enrolled in PacifiCare’s Secure Horizons plan and selected a Bright physician for her primary care. In August 2003, Bright diagnosed Elsie with a large cerebral aneurysm. Due to the aneurysm’s size, Bright lacked the expertise to treat it within its medical provider network and therefore referred Elsie for out-of-network treatment at the University of Southern California Medical Center (USC).

Although Elsie consulted with a neurosurgeon at USC in September 2003, Bright did not approve the neurosurgeon’s recommended treatment until mid-December 2003, despite multiple requests. Bright approved the procedure only after requiring Elsie to undergo what the USC neurosurgeon characterized as an unnecessary angiogram. After receiving the approval, USC scheduled the treatment for early February 2004. Tragically, Elsie’s aneurysm burst in January 2004 and she died after the doctors removed her from life support.

At no time did Elsie or anyone acting on her behalf contact PacifiCare to discuss Elsie’s medical care or challenge Bright’s utilization review decisions.

 The Trial and Good Faith Settlement 

Trial proceeded on the Martins’claims against PacifiCare after Bright settled. After the Martins completed their case-in-chief, the trial court granted PacifiCare’s non-suit motion, finding the Martins’evidence supported recovery only on a theory of vicarious liability, but Health and Safety Code section 1371.25 (section 1371.25) barred recovery. 

PacifiCare challenged the trial court’s good faith settlement determination on two main grounds. First, PacifiCare argues the trial court lacked authority to make a good faith settlement determination because PacifiCare and Bright did not share joint liability for the Martins’damages. Second, PacifiCare argued the trial court abused its discretion in finding Bright and the Martins settled in good faith because the trial court failed to consider Bright’s indemnity liability to PacifiCare for the attorney fees PacifiCare incurred in defending the Martins’claims.

A determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. A good faith finding also reduces the claims against the non-settling tortfeasors in the amount stipulated by the settlement.

 Joint Tortfeasor 

 To be a joint tortfeasor, a party need not be found liable in tort. Any joint tortfeasor who settles with a plaintiff is entitled to have the trial court determine if the settlement is in good faith regardless of whether the tortfeasors acted in concert to create a single injury, or successively to create distinct and divisible injuries.

In seeking a good faith settlement determination, Bright pointed out the Martins’direct liability theories against PacifiCare. At oral argument on the motion, the Martins acknowledged that a non-delegable duty served as their primary liability theory, but also emphasized that,“separate and apart from that, there is direct liability as well.”

Assuming the Martins clearly“alleged”PacifiCare and Bright acted as“joint tortfeasors,”PacifiCare nonetheless contends the good faith settlement statute does not apply because the statute renders any liability by PacifiCare and Bright several only. PacifiCare would be liable to the Martins only it if directly committed some act or omission contributing to the delays in Elsie’s health care. In reaching this result, the Court of Appeal did not address whether PacifiCare and Bright could be jointly liable if they both committed acts or omissions contributing to the delays in Elsie’s health care.

In American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578 (American Motorcycle), the Supreme Court explained the nature of joint liability and its relation to vicarious liability:“Under well-established common law principles, a negligent tortfeasor is generally liable for all damage of which his negligence is a proximate cause; stated another way, in order to recover damages sustained as a result of an indivisible injury, a plaintiff is not required to prove that a tortfeasor’s conduct was the sole proximate cause of the injury, but only that such negligence was a proximate cause.”  In cases involving multiple tortfeasors, the principle that each tortfeasor is personally liable for any indivisible injury of which his negligence is a proximate cause has commonly been expressed in terms of joint and several liability. Liability attaches to a concurrent tortfeasor not because he is responsible for the acts of other independent tortfeasors who may also have caused the injury, but because he is responsible for all damage of which his own negligence was a proximate cause.

Liability arises from PacifiCare and Bright’s own acts or omissions and makes both potentially responsible for the full amount of the Martins’damages.

Contrary to PacifiCare’s contention, the trial court did not lack authority to determine whether the Martins and Bright settled in good faith. Because the Martins alleged both PacifiCare and Bright contributed to the delays in Elsie’s health care, PacifiCare and Bright are treated as joint tortfeasors under the good faith settlement statutes.

 Proof of Good Faith Settlement 

A settlement does not lack good faith solely because the settling tortfeasor pays less than his or her theoretical proportional or fair share. Discounting a settling tortfeasor’s proportional share is appropriate because a plaintiff’s damages are often speculative, and the probability of legal liability therefor is often uncertain or remote.

In the end, the ultimate determinant of good faith is whether the settlement is grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person at the time of settlement would estimate the settler’s liability to be. A good faith settlement does not call for perfect or even nearly perfect apportionment of liability. In order to encourage settlement, it is quite proper for a settling defendant to pay less than his proportionate share of the anticipated damages. What is required is simply that the settlement not be grossly disproportionate to the settlor’s fair share. The party challenging a settlement’s good faith bears the burden to show the settlement is so far out of the realm of a reasonable settlement and is inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the good faith settlement statute.

According to PacifiCare, the trial court abused its discretion in granting Bright’s good faith settlement motion because the trial court failed to consider Bright’s indemnity liability for PacifiCare’s attorney fees. When evaluating whether the parties reached a settlement in good faith, a trial court must examine not only the settling tortfeasor’s potential liability to the plaintiff, but also the settling tortfeasor’s potential liability to all non-settling tortfeasors.

 If PacifiCare shared joint liability because its own acts or omissions contributed to the delays in Elsie’s health care, as the Martins alleged, PacifiCare’s attorney fees claim still would fail. The authority PacifiCare relies on for its right to recover attorney fees—the tort of another doctrine and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.6—apply only when the party seeking the fees bears no fault. The Court of Appeal concluded that PacifiCare failed to establish a viable attorney fees claim against Bright. Without a viable theory for its attorney fees claim, PacifiCare cannot show the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider that claim when determining Bright and the Martins settled in good faith. The record established no abuse of discretion and the Court of Appeal concluded the trial court properly granted Bright’s good faith settlement motion.

The order granting Bright’s good faith settlement motion and dismissing PacifiCare’s cross-complaint was affirmed. Bright’s cross-appeal from the order denying its summary judgment motion is dismissed as moot.

 LESSON 



When an insurer seeks indemnity from a third party who it believes owes it indemnity but does not have a contractual right to indemnity, must be careful to work with the third party from whom it seeks indemnity. In California, the good faith settlement statute destroys the right to indemnity.

Insurers, using third parties like PacifiCare used Bright should be sure to include in the contractual relationship a forceful and enforceable indemnity agreement

and a requirement that the vendor make the insurer an additional insured on its third party liability insurance and its medical malpractice policy.

Limiting an insurer’s rights to equitable indemnity when it has the power to include indemnity language in the contract with the vendor can be very expensive and cost Pacificare over $1.5 million in legal fees it might not have had to pay.

 No Right to Interest on Deposit Premium 
 Posted on September 6, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 No Right to Interest 

 Right to Interest Must Be In Contract 

 In an opinion not officially published the California Court of Appeal decided that an insured is not entitled to interest on a deposit premium paid to the California State Fund (a workers’compensation insurer created by statute) because the insurer had no interest in the deposit sufficient to compel payment of interest. In William Francis Flahavan v. State Compensation Insurance Fund , No. A128280 (Cal.App. Dist.1 09/01/2011) the court analyzed multiple issues relating to interest and ruled in favor of the Fund.

William Francis Flahavan filed an action on behalf of himself, individually, and on behalf of all persons similarly situated against the State Compensation Insurance Fund (the State Fund). Flahavan challenged the State Fund’s practice of not paying interest on a“deposit premium”that it charges when a party obtains a policy for workers’compensation insurance from it. After the policy ends, if some deposit premium remains on the account, the State Fund refunds the excess but retains the interest earned on the revenue. 

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State Fund. It determined that the State Fund had no obligation to pay policyholders interest. Flahavan appeals from the judgment and claims that the language of the policy and the common law rule that interest follows principal created an obligation to pay interest on the“deposit premium.”

 Background 

The State Fund, a state agency and public enterprise fund created by the California Constitution and the Legislature, provides workers’compensation insurance to California employers. The State Fund was created to guarantee that California employers would have a source for workers’compensation insurance. The State Fund cannot refuse to insure any workers’compensation risk, except under narrow circumstances.

 The State Fund receives no money from the state, and is required to support itself. Any surplus in excess of required reserves is returned to policyholders. If there is“an excess of assets over liabilities, necessary reserves, and a reasonable surplus for the catastrophe hazard, then a cash dividend may be declared to, or a credit allowed on the renewal premium of, each employer who has been insured with the [State Fund].”(Ins. Code, § 11776.)

When a policyholder obtains workers’compensation insurance, the State Fund requires the policyholder to pay as“deposit premium”a percentage of the estimated annual premium for the policy year. The estimated annual premium is generally determined by the State Fund using expected payroll and job classification information provided by the policyholder. These estimates, along with other information, are used to arrive at an“interim rate.”The interim rate is the estimated rate for each class code, and includes a premium discount modifier that is based upon the amount of premium. The premium discount modifier is estimated when a policyholder begins a policy year, and then is adjusted at the end of the policy year, when the actual premium is known.

The percentage of the estimated annual premium that must be paid as“deposit premium”to obtain insurance depends upon the frequency of payment. Thus, if the policyholder is to pay premium on a monthly basis, the policyholder pays 10 percent of the estimated annual premium to incept coverage. If the policyholder is to pay premium on an annual basis, then the policyholder pays 100 percent of the estimated annual premium to commence coverage.

At the end of every policy year, the State Fund audits certain accounts and determines whether this policyholder reported accurate payroll information and paid the correct amount of premium. Subsequently, the audit is assigned to an audit analyst who prepares a final bill. After the audit is completed, the audit analyst determines the actual rates to be used. There is nothing in this record to suggest that any audit was performed as to the policy at issue on this appeal.

 Trial Court Decision 

The trial court concluded as follows:“There is no triable issue as to whether there is an obligation for the State Fund to pay interest on any or all of a deposit premium from the date of the payment of the deposit premiums. The language of the policy contract does not create an obligation to pay interest to the policyholders from the date the State Fund receives the deposit premium. [¶] . . . Flahavan has not shown that any California law requires the State Fund to pay interest to its insureds on the deposit premiums from the date the insureds pay the deposit premiums.”

The trial court elaborated:“Where, as here, there is a contract that governs the parties’rights and obligations and that contract is silent regarding the payment of interest, absent a statute requiring the payment of interest, there is no duty to pay interest at least until all of the contract terms have been fully executed.”(Underline omitted.) The court determined that“[t]he common law rule of‘interest follows principal’does not apply to [the] State Fund’s failure to pay interest on all or any portion of the deposit refund on or before its review of a final payroll report.”(Underline omitted.) The court found that the State Fund did not owe a duty to pay interest under express or constructive trust theories. It concluded that the State Fund did not violate the UCL.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the State Fund on February 22, 2010. Flahavan filed a timely notice of appeal.

 Appellate Analysis 

 The Workers’Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau (WCIRB), pursuant to Insurance Code section 11658, approved the policy at issue. The WCIRB and the California Department of Insurance regulations require the contract to state that it, with its endorsements and declarations, constitutes the“entire contract of insurance,”and that no condition, provision, agreement or understanding not set forth that affects the rights, duties, or privileges, arising under the policy. The policy was an integrated contract and the parol evidence rule, as codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1856, subdivision (a), applies. This statute provides:“Terms set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement.”

The Court of Appeal concluded that the language in the policy does not indicate that the policyholder retains a property interest in the“deposit premium,”and the policy is silent on the subject of interest on the“deposit premium.”

In asserting that the policyholders have a property interest in the“deposit premium,”Flahavan also relied on multiple state and federal appellate decisions.  After analyzing Flahavan’s authorities the Court of Appeals concluded that the policyholders voluntarily paid money for insurance and voluntarily renewed the insurance by agreeing that the first year’s“deposit premium”would be applied to the second year’s insurance. Moreover the policy does not mention interest on the“deposit premium.” 

In this decision, the Court of Appeal concluded that it need not consider whether a contract must always state that the depositor earns the interest for the depositor to earn interest pursuant to the contract. The policyholder was unable to establish a property interest in the deposit; the policyholder voluntarily provided the funds to the State Fund; and the policyholder had no reasonable expectation that the entire deposit would be returned to the policyholder. In such a context, where the contract is completely silent on the subject of interest on the“deposit premium,”the depositor is not entitled to any interest on the deposit and can derive no benefit from the maxim that interest follows principal.

 Lesson 

If an insured wants interest on so-called“deposit premiums”the insured must require the insurer to write the right to interest into the wording of the policy. If not there this decision, although it has no precedential weight and cannot be cited to other courts in California, a plaintiff like Mr. Flahavan should not waste his time and money trying to collect interest that was not promised for himself and a class of people similarly situated.

Insurance, as I and the courts of the United States, continue to say is a contract. Courts will not add terms to the contract that are not there and will not force an insurer to do something it did not promise to do when the contract was issued any more than it will require an insured to perform any promises it did not make in the contract.

 Texas Eliminates Tort of Bad Faith for Most Workers’ Compensation Claims 
 Posted on September 2, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Workers’Compensation&amp;Bad Faith 

 Workers’ compensation is a remedy created by statute to allow employees to recover, without evidence of fault, for injuries incurred on the job. When the legislative system did not provide sufficient remedies to protect workers from their employers or insurers who refused to pay benefits under the system the Texas Court created a common law cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In Texas Mutual Insurance Company v. Timothy J. Ruttiger , No. 08-0751, Supreme Court of Texas, August 26, 2011, ruled after the injured worker was successful in trial and at the Court of Appeal, the injured worker lost the tort damages he had recovered.

Phil Johnson, Justice, wrote the opinion for the majority of the court and answered the following cases, among others:

 the interaction of the current Act with the Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and whether the 1989 restructuring of the Act and subsequent amendments obviate the need we found in Aranda v. Insurance Co. of North America , 748 S.W.2d 210 (Tex. 1988) to engraft an extra-statutory cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing onto the workers’compensation system. 

The Supreme Court concluded that claims against workers’compensation insurers for unfair settlement practices may not be made under the Insurance Code, but

 claims under the Insurance Code may be made against those insurers for misrepresenting provisions of their policies, and although in this case there was no evidence the insurer did so. 

 Background 

On June 21, 2004, Timothy Ruttiger was working for A&amp;H Electric in Galveston when he reported to his supervisor that he was injured while carrying pipe. He went to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston where he was diagnosed as having bilateral inguinal hernias. Later that day he went to A&amp;H’s office and filled out a TWCC-1 form reporting that he had been injured on the job. Ruttiger was scheduled for hernia repair surgery to be performed on July 14, 2004.

When A&amp;H’s workers’compensation carrier, Texas Mutual Insurance Company (TMIC), received written notice that Ruttiger was claiming an injury, it initiated temporary income benefit payments and began investigating. As part of the investigation process, TMIC’s adjuster, Audie Culbert, interviewed A&amp;H employees. One employee told Culbert that Ruttiger had been at a softball tournament the weekend before the alleged injury and had come to work on the morning of the incident with a limp.

On July 11, Ruttiger’s doctor notified him that TMIC refused to pay for the hernia surgery. Ruttiger testified that he then called Culbert who told him the claim was denied because the hernias resulted from Ruttiger’s playing softball and were not work related.

On July 12, 2004, TMIC filed a“Notice of Refused or Disputed Claim”with the Texas Workers’Compensation Commission and discontinued temporary income benefit payments after having sent one check. In its notice, TMIC stated that its investigation revealed Ruttiger sustained the hernias while he was playing softball and that it“disput[ed] this claim in its entirety.”The notice included the WCD’s telephone number and a statement that an injured worker whose claim was denied had the right to contact the Division to request a benefit review conference (BRC).

 On June 16, 2005 while his claim was still pending before the WCD and before he had reached maximum medical improvement, Ruttiger sued TMIC and Culbert (generally referred to collectively as TMIC) for violations of article 21.21 of the Insurance Code, the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Ruttiger did not claim that TMIC failed to fulfill the agreement it entered into at the BRC or that TMIC did not properly pay income and medical benefits after the BRC. He claimed that TMIC’s delay in paying temporary income benefits and agreeing to pay for surgery until January 2005 damaged his credit, worsened his hernias, and caused mental anguish, physical impairment, and pain and suffering over and above what he would have suffered if TMIC had timely accepted liability and provided benefits.

The case was tried to a jury, which found that TMIC:

 breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing; committed unfair and deceptive acts or practices that were a producing cause of damages to Ruttiger; and engaged in the unfair and deceptive acts knowingly. 

The jury found damages for past physical impairment, past and future pain and suffering, past and future loss of credit, past mental anguish,“additional”damages, and attorneys’fees. The trial court rendered judgment based on the Insurance Code findings, but also provided in its judgment that if the Insurance Code theory of liability failed on appeal, Ruttiger was entitled to recover for TMIC’s breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

 The Appeals 

TMIC made several arguments for reversing the court of appeals’judgment: 

 Ruttiger is not entitled to recover for aggravation of his hernias due to delay in surgery because a worker may only recover for a common law bad faith claim if he suffers an“independent injury”separate from his compensation injury; the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award bad faith damages for wrongful delay of benefits because Ruttiger did not exhaust his administrative remedies by obtaining a determination by the WCD that benefits were due; the Insurance Code causes of action do not apply to Ruttiger’s claims as a matter of law, and even if they do, there is no evidence to support the jury findings that TMIC violated the Code’s provisions; even if Ruttiger’s injuries were independent and the trial court had jurisdiction over his claims, this Court should join the majority of states that have considered the issue and disallow common law bad faith claims in the context of workers’compensation; the court of appeals misapplied insurance claims-handling standards for liability and no-evidence appellate review when it held that jurors may disregard conflicting evidence of coverage such as exists here where the statements made by employees of A&amp;H and medical records indicated Ruttiger’s hernias were preexisting; there is no evidence that TMIC knowingly violated the Insurance Code because there is no evidence it was actually aware it was being unfair to Ruttiger; and there is no evidence to support the award for mental anguish damages. 

 Insurance Code Claims do not Apply to Workers’Compensation 

TMIC asserted that because the Labor Code and WCD rules set specific deadlines and procedures for both paying and denying workers’compensation claims and impose administrative penalties for failing to comply with them, allowing recovery under the Insurance Code would be inconsistent with what the Legislature has deemed to be adequate protections for workers. TMIC concludes that as between section 541.060 and the Act, the Act is the exclusive remedy. Ruttiger responds that under Aetna Casualty&amp;Surety Co. v. Marshall , 724 S.W.2d 770 (Tex. 1987), an employee has a cause of action under the Insurance Code against a worke
 
WORKERSCOMP-BOAT
 
rs’compensation carrier.

The statutes provide a private action for damages against someone who has engaged in a specified act or practice. A plaintiff who prevails on such an action is entitled to actual damages and treble damages if the trier of fact finds that the defendant“knowingly”committed the act.

The purpose of the Act is: “to provide employees with certainty that their medical bills and lost wages will be covered if they are injured. An employee benefits from workers’compensation insurance because it saves the time and litigation expense inherent in proving fault in a common law tort claim. But a subscribing employer also receives a benefit because it is then entitled to assert the statutory exclusive remedy defense against the tort claims of its employees for job related injuries.”

In order to ensure compensation for injured employees while protecting employers from the costs of litigation, the Legislature provided a mechanism by which workers could recover from subscribing employers without regard to the workers’own negligence, while limiting the employers’exposure to uncertain, possibly high damage awards permitted under the common law. Recovery of workers’compensation benefits in Texas, and most other states, is the exclusive remedy of an employee covered by workers’compensation insurance coverage.
 
To accomplish these purposes, the Act provides detailed notice and administrative dispute resolution proceedings that include specific deadlines and incorporate a“conveyor-belt”approach. That is, once the administrative dispute resolution process is initiated, a dispute continues through the process until the dispute is either resolved by the parties or by a binding decision through the resolution procedures. The claims process begins when an employee reports a lost-time injury or occupational disease to the employer.  If there are disputed issues, the dispute resolution process begins when a party requests a BRC hearing or the WCD sets a BRC on its own motion. If a BRC is requested, the WCD must schedule it within forty days after receiving the request, or within twenty days if compensability or liability for essential medical treatment is in dispute.

The Supreme Court concluded that in light of the specific substantive and procedural requirements built into the Act and the detrimental effects on carriers flowing from and penalties that can be imposed for failing to comply with those requirements, the Legislature did not intend for workers’compensation claimants to have a cause of action against the carrier under the general provision of section 542.003 of the Insurance Code.

 Good Faith and Fair Dealing 

 The lack of an immediate, binding dispute resolution process under the old law resulted in carriers, for the most part, having control over claims resolution. That control yielded greatly disparate bargaining positions between insurers and injured workers, and the IAB was considered to have had relatively little power to control the process.

When compared to the old law, the Act provides a reduced amount of time for carriers to file a notice of dispute or start paying benefits. Failure to meet the time limit is an administrative violation subject to penalties of $500 to $5,000 depending on how long it takes a carrier to comply.  The carrier has statutory and regulatory duties to promptly conduct adequate investigations and reasonably evaluate and expeditiously pay workers’legitimate claims or face administrative penalties. If a carrier on multiple occasions fails to pay benefits promptly as they accrue, except as authorized by the Act, the carrier is subject to an additional administrative violation and even revocation of its right to do business under the workers’compensation statutes.

The Legislature has substantially remedied the deficiencies that led to this Court’s extending a cause of action under Arnold for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing to the workers’compensation system.

The current system:

 reduces the disparity of bargaining power between compensation insurers and employees; removes insurers’exclusive control over the processing of claims; diminishes and in most instances negates the ability of insurers to make arbitrary decisions refusing or unreasonably delaying payment of valid claims; provides employees information about, immediate recourse to, and, through the ombudsman program, free assistance before the WCD with the claims and dispute resolution process; and provides multiple remedies and penalties, including specific provision for revocation of the carrier’s right to do business under the workers’compensation laws of Texas if on multiple occasions it fails to pay benefits promptly and as they accrue. 

The original creation of, continued existence of, and amendments to update and improve the workers’compensation system are within the Legislative function of establishing public policy.

The question faced by the Texas Supreme Court was to what extent the judiciary will respect the Legislature’s function of addressing the concerns and adjusting the rights of parties in the workers’compensation system as part of its policy-making function. In reaching this conclusion it is important to keep in mind the fact that the workers’compensation system is wholly a legislatively crafted entity. It exists only because it was created by the Legislature. Its continued existence and nature depends on the Legislature renewing, revie wing, and amending it to meet the changing needs of Texas employees and employers.

This case is a classic demonstration of how a cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing can hinder the prompt resolution of disputes through proper use of the Act’s dispute resolution provisions and increase costs to participants in the system. TMIC timely notified Ruttiger that it was disputing his claim, why it was doing so, and notified him of his right to a BRC. When Ruttiger finally requested a BRC to resolve the dispute, one was scheduled and held, the dispute was resolved, and TMIC began paying benefits. The way the dispute was resolved after Ruttiger initiated the dispute resolution process is the way the Act is designed to function. The disruptive factor was Ruttiger’s waiting three months to request a BRC. Such a delay is not what is contemplated by the statutes, and the time for which Ruttiger delayed in initiating the Act’s dispute resolution procedures is the basis for his claim for damages in this suit.

The Act effectively eliminated the need for a judicially imposed cause of action outside the administrative processes and other remedies in the Act. Recognizing and respecting the Legislature’s prime position in enacting, studying, analyzing, and reforming the system, and its efforts in having done that, the Supreme Court concluded that Aranda should be overruled. In the final analysis. If the Texas Legislature determines, in its role of managing the workers’compensation system for the benefit of injured workers and employers that such a cause of action is appropriate as part of the system, the Supreme Court stated its confidence that legislators will exercise their prerogative to explicitly provide one.

 Conclusion 

The judgment of the court of appeals affirming the trial court’s judgment as to Ruttiger’s Insurance Code and DTPA claims is reversed and judgment is rendered that Ruttiger take nothing on them. The case is remanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings regarding TMIC’s contentions as to Ruttiger’s claim for breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing.

 Lessons 

When dealing with, or presenting, a workers’compensation claim in Texas it is imperative to demand a BRC once it becomes clear that the insurer will not honor benefits. It may cost the insurer  and the insured’s time but it will resolve all disputes more quickly than litigation. The tort of bad faith is now unavailable to a workers’compensation claimant unless the insurer lies to the claimant about the coverages available.

 Ignorance Can Be Cured – Stupid is Forever 
 Posted on September 2, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insureds&amp;Their Public Adjuster Nephew Punished for Adding to Damage After Legitimate Loss 
 
 It is a statement of faith and a maxim of law that no insured should be allowed to profit from insurance fraud. Unfortunately, in normal practice, many profit from insurance fraud because it is not worth the while of the insurer and police agencies to punish the fraud perpetrations.

When the fraud committed is stupid the it becomes impossible to ignore and the insured attempting insurance fraud is punished both civilly and criminally.

 STUPID ATTEMPT AT FRAUD 

In New Jersey not only did the persons insured intentionally add to their damages by beating on their building with broken pieces of a fallen tree, they added to their crime and proved their stupidity by allowing their conduct to be videotaped. 

Liberty Mutual gained possession of the tape and were able to prove that their insured inflated the claim. Liberty Mutual sued the insured and recovered a judgment for all of its investigative costs and attorneys fees. To punish the stupidity of the insured the court then trebled the damages.

This case proves that although crime often pays it does not pay when an insured is caught committing fraud in New Jersey. Not only did the insured Land fail to collect the legitimate part of their claim, they found that in New Jersey they must pay three times the damages the insurer incurred.

Liberty Mutual showed a great deal of patience and fortitude. After ten years of fighting the insurer – who had the courage of its conviction and a willingness to refuse to pay off an insurance fraud perpetrator – was honored with a judgment recovering all of its costs and a bonus by the court trebling the damages.

 In Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Land , No. A-6126-06T2 (N.J.Super.App.Div. 01/14/2010) the court of appeal in New Jersey affirmed a trial court judgment in a second trial between an insurer and its insureds after the New Jersey Supreme Court reversed when it ruled in Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Land, 892 A.2d 1240, 186 N.J. 163 (N.J. 03/14/2006) what the appropriate standard of proof was for violation of its Insurance Frauds Prevention act. The statute allows any insurance company that has been damaged as a result of a statutory violation to bring a civil action to recover compensatory damages, including reasonable investigation costs and attorneys’fees. A successful insurance company shall recover treble damages if the court determines that the defendant engaged in a pattern of violations under the Act.

At trial, Liberty Mutual established that its insured, Rose Land and Frank Land (collectively, the Lands) engaged in statutory insurance fraud. The jury’s verdict not only destroyed the Lands’entitlement to collect insurance proceeds for their putative property losses, but additionally exposed them to a judgment in favor of plaintiff Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual). The trial court ultimately determined the Lands’total monetary obligation to Liberty Mutual was $175,302.88.
 
 FACTS 
 
The litigation arose after a seemingly innocuous property loss. A neighbor’s tree toppled onto the roof of the Lands’cabin in Highland Lakes in December 2000, defendants filed a property damage claim with plaintiff, their homeowners’insurance carrier. During its investigation of the Lands’claim, plaintiff uncovered a videotape that depicted Budge [who is the Lands&apos; nephew and a public adjuster]. Budge has since been stripped of his license to be a public adjuster and – as a consequence of the events of this case – was indicted by a grand jury in February 2003 and charged with theft by deception. The videotape showed three men taking a heavy portion of the fallen tree – estimated to be 600 pounds – and slamming it against the roof, in an effort to create further damage and shatter a skylight.

Although adamantly denied by defendants, they had apparently gone onto the roof after the tree fell and attempted to increase the physical damage to the Lands’cabin. Among other things, defendants argued that it was logically impossible to increase the physical damage to the cabin because it already was a total loss. Similarly stated, defendants claim that they could not do further damage or injury to a structure that was already damaged beyond repair, and which would need to be totally replaced.

 THE PROOF OF LOSS AND EUO 
 
In furtherance of their claim of property damage, the Lands submitted a “Sworn Statement In Proof of Loss,” which was on Budge’s letterhead. Their losses were claimed to total $69,338. As an additional part of the claims process, defendants appeared for an oral examination several months later, at which they testified under oath about the circumstances of the tree-falling incident without disclosing the damage-enhancement activities.

 TRIAL VERDICT 
 
 The matter was initially tried to a jury in 2002. That trial resulted in a jury verdict in plaintiff’s favor against the Lands and Budge, finding that each defendant had violated the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA). The trial court then issued a consequential judgment awarding compensatory damages. On the ensuing appeal, this court set aside the initial judgment on three distinct grounds:

1)            the appropriate standard of proof was by a heightened “clear and convincing” evidence, not the preponderance standard that had been charged to the jury;

2)            plaintiff’s counsel made improper comments in his summation that had the capacity to unduly influence the jurors; and

3)            Budge, who represented himself, should have been permitted to testify at trial in narrative form.

The court of appeal sent the case back to the trial court for a new trial. The matter was tried anew before a second jury in November and December 2006. Budge again appeared pro se , as his own lawyer, but this time was permitted to testify in narrative form. This jury also returned a verdict in Liberty Mutual’s favor, again finding that all defendants had violated the IFPA. The jury was neither presented with direct evidence of precise losses or damages suffered by plaintiff, nor did it render a verdict as to the exact amount of plaintiff’s compensatory damages. As a result, the trial court entered an order for final judgment on April 19, 2007, in which it determined the amount of compensatory damages suffered by plaintiff, applied the trebling pursuant to the IFPA, and dismissed the Lands’counterclaim that had sought payment for their property losses in accordance with Liberty Mutual’s policy.

The order first awarded Liberty Mutual $5,157.41 in investigative costs, plus $52,576.78 in counsel fees. The court then trebled those amounts, yielding a total of $173,202.57. Thereafter, the court further specified that Lands and Budge were responsible for reimbursing Liberty Mutual for an additional $2,100.31 in expenses. The total monetary judgment, on which Lands and Budge are jointly and severally liable, amounts to $175,302.88. 

Because of the close connection between the facts that Liberty Mutual alleged as grounds for a rescission of insurance coverage and a determination of insurance fraud, it was entirely appropriate to join all of the claims into a single complaint. An insurance company’s proof of resultant damages from insurance fraud pursuant to the IFPA is not an element of the cause of action that is required to be submitted to a jury. The penalties permitted by the IFPA are not designed to remedy direct monetary damage to the insurer.

The insureds sought a “clear and convincing” evidence standard for proof of violation of the IFPA. The Supreme Court rejected the suggestion because courts have long held that when an insurance company is defending against payment of an insurance claim that it deems to be fraudulent, the company need only prove the affirmative defenses of arson and that of fraud and false swearing by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Legislature desired to require more stringent proof it could have placed the requirement in the statute. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has rejected application of the clear and convincing standard to civil anti-trust actions for treble damages. Ramsey v. United Mine Workers, 401 U.S. 302, 311, 91 S.Ct. 658, 664, 28 L.Ed. 2d 64, 71 (1971).
 
 DECISION OF SUPREME COURT 
 
 In this case, the court was convinced that the trial judge’s findings were supported by “competent, relevant or reasonably credible evidence.” Judge Dumont reviewed the wealth of evidence presented at trial, in addition to the affidavits and other submissions of the parties in determining the amount of Liberty Mutual’s statutory compensatory damages. In a written opinion, he concluded that Liberty Mutual’s statements of fees and costs should be truncated to include only those “for the work done prior to the first trial and in connection with the second trial,” and not including fees and costs attributable to the appeals. His ultimate determination of the compensatory damages as amounting to $57,734.19 is readily supportable by the credible evidence that was presented to him.

The judge further determined that the Lands engaged in a distinct pattern of violating the act by committing at least five or more related violations of the IFPA.  The trial court’s written opinion carefully explained the specific instances of the Lands’multiple statutory violations, including submission of proofs of loss that contained false or misleading information and their false testimony given during oral examination. Accordingly, the trebling effect that increased the compensatory damages to $173,202.57 was also supported by the evidence.

 LESSON 

Insurance fraud is best left to professionals. These individuals committed a blatant fraud and left evidence of their fraud in a place where the insurer could find it, are too stupid to be allowed to succeed. Intelligent and professional fraud perpetrators are successful and seldom caught in either civil court or criminal court. 

This case teaches an even more important lesson: the courts take their time dealing with fraud. This case took ten years to resolve with two trials and multiple appeals. The Court of Appeals and a dissenting justice on the Supreme Court did not want to punish the perpetrators. If the defendants were not so stupid as to videotape themselves causing additional damage to the property they would have had a successful claim. If they were right and the building was a total loss before they caused additional damage, pounding on the roof with a log, the cabin would have been rebuilt totally.

Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Gump said, and she must have had the Lands in mind when she did. But the court system that made this case spend ten years in the courts of New Jersey instead of the state prison, also fits Mrs. Gumps’conclusion. No one won this case. Both were losers.

 Pollution Exclusion Enforced 
 Posted on August 31, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Exclusion is Absolute 

 The Minnesota Court of Appeals concluded that the pollution exclusion in a CGL was sufficiently open, obvious and clear to include injuries from a carbon monoxide leak from an improperly installed boiler and carbon monoxide detector.  In Midwest Family Mutual Insurance Company v. Michael D. Wolters, et al, No. A11-181 (Minn.App. 08/22/2011) the pollution exclusion of a Commercial General Liability Policy was enforced because it was clear, open, obvious and unambiguous and because carbon monoxide fit the definition of “pollutant.”

 FACTS 

On December 28, 2007, respondents Charles Bartz and Catherine Brewster went to sleep in Bartz’s newly constructed residence. Brewster woke up at about 5:30 the next morning disoriented and nauseous. She could not wake Bartz and called 911. Both Bartz and Brewster were taken to a hospital and treated for carbon-monoxide poisoning. An investigation revealed that the boiler caused the high levels of carbon monoxide and that the carbon-monoxide detector was not connected to a power source. 

In January 2007, Bartz had hired Michael Wolters to construct the residence, which was designed to have radiant heating in the floor. Wolters subcontracted the plumbing and electrical work, and he purchased the materials for the heating system from a local supplier for the plumber to install. Wolters testified at his deposition that he told the supplier that he needed a boiler designed to use liquid-propane fuel. But he was sold a boiler that was compatible only with natural gas and was clearly marked“for natural gas only.”The plumber installed the boiler and Wolters connected it to a liquid-propane fuel line designed to connect to a propane tank. Wolters never tested the boiler because Bartz had not yet purchased the propane tank by the time Wolters’s work was completed in October 2007.

Wolters also instructed the electrician to install the carbon-monoxide detector. Wolters testified that he tested the fire and carbon-monoxide detectors before completing the job and that they were working at that time. But the engineering firm hired to investigate the incident reported that the carbon-monoxide detector was not connected to the electric wires in the ceiling that were supposed to supply power and that the back-up battery was installed backwards.

Bartz and Brewster sued Wolters for negligence and breach of express and implied warranties. Wolters was insured under an artisan-contractor commercial general liability (CGL) policy from appellant Midwest Family Mutual Insurance Company from April 2007 until April 2008, and he tendered his defense. Midwest appointed defense counsel for Wolters and also commenced a declaratory-judgment action, claiming that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Wolters under the policy. Midwest moved for summary judgment in the declaratory-judgment action, which the district court denied.

 THE POLICY 

Wolters’s CGL policy provides coverage for costs of“bodily injury”or“property damage”for which the insured becomes liable. But this coverage is subject to several express exclusions, including a pollution exclusion, which states:
 
 9. We do not pay for bodily injury or property damage: 
 a. arising wholly or partially out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants: 
 . . . 4) at or from any premises where you or any contractor or subcontractor, directly or indirectly under your control, are working or have completed work: 
 a) if the pollutant is on the premises in connection with such work, unless the bodily injury or property damages arise from the heat, smoke or fumes of a fire which becomes uncontrollable or breaks out from where it was intended to be; or 
 b) if the work in any way involves testing, monitoring, clean-up, containing, treating or removal of pollutants. 
 
“Pollutant”is defined in the policy to include“any solid, liquid, gaseous, thermal, electrical emission (visible or invisible) or sound emission pollutant, irritant or contaminant.”Because the exclusion no longer includes an exception for sudden and accidental dispersal of pollutants, it is known as an absolute pollution exclusion.

 ANALYSIS 

The trial court concluded that the absolute pollution exclusion should be limited to traditional environmental pollutants, reasoning that Minnesota courts’past interpretations of the exclusion to include interior contamination from ordinary negligence is against public policy. Although the Court of Appeals believed that the concerns expressed by the builder and the trial court was valid, precedent compels an interpretation of the pollution exclusion to include interior pollutants, and any policy-based expansion of that exclusion is beyond the court’s authority, thus inviting the Supreme Court to review its decision.

The Court of Appeals took a“non-technical, plain-meaning approach”to interpreting the pollution exclusion where carbon monoxide constitutes a pollutant under the policy definition. The policy definition defines pollution to include“any . . . gaseous . . . emission . . . pollutant, irritant or contaminant.”Carbon monoxide is a highly poisonous gas that was emitted by the improperly functioning boiler.  In fact, the federal government classifies carbon monoxide as a pollutant and regulates its concentration under the Clean Air Act binding the court to the conclusion that carbon monoxide fits within the policy definition of “pollutant.”

 Because the pollution exclusion includes the release of carbon monoxide in a home, the court then asked if the particular circumstances of the emission fall within the policy exclusion. The policy excludes coverage for damages arising out of the discharge or escape of pollutants at or from any premises where the insured or any subcontractor under the insured’s control are working or have completed work if the pollutant is on the premises in connection with such work.

The Court of Appeals noted that a court may not read an ambiguity into the plain language of a policy in order to provide coverage. The phrase“in connection with”is not susceptible to an interpretation that requires a contractor to bring the pollutant onto the premises for the exclusion to apply and is not ambiguous. The discharge of carbon monoxide occurred at Bartz’s home, where Wolters had worked, because the boiler Wolters purchased was not compatible with the liquid-propane fuel source Wolters connected it to and the injuries occurred in connection with Wolters’s work.

The pollution exclusion in the CGL policy is clearly marked and the exception for hostile fires is defined by the policy terms to include only a fire“which becomes uncontrollable or breaks out from where it was intended to be.”The engineering report stated that the boiler was“significantly over-fired”because of the use of propane instead of natural gas and that this caused production of high levels of carbon monoxide and pressurization of the boiler cabinet, which allowed the gas to escape. The pollution exclusion was clearly designated in the exclusions section of the policy and the doctrine of reasonable expectations is inapplicable. Wolters paid $560 for a CGL policy that covered certain risks and excluded others; his reasonable expectations were not defeated. 

The pollution exclusion is not limited to environmental pollutants under Minnesota law and that damages resulting from Wolters’s installation of a boiler incompatible with propane and improper installation of a carbon monoxide detector are excluded from insurance coverage. Consequently, Midwest does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Wolters in the underlying action, and the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s decision and ordered summary judgment be entered in favor of the insurer.

 LESSON 

If an insurer wishes to avoid pollution claims in Minnesota it should emulate the language of the Midwest policy quoted, in part, above. If the insured wishes to protect against such a risk the insured should be ready to pay more than the minimal amount paid by the insured in this case to convince an insurer to withdraw the pollution exclusion.

 Claims In A Catastrophe 
 Posted on August 30, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Presenting a Claim 

 If your house was damaged or destroyed by fire, windstorm, hurricane, tornado, or flood as a result of state declared catastrophes and you had a fire, homeowners, flood insurance, tenant’s homeowners or condominium policy you will be dealing with an insurance adjuster. You should recognize that dealing with an insurance adjuster in a catastrophe is usually fairly easy because of the number of claims the adjuster is required to deal within a short time.

Insurers will be in a very generous mood. They will be seeking good publicity by taking  care of victims of the catastrophe quickly and fairly. To make the claims process go easily the insured person must understand that both the insured and the adjuster have duties when damage-caused by fire, windstorm, flood or other insured perils are discovered. The following list outlines the most important of these duties:

 You should be sure there is no unnecessary delay in reporting the fact of the discovery of damage to your insurer as a claim. You and the adjuster should establish that there is no unnecessary delay in responding to any fire, fire fighting, flood or water-related cause of loss where“mold”may result as a natural result of water, warmth, and existence of mold spores in all building. You may be asked to sign a non-waiver agreement. You may receive a reservation of rights letter advising you of your duties under the policy, the conditions that apply or might apply, and the exclusions that may apply to the facts of the loss. You, as the insured, should readily, and without objection, sign the non-waiver agreement or accept the reservation of rights as an expression of the status quo . The adjuster should remind you, as part of the reservation of rights letter and explanation of the duties of the insured, to preserve and protect the damaged property and to mitigate the loss with due diligence and dispatch. You can request from the adjuster the identity of respected, competent, and professional contractors experienced in fire reconstruction or the drying out of buildings and the prevention or restriction of further loss including mold growth. You should follow up regularly with the adjuster to ensure that he or she is meeting contractual obligations since a catastrophe often makes communications difficult. If you have failed to protect the property from further loss, the adjuster must remind you, in writing, of your failure and how that could effect your claim. The adjuster should consider advance payments to avoid any unnecessary difficulties so that you and your family will have a place to live while your house is being rebuilt. 
 You can expect an advance of $10,000 to $20,000 if your house is destroyed to carry you over. Even if your house was not damaged you are entitled to additional living expense payments if you were ordered out of your house by the state government, federal government, Homeland Security, or the local fire department. Remember that additional living expense coverage does not pay all of your post loss expenses, only those over and above your normal expenses. 


 Insurance claims require personal attention to detail by the insured. You and the adjuster must meet in person. If the claim is to be resolved expeditiously and fairly, both you and the adjuster should work to establish a personal relationship and to resolve, if coverage is available, the problems caused by the damage to the dwelling or business structure.

Once the rights, obligations, and duties of the insured and the insurer have been stated, and the initial investigation is complete, the insurer is obligated to conduct a prompt analysis of the policy wording and the law to determine whether coverage exists for the damage claimed. Once the investigation is complete and the decision made, it is the adjuster’s obligation to advise you, promptly and in detail, of the decision of the insurer. If coverage is available, it is also the obligation of the adjuster to advise you of your duties and obligations to obtain complete indemnity from the insurer and to protect the property from further loss.

 The Notice of Loss 

If you believe that your property was damaged or destroyed by a peril insured by your policy you should call or write the insurance agent, broker or insurer immediately (or as soon as practical) to report your claim. Follow up the phone call with a fax, an email, and a letter. If the house was not destroyed but a great deal of fire fighting water or subsequent rain or flood water entered the property try to get a remediation team into the home or business within the first 48 hours to begin drying out the property. If you do not know one ask your insurer for a referral. This is crucial to preventing or containing mold growth and rot. If the agent, insurance company, independent adjuster, or restoration company delays the claim, follow up with a fax, an email, and a letter confirming their delay in responding. It would be helpful to send copies of the follow-up letters to the consumer protection unit of the state’s Department of Insurance.Take detailed notes of every conversation, including the name, company, phone number, address, and job title of every insurance adjuster, representative, consultant, and contractor you deal with. Confirm all agreements in writing and insist that appointments and deadlines be honored. Keep a log of all notes and letters and ask for and keep business cards from everyone involved in your claim.

Immediately after the telephone call, write a letter to the broker or agent, with a copy to the insurer, providing the same information. The letter need not be formal. It can be handwritten on any available paper. Make a photocopy.

The notice of loss should include the following information:

•    Your full name.
•    The location of the property.
•    The policy number.
•    The effective dates of the policy.
•    The date when damage first occurred.
•    The type of property damage.
•    The cause or causes of the damage.
•    How the adjuster can contact you.
•    That you need immediate contact from the adjuster.

By providing the information to the agent, the broker and/or the insurer you have fulfilled the first obligation under the policy: to provide immediate notice of loss to the insurer.

 If the insurer is working effectively and has a catastrophe team of adjusters in place you should receive contact from an adjuster within 24 hours of the notice. The first call should arrange an appointment to inspect the property. You should arrange for inspection as soon as possible and have the entire property available for the inspection if possible. If emergency efforts are required, you should so advise the adjuster so that he or she can help you take emergency measures to protect against further loss.

If possible, you or the adjuster should arrange to have one or more contractors present at the first meeting to determine the extent of the damage. If the damage is extensive, consider retaining the services of a public insurance adjuster [if you determine a public insurance adjuster would be helpful, it is appropriate to seek one who is a member of the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters (NAPIA), a professional membership organization that seeks to instill professionalism in the trade] or an attorney experienced in representing policyholders in the claims process to represent your interest. The lawyer will usually work on an hourly fee basis while the public insurance adjuster will expect a percentage of the amount paid by the insurer. You must recognize that the public insurance adjuster will ask for a 10 – 15% negotiable fee. Do not hesitate to negotiate with the public insurance adjuster. Never pay the first fee quoted. Considering the volume of work in a catastrophe, you should be able to negotiate a fee between 3% and 10%.

 Insurance Company Response 

Your insurer should respond to typical catastrophe claims by written or verbal contact within 24 hours of your notice of the claim. The insurer should share information regarding emergency repairs, additional living expenses, temporary advance payments and prevention of further loss with you. 

Your insurer should, and in California is obligated to, advise you of your responsibilities under the policy. Many require their representatives to be at your home within 24 to 72 hours of notice of claim. If you explain that your fire loss is severe, the insurer should attempt to have a representative at your house within 24 hours.

The insurer is obligated by statute, state administrative regulations, or by the terms of the policy to determine whether your claim is covered and provide an initial estimate of damage within seven to 14 days after the insurer’s first on-site visit. This first estimate is subject to change. Within the same time frame, your insurer should attempt to provide you with a written statement confirming or denying coverage. These time limits are usually waived in catastrophes and may be impossible to meet with regard to Hurricane Katrina event and other massive catastrophes. You should expect your insurer to return all phone calls within 24 hours. Initial contact may be with your insurance agent or broker or a claims office or the toll-free phone number included in the policy. Because of the volume of claims after a catastrophe like those in the 2005 hurricane season and the 2008 California wild fire season, this time frame will probably not be feasible.

 First Contact with the Adjuster 

Your first contact with the adjuster is usually an informative meeting where you discuss the cause of the loss, the type of loss, when the loss was discovered, and make an initial effort to agree on a tentative scope of loss.
You should expect the adjuster to do the following:

 ask for a walk-through inspection of the entire dwelling or building. 
 You should make every effort to point out each item of damage or suspected damage during the walk-through inspection. You, or your representative, should assist the adjuster in viewing both the damage and the source of the damage; 
 ask you to submit to a recorded statement; ask you for the identities of each family member or vendor who can give the adjuster information about the loss; ask for the recorded statements of the persons identified; ask permission to allow experts retained by the insurer to inspect the property and do minor destructive testing to establish the appropriate methods of reconstruction and repair; and ask permission to contact others who know information about the loss and to obtain from those people within your control a detailed recorded statement and documents relating to their knowledge of the loss and the extent of the loss. 

 First Meeting with the Adjuster 

 An adjuster is a person professionally trained to assess the damage to your property. He or she will probably visit your home or business before you are asked to complete any forms. The more information you have about your damaged home or business and belongings, the sooner your claim will be settled. Your adjuster generally will come prepared to do a thorough and complete evaluation of the damage to your property. If the adjuster is unable to complete a thorough inspection due to time constraints or the extent of damage, he or she should prepare a scope of the loss report. This is a brief listing of the findings of damage determined at the initial inspection of the damage. The adjuster should ask you to agree to the scope of loss. Agreeing to a scope of loss is not presenting a claim. It is understood by the adjuster that the scope is incomplete and will be added to as new damage is discovered. It is usually supplemented with a second visit after the reports of experts are received to complete the inspection.

 The“scope of loss”should include the following: 

 degree of damage; a description of each location where damage was observed; a description of the adjuster’s and your own best estimates of the type of damage observed; a list of all personal property damaged or destroyed; quality of the materials and workmanship; and measurements needed to calculate quantities, including length, width, and height of rooms and the number of“openings”(windows and doors) in each room. 

The scope of loss, usually referred to by claims people as the“scope,”differs from the finished estimate in two ways the scope does not necessarily list any prices, although prices can be used to describe quality the scope does not list the calculated quantities; it includes just the raw counts and measurements needed to calculate quantities for the estimate.

 Protect All Property from Further Damage 

Every policy requires that the insured protect the property from further loss. Therefore, you should turn off any water flow to broken appliances or pipes, arrange to have openings in roofs or walls covered to protect from rain damage, and seek help from the adjuster to further protect your property from losses of all types.
 
Take any necessary emergency measures to protect the building and personal property from any further damage. Do not throw anything away until permission of the insurance company is obtained in writing and you have documented its condition unless the damaged property presents a hazard to the health or safety of your family or others.

If the insurer delays or refuses to authorize measures to prevent further loss, confirm the insurer’s delay in a fax, email, and a letter, and take whatever reasonable measures you can afford to protect the property. If your loss is covered, the insurance company should also cover the cost of any reasonable emergency measures you took to protect your property. It is not unusual for an insurer to deny coverage for damage resulting after the initial claim on the grounds that an insured failed to comply with the policy condition to protect the property from further damage.

 Document the Loss 

If you were prudent and prepared, before the catastrophe, an inventory of your contents or took pictures of your contents, provide the adjuster with the inventory and photographs or videotape. Photograph, videotape, and inventory all damaged property after the loss. Make sure you record the date of the photos and videotape. It is important to document the source and the extent of damage whether by fire or water intrusion.

 In most states, a material misrepresentation, concealment, or omission made in connection with the claim will give the insurer a valid reason to reject the entire claim. For example, claiming that an item was destroyed that really wasn’t or substantially overstating the value of a damaged item is fraud. In most states insurance fraud is a felony that can place you in state prison if convicted.

No catastrophe is so bad as to cause you to attempt to defraud your insurer to make up for uninsured losses. You should never exaggerate, speculate, or guess about the loss or value of any particular piece of property. Make it clear to your insurer when recollection may not be accurate, when you are estimating value, and the basis for your estimate. For the value of items you are not sure about on a claim presentation, use the phrase“To Be Determined.”If you do not have receipts to show the price of an item, information can be found in catalogs, statements from retail clerks, bank statements, credit card statements, or statements from family members or friends.

If all else fails, a formal appraisal can be obtained from a professional personal property appraiser. Save this as a last resort, since the insurer will usually refuse to reimburse you for the costs of hiring an appraiser, but may hire one at no cost to you if asked courteously.

You Must Cooperate with the Insurance Company’s Investigation and Handling of the Claim

You have a contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer in its investigation and handling of the claim. You never have an obligation to allow yourself to be abused. In most states the insured and the insurance company have a mutual obligation to act in good faith and deal fairly with each other to investigate and process the claim. This means that both should avoid taking any unreasonable position or doing or saying anything that would in any way frustrate each other’s rights under the policy. 

The insurer may require one or more recorded statements from you. Always request a copy of the tape and a transcript of the statement to review. When the recording is complete, ask the adjuster to break out the tab so that nothing can be recorded over the tape and place your signature and date on the tape label. Ask the adjuster to similarly place his or her signature on the tape. You have a right to review and correct the transcript of any recorded statement.

You may also be required to appear for an“Examination Under Oath”(EUO). The insurer may, but is not required to, hire an attorney to take the EUO to represent the insured. Since a lawyer is not required, however, the insurer will not pay for the attorney that is representing you. The EUO is a contractual obligation and there is usually no clause in the insurance policy promising to pay a lawyer to help the insured make a claim against an insurer. You should not appear for an EUO until you understand all rights, the insurance coverage, and the full extent of the claim, or until counsel is retained by you to represent you at the EUO. Do not refuse to appear at an EUO or the insurer may reject the claim because such refusal is a breach of a material condition of the policy. You may reasonably request a delay in appearance at an EUO to obtain the services of counsel or a public insurance adjuster.

The insurer may ask you to make available various documents related to the claim, including banking statements, investment reports, receipts, and other personal financial documents. You are required to produce any documentation reasonably related to the insurer’s investigation of the claim that can include tax returns. In some states, tax returns are considered privileged and the insured cannot be compelled to produce them, while in other states the failure to produce tax returns is sufficient cause to deny the claim. [See Barry Zalma, Insurance Claims: A Comprehensive Guide , (Specialty Technical Publishers, 2002): Chapter II-5.] The insurer can require you to produce these kinds of documents as long as they are reasonably related to its investigation. You should not provide these documents to the insurer until you understand the rights, duties, and obligations imposed by the insurance coverage and the full extent of the claim. You should never refuse to produce documents unreasonably since the requirement for document production is a condition precedent to the insurer’s obligation to provide a defense and/or indemnity to you.

 Proof of Loss Requirement 

Most first party property policies require that you submit a sworn proof of loss form to the insurer within a certain amount of time, either after the loss or after being provided the proof of loss form. Du ring a catastrophe, especially when total losses are involved, insurers will often waive this requirement.

Flood insurance policies require the proof of loss within sixty days of the loss and are applied in a draconian fashion. If you cannot produce a proof of flood loss within 60 days of the loss obtain an extension of time, in writing from the adjuster, or you will lose all rights under the policy to indemnity.

The National Flood Insurance Program, on September 21, 2005, announced that it  waived proof-of-loss requirements for victims of Hurricane Katrina and will instead rely on claims adjuster reports, aerial photography, and information on water depths to help expedite the process of paying claims, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. Whether similar actions will occur as a result of recent hurricanes or flood disasters has not been determined.

In most states you are contractually obligated to submit the sworn proof of loss within the time limit (usually 60 days from the date of request), or at least to substantially comply with the requirement, unless the insurer agrees to dispense with the sworn proof of loss or extend the time. The NFIP applies this requirement strictly and will deny your claim if you fail to submit a claim within 60 days or obtain a written extension of time to submit a proof of loss. Such denials are invariably upheld by federal courts.

You should not submit the sworn proof of loss to the insurer until you understand all of the rights and obligations imposed by the policy, the insurance coverages, and the full extent of the claim. It is not unusual for an insurer to consider mistakes in the sworn proof of loss (since they are sworn to under oath) as intentional misrepresentations sufficient to allow it to reject coverage for a claim. A statement made under oath cannot, by definition, contain an innocent misrepresentation. Never sign a sworn proof of loss, even if your lawyer or professional public insurance adjuster prepares it, until you have carefully read every word and are certain that the statements made are true.

Some insurers believe that, at some point, you will refuse to comply with their requests. If you refuse to comply with reasonable requests for a recorded statement, an EUO, a sworn proof of loss, or documents reasonably related to the insurer’s investigation, you may give the insurer a valid excuse to deny the claim based on your breach of the duty to cooperate. If you believe that any requests made by the insurer are unreasonable, ask the insurer to explain the reason(s) for the requests in writing. Err on the side of caution and provide all documents that have some reasonable connection to the policy or loss. Before giving an insurer a reason to deny a claim because of your failure to cooperate, consult with a policyholder attorney, a public adjuster, or the state Department of Insurance before refusing a request that may, in retrospect, turn out to have been reasonable.

 Estimating Cost of Repair 

Many insureds believe that insurers make a practice of making inadequate (sometimes called“lowball”) offers of settlement. They are wary of what they think are estimates from insurance-company-friendly contractors. Similarly insurers are wary of contractor estimates written by contractors who appear only at disasters and whose repair estimates are exceptionally high. Whether true or not, it is a good practice for the insured and the insurer to get a second, or even a third, written estimate to repair and replace damaged property from reputable, independent professionals that you would hire to do the repairs if there was no insurance.

You are entitled to have the damaged property replaced with“like kind and quality.”This means that you should insist that the amount determined to be the amount of loss is sufficient to replace the property with property of like kind and quality to the damaged property. When you cannot match the remaining undamaged tile, wallpaper, carpeting, or other portions of undamaged property, you are usually entitled to have the entire“line of sight”replaced to match. For example, if a broken water pipe destroys the hardwood floor in a kitchen and does no damage to the contiguous hardwood floor in the adjoining family room, the insurer is required to replace both the damaged and undamaged floors so that they match as long as they are in a continuous line of sight.

 Some losses are paid on an actual cash value (ACV) basis, which in some states means either the fair market value of the property at the time of loss unless the policy defines ACV differently. Many policies will define ACV as replacement cost less physical depreciation for age and wear and tear. Some losses are paid out on a replacement cost value (RCV), where the insured is paid the difference between actual cash value and replacement cost value after the insured has actual sums necessary to complete the replacement. You may collect the ACV loss immediately and advise the insurer you intend to make claim for the difference between ACV and RCV when the structure is rebuilt. If your policy has a time-limit for rebuilding be sure to get a written extension of time since, after a catastrophe, the rebuilding process is often severely delayed.

When fire and water-damage reconstruction contractors write estimates for insurance companies they always add at the end of their estimate a sum equal to 10% of the basic contract price for“overhead,”and an additional 10% of the basic contract price for“profit.”This technique is a fiction believed only by property owners and accepted as a fiction by contractors and adjusters. Knowledgeable construction people know that no contractor could survive on 10% profit and that contractors build overhead and profit into their basic unit costs (paint, plaster, roofing, etc) and add the“profit and overhead”numbers as a fee for the extra service they provide to insurers. In recent years, some insurers have attempted to withhold 20%, an amount equal to the contractor’s“profit and overhead”numbers to arrive at an ACV amount. There is no basis in the policy that allows withholding profit and overhead as a means of calculating ACV.  In fact, ACV is defined either as the difference in the fair market value of the property before the loss and the fair market value of the property after the loss or the full cost of replacement using like kind and quality, less physical depreciation. You should insist that any amounts withheld from payment pending completion of the work, be documented in writing and justified by the adjuster objectively. Policyholder attorneys and some insurance regulators have successfully prevented insurers from withholding these amounts.

 Investigate Contractors 

Thoroughly investigate the qualifications, license, and references of your insurance company’s approved contractor before agreeing to hire them to perform the repairs. The State Contractors Licensing Board will usually provide the consumer, by telephone or over the Internet, with the contractor’s license status and history of discipline. At a minimum, the licensing entity and a reference should be checked before a contract is signed. You do not have to use consultants or contractors recommended or approved by the insurer to perform repairs. Approved contractors are typically contractors who have agreed to discount their labor and costs and follow insurer guidelines in exchange for a volume of business from the insurance company. If your insurer promises to guarantee the approved contractor’s work, the guarantee is generally limited to replacing any defective materials or correcting faulty workmanship. The insurer is not insuring against any contractor delays, negligence, or liability. Accordingly, do not use the approved contractor unless it is a contractor that you would independently hire to do the work after a thorough screening. Check that each contractor’s license is valid and for any complaints against the license. Ensure that the contractor is bonded and insured.

 Seek Proper Legal Advice 

 Never sign a release, waiver, indemnity, or“hold harmless”agreement without proper legal advice. If the insurer, adjuster, consultant, or contractor asks you to sign a release, waiver, indemnity, or hold harmless agreement, ask them to explain why in writing. These kinds of agreements can be used to deprive an insured of rights and benefits and may obligate you to pay thousands of extra dollars for issues that arise after the document is signed. Consult a policyholder attorney to determine your rights before signing any such agreement.

Seek professional help, if needed. If you reach an impasse with the insurer, document the dispute fully in writing. Explain your position and why the insurance company’s position is unreasonable. If the dispute does not require legal advice, you may be able to resolve it by calling the state Department of Insurance or by hiring a lawyer or public insurance adjuster. If the dispute does require legal advice, contact a lawyer who is experienced and specializes in representing policyholders. There are many consultants who claim to be“insurance claims experts”who do not have adequate training, skill, or experience. Before you retain one investigate the person diligently by contacting licensing bodies and references.

 Be Aware of Deadlines 

Make sure you know all the deadlines that may cut off the right to file a lawsuit. California has a four-year statute of limitations for breaches of written contracts but most insurance policies require suit within one or two years of the loss or the denial of a claim. If your claim is denied seek legal advice promptly.

In most states the insurance company is required to tell you, in writing, that the claim is denied, and that the limitations clock is running. That is, if you disagree with the insurer’s conclusion to deny your claim you have a limited time to file suit. Make sure you understand all possible deadlines. Consult with a policyholder attorney as soon as possible. The time limitation can be as short as one year from the date the loss occurred and can be put on hold by actions of the insurer. If you wish to sue, it is best to contact counsel as soon as possible before the expiration of the time limit.

 Report all Unfair Claims Handling to the Department of Insurance or an Insurance Regulator 

The state Insurance Department tracks policyholder complaints about their insurers and compiles the results. Most states have proactive consumer advocates in their insurance departments who will jump in to help you if they believe the insurer is not treating you fairly.

 Conclusion 

Many insurers involved in Catastrophes provide their adjusters with policy limits authority and instruct the adjuster to be generous. If your house was one of those totally destroyed and coverage is available there is a good probability that you will receive the full policy limits immediately.

If you did not carry sufficient insurance to totally rebuild your house and replace your contents consider the acquisition of a factory built home which can be trucked to your site and completed, with all appliances included, for much less than a conventionally constructed home.

Almost all claims will be handled promptly and fairly. Insurers have teams of specially trained catastrophe adjusters or retain independent catastrophe adjusters. A person knowledgeable about insurance claims can better deal with an insurance company. Don’t take advantage of your insurer and don’t let an insurer take advantage of you. You are entitled to indemnity. You and your insurer should work together to make you whole.

 The Private Limitation of Action 
 Posted on August 29, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Ohio Enforces Private Limitation 

Almost every policy of first party property insurance contain a private limitation of action provisi on that limits the right of the insured to sue on the policy for a period shorter than the statutory limitation period.  When an insured fails to file suit before the running of that limitation period the insured will argue that the insurer waived its right to enforce the private limitation of action provision or that the provision is ambiguous.

The Supreme Court of Ohio, on August 23, 2011, was faced with just such an argument when the court of appeals concluded that a private limitation of action provision in a policy issued by Nationwide Insurance Company was ambiguous and that Nationwide, by its actions, waived the right to enforce the limitation period in Dominish v. Nationwide Ins. Co. , Slip Opinion No. 2011-Ohio-4102 (the court’s opinion can be accessed at http://www.supremecourtofohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2011/2011-ohio-4102.pdf .)

 Facts 

On July 28, 2006, a storm caused a tree to fall and damage a house owned by Dennis J. Dominish. Dominish submitted a claim to his insurance company, appellant, Nationwide Insurance Company. Nationwide investigated, assessed damaged, and twice issued a check to Dominish in the mount of $6,741.96. Both times that Dominish received a check, he wrote the word “void” on it and returned it to Nationwide, deeming the amount insufficient to cover the damage to his home.

On July 25, 2008, almost two years after the tree fell, Dominish filed suit against Nationwide. Nationwide argued that the lawsuit was barred by a clause in the insurance contract that states:

 The Limitation Provision 
 
 “Suit Against Us. No action can be brought against us unless there has been full compliance with the policy provisions. Any action must be started within one year after the date of loss or damage.” 
 
 Nationwide clearly stated that it was not liable beyond the amount of the check that it twice proffered to Dominish. In a letter dated September 6, 2006, Nationwide stated, “You will receive or have received, a partial denial letter, indicating the roof damage is NOT part of the covered loss, nor is any damage to personal property, nor is there any covered cause of loss for any mold related issues. All of these issues are discussed in the partial denial letter.”

 Analysis 

The Supreme Court, as have most courts in the U.S., noted that although most words in the English language have multiple meanings, ambiguity should not be created where it does not exist.  In isolation, any word or phrase in a policy wording may appear to be ambiguous. When considered as a whole, however, the provision in the Nationwide policy is unambiguous. That the word “start” is not commonly used to indicate the commencement of a lawsuit does not mean that it refers to something else when it is used in a provision entitled “Suit Against Us.” Similarly, though the word “action” can refer to virtually anything done by a person, there is no reason to think it refers to anything other than a lawsuit when used as part of a two-sentence provision entitled “Suit Against Us.”

The fact that the two sentences could have been written more clearly, and they could have, does not mean that they are ambiguous.

 Waiver 

To be deemed to have waived its right to enforce a limitation-of action clause in Ohio an insurance company must have either recognized liability or held out a reasonable hope of adjustment and by doing so, induced the insured to delay filing a lawsuit until after the contractual period of limitation had expired. We conclude that Nationwide did not recognize liability for the disputed portion of the damage or hold out a hope of an adjustment to include compensation for that portion of the damage.

In the partial-denial letter, Nationwide clearly advised the insured of the limitation of coverage and stated: “I wish to point out that the policy states on page E2 that any suit you wish to file against Nationwide as a result of this claim must be done so within one year” and quoted the policy wording.

The Supreme Court concluded the language of the policy was clear and there was no waiver and reinstated the trial court’s grant of Nationwide’s motion for summary judgment. In doing so it followed the great weight of authority.

 Other States 

 The history and development of the law with regard to the private limitation of action provision teaches that it should not be ignored. In 1868, the United States Supreme Court concluded that a 12-month private limitation of action provision should be strictly enforced. Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Insurance Company , 74 U.S. 386, 19 L. Ed. 257 (1868). The U.S. Supreme Court stated:
 
 It is clearly for the interest of insurance companies that the extent of losses sustained by them should be speedily ascertained, and it is equally for the interest of the assured that the loss should be speedily adjusted and paid. The conditions in policies requiring notice of the loss to be given, and proofs of the amount to be furnished the insurers within certain prescribed periods, must be strictly complied with to enable them to recover…And it is not an unreasonable term that in case of a controversy upon a loss resort shall be had by the assured to the proper tribunal, whilst the transaction is recent, and the proofs respecting it are accessible… 

 The commencement, therefore, of the present action within the period designated was a condition essential to the plaintiff’s recovery. 
 
In 1885, the California Court of Appeal found the one year private limitation to be enforceable unless the plaintiff established that negotiations with the defendant insurer established a waiver or caused the insurer to be estopped from asserting the provision as a defense. Finding no evidence of waiver or evidence to support estoppel, the defense verdict was affirmed. In 1909, the California Supreme Court stated that the general rule with regard to the private limitation of actions provision was:
 
 [T]hat a condition in a policy of insurance, providing that no recovery shall be had thereon unless suit be brought within a given time, is valid, if the time limited be in itself not unreasonable…The six months’ period was not in itself unreasonable. Tebbets v. Fidelity&amp;Casualty Co. of New York, 155 Cal 137, 99 P. 501 (1909). 
 
Basing its decision on the “great weight of authority,” the California Supreme Court found a period of limitation half that of the present private limitations period to be reasonable and enforceable. The primary purpose of contractual modifications of the statute of limitations is to avoid prejudice; specifically, to avoid the extra danger of fraud and mistake associated with stale claims. See Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Sand Lake Lounge, Inc. , 514 P. 2d 223, 226 (Alaska 1973) and Estes v. Alsaka Guaranty , 774 P. 2d 1315 (1989) where the Supreme Court of Alaska required “prejudice” be shown before the private limitation of action provision is applied.

In Zuckerman v. Transamerica Insurance Co. , 650 P. 2d at 448, the Arizona Supreme Court held that a contractual modification of the statute of limitations should be enforced only “when the reasons for its existence are thereby served.” When enforcement does not serve the reasons for the provision’s inclusion in the policy, the insured’s reasonable expectation that coverage will not be arbitrarily denied must be given effect.

It is a contractual undertaking between the parties to a contract of insurance: that there is a limitation on the time for bringing suit imposed by the parties to the contract. Lardas v. Underwriters Ins. Co., 426 Pa. 47, 231 A. 2d 740, 741-42 (1967). Suit limitation clauses are ubiquitous.

The California Court of Appeal, as recently as 1985, reiterated and accepted what the California Supreme Court had stated in the past:
 
 We accordingly hold that the shortened time-forcommencement-of-suit provision in the policies in question is valid and govern the time within which suit has to be commenced in this case. C&amp;H Foods, Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co ., 163 Cal. App. 3d 1055, 211 Cal. Rptr. 765 (1984). 
 
The California Supreme Court agrees. It stated, in Prudential-LMI:
 
 [W]e hold that the one-year suit provision begins to run on the date of inception of the loss, defined as that point in time when appreciable damage occurs and is or should be known to the insured, such that a reasonable insured would be aware that his notification duty under the policy has been triggered. 
 
The California Supreme Court tolled the limitation period between the time the claim was reported and the date of denial. Although the Ohio court did not apply the California rule if it were applied the result would have been the same since it took two years after the denial for the insured to file suit.

 Lesson 

It is best to draft policy wording to avoid, if possible, claims of ambiguity. Regardless of the wording of the policy it is best to deny the claim and to advise the insured, even if the insured is represented by counsel, of the private limitation of action provision so there can be no dispute.

It is prudent for insurers, as did Nationwide in the Dominish case, for the insurer to assert the limitation of action clause “at every possible instance” so the insured was not induced to forbear filing suit by anything the insurer did and thereby eliminate the waiver argument.

Counsel for policyholders should be aware of private limitations of action provisions and be certain to file suit within the time limited by the contract and local case law.

 Friday Fun 
 Posted on August 26, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 The story that follows is based on fact. It is, however, a work of fiction. The names, places and descriptions have been changed to protect the guilty. Any resemblance to real people is purely coincidental. This story was written for the purpose of providing insurers, those in the insurance business, and the insurance buying public sufficient information to recognize and join in the fight against insurance fraud. It is one of 84 stories in my e-book“Heads I Win, Tails You Lose.” 

 The Hawaiian 

 The insured was a contractor in Honolulu. He made an excellent living cheating his customers. The insured’s most lucrative scheme was an electronic vermin killer. It consisted of a long wire and a transformer. The contractor strung the wire around a house and plugged it in a wall. The device, charged with low voltage from the transformer, repelled vermin. The insured guaranteed that all roaches, flying insects and rodents could not pass the charge in the wire.

When it didn’t work and a customer called to complain the insured would ignore the complaints. Since the tropical Hawaiian climate is a prime breeding ground for insects, the insured had no lack of customers. He bought a Ferrari sports car with the profits.

Eventually the attorney general of the State of Hawaii learned of his fraud. Investigation showed that the vermin killer did not work. Eye witnesses reported cockroaches dancing on the wire unharmed.

The Attorney General filed administrative charges accusing the insured of consumer fraud. The local press published reports of the charges. His sales began to drop. He needed cash flow.

The insured went to the most exclusive jewelry store in all of Honolulu. The store occupied the 15th floor of a high rise office building. To enter he needed to show identification to a guard and pass through two steel doors. 

He bought a single wrist watch at the jeweler and charged it on his American Express card. He asked the jeweler for, and received, an appraisal of the wrist watch.

He then visited the local public library and withdrew three textbooks on gemology.
He returned to his office and made a Xerox copy of the appraisal. He then covered the description of the wrist watch with a large Post-It Note. He photocopied 20 new copies of the appraisal. The Post-It-Note was invisible to the Xerox machine and he had clean appraisals with no descriptions.

Using the books on gemology, he wrote out descriptions for forty-five separate items of ladies and men’s jewelry. He set values beside each item so they totaled over $500,000. He gave the blank appraisals to his secretary and had her type up the descriptions and values he had written onto the appraisal forms he had created. He then made two copies of the new appraisals and destroyed the originals.

 Armed with his appraisals he visited a large retail insurance brokerage in Honolulu. He advised the broker that he had recently acquired the jewelry from his deceased mother and needed it insured. The broker was familiar with the jewelry establishment and its impeccable reputation. He accepted the Xerox copies of the appraisals, prepared an application, and submitted the application and appraisals to various markets. He received quotations from three different insurers. Each agreed to insure the jewelry. The insured selected the insurer that offered the lowest premium. He explained to his agent that he had a slight cash flow problem and the agent helped him by financing the premium.

He made one payment on the premium finance contract and then reported a theft.
He advised his insurer that the jewelry was secured in the locked drawer of his office which he considered to be a safe. His office was a small structure with a warehouse facility where he parked his construction truck and, on that night, the Ferrari. It was an employee’s birthday and he and five employees went to a local restaurant to celebrate the birthday. Since they could not fit in his Ferrari, they all went in his foreman’s eight passenger van.

When they returned from the birthday party, they immediately noticed that the Ferrari was no longer in the warehouse. The aluminum overhead door was off its track. Someone had broken in. The thieves must have found the keys to his Ferrari in the desk. The desk drawer was broken and on the floor. No jewelry remained in the building. The insured was distraught since the jewelry was his only connection with his deceased mother. He demanded that the police do everything they could to catch the thieves and return his jewelry. He told the police he did not want insurance money. He only wanted his family heirlooms back. He even asked his insurer to offer a reward for the return of the stolen jewelry.

The insurer, faced with a $500,000 loss assigned their most senior investigator to the claim. He agreed with the insured and offered a $50,000 reward for the return of the jewelry. He then began his investigation with the recorded statement of the insured.

 Besides advising the investigator of the theft he informed him that his mother had mailed him the jewelry shortly before her death. She died four years before in a small village in the Philippines. She was afraid that the Philippine government would take the jewelry for taxes. To avoid those taxes mother had simply packaged them in a plain brown wrapper and sent them by mail. She did not insure the delivery nor did she register or declare to US Customs the contents. He kept them in his home, for safekeeping until her death when he believed they had become his property. Then he took them to the jewelry store to establish the value of the gift his mother had made to him. He was astonished that the jewelry had as great a value as reported by the jeweler. He immediately took steps to insure the jewelry.

Two days after the theft, the police found the Ferrari in a gully. Since it was only one of eight Ferraris on the entire island, there was little the thieves could do with it. The police believed the theives set it afire. The police found only a burned out hull and no evidence available to lead them to the thieves. The destruction of the Ferrari seemed to establish the legitimacy of the claim.

The adjuster began the steps necessary to complete what might be a routine investigation. His first stop was at the jewelry store. He found the gemologist who signed the appraisal. He showed the appraisal to him and asked that he verify the appraisal. The jeweler stated: “That is our appraisal form. That is a copy of my signature. I have no record of ever doing this appraisal. I have no recollection of ever doing this appraisal . I have no knowledge of the person with the name of the insured. That isn’t unusual however since I do one thousand appraisals a year.” “Do you have your file copy?”

“That’s what is strange, I can’t find the file copy. But my secretary, just about the time of this appraisal began chemotherapy treatment for cancer. She’s dying and I can’t disturb her.”

The adjuster had a logical explanation for the failure to verify the appraisal. He could not, however, let it sit. As a simple straightforward theft claim was becoming complicated.

The adjuster next had a friend who works the South Pacific attempt to verify that the insured’s mother did in fact live in the village in the Philippines described by the insured. The investigator was successful. He found neighbors and relatives who knew the insured’s mother. He could not, however, verify that she had $500,000 in jewelry to donate to her son. In fact, he found that the insured’s mother lived in a one room house on stakes with a grass roof, no electricity, no running water and no indoor plumbing. Her ex-husband still lived in Honolulu.

 The insured’s family name was unusual in Hawaii and it only took the investigator two days to find the insured’s father. The father lived in a basement apartment in a rundown area of Honolulu. He was pleased to give the adjuster an interview. He had been estranged from his son for twenty years and his wife for ten so he had no first hand, up-to-date information. He did acknowledge that his wife owned jewelry. He told the adjuster:

“Yes, I believe it was very valuable jewelry she owned.”

“How much to do think it was worth?”

“At least $500-$600.”

The adjuster began his investigation in earnest. He invited the insured’s secretary out to lunch. Over a chef’s salad and a glass of ice tea he learned the secretary’s life story. He knew she had been in Hawaii for only two years having come to the islands from Iowa. She was young and very innocent. She liked her job but made only enough money to survive in the Islands. She could not believe the cost of housing compared to what it had been in Iowa.

After gaining her confidence the adjuster confronted the secretary with the result of his investigation. He told her he knew that the appraisals were not done by the jeweler. He showed her where he had discovered that the typewriter used to type the description of the items of jewelry was different from the typewriter used to type the name of the appraiser. He told her that he liked her and would be very sorry if she was involved in aiding her boss in committing a crime. 

She began to cry. When he calmed her down, she confessed that she had typed in all of the descriptions and the values of the jewelry. Her boss, the insured, took the print ball out of the IBM Selectric typewriter and smashed it under his shoe. If asked, she was to say that his children broke the typewriter while playing with it. The adjuster thanked her, paid for lunch and suggested she get a new job. He told her he would do what he could to keep her out of criminal problems.

He then got permission from his client, the insurer, to deny the claim. He wrote a simple brief, letter to the insured stating as follows:

“Your claim is denied because it was presented by you with the knowledge that it was false and fraudulent.”

He said nothing more. The adjuster, as required by law, reported his findings to the local police agency and to the U.S. Postal Inspectors. Both promised to complete a prompt criminal investigation and prosecute the insured for insurance fraud. The adjuster waited, patiently, for five years. Every twelve months he would ask the police concerning their investigation. He would always receive the same response “We’re working on it.”

On the fifth year, just before the statute of limitations ran, they arrested the insured for insurance fraud, wire and mail fraud. On the testimony of the adjuster and the secretary the insured was convicted. The court sentenced him five years in jail, suspended on the condition that he actually served 30 days and that he make restitution of $10,000 in investigation costs to the insurer. Five years have elapsed since his conviction. He is still making a living as a contractor in Hawaii defrauding his customers. He paid when the probation officer caught him what he told the probation officer he could afford. In five years the insured paid, on the restitution order that is a condition of his probation, a total of $250.00. His probation is over.
The crime did not succeed. He did not collect $500,000. The insurance company did not succeed. It paid out over $10,000 to its investigators which it will never recover.

 EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE MUST BE CONSIDERED IN UTAH TO DETERMINE DUTY TO DEFEND 
 Posted on August 25, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Unless The Policy Requires It The“Eight Corners Rule”Is Dead In Utah 

 The Need For a Thorough Investigation 

 Since insurance is a contract of the utmost good faith insurers must conduct a thorough investigation of the policy and the claim before making a decision to defend or not defend a suit. Had Carolina Casualty Insurance Company performed a thorough investigation and accepted the fact that a suit was brought against its insured improperly and miscaptioned it would have concluded that it had the obligation to defend its insured.

When a policy agrees to defend it insured it must do so if there is a potential for the loss or claim to be covered by the terms and conditions of the policy. When a suit is improperly filed by someone without authority in the name of the insured against officers and directors of the insured the insurer must consider extrinsic evidence before making a decision to defend or not. In Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association  v. Carolina Casualty Insurance Company , 2011 UT 49, No. 20090676, Filed August 19, 2011 the Utah Supreme Court decided that the so-called eight corners rule – review of the pleadings alone to the policy to determine if there is a duty to defend – does not always apply and under certain circumstances, the court must consider extrinsic evidence before making a decision to defend.

 Background 

In March 2005, Greg Kersten resigned as the chief executive officer and trustee of Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA). He remained a paid employee of EAGALA until his employment was terminated on November 16, 2005. The day after his termination, Mr. Kersten sued EAGALA’s board of trustees seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.

Mr. Kersten captioned the complaint so it appeared that EAGALA was the plaintiff, and Mr. Kersten signed the complaint as “President and  CEO” of EAGALA. Although Mr. Kersten had no authority to sue on EAGALA’s behalf, he nevertheless obtained a temporary  restraining order giving him control of EAGALA. The EAGALA board members were forced to demonstrate that Mr. Kersten was no longer affiliated with EAGALA and that he had no standing to sue in its name. The district court eventually dissolved the temporary restraining order, and Mr. Kersten voluntarily dismissed the case. EAGALA incurred substantial costs defending itself and its board members against Mr. Kersten’s miscaptioned suit.

 AGALA notified its insurance carrier, Carolina Casualty, of Mr. Kersten’s complaint and requested coverage for the costs of its defense. Carolina Casualty had issued EAGALA a nonprofit  organization liability insurance policy. The policy covered the “Costs of Defense.” It defined a “Claim” as “a written demand for monetary or non-monetary relief including . . . a civil, criminal, administrative or arbitration proceeding.” However, the policy excluded from coverage “any Claim made against an Insured . . . by, on behalf of, or in the right of the Insured Entity.”

The suit, although miscaptioned, clearly sought monetary damages from EAGALA to be paid to Mr. Kersten.

Carolina Casualty, relying solely on the allegations of the complaint, denied coverage, contending that the complaint was brought “by, on behalf of, or in the right of [EAGALA].” Even after EAGALA explained that Mr. Kersten had no authority to file the complaint, Carolina Casualty argued that it was still an excluded claim because the complaint was captioned in EAGALA’s name.

 The Dispute 

EAGALA sued Carolina Casualty to establish coverage for the costs of defending Mr. Kersten’s unsuccessful suit. Carolina Casualty sought judgment on the pleadings on the basis that any claim in the complaint was one “by, on behalf of, or in the right of [EAGALA]” because it was captioned as such. In response, EAGALA proffered extrinsic evidence that Mr. Kersten had no authority to sue in EAGALA’s name and, therefore, the “insured versus insured” exclusion to coverage did not apply. The trial court refused to consider any extrinsic evidence. Instead, it compared the complaint with the policy and held that, on its face, Mr. Kersten’s complaint fell within the “insured versus insured” exclusion to coverage. 

EAGALA appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. The court of appeals explained that whether extrinsic evidence is admissible in the duty-to-defend analysis turns on the parties’ contractual terms. The court of appeals concluded that under the language of the insurance policy, extrinsic evidence was admissible to determine whether the complaint was “actually” filed “by, on behalf of, or in the right of [EAGALA].”

 Analysis 

In past decisions the Utah Supreme Court noted that an insurer may base its decision on the duty to defend on the face of the complaint and its allegations, or on the facts and circumstances underlying the complaint. In Utah, whether a court may consider extrinsic evidence depends on how the duty is described in the contract.

 Whether extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend an insured turns on the parties’ contractual terms. The Supreme Court found that when policy terms define the scope of the duty to defend in reference to something other than the allegations in the complaint and a court may look beyond the text of the complaint to determine whether the duty has been triggered. In that situation, an inquiry limited to the face of the policy and the complaint leaves unanswered the question of whether the insurer has a duty to defend. Analysis of the duty must always begin with an examination of the policy language and the complaint, it ends there only if the policy terms when compared with the allegations definitively indicate that there is or is not a duty to defend.

The primary purpose of contract interpretation is to “ascertain the intentions of the parties” at the time of contracting. To discover these intentions, the court first examines the plain language of the contract. Additionally, it considers each contract provision in relation to all of the others, with a view toward giving effect to all and ignoring none.

While the insurance agreement provides a broad duty to defend any claim brought against EAGALA and its agents, it narrows that duty with a list of coverage exclusions. Among these exclusions is an “insured versus insured” clause that excludes from coverage claims brought by EAGALA against itself or its agents. 

The Supreme Court concluded it must answer is whether a complaint that is incorrectly captioned in a manner designed to make it appear as if it were a legitimate lawsuit in which EAGALA is the plaintiff is a claim made “by, on behalf of, or in the right of [EAGALA]” under the terms of the insurance agreement is in fact such a suit. Although Carolina Casualty concedes that Mr. Kersten had no authority to caption the complaint in EAGALA’s name, it contends that Mr. Kersten’s authority is immaterial. Specifically, Carolina Casualty argued that a duty to defend may arise only within the “eight corners” of the policy and the complaint and that extrinsic evidence is inadmissible and irrelevant when determining whether a duty to defend exists. It reasoned that because the complaint was captioned as though it were brought by EAGALA, the “insured versus insured” clause governs, and Carolina Casualty did not have a duty to defend EAGALA.

Because an insurance policy is a contract, the Supreme Court examined the language of the policy and compared it to the allegations made in the complaint to ascertain the scope of coverage provided by the policy. This so called “eight corners” rule allows a court to determine whether the allegations alone trigger the terms that provide the duty to defend in the insurance policy. If coverage is premised on information not contained in the complaint, the Supreme Court concluded it is obligated to continue its inquiry to examine that information.

The fact that Mr. Kersten brought an unauthorized suit and miscaptioned his complaint in the name of EAGALA did not trigger the exclusion at issue. As noted by the court of appeals, whether a claim is made by, on behalf of, or in the right of EAGALA is an objective fact, the truth or falsity of which is not determined solely by the allegations, or in this case, the captioning, of the complaint. In light of the language defining the scope of the exclusion, an analysis limited to the “eight corners” of the policy and the complaint is incomplete and fails to resolve the central inquiry whether the claim brought by, on behalf of, or in the right of EAGALA?

Since the question cannot be answered through an inspection of the complaint alone, the court’s examination must go on to develop the facts relevant to answer the inquiry. Accordingly, the court of appeals correctly concluded that the trial court erred when it discontinued its analysis and limited its examination to the “eight corners” of the policy and complaint.

An insurance contract, if the parties agree when it is issued, may premise the duty to defend on information in the complaint. However, when an insurance policy conditions the duty to defend on something outside of the complaint, extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine whether the duty has been triggered. In this case, Carolina Casualty issued a policy that hinged the duty to defend on whether the claim was brought “by, on behalf of, or in the right of [EAGALA].” Because this determination is based on objective facts that are not apparent from the face of the complaint, the trial court erred when it refused to consider extrinsic evidence proffered by EAGALA in opposition to Carolina Casualty’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals, reversing the district court’s dismissal of EAGALA’s action.

 LESSON 

If an insurer desires to limit its decision on the four or eight corners of a complaint and avoid analysis based on extrinsic evidence it should write its policy to limit its obligation to defend to the allegations. Instead of the definition contained in the Carolina Casualty policy expressed in EAGALA’s suit it could have defined “claim” as: 
 
 
 “‘Costs of Defense,’ are the costs and expenses resulting solely from the investigation, defense and appeal of any ‘Claim’ against the Insureds as alleged in the claim or suit. ‘Claim’ is a written demand for monetary or non-monetary relief including a civil, criminal, administrative or arbitration proceeding as alleged in the written claim, demand or suit without consideration of facts not alleged in the claim, demand or suit.” 
 
If standard language is to be used, since a policy with such restrictive language as suggested above would be difficult to sell, insurers should thoroughly investigate every claim and determine whether it is appropriate to consider extrinsic evidence to determine if there is a potential for coverage. For example, the extrinsic evidence produced by EAGALA to Carolina Casualty made clear that their reliance on an insured vs. insured exclusion was misplaced.

 South Carolina CGL Ruling on Time on Risk 
 Posted on August 24, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 South Carolina Adopts “Time on Risk” Apportionment of Continuing and Progressive Losses 
 

In Crossmann Communities of N.C., Inc. v. Harleysville Mutual Ins. Co ., Op. No. 26909 (S.C. Sup. Ct. re-filed August 22, 2011) the Supreme Court of South Caro

lina changed its position with regard to “occurrence” under a Commercial General Liability Policy (“CGL”). It concluded that CGL policies provide coverage for progressive property damages and required multiple insurers to share the losses in a pro-rata fashion based on the time on risk.

Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company (“Harleysville”) issued a series of standard CGL policies to the Respondent developers or their predecessors (collectively“Crossmann”) for a series of condominium projects in the Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina.  The exterior components of the condominium projects were negligently constructed, which resulted in water penetration and progressive damage to o
 South Carolina Supreme Court 
therwise nondefective components of the condominium projects.  The homeowners settled their lawsuits against Respondents.  Crossmann then filed this declaratory judgment action to determine coverage under Harleysville’s policies. Harleysville’s liability is limited to damages accrued during its“time on the risk.”

Using the“time on risk”framework, the allocation of the damage award against Crossmann must conform to the actual distribution of property damage across the progressive damage period.  Where proof of the actual property damage distribution is not available, the allocation formula adopted by the Supreme Court was designed to serve as an appropriate default method for dividing the loss among Crossmann’s insurers. 

 Negligently Constructed Property Not“Property Damage” 

 The Supreme Court found that the costs to replace the negligently constructed stucco did not constitute“property damage”under the terms of the policy.  The stucco was not“injured.”However, the damage to the remainder of the project caused by water penetration due to the negligently installed stucco did constitute“property damage.”Based on those allegations of property damage and construing what the court found to be the ambiguous occurrence definition in favor of the insured, the insuring language of the policy in was triggered by the property damage caused by repeated water intrusion.

 Injury In Fact Trigger Applied 

Because the Supreme Court found the injury-in-fact trigger is consistent with the policy’s requirement that damage occur during the policy period, it adopted it in conjunction with a continuous trigger of coverage. It concluded that an injury-in-fact trigger and continuous trigger are on the same continuum and are complementary and rejected the argument that there can be only one occurrence in continuous injury case and applying actual injury rule. 

In this case, Crossmann argued in favor of a“joint and several”approach to the allocation of damages, while Harleysville advocates a pro rata/”time on risk”approach.  The Supreme Court adopted the pro rata/”time on risk”approach. Courts adhering to the“joint and several”theory require each triggered insurer to indemnify its policyholder for the entire loss caused by the progressive injury, up to the policy limit, even if the majority of the loss occurred after the policy period expired.  A key feature of this approach is that a policyholder may be indemnified in full despite its failure to purchase CGL coverage throughout the entire progressive damage period.

The Supreme Court also noted that there is no logic to support the notion that one single insurance policy among 20 or 30 years worth of policies could be expected to be held liable for the entire time period.  Nor is it reasonable to expect that a single-year policy would be liable, for example, if the insured carried no insurance at all for the other years covered by the occurrence.

 Allocation Must Be Pro-Rata Based on Time on Risk 

 The Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s order allocating the entire $7.2 million in stipulated damages to Harleysville and held that the proper method for allocating damages in a progressive property damage case is to assign each triggered insurer a pro rata portion of the loss based on that insurer’s time on the risk. An ideal application of the“time on risk”approach would require the finder of fact to determine precisely how much of the injury-in-fact occurred during each policy period and precisely what quantum of the damage award in the underlying suit was attributable to that injury.  Unfortunately, it is often“both scientifically and administratively impossible”to make such determinations.

In cases where it is impossible to know the exact measure of damages attributable to the injury that triggered each policy, the basic formula consists of a numerator representing the number of years an insurer provided coverage and a denominator representing the total number of years during which the damage progressed.  This fraction is multiplied by the total amount the policyholder has become liable to pay as damages for the entire progressive injury.  In this way, each triggered insurer is responsible for a share of the total loss that is proportionate to its time on the risk.

 Logical Default Method of Allocation 

Although the formula is not a perfect estimate of the loss attributable to each insurer’s time on the risk it is a default rule that assumes the damage occurred in equal portions during each year that it progressed.  If proof is available showing that the damage progressed in some different way, then the allocation of losses would need to conform to that proof.  However, absent such proof, assuming an even progression is a logical default.

In sum, the Supreme Court construed the standard CGL policy to require that each insurer cover only that portion of a loss attributable to property damage that occurred during its policy period.  In light of the difficulty in proving the exact amount of damage incurred during each policy period, it adopted the formula as the default method for allocating shares of the loss.  Trial courts may vary from this default formula where appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case, but they must remain faithful to the premise that each insurer is responsible only for a pro rata portion of the total loss, and each pro rata portion must be defined by the insurer’s time on the risk.

 Insured Must Pay Only One Deductible 

 After taking the position in Crossman the Supreme Court was asked by a federal district court to resolve a similar issue in Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company and Employers Insurance of v. J.T. Walker Industries, Inc., F/K/A Metal Industries, Inc.; and MI, No. 2011-MO-022 (S.C. 08/22/2011) and certified its response to the following question from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina:
 
 Under South Carolina law, when multiple commercial general liability policies are triggered pursuant to Joe Harden Builders, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty&amp;Surety Co ., 486 S.E.2d 89 (S.C. 1997), and an insurer is able to allocate indemnity costs to another subsequent insurer, is the insured entitled to prorate the various deductibles in proportion to the allocation of indemnity costs among the triggered policies? 
 
The Supreme Court answered the certified question“no.”It found that Defendants/policyholders were not entitled to prorate their deductibles based on the limited record before it. The Supreme Court cautioned that its answer to the certified question is a narrow one, for it viewed the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment as binding on it. Moreover, after acceptance of the certified question the Supreme Court overruled its decision in Century Indemnity Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, In c., 348 S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355 (2002) in Crossmann Communities of N.C., Inc. v. Harleysville Mutual Ins. Co., Op. No. 26909 (S.C. Sup. Ct. re-filed August 22, 2011).

 FACTS 

Plaintiffs Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company and Employers Insurance of Wausau (collectively,“Liberty Mutual”) issued commercial general liability insurance policies to Defendant J.T. Walker Industries, Inc. (“Walker”) covering the period between May 1, 1997 and July 1, 2003. Defendant MI Windows&amp;Doors (“MI”), a subsidiary of Walker, was a named insured. These policies offered liability coverage for property damage up to $1,000,000 per occurrence, with a deductible of $500,000 per occurrence. Under the policies, MI would reimburse Liberty Mutual for its defense and indemnity costs up to $500,000, and Liberty Mutual would be responsible for the remainder of the defense costs and for indemnifying MI up to $1 million. Beginning in July 2003, Walker/MI obtained commercial general liability insurance policies from a different insurer, Zurich North America (“Zurich”).

From 2002 to 2008, five homeowners’associations commenced actions in South Carolina state courts alleging certain products manufactured by MI and installed in their homes were defective and that these defective products allowed water to intrude into the homes, causing progressive property damage. Liberty Mutual defended MI in these lawsuits, under a reservation of rights. All five lawsuits were settled over MI’s objection.

The lawsuit at issue, Marais Property Owner’s Association v. Beach Marais, LLC, et al. settled for $500,000. While the parties dispute the precise amount of the defense costs (and we are unable to resolve this dispute), the various amounts asserted fall between $390,000 and $435,000. Liberty Mutual and Zurich agreed among themselves to split the defense costs equally and to allocate the responsibility for indemnity payments as follows: 42% ($210,000) to be paid by Liberty Mutual and 58% ($290,000) to be paid by Zurich. This allocation was based on each insurer’s“time on risk.”

 MI claims to have reimbursed Zurich for $310,208 in defense and indemnity costs. In addition, MI claims to have reimbursed Liberty Mutual for $193,859.25 in defense costs. Liberty Mutual, on the other hand, contends MI“has not reimbursed Liberty Mutual for any defense costs or indemnity payments made to settle the Marais action.”

Liberty Mutual brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina seeking a declaration of its rights and obligations with regard to the defense and settlement of the state court lawsuits. Following cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the district court entered an order finding that the Liberty Mutual policy“covers the full settlement…as do all other policies covering the risk during the progressive damages period”:
 
 [U]nder South Carolina law, the Liberty Mutual policy in effect at the time of the injury-in-fact covers the full settlement of each underlying claim, as do all other policies covering the risk during the progressive damages period, see Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 561 S.E.2d 355, 357 (S.C. 2002); Joe Harden Builders Inc. v. Aetna Cas.&amp;Sur. Co., 486 S.E.2d 89, 91 (S.C. 1997); [and] Liberty Mutual has a right to seek allocation of payments from other insurers, pro rata, based upon the length of time the risk was covered, see Joe Harden, 486 S.E.2d at 91 . . . . 

 The district court then asked the Supreme Court to determine whether MI was“entitled to prorate the various deductibles in proportion to the allocation of indemnity costs among the triggered policies.” 
 
To the Supreme Court the U. S. District court’s order on partial summary judgment determined Liberty Mutual was required to indemnify MI in full. Proceeding on that premise alone, it answered the certified question“no.”If MI was entitled to full indemnity from a single insurer, no subsequent agreement among Liberty Mutual and Zurich could impair that right.

Neither Liberty Mutual nor Zurich was entitled to charge back any portion of the indemnified loss against MI. Where each insurer triggered by a progressive injury is responsible for indemnifying its policyholder in full, a policyholder is“out of the mix once it has been indemnified”and its insurers may not“charge back to the policyholder”any portion of the amount they might subsequently pay to one another.

Accordingly, assuming Liberty Mutual was required to indemnify MI in full, MI was required to pay one full deductible to Liberty Mutual in exchange for full indemnity, and MI could not prorate that single deductible.

If it is true that MI has already paid over $300,000 to Zurich and over $190,000 to Liberty Mutual, it may seem harsh to require MI to pay Liberty Mutual the remainder of its $500,000 deductible. However, the record before the Supreme Court was incomplete and the parties disputed whether these payments were actually made. Factual issues of this kind are beyond the scope of the certified question with which the Supreme Court was presented. If additional action is necessary in order to make MI whole, it stated it was sure those matters will be addressed to the district court.

 LESSONS 

 Various courts have adopted multiple methods of allocating damages between insurers who insure people charged with causing damages over a long period of time and causing progressive damages. South Carolina has adopted what appears to be a fair and equitable method of splitting the insured risk between multiple insurers. By causing pro-rata sharing based on time on risk if the amount of damage in each period can be determined it limits the obligation of the insurer to those damages it agreed to pay as indemnity under an insurance policy.  If the amount of damage in each period cannot be determined it sets up a pro-rata formula that assumes an equal amount of damage during each policy year. 

I agree with the Supreme Court that it is illogical to require one insurance policy, at the option of the insured, among 20 or 30 years worth of policies to be held liable for the entire time period.  I also agree that it is not reasonable to expect that a single-year policy would be liable, for example, if the insured carried no insurance at all for the other years covered by the occurrence.

Insurance is a contract that makes certain promises to indemnify an insured against certain risks of loss. Although the insured may suffer by the pro-rata requirement of the South Carolina Supreme Court because early insurers may have become insolvent or some damage may have occurred when the insured was not insured, it is equally unfair to make an insurer pay for risks it did not agree to take and for which it obtained no premium.

Prudent insurers will work to resolve progressive losses in a fair and reasonable manner using the logical default method used by the South Carolina court, whether the loss is in South Carolina or some other jurisdiction. If outside South Carolina failure to act reasonably, protect the insured, and share reasonable will avoid unnecessary litigation where a court might cause one insurer to pay everything and others to pay nothing. The risk of being the sole payer is worse than the costs of litigation.

 Duty To Provide Safe Place to Work is Delegable 
 Posted on August 23, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Prudent to Delegate Duty to Independent Contractor 

 The California Supreme Court resolved disputes between different district courts of appeal with regard to the duty raised by the California Occupational and Safety and Heath Act (CalOSHA) and whether it is delegable to an independent contractor. Finding the duty delegable the Supreme Court caused to be dismissed a subrogation action by a workers’ compensation insurance company in SeaBright Insurance Company v. US Airways, Inc ., California Supreme Court, Case: S182508, decided August 22, 2011, that reversed the decision of Court of Appeals at 183 Cal.App.4th 219 (2010).

 The General Rule 

Generally, when employees of independent contractors are injured in the  workplace, they cannot sue the party that hired the contractor to do the work.   ( Privette v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 689 (Privette).)  The Supreme Court of California in Seabright decided whether the Privette rule applies when the party that hired the contractor (the  hirer) failed to comply with workplace safety requirements concerning the precise subject matter of the contract, and the injury is alleged to have occurred as a  consequence of that failure. 

By hiring an independent contractor, the hirer without doubt implicitly delegates to the  contractor any tort law duty it owes to the contractor’s employees to ensure the safety of the specific workplace that is the subject of the contract. That implicit  delegation includes any tort law duty the hirer owes to the contractor’s employees to comply with applicable statutory or regulatory safety requirements.

Such  delegation does not include the tort law duty the hirer owes to its own employees to comply with the same safety requirements. Under the definition of employer that applies to California‘s workplace safety laws the employees of an independent contractor are not considered to be the hirer’s own employees.

 The Decision 

The Supreme Court decided that the Court of Appeal erred in reversing the trial court, which had granted summary judgment for defendant.

 Factual Background 

 US Airways uses a conveyor to move luggage at San Francisco International Airport.  The airport is the actual owner of the conveyor, but US  Airways uses it under a permit and has responsibility for its maintenance.  US Airways hired independent contractor Lloyd W. Aubry Co. to maintain and repair  the conveyor; the airline neither directed nor had its employees participate in Aubry‘s work.

The conveyor lacked certain safety guards required by applicable regulations. Anthony Verdon Lujan, who goes by the name Verdon, was inspecting the conveyor as an employee of Aubry, and his arm got caught in its moving parts. Plaintiff SeaBright Insurance Company, Aubry‘s workers’ compensation insurer,  paid Verdon benefits based on the injury and then sued defendant US Airways, claiming the airline caused Verdon‘s injury and seeking to recover what it paid in  benefits. Verdon intervened as a plaintiff in the action, alleging causes of action  for negligence and premises liability.

 Issues 

Defendant US Airways sought summary judgment based on Privette, supra,  5 Cal.4th 689, and Hooker v. Department of Transportation (2002) 27 Cal.4th 198 (Hooker). In Hooker, the Supreme Court held that the hirer of an independent contractor can be liable for a workplace injury of the contractor‘s employee if the hirer retained control over the contractor’s work and exercised that control in a way that affirmatively contributed  to the employee’s workplace injury. Defendant US Airways argued that it did not affirmatively contribute to employee Verdon’s injury.

Insurer SeaBright and employee Verdon (plaintiffs) countered with a declaration by an accident reconstruction expert, who stated that the lack of safety guards at nip points  on the conveyor violated Cal-OSHA regulations (see § 6300  et seq. [Cal. Occupational Safety&amp;Health Act of 1973 (Cal-OSHA)]; Cal. Code  Regs., tit. 8, §§ 3999, 4002 [regulations governing conveyor safety]) and that the safety guards would have prevented Verdon’s injury.

The trial court struck plaintiffs’ declaration insofar as it discussed causation. It found no evidence that US Airways affirmatively contributed to  the accident and granted summary judgment for defendant US Airways. The Court of Appeal reversed.

The Court of Appeal held that, under Cal-OSHA, defendant US Airways had a nondelegable duty to ensure that the conveyor had safety guards, and that  the question whether the airline’s failure to perform this duty affirmatively contributed to plaintiff‘s injury remained a  triable issue of fact, precluding summary judgment.  The court noted conflicting views among the Courts of Appeal as to how Privette, supra,  5 Cal.4th 689, and Hooker, supra, 27 Cal.4th 198, apply when the hirer of the  independent contractor failed to comply with Cal-OSHA regulations, and the court  followed a line of decisions holding that such omissions can expose the hirer to  liability.

Two questions govern the assignment of tort liability:

1.    Did the defendant owe the plaintiff a duty of care?

2.    If so, what standard of care applied?

 Analysis 

 A plaintiff can rely on statutory law to show that a defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care.

Whether Cal-OSHA imposes on an employer like US Airways a tort law duty of care that extends to the employees of other parties such as independent contractors is a question that was unsettled. Under the law before SeaBright, a plaintiff may rely on Cal-OSHA requirements in the same manner that it can rely on other statutes and regulations to show that a defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care. However, California law defines “employer” narrowly.

The issue considered by the Supreme Court was whether US Airways could and did delegate to independent contractor Aubry any duty it owed to Aubry’s employees to comply with the safety requirements of Cal-OSHA. In analyzing this issue the Supreme Court’s earlier decisions recognized a presumptive delegation of responsibility for workplace safety from the hirer to the independent contractor, and a concomitant delegation of duty.

The 1993 decision in Privette, supra , 5 Cal.4th 689, explained: “At common law, a person who hired an independent contractor generally was not liable to third  parties for injuries caused by the contractor‘s negligence in performing the work.…Central to this rule of nonliability was the recognition that a person  who hired an independent contractor had no right of control as to the mode of doing the work contracted for.” That was the common law rule,  but over time, the courts created so many exceptions to this general rule of nonliability that the rule [came to be] primarily important as a preamble to the catalog of its exceptions.

Workers‘ compensation serves the same policies as the peculiar  risk doctrine:  It ensures the availability of compensation to injured employees, spreads the risk created by a contractor‘s work to those who benefit from the  work, and encourages workplace safety. 

The Privette line of decisions establishes that an independent contractor’s hirer presumptively delegates to that contractor its tort law duty to provide a safe workplace for the contractor’s employees.  At issue here  is whether the hirer can be liable to the contractor‘s employees for workplace injuries allegedly resulting from the hirer’s failure to comply with safety requirements of Cal-OSHA and its regulations.  That raises the question whether the tort law duty, if any, to comply with Cal-OSHA and its regulations for the  benefit of an independent contractor’s employees is nondelegable.

The nondelegable duties doctrine prevents a party that owes a duty to others from evading responsibility by claiming to have delegated that duty to an  independent contractor hired to do the necessary work.  The doctrine applies when  the duty preexists and does not arise from the contract with the independent  contractor.

Before hiring independent contractor Aubry, defendant US Airways owed its own employees a duty to provide a safe workplace.  The Supreme Court did not suggest that defendant could delegate that preexisting duty to Aubry such that defendant could  avoid liability if the conveyor had injured defendant’s own employee.  But under  the definition of “employer” that applies to California’s workplace safety laws, the employees of an independent contractor like Aubry are not  considered to be the hirer’s own employees, and the issue whether  defendant US Airways implicitly delegated to contractor Aubry the tort law duty, if  any, that it had to ensure workplace safety for Aubry’s employees.

 The latter duty did not predate defendant’s contract with Aubry; rather, it arose out of the contract. Any tort law duty US Airways owed to Aubry’s employees only existed because of  the work (maintenance and repair of the conveyor) that Aubry was performing for  the airline, and therefore it did not fall within the nondelegable duties doctrine.

The Supreme Court concluded, therefore, that plaintiffs cannot recover in tort from defendant US Airways on a theory that employee Verdon’s workplace injury resulted from defendant’s breach of what plaintiffs describe as a nondelegable duty under Cal OSHA regulations to provide safety guards on the conveyor. The Court of  Appeal erred in reversing the trial court‘s grant of summary judgment for defendant.

 Lesson 

People or companies that use independent contractors can delegate the duty to provide a safe workplace to the independent contractor. In SeaBright the delegation was found to be implicit in the agreement between US Airways and Aubry. The prudent business using an independent contractor should consider making the delegation of the duty to be explicit and contained in the contract to avoid unnecessary litigation from workers’ compensation insurers and the employees of the independent contractor. 

Of course, US Airways, and anyone using an independent contractor, cannot delegate the duty for injuries to its own employees. That type of risk shifting can be accomplished with a well written indemnity agreement and/or a requirement that the independent contractor makes the person hiring it to become an insured of the independent contractor’s policy of liability insurance which includes insurance to fulfill the indemnity agreements.

 Insurer Wins 
 Posted on August 23, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
On June 14, 2011, Limor Lehavi ( llehavi@archernorris.com ), a partner with Archer Norris PLC in Newport Beach, California, along with partner Kevin L. Place, obtained a unanimous 12-0 jury defense verdict for an insurance company in an insurance bad faith case in San Bernardino Superior Court, California. Barry Zalma ( zalma@zalma.com ) of Zalma Insurance Consultants in Culver City, California, testified as an expert witness on behalf of the insurer.

The case, Joel P. Todd and Yojana V. Todd v. Coast National Insurance Company, Inc, et al, case no. CIVSS 801883, involved the claimed theft of a Chevrolet Trailblazer. The claim was denied by Coast National based on advice of counsel on the grounds that plaintiffs violated the policy’s misrepresentation and concealment clause. The car was found after it was reported stolen on the freeway in the direction of the plaintiffs’ home with heavy collision damage on the passenger’s side, but no parts missing and no evidence of forced entry or ignition tampering. A forensic exam concluded that the car was last driven with a properly cut key. Statements of the plaintiffs’ family members differed on key facts, such as what time they were each home before the car was discovered stolen, where the keys were kept, and the activities of the various family members. One of the plaintiffs’ family members was an excluded driver on the policy, yet admitted to driving some of the family cars. Plaintiffs argued that the insurer conducted a biased and harassing investigation which focused only on facts that supported denial of the claim, which was unreasonably denied based solely on circumstantial evidence. Complicating matters, plaintiff Joel Todd had just returned from active duty in Iraq, and argued that the handling and denial of the claim severely exacerbated the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his combat experiences in Iraq.

Ms. Lehavi p ersuaded the jury that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to prove the Trailblazer was stolen. Further, Mr. Zalma testified and Ms. Lehavi argued that the decision to deny was correct because Coast National followed the custom and practice of automobile material damage insurance practices, completed a thorough and exhaustive investigation, acted in good faith and dealt fairly with the plaintiffs.

The jury agreed.

 WHO GOT CAUGHT 
 Posted on August 22, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Recent Convictions for Insurance Fraud 

The following are some stories of convictions for insurance fraud across the country that will be published in the September 1, 2011 issue of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter .

 Six Months for Creating Fake Claims 

Pamela Carpenter, of Charleston, West Virginia, a former Wells Fargo Third Party Administrators employee was sentenced to six months in prison for fabricating insurance claims for corporate clients.

Carpenter had pleaded guilty to wire-fraud charges stemming from her creating 28 bogus medical insurance claims for various policyholders. U.S. District Judge John Copenhaver on August 15, 2011 also sentenced her to six months on home confinement and ordered her to pay nearly $50,000 in restitution – the amount Wells Fargo lost in the scheme.

Carpenter was responsible for managing claims accounts for two of Wells Fargo’s business clients. She recruited others at the company’s third-party administrator branch in North Carolina to cash claims checks that she had intercepted and mailed to them. Her accomplices shared the proceeds.

 One Year for B.P. Spill Fraud 

Nicholas Billiot of Houma, Louisiana man was sentenced to one year in prison for fraudulently receiving money from the $20 billion claims fund that BP PLC established after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey also on August 16, 2011 ordered the 25-year-old Billiot to pay $26,000 in restitution to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility. 

Billiot pleaded guilty in June to one count of mail fraud.

Federal prosecutors say the GCCF issued $26,000 in checks to Billiot, who claimed he owned a company called Hope’s Home Improvement that lost business after last year’s Deepwater Horizon rig blast triggered the massive spill. Prosecutors say the company never operated or conducted any business.

 UK Broker Pleads Guilty of Issuing Fake Policies 

Clive Hesketh, 47, from Tottington, Bury, United Kingdom is an insurance broker facing jail after admitting to duping local firms by issuing fake professional indemnity (PI) polices and certificates of more than £90,000 between January 2010 and October 2010. Hesketh pleaded guilty to 11 counts of false representation when he appeared before Bury magistrates on Monday, August 15, 2011. He opted for Travelers as one of the names to use on the fraudulent documents, although the insurer had nothing at all to do with the broker’s trickery.

A Travelers spokesman told Insurance Times that “Travelers has nev er had a business association with the broker in question.”The Bury broker was arrested over fraud last month after police received reports of fraudulent activity on June 30.
Hesketh is due to be sentenced at Bolton Crown Court on September 15.

 Lawyer Pleads No Contest to Insurance Fraud – Probation&amp;Restitution Only 

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones announced August 19, 2011 that Susana Ragos Chung, 60, a Los Angeles area based attorney has been sentenced in Alameda Superior Court for Insurance Fraud. Chung entered pleas of no contest on two felony counts for violations of Section 549 of the Penal Code, recklessly submitting fraudulent insurance claims. She was sentenced to five years formal probation and to also pay $117,561 in restitution to insurance companies for 15 separate fraudulent claims. In addition, she was ordered to pay $235,123 to the state restitution fund. Chung agreed to place herself on inactive status with the California State Bar pending its mandatory investigation into her criminal conduct, which may result in her disbarment. 

In August 2003, the California Department of Insurance (CDI), Benicia Regional Office, Fraud Division, Urban Auto Fraud Task Force initiated an investigation known as“Phantom Menace”into organized automobile insurance fraud in the Bay Area. The Task Force included Investigators from the California Highway Patrol, and Alameda and San Francisco County District Attorney’s Offices. As a result of the information and evidence gathered by the Task Force CDI began an undercover investigation in July 2004, which included contacting numerous auto body shops, medical offices and law offices.

Task force members were able to infiltrate a sophisticated auto fraud organized crime ring operating in the Bay Area. This ring was working with law offices in the Los Angeles area. One of these law offices was owned and operated by Chung. In November 2004, task force members acting in undercover capacities were solicited to participate in staged collisions. Numerous collisions were staged and undercover officers were referred to auto body repair shops, medical offices and law offices in an effort to file false automobile insurance claims and secure substantial bodily injury claim settlements.

 Between 2003 and 2007, Chung participated in this fraud ring by submitting insurance claims for suspects who staged these collisions for profit. Chung represented the claimants who were allegedly“injured”in these fake collisions. The majority of the people she represented never met her, and many did not even know they had an attorney. Nearly 100 people have been convicted in Alameda County over the last several years as part of this conspiracy, including more than 90 staged collision participants, and three chiropractors. The majority of the participants in these staged collisions readily admitted to law enforcement that no accident had ever occurred.

I understand that California jails are crowded and criminals are being let loose to ease the crowding but running a major fraud ring, in the opinion of ZIFL, requires some real jail time and seizure of the guilty lawyer’s assets. Mr. Jones should not be bragging about this result he should be complaining that the court is being too kind.

 Ex-Insurance Agent Gets Six Years in NJ State Prison 

Daniel J. Trolaro, of Oakland, N.J., a former insurance agent was sentenced to six years in state prison for defrauding nine clients out of more than $1.9 million, state law enforcement officials said. 

Trolaro was a licensed insurance producer, securities dealer and certified financial planner working for Prudential Insurance Company of America’s West Essex Agency in East Hanover, N.J.  Superior Court Judge Thomas V. Manahan in Morris County sentenced Trolaro to six years in jail, and also ordered him to pay Prudential Insurance Co. $2 million and pay $75,000 in restitution.

As part of a plea agreement, Trolaro admitted he stole the money from clients between June 4, 2008, and Feb. 12, 2010. The amounts stolen from clients ranged from $46,000 to $910,000, according to Acting Insurance Fraud Prosecutor Ronald Chillemi. Trolaro was supposed to invest the money on behalf of his clients, but he instead used most of it for online gambling, authorities said.

After discovering the fraud, Prudential fired Trolaro and referred the matter to the Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor for further investigation. Prudential has repaid all of the victims that sought restitution.

Prudential learned the hard way that it is prudent to audit the work of their agents. Prudential would have spent less than $1.9 million performing the audits and would have protected many of its clients whose agents have not yet been caught.

 Plaintiff May Only Recover for Damages Incurred 
 Posted on August 19, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 What Took So Long ?

 Until the California Supreme Court ruled on August 18, 2011, injured plaintiffs would present into evidence medical bills they were never required to pay. Rather, the invoiced amount were reduced by contracts between the plaintiff’s health insurer and the medical provider that were much less than that billed. As a result the jury was presented with inflated amounts of medical expenses and, as a result, inflated the general as well as the special damages awarded to the plaintiff.

The California Supreme Court resolved the problem in Rebecca Howell v. Hamilton Meats&amp;Provisions , No. S179115 (Cal. 08/18/2011) by finding the plaintiff can only recover damages actually incurred. The Supreme Court based its decision on the fact that when a tortiously injured person receives medical care for his or her injuries, the provider of that care often accepts as full payment, pursuant to a pre-existing contract with the injured person’s health insurer, an amount less than that stated in the provider’s bill. 

In that circumstance, the Supreme Court answered that the injured person may not recover from the tortfeasor, as economic damages for past medical expenses, the undiscounted sum stated in the provider’s bill but never paid by or on behalf of the injured person. The Supreme Court concluded that the injured plaintiff did not suffer any economic loss in that amount and could not recover what was not lost.

 THE COLLATERAL SOURCE RULE 

The collateral source rule, which precludes deduction of compensation the plaintiff has received from sources independent of the tortfeasor from damages the plaintiff“would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor”ensures that plaintiff here may recover in damages the amounts her insurer paid for her medical care. The rule, however, has no bearing on amounts that were included in a provider’s bill but for which the plaintiff never incurred liability because the provider, by prior agreement, accepted a lesser amount as full payment. Such sums are not damages the plaintiff would otherwise have collected from the defendant. They are neither paid to the providers on the plaintiff’s behalf nor paid to the plaintiff in indemnity of his or her expenses. Because they do not represent an economic loss for the plaintiff, they are not recoverable in the first instance. The collateral source rule precludes certain deductions against otherwise recoverable damages, but does not expand the scope of economic damages to include expenses the plaintiff never incurred.

 FACTS 

 Plaintiff Rebecca Howell was seriously injured in an automobile accident negligently caused by a driver for defendant Hamilton Meats&amp;Provisions, Inc. (Hamilton). At trial, Hamilton conceded liability and the necessity of the medical treatment plaintiff had received, contesting only the amounts of plaintiff’s economic and non-economic damages.

 DISCUSSION 

The Restatement of Torts reflects the widely held view that the collateral source rule applies to gratuitous payments and services.  As plaintiff herself explains, hospitals and medical groups obtain commercial benefits from their agreements with health insurance organizations; the agreements guarantee the providers prompt payment of the agreed rates and often have financial incentives for plan members to choose the providers’services. 

The California Supreme Court disagreed with the Restatement and concluded the negotiated rate differential is not a collateral payment or benefit subject to the collateral source rule. However, it emphasized that the rule applies with full force to sources that fit the rule. Plaintiff recovered the amounts paid on her behalf by her health insurer as well as her own out-of-pocket expenses. Plaintiff received the benefits of the health insurance for which she paid premiums. Her medical expenses have been paid per the policy and those payments are not deducted from her tort recovery.

Plaintiff’s insurance premiums contractually guaranteed payment of her medical expenses at rates negotiated by the insurer with the providers; they did not guarantee payment of much higher rates the insurer never agreed to pay. Indeed, had her insurer not negotiated discounts from medical providers, plaintiff’s premiums presumably would have been higher, not lower. Recovery of the amount the medical provider agreed to accept from the insurer in full payment of her care, but no more, thus ensures plaintiff receives the benefits of her thrift and the tortfeasor does not garner the benefits of his victim’s providence.

 FORTUITY 

 There is an element of fortuity to the compensatory damages the defendant pays under the rule articulated by the Supreme Court. A tortfeasor who injures a member of a managed care organization may pay less in compensation for medical expenses than one who inflicts the same injury on an uninsured person treated at a hospital (assuming the hospital does not offer the person a discount from its chargemaster prices). But, as defendant noted,“[f]ortuity is a fact in life and litigation.”The California Supreme Court refused to order one defendant to pay damages for an economic loss the plaintiff has not suffered merely because a different defendant may have to compensate a different plaintiff who has actually suffered such a loss by being billed full price by a hospital.

 AVAILABLE REMEDY 

Where a trial jury has heard evidence of the amount accepted as full payment by the medical provider but has awarded a greater sum as damages for past medical expenses, the defendant may move for a new trial on grounds of excessive damages. The trial court, if it grants the new trial motion, may permit the plaintiff to choose between accepting reduced damages or undertaking a new trial. 

In Ms. Howell’s case the trial court correctly ruled plaintiff could recover as damages for her past medical expenses no more than her medical providers had accepted as payment in full from plaintiff and PacifiCare, her insurer. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the Court of Appeal to, as appropriate, consider any remaining issues regarding the procedures and evidence on which the trial court ordered the damages reduced.

 LESSON 

California has finally stepped away from a technique that allowed plaintiffs to recover more than they were entitled to recover for economic as well as general damages.

 When I was a young adjuster most bodily injury claims were evaluated by payment of the special or economic damages and by a multiplier of the economic damages to reach an appropriate amount to compensate the claimant for trouble and inconvenience or pain and suffering. If the amount of economic damages is inflated by using amounts billed rather than amounts agreed to accept as payment in full the general damages amount was unconscionably and improperly inflated. Many plaintiffs would have a deal with the provider to bill twice the amount agreed for the service and share the inflated recovery.

This decision will result in verdicts and settlements that are more fair and not inflated by medical bills not actually incurred. It will, as a result of allowing evidence of that actually incurred rather than that billed, will go a long way to eliminate a great deal of fraud.

Claims handlers and defense counsel should not accept invoices and billings from medical providers as gospel but should determine the amount the provider has agreed to accept as payment in full. Failure to do so will cost the defendant and the defendant’s insurer more than fair and reasonable.

 DEFECT IN ILLINOIS CAN BE AN OCCURRENCE 
 Posted on August 19, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Fail to Defend at Your Peril 

 Insurance companies are loathe to defend insureds who are accused of defective construction since CGL policies are only intended to protect the insured from liability for injury or damage to the persons or property of others. CGL policies are not intended to pay the costs associated with repairing or replacing the insured’s defective work and products, which are purely economic losses. Finding coverage for the cost of replacing or repairing defective work would transform the policy into something akin to a performance bond and allow a negligent builder to profit from his negligence.  However, the duty to defend is very broad and if there is a potential for coverage a defense must be provided.

In Milwaukee Mutual Insurance Company, Insurance Company v. J.P. Larsen, Inc, 2011 IL App 101316 (Ill.App. Dist.1 08/15/2011), an Illinois court of appeals found that Milwaukee Mutual Insurance Company, n/k/a Milwaukee Insurance Company (Milwaukee), appealed the trial court’s order denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of defendant, J.P. Larsen, Inc. (Larsen). Milwaukee contended the trial court erred in finding the underlying pleadings sufficiently established Milwaukee had a duty to defend Larsen in a third-party action.
 
 FACTS 
 
Milwaukee provided Larsen with commercial general liability(CGL) insurance and umbrella insurance. In March 2003, Weather-Tite, Inc. (Weather-Tite), hired Larsen as a subcontractor to apply sealant to windows installed by Weather-Tite in a condominium building called Prairie District Homes Association (PDH). The windows subsequently leaked and caused water damage.

On July 29, 2008, PDH sued Weather-Tite for breach of express and implied warranties. On April 23, 2009, Weather-Tite filed a third-party complaint against Larsen alleging that, in the event the PDH was successful with its breach of warranty claims, Larsen was liable for contribution as a joint tortfeasor and also alleging Larsen was in breach of contract for failing to add Weather-Tite as an additional insured to its CGL policy.

Weather-Tite and Larsen both asked Milwaukee to defend the PDH suit. Milwaukee denied both defense tenders, finding there was no coverage under the CGL policy where the complaints alleged only construction defects and not“property damage”or an“occurrence”within the terms of the policy.

On June 25, 2009, Milwaukee filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Weather-Tite and Larsen to determine the parties’rights under the CGL policy. Milwaukee filed a motion for summary judgment, and Weather-Tite and Larsen both filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On March 30, 2010, the trial court entered an order granting Milwaukee’s summary judgment motion as to Weather-Tite, but denying Milwaukee’s summary judgment motion as to Larsen. The trial court granted Larsen’s cross-motion for summary judgment against Milwaukee.

Turning to the substance of the pleadings, the third amended verified complaint filed by PDH contained two counts against Weather-Tite, breach of the implied warranties of habitability and workmanship and breach of an express warranty.
 
 ANALYSIS 

 The construction of an insurance policy is a question of law. In construing the terms of an insurance policy, it is the court’s goal and obligation to give effect to the intent of the contracting parties by relying on the language used in the signed contract. The court must construe an insurance policy as a whole, using the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms to give effect to every provision.
 
Milwaukee contends the trial court erred in finding it had a duty to defend Larsen under the parties’CGL policy where the underlying pleadings failed to allege damages within the policy’s coverage.

The CGL policy issued by Milwaukee to Larsen provided:“We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of‘bodily injury’or‘property damage’to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any‘suit’seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any‘suit’seeking damages for‘bodily injury’or‘property damage’to which this insurance does not apply. We may at our discretion, investigate any‘occurrence’and settle any claim or‘suit’that may result.”

The CGL policy limited coverage to“property damage”that was“caused by an‘occurrence’that takes place in the coverage territory”and“occurs during the policy period.”“Property damage”was defined by the policy as: (1)“physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it”;or (2)“[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the‘occurrence’that caused it.”“Occurrence”was defined by the policy as“an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.”

In order to determine whether Milwaukee Mutual has a duty to defend Larsen, the court was called upon to ascertain whether the underlying pleadings alleged facts demonstrating“property damage”resulting from an“occurrence”within, or potentially within, the terms of the CGL policy.“Property damage”was defined in the CGL policy as“physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or [l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the‘occurrence’that caused it.”

To the average, ordinary person, tangible property suffers a physical injury when the property is altered in appearance, shape, color or in other material dimension. Conversely, to the average mind, tangible property does not experience physical injury if that property suffers intangible damage, such as diminution in value as a result from the failure of a component to function as promised.

 CGL PURPOSE 

CGL policies are intended to protect the insured from liability for injury or damage to the persons or property of others; they are not intended to pay the costs associated with repairing or replacing the insured’s defective work and products, which are purely economic losses. Finding coverage for the cost of replacing or repairing defective work would transform the policy into something akin to a performance bond.  If insurance proceeds could be used for damages from defective workmanship, a contractor could be initially paid by the customer for its work and then by the insurance company to repair or replace the work. Treati ng a CGL policy like a performance bond would be unjust to the CGL insurer, which, in contrast to the surety on a performance bond, cannot bring suit against the contractor for the defective construction. [ Stoneridge Development Co. v. Essex Insurance Co ., 382 Ill. App. 3d 731, 752, 888 N.E.2d 633 (2008) (citing Monticello Insurance Co. v. Wil-Freds Construction, Inc ., 277 Ill. App. 3d 697, 709, 661 N.E.2d 451 (1996)]

In its third amended verified complaint, the PDH Association alleged that, due to faulty construction, the condominium common elements, individual units and unit owners’personal property were damaged. The complaint further stated that“apart from the property damage, the Association will have to make repairs to correct the design and/or construction defects ”(emphasis added) in the amount of $4 million to $8 million.

Although the damages to the common elements, individual units and personal property were not expressly described, the Court of Appeals construed the pleadings, as it must, liberally to allow for coverage, or, at least, the potential for coverage.

The damages alleged are not merely construction defects, which would constitute economic losses not covered under the CGL policy. The costs described for the construction defects were between $4 million and $8 million. The costs associated with the“property damage”suffered by the individual unit owners was in addition to that sum, according to the complaint. The damages alleged are not intangible or merely associated with the repair or replacement of the faulty window caulking and sealant.

Although a pleading is identified as a cause of action for contribution, the allegations of the pleading control over its form. The Allegations against Larsen sounded in negligence. The court noted that the factual allegations of the complaint, rather than the legal theory under which the action is brought, determine whether there is a duty to defend.  Moreover allegations based in contract have resulted in duties to defend as long as the damage is not to the actual property the insured was working on but, rather, is to other property caused by the insured’s work product.

As a result the court of appeals concluded the pleadings alleged“property damage”within, or at least potentially within, the definition of the CGL policy.

Milwaukee contended the underlying pleadings do not allege an“occurrence”where the

“defects alleged in the third-party complaint are the natural and ordinary consequence of faulty workmanship, and the resulting damage was not caused by an accident. Illinois courts have repeatedly stated that damage to something other than the project itself does constitute an“occurrence”under a CGL policy.

In its third amended verified complaint, PDH alleged the installation of a faulty window
 Water Damage With Mushrooms 
system resulted“in significant and continuing water leakage into the common elements and residential”units. Moreover, the“property damage”that is, at least possibly, imputed to Larsen through his negligent workmanship included personal property and water damage throughout a building not constructed by Larsen. Therefore, the underlying pleadings alleged that Larsen’s negligent workmanship caused an accident in the form of significant and continuing water leakage. The court of appeals concluded, therefore, that an“occurrence”was pled.
 
 CONCLUSION 
 
Based on our finding that the pleadings alleged facts that bring the cause within, or at least potentially within, the CGL policy’s coverage, Milwaukee has a duty to defend Larsen in the third-party action.

 Eighth Circuit 

Since first posting this I found another case that held, on similar allegations, no occurrence.

In Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. Pella Corporation; Pella Windows and Doors, Inc, No. 10-1933, 10-2065 (8th Cir. 08/18/2011) the Eighth Circuit concluded that two actions against Pella alleged that Pella knew that its windows had a defect that allowed water to leak through the window frame.  In both cases, the property damage-whether to the windows themselves or the structure of the building near the windows-was caused by a defect that Pella was alleged to have known about. Under Iowa law, such defective workmanship, as alleged in the suits, cannot be considered an occurrence, i.e.,“an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event.” Pursell, 596 N.W.2d at 70 (quotation and citation omitted).

Because the suits did not allege an“occurrence,”Liberty Mutual did not owe Pella a duty to reimburse its costs in defending either action. As a result, we need not address Liberty Mutual’s alternative argument that the Pappas Suit did not allege“property damage”apart from the damage to the windows themselves.

The issue will continue to result in different results and we will follow them as often as possible.

 LESSONS 

Although Illinois does not rely on extrinsic facts when deciding an issue of duty to defend but limits its analysis to the four or eight corners of the complaint, before an insurer denies a claim for defense it must understand everything alleged in the complaint and the facts surrounding the complaint. If Milwaukee had carefully read the complaint and had done a thorough investigation it would have learned that there was damage to property not involved in the defective windows but damaged personal property belonging to condominium unit owners as well as other parts of the unit damaged.

The covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires that insurers and their insureds act fairly to allow each to obtain the benefits of the contract of insurance. When an insurer relies solely on one part of a policy and a small part of the pleadings in the complaint, and ignores facts that raise a potential for coverage, it fails to deal fairly with its insured. Milwaukee will defend Larsen as it should and wasted a great deal of money denying coverage and filing a complaint for declaratory relief.

 Insurer Avoids Liability for Agent’s Fraud 
 Posted on August 18, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Contract Between Agent And Insurer 

 The relationship between insurance agents and brokers with insurers is based upon the contract between the insurer and the agent or broker. When the agent or broker breaches the contract with an insurer by defrauding an insured the insurer, unless it directs or ratifies the fraud, has no liability to the insured. In National Western Life Insurance Company v. Sheila Newman , No. 02-10-00133-CV (Tex.App. Dist.2 08/11/2011) National Western Life Insurance Company (National Western) appealed the trial court’s judgment against it for the fraudulent acts of its agent, Lynn Strickland, Jr., upon Shelia Newman. 

 Background Facts 



In late 2005, Newman decided to invest a large amount of her savings. She was uneducated in investing so she researched companies online and chose to purchase an annuity from National Western because“[i]t was a reputable company that had been in business for many years.”Newman called National Western, who told her an agent would contact her.

Soon after, Strickland called Newman and made an appointment to speak with her at her home. Strickland told Newman that if she invested $200,000, she could live off the interest received. He also told her that if she invested that amount, she would receive a $20,000 bonus.  In November 2005, Newman phoned Strickland and agreed to the $200,000 amount. Strickland told her to get two cashier’s checks, one for $75,000 and another for $125,000. He also told Newman to make both checks out to Lone Star Financial“in order for him to be able to handle the money.”Lone Star Financial is owned by Strickland.

In January 2006, Strickland went to Newman’s house, where he gave her a two-page application for the annuity. The first page contained a section for Newman’s personal information, which she filled out. The first page also contained blanks for identifying the type of plan, the beneficiary, and a blank for the amount of money submitted with the application. Newman left the amount blank because Strickland“was in a hurry that day . . . and [she] trusted that he would take care of it.”At the bottom of the first page was the following statement:
 
 I have read the statements above and to the best of my knowledge and belief they are true and correct. Any statement made by either the agent of this application or by any other person shall not be binding on [National Western] unless such statement is reduced to writing by [National Western] and made a part of the annuity contract. I have received and read a copy of the annuity information brochure and understand the features of the plan of insurance applied for. 
 
Evidence at trial showed that, regardless of her signature, she did not read the application because on the application in bold print was the statement,“***ALL CHECKS MUST BE PAYABLE TO NATIONAL WESTERN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY***.”Strickland was also supposed to give Newman a document titled“Consumer Disclosure Signatures.”That document contained the statement that said:
 
 If you have any questions after you receive your annuity Policy, please contact your agent or call National Western’s Customer Service Department at 1-800-922-9422. We want to be sure that you read all 10 pages of this Disclosure and are aware of the benefits and features explained herein. 
 
 Newman’s initials were next to the statement that the policy had been explained to her, and Newman’s and Strickland’s signatures were under the statement that she had received a copy of the Disclosure and had reviewed it with her agent. Newman testified at trial that she did not recall ever seeing the disclosure and that her signature on it was forged.

Strickland kept the $75,000 and  ordered and received from National Western a policy in the amount of $125,000 in favor of Newman. National Western sent Strickland a copy of the insurance policy for him to hand-deliver to Newman but he did not.

Between January 2006 and December 2007, Newman drew on the annuity a number of times. She also received checks from National Western, some that she received in the mail and some that she claims were hand-delivered by Strickland, although they were all addressed to her.

Finally in December 2007, Newman complained to National Western that she never received a copy of her $200,000 policy. National Western told Newman that her policy was only for $125,000. National Western contacted Strickland about Newman’s complaint. He responded that the amount of the annuity Mrs. Newman bought was for $125,000. National Western sent Newman a letter reaffirming receipt of only the $125,000 check, and provided her a copy of the check and another copy of her policy. After Newman’s complaint that she did not receive her policy, National Western terminated Strickland’s contract. Newman demanded that National Western reimburse her $200,000. National Western refused.

Newman filed suit against Strickland and National Western. After striking Strickland’s answer as sanctions for failing to appear at scheduled depositions, the trial court rendered judgment against Strickland, awarding Newman treble damages under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

The jury awarded actual damages of $112,736.49 ($200,000 plus a $20,000 bonus less the amount Newman withdrew on the policy). At the bifurcated punitive damages phase, the jury found clear and convincing evidence that Newman’s damages“resulted from gross negligence”and awarded Newman $150,000,000 in punitive damages. Newman elected to recover for fraud, and the trial court entered judgment on the verdict for the actual damages awarded and prejudgment interest, attorney’s fees, and the punitive damages found by the jury.

 Analysis 

Actual authority for another to act for a party must arise from the party’s agreement that the other act on behalf and for the benefit of the party to act on behalf of National Western. If a party so authorizes another to perform an act, that other party is also authorized to do whatever else is proper, usual, and necessary to perform the act expressly authorized.

Apparent authority exists if a party:

 knowingly permits another to hold himself out as having authority to act on behalf of another, in this case, National Western or, through lack of ordinary care, bestows on another such indications of authority that lead a reasonably prudent person to rely on the apparent existence of authority to act on behalf of [National Western] to his detriment. 

 Only the acts of the party sought to be charged with responsibility for the conduct of another may be considered in determining whether apparent authority of another to act for the party exists. When a person has notice of the limitations of an actor’s authority, then that such person cannot detrimentally rely on the apparent existence of the authority of the actor to act for the party.

The fact that Strickland had authority to act for National Western was never in doubt. National Western and Strickland had a contract that specifically authorized Strickland to procure applications and collect monies on behalf of National Western. National Western claims throughout its argument on appeal that there is no evidence to support any finding that it authorized Strickland’s misdeeds, controlled his fraudulent actions, or ratified his conduct after the fact.

Absent a showing that Strickland had the authority to bind National Western through his actions, or a showing that National Western ratified Strickland’s conduct after the fact, National Western cannot be liable for Strickland’s fraud.

An agent’s authority to act on behalf of a principal depends on some communication by the principal either to the agent (actual or express authority) or to the third party (apparent or implied authority). Actual authority is authority that the principal intentionally confers upon the agent, or intentionally allows the agent to believe he has, or by want of ordinary care allows the agent to believe himself to possess. Apparent authority is based on estoppel, arising either from a principal knowingly permitting an agent to hold himself out as having authority or by a principal’s actions which lack such ordinary care as to clothe the agent with the indicia of authority, thus leading a reasonably prudent person to believe that the agent has the authority he purports to exercise. 

Newman argued that Strickland’s fraudulent acts were incidental to his authorized duties, and thus should be attributable to National Western. As the supreme court has said,“In determining a principal’s vicarious liability, the proper question is not whether the principal authorized the specific wrongful act; if that were the case, principals would seldom be liable for their agents’misconduct.” Celtic Life Ins. Co. v. Coats , 885 S.W.2d 96, 99 (Tex. 1994). Therefore, the proper test for actual authority is whether the agent’s acts were within the course and scope of his agency. If an employee deviates from the performance of his duties for his own purposes, the employer is not responsible for what occurs during that deviation.

Had Strickland performed his duties consistent with his contract after being referred to and meeting with Newman, there would have been no fraud. An entity’s liability must arise from its own injury-causing conduct. The injury-producing event occurred when Strickland convinced Newman to write two checks to his company instead of National Western; sign an application with critical information (i.e., the amount of the policy) left blank; and not to contact National Western with her concerns.

Because National Western did not retain control over those aspects of Strickland’s job that led to Newman’s injury, liability cannot be based on the right to control. The Court of Appeals concluded that, therefore, there is no evidence to support the jury’s findings that Strickland was not an independent contractor and that National Western retained the right to control. The evidence conclusively establishes the opposite.

 The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no evidence that National Western intentionally conferred, or intentionally allowed Strickland to believe, or by want of ordinary care allowed Strickland to believe that he possessed the authority to defraud National Western clients or the company itself. Nor were Strickland’s acts in furtherance of his duties as an agent of National Western.

Since it was undisputed that Newman received the product that National Western received payments for – a $125,000 annuity. Newman testified that she never spoke to anyone at National Western concerning an amount until after Strickland’s fraud was discovered. National Western therefore did not have the full knowledge necessary to establish apparent authority. Further, none of the acts were the cause of Newman’s damages.

The Court of Appeals concluded that Newman was injured because she followed Strickland’s instructions to write two checks to Lone Star Financial, sign an incomplete application, and not contact National Western because they would not have her information. None of these directions may be attributable to National Western because there is no evidence that National Western was aware of them or authorized them. It concluded, therefore, that there was no evidence of any conduct by National Western that would have reasonably led Newman to believe that Strickland was authorized to defraud her.

 LESSONS 

Insurers using agents who are independent contractors should be careful to require the agent to sign a well written contract that clearly establishes the relationship between the agent and the insurer and set forth the duty of each in detail. This case establishes what all insurers know, but not all work to protect themselves against, that some people in the business of insurance are dishonest. The dishonest, like Mr. Strickland, have no qualms about taking money from clients by fraud and will leave the insurer holding the bag for defending a lawsuit for actions that it did not do. 
 

Insurance criminals must be eliminated from the insurance industry. If any facts exist that indicate fraudulent acts by an agent the insurer must move quickly to void that agent’s contract and terminated all relationship with the criminal agent.

To avoid problems like that faced by National Western it would be prudent for every insurer to audit the files of its independent contractor agents and or brokers and its appointed agents. Insurers should also work with their local insurance fraud investigators and prosecutors to see that the criminal agent is prosecuted tot he full extent of the law.

 Ninth Circuit Punts—No Standing to Sue on Obamacare 
 Posted on August 17, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Standing Requires an Actual Injury 

 About the same time the Eleventh Circuit decided that the individual mandate provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010). , also known as“Obamacare,”was unconstitutional the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal punted on a similar suit by finding that the plaintiffs had no standing to bring a suit against the government.

In Steve Baldwin and Pacific Justice v. Kathleen Sebelius, No. 10-56374 (9th Cir. 08/12/2011) Steve Baldwin and the Pacific Justice Institute challenged the constitutionality of the so-called“individual mandate”provision in Obamacare. That provision takes effect in 2014 and requires those who are non-exempt to maintain qualifying health insurance or pay a penalty. Baldwin objected to the provision. The Ninth Circuit noted, however, that Baldwin failed to allege that he did not have qualifying health insurance or that he will not have it in 2014. The Institute also objected but failed to allege that the“individual mandate”applies to it or that it has enough employees to be subject to the analogous“shared employer responsibility”provision.

The district court held that neither had alleged an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing. Baldwin and the Institute appealed the order denying the preliminary injunction which gave the Ninth Circuit jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

Baldwin alleged that he objects to the“individual mandate”and does not consent to being compelled by the Act to maintain health care insurance as Congress lacks authority under Article I of the Constitution to enact such legislation. But an objection of this sort is simply a generalized grievance, for which no standing lies. 

To establish standing a plaintiff must show that he has suffered“injury in fact,”the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. An injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent. It cannot be conjectural or hypothetical.“Particularlized”means the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.

The injury in fact test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured. The Ninth Circuit concluded that Baldwin’s allegations failed to show injury in fact. Baldwin did not allege that he currently lacks qualifying health insurance so that he would be non-compliant when the Act goes into effect. Neither did Baldwin raise a justiciable pre-enforcement challenge to the Act, for he has not established a genuine threat of imminent prosecution as required by the Ninth Circuit. He did not even articulate a concrete plan to be inadequately insured in the future.

 To the extent the Institute challenged the individual mandate, the Ninth Circuit concluded it does not have standing because the provision does not apply to employers. To the extent the Institute challenged the employer shared responsibility provision, the Ninth Circuit does not have standing because it failed to allege it had over 50 employees so that it would be subject to the provision.

Neither Baldwin nor the Institute showed the Ninth Circuit injury in fact, or a genuine threat of prosecution, sufficient to give them standing or make their challenge justiciable.

 Individual Mandate Unconstitutional 
 Posted on August 16, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Doing Nothing Is Not Commerce 

The decision of Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal in State of Florida v. U.S. Dep’t of Health&amp;Human Services, No. 11-11021 (11th Cir. 08/12/2011) finding unconstitutional the  individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act sometimes referred to as“Obamacare”will eventually be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court since different federal courts have reached different decisions about the constitutionality of Obamacare. The Eleventh Circuit, in an opinion that covers 861 paragraphs performed a detailed analysis of the statute and the precedent to fulfill the requirement to deal with a district court decision that found the entirety of Obamacare to be unconstitutional. It affirmed the District Court in part, finding that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but reversed the part of the decision that eliminated the entire statute.

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the mandate was unconstitutional because the government’s position amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual’s existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life. This theory affords no limiting principles in which to confine Congress’s enumerated power.

The reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit with regard to the individual mandate made a part of Obamacare is well reasoned and detailed and will be touched upon only briefly here. Its conclusion, however, damns the reasoning of the U.S. Congress by stating that what:
 
 Congress cannot do under the Commerce Clause is mandate that individuals enter into contracts with private insurance companies for the purchase of an expensive product from the time they are born until the time they die. 
 
Since insurance is nothing more than a contract where the insurer agrees to indemnify another against a contingent or unknown event which must be entered into, like any other contract, freely and without compulsion. Obamacare, however, requires almost every individual residing in the United States (except for some exempted individuals like native Americans and illegal aliens) to buy an insurance policy from private companies or suffer a fine that is imposed but is not enforceable.

It seems to me, and the Eleventh Circuit, that Congress does not have the power to compel an individual to buy an insurance contract from a private corporation any more than it has the right to compel an individual to buy a car when the individual prefers to walk. To do so would void the contract since it was not made freely. As the U. S. Supreme Court said in Charles Clarke and Robert P. Clarke, Petitioners, v. The Steamship Elfrida, Pyman, Bell&amp;Co., Claimants , ELFRIDA 19 S. Ct. 146, 172 U.S. 186 (U.S. 12/12/1898) a contract entered into under compulsion is not enforceable. See also 1 Parsons on Cont. 319; DUNCAN v. HENSLEY , 248 Ark. 1083, 455 S.W.2d 113 (Ark. 06/15/1970); or Ricketts v. Waller , 81 F.2d 977 (8th Cir. 02/03/1936) among others.

 The Factual Setting 

Soon after Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), amended by Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“HCERA”), Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (the“Act”), the plaintiffs brought this action challenging the Act’s constitutionality. The plaintiffs are 26 states, private individuals Mary Brown and Kaj Ahlburg, and the National Federation of Independent Business (“NFIB”) (collectively the“plaintiffs”). The defendants are the federal Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Treasury, and Labor Departments and their Secretaries (collectively the“government”).

 THE DECISION CONCERNING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE 

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the individual mandate exceeds Congress’s commerce power. The reasoning of the court follows:

 First Principles 

As the Supreme Court has observed, the judicial authority to determine the constitutionality of laws, in cases and controversies, is based on the premise that the powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.

The judiciary is called upon not only to interpret the laws, but at times to enforce the Constitution’s limits on the power of Congress, even when that power is used to address an intractable problem.

In enforcing these limits, the Eleventh Circuit recognized that the Constitution established a federal government that is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers.  The power to regulate commerce is the power  to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. As the Supreme Court instructs:“The power of Congress in this field is broad and sweeping; where it keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere.” Katzenbach v. McClung , 379 U.S. 294, 305, 85 S. Ct. 377, 384 (1964).

It is because of the breadth and depth of this power that even when the Supreme Court has blessed Congress’s most expansive invocations of the Commerce Clause, it has done so with a word of warning that the power may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, that would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government.

While the substantial growth and development of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause has been well-documented, the Court has often reiterated that the power therein granted remains“subject to outer limits.”When Congress oversteps those outer limits, the Constitution requires judicial engagement, not judicial abdication.

The parties contend that the answer to the question of the individual mandate’s constitutionality is straightforward. The government emphasized that Congress intended to regulate the health insurance and health care markets to ameliorate the cost-shifting problem created by individuals who forego insurance yet at some time in the future seek health care for which they cannot pay. One of the tools Congress employed to solve that problem is an economic mandate requiring Americans to purchase and continuously maintain health insurance.

The plaintiffs responded that the plain text of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent support the conclusion that“activity”is a prerequisite to valid congressional regulation under the commerce power. The plaintiffs stress that Congress’s authority is to“regulate”commerce, not to compel individuals to enter into commerce so that the federal government may regulate them. The plaintiffs point out that by choosing not to purchase insurance, the uninsured are outside the stream of commerce. Indeed, the nature of the conduct is marked by the absence of a commercial transaction. Since they are not engaged in commerce, or activities associated with commerce, they cannot be regulated pursuant to the Commerce Clause. The plaintiffs emphasized that, in 220 years of constitutional history, Congress has never exercised its commerce power in this manner.

Beginning with the plain language of the text, the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate Commerce. The power to regulate commerce, of course, presupposes that something exists to regulate. 

The uninsured made a decision, either consciously or by default, to direct their financial resources to some other item or need than health insurance. Congress described the activity it sought to regulate as economic and financial decisions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased.  That Congress casts the individual mandate as regulating economic activity is not surprising.  Properly formulated, the Eleventh Circuit perceived the question before it to be whether the federal government can issue a mandate that Americans purchase and maintain health insurance from a private company for the entirety of their lives. These types of purchasing decisions are legion. Every day, Americans decide what products to buy, where to invest or save, and how to pay for future contingencies such as their retirement, their children’s education, and their health care.

The government contended that embedded in the Commerce Clause is the power to override these ordinary decisions and redirect those funds to other purposes. Under this theory, because Americans have money to spend and must inevitably make decisions on where to spend it, the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to direct and compel an individual’s spending in order to further its overarching regulatory goals, such as reducing the number of uninsureds and the amount of uncompensated health care. 

 Unprecedented Nature of the Individual Mandate 

Both parties have cited extensively to previous Supreme Court opinions defining the scope of the Commerce Clause. Economic mandates such as the one contained in the Act are so unprecedented, however, that the government has been unable, either in its briefs or at oral argument, to point this Court to Supreme Court precedent that addresses their constitutionality. Nor does our independent review reveal such a precedent.

The Supreme Court has sustained Congress’s authority to regulate steamboat traffic; trafficking of lottery tickets across state lines; and carrying a woman across state lines for“immoral purposes”. Through the Commerce Clause, Congress may prevent the interstate transportation of liquor; punish an automobile thief who crosses state lines; and prevent diseased herds of cattle from bringing their contagion from Georgia to Florida. In the modern era, the Commerce Clause has been used to regulate labor practices; impose minimum working conditions; limit the production of wheat for home consumption; regulate the terms of insurance contracts; prevent discrimination in hotel accommodations; restaurant services and prevent the home production of marijuana for medical purposes. What the Court has never done is interpret the Commerce Clause to allow Congress to dictate the financial decisions of Americans through an economic mandate. 

Despite the breadth of powers that have been exercised under the Commerce Clause, it is unclear whether the clause would provide a solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a requirement to have health insurance. The fact that Congress has never before exercised this supposed authority is telling. Few powers, if any, could be more attractive to Congress than compelling the purchase of certain products.  Even in the face of a Great Depression, a World War, a Cold War, recessions, oil shocks, inflation, and unemployment, Congress never sought to require the purchase of wheat or war bonds, force a higher savings rate or greater consumption of American goods, or require every American to purchase a more fuel efficient vehicle. Traditionally, Congress has sought to encourage commercial activity it favors while discouraging what it does not. Instead of requiring action, Congress has sought to encourage it. The instances of such encouragement are ubiquitous, but the example of flood insurance provides a particularly relevant illustration of how the individual mandate departs from conventional exercises of congressional power.

Without an“individual mandate,”the flood insurance program has largely been a failure. People living in a flood plain know that even if they do not have insurance, they can count on the virtually guaranteed availability of federal funds. Nevertheless, despite the unpredictability of flooding, the inevitability that floods will strike flood plains, and the cost shifting inherent in uninsured property owners seeking disaster relief funds, Congress has never taken the obvious and expedient step of invoking the power the government now argues it has and forcing all property owners in flood plains to purchase insurance.

Contrast flood insurance with the very few instances of activity in which Congress has compelled Americans to engage solely as a consequence of being citizens living in the United States. Given the attractiveness of the power to compel behavior in order to solve important problems, we find it illuminating that Americans have, historically, been subject only to a limited set of personal mandates: serving on juries, registering for the draft, filing tax returns, and responding to the census.

The Eleventh Circuit held that what matters is the regulated subject matter’s connection to interstate commerce and found that nexus lacking with regard to Obamacare. In fact the court concluded that it is immaterial whether it perceived Congress to be regulating inactivity or a financial decision to forego insurance. Under any framing, the regulated conduct is defined by the absence of both commerce or even the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities-the broad definition of economics in Supreme Court decisions. To connect this conduct to interstate commerce would require a“but-for causal chain”that the Supreme Court has rejected, as it would allow Congress to regulate anything.

 Broad Scope of Congress’s Regulation 

The scope of Congress’s regulation also affects the constitutional inquiry. Indisputably, the health insurance and health care industries involve, and substantially affect, interstate commerce, and Congress can regulate broadly in both those realms. Nonetheless, Congress, in exercising its commerce authority, must be careful not to sweep too broadly by including within the ambit of its regulation activities that bear an insufficient nexus with interstate commerce.

In this regard, the individual mandate’s attempt to reduce the number of the uninsured and correct the cost-shifting problem is woefully overinclusive. The language of the mandate is not tied to those who do not pay for a portion of their health care (i.e., the cost-shifters). It is not even tied to those who consume health care. Rather, the language of the mandate is unlimited, and covers even those who do not enter the health care market at all. Although overinclusiveness may not be fatal for constitutional purposes, the Supreme Court has indicated that it is a factor to be added to the constitutional equation.

Because the Supreme Court’s prior Commerce Clause cases all deal with already-existing activity-not the mere possibility of future activity (in this case, health care consumption) that could implicate interstate commerce-the Court never had to address any temporal aspects of congressional regulation. However, the premise of the government’s position-that most people will, at some point in the future, consume health care-reveals that the individual mandate is even further removed from traditional exercises of Congress’s commerce power.

As the plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument, when the uninsured actually enter the stream of commerce and consume health care, Congress may regulate their activity at the point of consumption. But the individual mandate does not regulate behavior at the point of consumption. Indeed, the language of the individual mandate does not truly regulate“how and when health care is paid for.”It does not even require those who consume health care to pay for it with insurance when doing so. Instead, the language of the individual mandate in fact regulates a related, but different, subject matter:“when health insurance is purchased.”If an individual’s participation in the health care market is uncertain, their participation in the insurance market is even more so. The Eleventh Circuit said:

 “In sum, the individual mandate is breathtaking in its expansive scope.” 

 It regulates those who have not entered the health care market at all. It regulates those who have entered the health care market, but have not entered the insurance market (and have no intention of doing so). It is overinclusive in when it regulates: It conflates those who presently consume health care with those who will not consume health care for many years into the future. 

The government’s position amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual’s existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life. This theory affords no limiting principles in which to confine Congress’s enumerated power.  For example, illegal aliens and other nonresidents are cost-shifters ($8.1 billion, or 18.9% of the $43 billion), but they are exempted from the individual mandate entirely. 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(d)(3). Low-income persons are the largest segment of cost-shifters ($15 billion, or 34.8% of the $43 billion), but they are covered by the Act’s Medicaid expansion or excepted from the mandate penalty.

___________________________________

 Cost Shifters Are Exempt ___________________________________ 

 For example, we harbor few doubts that an individual’s decisions about“marriage, divorce, and child custody,”if aggregated, would have substantial effects on interstate commerce. Yet, the mere fact of an activity’s substantial effects on interstate commerce does not thereby render that activity an appropriate subject for Congress’s plenary commerce authority. At best, the Eleventh Circuit can only say that the uninsured may, at some point in the unforeseeable future, create that cost-shifting consequence. Yet this readily leads to a scenario where we must“pile inference upon inference”to sustain Congress’s legislation, a practice the Supreme Court admonishes us to avoid.

 Areas of Traditional State Concern 

For the individual mandate to be sustained, it must be enacted pursuant to a valid exercise of Article I power. It simply will not suffice to say that, because Congress has regulated broadly in a field, it may regulate in any fashion it pleases. The Constitution supplies Congress with various tools to effectuate its legislative power, but it also denies others.

Insurance qualifies as an area of traditional state regulation. This recognition counsels caution, and supplies reviewing courts with even greater cause for doubt when faced with an unprecedented economic mandate of dubious constitutional status. The health care industry also falls within the sphere of traditional state regulation. A state’s role in safeguarding the health of its citizens is a quintessential component of its sovereign powers.

Congress, the Eleventh Circuit concluded, has hamstrung its own efforts to ensure compliance with the mandate by opting for toothless enforcement mechanisms. Eschewing the IRS’s traditional enforcement tools, the Act waives all criminal penalties for noncompliance and prevents the IRS from using liens or levies to collect the penalty. Thus, to the extent the uninsureds’ability to delay insurance purchases would leave a“gaping hole”in Congress’s efforts to reform the insurance market, Congress has seen fit to bore the hole itself.

 Conclusion 

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the individual mandate contained in the Act exceeds Congress’s enumerated commerce power. This conclusion is limited in scope. The power that Congress has wielded via the Commerce Clause for the life of this country remains undiminished. Congress may regulate commercial actors. It may forbid certain commercial activity. It may enact hundreds of new laws and federally-funded programs, as it has elected to do in this massive 975-page Act. But what Congress cannot do under the Commerce Clause is mandate that individuals enter into contracts with private insurance companies for the purchase of an expensive product from the time they are born until the time they die. 

It cannot be denied that the individual mandate is an unprecedented exercise of congressional power.  Because the Commerce Clause is an enumerated power, the Supreme Court’s decisions all emphasize the need for judicially enforceable limitations on its exercise. The individual mandate embodies no such limitations, at least none recognized by extant Commerce Clause doctrine.

As to the individual mandate provision, however, Congress exceeded its enumerated commerce power.

Excising the individual mandate from the Act does not prevent the remaining provisions from being“fully operative as a law.”In invalidating the entire Act, the district court placed undue emphasis on the Act’s lack of a severability clause.

It is also telling that none of the insurance reforms, including even guaranteed issue and coverage of pre-existing conditions, contain any cross-reference to the individual mandate or make their implementation dependent on the mandate’s continued existence.

Further, the individual mandate exceeds Congress’s enumerated commerce power and is unconstitutional. This economic mandate represents a wholly novel and potentially unbounded assertion of congressional authority:
 
 the ability to compel Americans to purchase an expensive health insurance product they have elected not to buy, and to make them re-purchase that insurance product every month for their entire lives. We have not found any generally applicable, judicially enforceable limiting principle that would permit us to uphold the mandate without obliterating the boundaries inherent in the system of enumerated congressional powers.“Uniqueness”is not a constitutional principle in any antecedent Supreme Court decision. The individual mandate also finds no refuge in the aggregation doctrine, for decisions to abstain from the purchase of a product or service, whatever their cumulative effect, lack a sufficient nexus to commerce. 
 
The individual mandate can be severed from the remainder of the Act’s myriad reforms. The presumption of severability is rooted in notions of judicial restraint and respect for the separation of powers in our constitutional system. The Act’s other provisions remain legally operative after the mandate’s excision, and the high burden needed under Supreme Court precedent to rebut the presumption of severability has not been met.

 No Good Representation Goes Unpunished 
 Posted on August 15, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance Appraiser/Arbitrator&amp;Lawyer At Risk 

 People get seriously upset when an insurance dispute does not provide them that to which they believe they are entitled. Some get angry and yell. Some threaten physical harm. Some sue the insurer. Others sue their own lawyer for failing to provide the result the insured wanted.

This seems especially true in a first party property insurance appraisal. In one case I tried to an appraisal panel the appraiser retained by the insured had promised a multi-million dollar recovery. When all the evidence was presented the two appraisers and the umpire signed a award less than the amount already paid by the insurer an not close to the amounts originally promised. The insureds successfully sued their appraiser and obtained a settlement of more than $1 million from his insurer.

 Appraisal in California is an Arbitration 

An appraisal under a first party property policy issued in California is an arbitration where the appraisers are limited to determining actual cash value and loss. Coverage issues cannot be decided by an appraisal panel unless the parties stipulate to allow the appraisers to resolve issues in excess of the authority provided by the policy. In Pahl&amp;Mccay v. E. Craig Mood y, No. H035365 (Cal.App. Dist.6 08/09/2011) a lawyer obtained an appraisal award on behalf of his clients almost twice the amount the insurer wanted to pay. As a reward for counsel’s excellent results, because it was less than what the insured wanted, he was sued for malpractice.

The trial court agreed with the lawyer that he obtained an excellent result for his clients. The malpractice suit resulted in a verdict in favor of the lawyer. 

 FACTS 

 In 1995, Winston and Elaine Lambert’s house was destroyed by fire. Farmers Insurance Exchange (FIE) agreed that it was obligated to provide coverage for the loss of the Lamberts’house and that the Lamberts’policy provided for“guaranteed replacement costs.”However, FIE and the Lamberts disagreed as to the scope of the term“replacement costs”in the FIE policy. In June 1998, the Lamberts retained Pahl to represent them in their dispute with FIE.

Winston Lambert told Pahl that he had been trained as an“MAI”certified real estate appraiser, and he was very involved as a decision-maker in forming legal strategies in the dispute with FIE. He communicated with Pahl on“a near daily basis,”and, among other things, submitted various definitions of“replacement costs”to Pahl and assisted in the writing of the briefs. In arguing on behalf of the Lamberts, Pahl included the Lamberts’interpretation of“replacement costs,”that is,“‘the cost to construct, at current prices, a building with utility equivalent to the building being appraised, using modern materials and current standards, design and layout.’”Pahl also argued that“replacement cost”included the Lamberts’attorney’s fees and costs for obtaining five variances, the cost of a new foundation, land stabilization costs, and the cost of designing the replacement house according to“contemporary design standards”and using“contemporary materials.”

The Lamberts felt they were entitled to recover from FIE most of the costs they incurred in building their new house, despite the fact that it was very different from the house that burned, in size and in design. FIE took the position that the Lamberts were only entitled to the cost of replacing the burned house with“one of similar kind and quality, with updated material and in conformance with building codes current at the time of rebuilding, essentially a‘stick for a stick’analysis.”According to FIE, there was no coverage for costs associated with obtaining variances, constructing a new foundation, or land stabilization.

The FIE policy provided that if there was a dispute as to the amount of loss, a party could make a demand for an appraisal. Each party would then choose an appraiser, and the appraisers would choose an impartial umpire. The appraisers would set the amount of loss. However, if the appraisers failed to reach an agreement, they would submit their differences to the umpire. A written agreement that was signed by any two members of the panel would then set the amount of loss. 

Pahl explained to the Lamberts various strategies for resolving the dispute with FIE, including mediation, litigation, and arbitration. In April 2000, Winston Lambert sent a letter to Pahl in which he outlined the advantages and disadvantages of mediation and arbitration. Lambert told Pahl that he believed the Lamberts had a much better chance of convincing a judge in Arbitration than a mediator will have of convincing FIE and getting them to concede to the Lamberts demands.

Pahl explained“numerous times”to Winston Lambert that the proceeding would be conducted as an arbitration, that the results would be final and binding, and the scope would include interpretation of the FIE policy. The Lamberts agreed with this strategy because they wanted a final resolution of their claim. The parties also agreed in writing that the arbitration would include interpretation of“replacement costs.”

The opening arbitration brief sought replacement costs of $3,045,258.68, which included the $800,000 that FIE had already paid the Lamberts.

On the first day of the proceeding, Retired Judge Barton Phelps, who was serving as the appraisal proceeding umpire, asked the parties if they had any objection to the two appraisers and the umpire resolving“‘some technical coverage problems, issues involved in determining the claim.’”Neither party had an objection. Winston Lambert never told Pahl that he did not want the appraisers to arbitrate the interpretation of“replacement cost.”

After a nine-day hearing, the Lamberts were awarded $1,212, 280, which was nearly twice as much as the amount advocated by FIE and much less than the Lamberts thought they were owed.

 Frivolous Suits 

 On August 26, 2005, Moody filed a complaint on behalf of the Lamberts against Pahl for professional negligence, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint alleged that Pahl: (1) disregarded the FIE policy and chose an umpire on their behalf who“had never done a replacement cost appraisal as the umpire, and let him control the appraisal process long before the appraisers were to have involved him”; (2) failed to provide the umpire with the actual costs that the Lamberts incurred to rebuild their residence, despite his request that it do so; (3) failed to argue that the Lamberts were entitled to betterment in seeking replacement cost; and (4) failed to argue that Insurance Code section 2071 did not apply to replacement cost policies. It was further alleged that Pahl breached its duties to the Lamberts, and the breach of these duties caused damages in excess of $1,800,000.

Pahl brought a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.
Present Malicious Prosecution Action.

 A Cure For Frivolous Suits 

After receiving a verdict in his behalf lawyer Pahl decided that a defense verdict was not enough.He had been insulted and was the victim of a lawsuit brought, he believed, with malice and with no basis in fact and law. Pahl filed a suit against the lawyer who sued him for malicious prosecution.

E. Craig Moody, Esq., the defendant in the malicious prosecution suit, filed two professional negligence actions against Pahl&amp;McCay (Pahl), which were resolved in favor of Pahl. After Pahl filed a malicious prosecution action against Moody, Moody filed a special motion to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute (California Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16). The trial court denied the motion, and Moody filed a timely appeal. Moody contended that the trial court erred in finding that Pahl met its burden of demonstrating a probability of prevailing on its claim. This discussion will be limited to the insurance matter.

Moody argued that there were multiple bases for liability in the Lambert action. Moody claimed that Pahl“allowed the appraisers, without the Lamberts’agreement, to exceed their authority; and/or that Pahl failed to seek to have the award vacated by the Superior Court once it was clear that the appraisers had exceeded their authority.”When an appellant asserts a point but fails to support it with argument and citations to relevant authority, the court may treat the point as waived. Here, Moody has failed to support this claim with argument or legal authority. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals found the issue was waived. It also found that even assuming that there has been no waiver the claim has no merit. 

Moody claimed Pahl was negligent in failing to seek vacation of the award under Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Superior Court ( 1970) 3 Cal.3d 398. The Court of Appeals found that Jefferson is distinguishable because it upheld an order vacating an appraisal award because the appraisers had exceeded their power by erroneously deciding a question of law. In contrast to Jefferson , the parties agreed that the appraisal panel could decide a question of law. The agreement eliminated the reason for reversal set out in Jefferson. The Court of Appeals noted that since the Lamberts sought the appraisal panel’s determination of a legal issue, that is, which replacement costs were covered under the policy, they were precluded from seeking to vacate the award on this ground.

The arbitration briefs and documents written by Winston Lambert established that Moody knew, or should have known, that the Lambert action against Pahl had no merit. As a result the Court of Appeals concluded that Pahl presented a prima facie showing that Moody pursued the Lambert action without probable cause.

 What is Malice 

 Whether the defendant acted with malice in initiating the underlying civil proceedings is a question of fact that is usually decided by the jury. Malice may not only consist of ill will or hostility toward the malicious prosecution plaintiff, but may also result where the prior suit was instituted primarily for an improper purpose. Malice may range anywhere from open hostility to indifference. Malice may also be inferred from the facts establishing lack of probable cause. If the trial court determines that the prior action was not objectively tenable, the extent of a defendant attorney’s investigation and research may be relevant to the further question of whether or not the attorney acted with malice.

In the present case, though Moody’s declaration states that he“bore no malice whatsoever to the PAHL firm or any of its attorneys,”a trier of fact could reasonably infer that Moody filed and pursed the Lambert actions primarily for an improper purpose. As we have stated, a review of the documents, pleadings, transcripts, and briefs in both the Lambert and Parivash actions have established that the facts upon which Moody relied were false.

Since Pahl met its burden of stating and substantiating a legally sufficient claim of malicious prosecution, the trial court properly denied Moody’s motion to strike the complaint pursuant to section 425.16.

 LESSON 

Insureds and their counsel should never allow fire insurance appraisers to determine coverage issues unless absolutely certain they will rule in their favor that is, in my opinion, something that would only be tried by Nostradamus. If such an agreement seems appropriate counsel should fully explain to the insured the hazards of such a stipulation, that doing so would deprive the insured of having the coverage issues resolved by a judge and jury, and that the results might not be what the insured desires. After completing the advice in writing the attorney should then obtain the approval of the insured client in writing as did Pahl in this case.

Insurance appraisers are usually skilled at determining the amount of loss and most, including a retired judge, are not necessarily knowledgeable about insurance policy interpretation. If the award is less than the insured wants, and grounds exist, counsel should move to set aside the award,  If there is no ground (and they are rare), counsel should advise the insured client why it is best to accept the award, make it a judgment and consider other remedies if still unhappy.

An insured should not sue his, her or their lawyer or appraiser unless it is obvious – that is clear and convincing evidence is available – that will establish that the lawyer or appraiser breached the professional duty and that the breach proximately caused damage. If not, the best option is to take the money and go on to better things like taking an afternoon sunning on the beach.

 Health Insurance Fraud Convictions 
 Posted on August 11, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Health Insurance Fraud Is Profitable 

I have written a regular newsletter on insurance fraud for the last fifteen years reporting on, among other things, those who are convicted of insurance fraud. Some estimates indicate that insurance fraud takes from the health insurance industry, Medicare and Medical over $300 billion every year.

The last issue of Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter, available free at http://www.zalma.com/ZIFL-CURRENT.htm reported on the following health insurance fraud convictions. Read and understand that these are just a few who were actually caught, tried and convicted. Note the major differences between the sentences for the crime.

Minor sentences for millions of profit where most are not caught and those that are caught are seldom convicted and those who are convicted are seldom sent to jail for a long time.

The post today is rather long because I will be gone tomorrow getting to rehearse for my daughter’s wedding on Sunday. I’ll be back Monday

 Why Bother Prosecuting – No Jail For Medicaid Fraud 

 Jianzhu Liang, 51, a Clark County, Nevada who pleaded guilty to Medicaid fraud was sentenced to only 60-days – suspended – and placed her on three years of probation. Liang also was ordered to perform 40 hours of community service and pay $9,220 in restitution after pleading guilty to a gross misdemeanor for intentional failure to maintain adequate records.

The case was investigated and prosecuted by the attorney general’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.

In 2010, Nevada Medicaid gave information to the fraud control unit that Liang was suspected of not providing personal care services to a Medicaid recipient despite continuing to receive payment from Medicaid. Medicaid has a personal-care assistant program to keep people living independently by providing basic services, including bathing, dressing, cleaning and meal preparation.

Liang was employed by a home-care company to provide day-to-day care for two recipients. It was discovered that Liang failed to provide care for the patients, yet claimed she performed the services and received payment as if she had done her work.

 19  Month Sentence For Medicaid Fraud 

Barbara Kashuba was sentenced to 19 months in prison for Medicaid fraud following sentencing in July 2011 in a case that involved her husband, Kenneth Kashuba, and his cousin, John. Barbara received the same sentence as her husband on 37 counts of fraud, including making false claims to Medicaid, theft I and unlawful use of food stamps.
According to Oregon Department of Justice spokesperson Kate Medema, trying the Stanfield couple separately reinforces the verdict, as the Kashubas were found guilty by two separate juries. The several dozen charges filed against the three stemmed from claims regarding John Kashuba’s health. Kenneth and Barbara Kashuba filed for Medicaid money, claiming they were providing care for John Kashuba, who suffered severe medical conditions, leaving him unable to walk or drive, among other things.

John Kashuba received a probation of five years for his part in the scam. The reduced sentence was due to his poor health, according to Judge Lynn Hampton. Kenneth and Barbara both received 19 months in prison, along with three years post-prison supervision. All three will face $77,520 in fines.

 Feds Recommend Only One Year for Doctor After Plea of Guilty to $1 Million Medicare Fraud 

 Glen R. Justice, by his actions caused federal prosecutors to change their recommendation for probation for oncologist Justice. Now the prosecutors say he should serve a year in prison because he continued to commit insurance fraud after agreeing to plead guilty. Justice, 66, is scheduled to be sentenced at 9 a.m. Monday by Judge Cormac Carney at the Ronald Reagan federal courthouse in Santa Ana, California. In May 2010, Justice pleaded guilty to defrauding Medicare and private insurers of up to $1 million from 2004 to 2009.

Justice, who lives in Corona del Mar, was the director of the cancer center at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley. He also owned and operated Pacific Coast Hematology/Oncology Medical Group, which is where the billing fraud took place. According to court papers filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannie Joseph, Justice signed the plea agreement March 15, 2010. In it, prosecutors agreed to recommend probation and Justice agreed to pay restitution. However, the documents say Justice worked into April and continued to bill health insurers for injectable cancer drugs that were not provided to patients.

The papers say the government initially recommended probation because of Justice’s exemplary contributions to the community and his otherwise law abiding life. But now prosecutors say that if the judge finds Justice breached his plea agreement, a prison sentence would “reflect the seriousness of the offense,” given that Justice was “continuing his fraudulent billing, not only after execution of a search warrant at his office, but after he negotiated and signed a plea agreement.”

Justice also faces discipline from the California Medical Board, which is seeking to revoke his license to practice.

 Pharmacist Guilty of Medicaid Fraud 

Ernest McGee, a Boston, MA pharmacist has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud Medicaid of more than $204,000 by submitting false claims to the federally funded program. Prosecutors alleged the 40-year-old McGee, an assistant pharmacist at Codman Square Pharmacy in Dorchester, worked with pharmacy owner Amadiegwu Onujiogu in the scheme. They allegedly paid customers to bring physician-signed prescriptions to the pharmacy and charged Medicaid for those prescriptions, but did not dispense the medications to the customers.

Prosecutors say the two solicited and paid cash for prescriptions from particularly downtrodden customers such as the homeless, AIDS patients, and drug addicts. Onujiogu pleaded guilty last month and was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. McGee is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 25.

 Connecticut Chiropractor Pleads Guilty To Health Insurance Fraud 

Jennifer A. Netter, a 38-year-old chiropractor who practices in Bridgeport and lives in Danbury, CT, a local chiropractor became the latest health professional to plead guilty in an automobile accident fraud that federal investigators now believe may have cost insurance companies and the state “millions of dollars.” Netter pleaded guilty in July to conspiring to make false statements by exaggerating injuries and ordering unnecessary treatments for auto accident victims.

 The chiropractor, a 2000 graduate of the University of Bridgeport’s College of Chiropractic, was released on a non-surety bond. Netter, who is pregnant, allowed her chiropractor’s license to become inactive on Sept. 30, 2010.

At least 500 claims were made.

Netter, who lives in Danbury, is the third medical professional to plead guilty in the scandal. Francisco R. Carbone, a 54-year-old former Bridgeport doctor and psychiatrist pleaded guilty Tuesday to four federal charges relating to the scam. Dr. James W. Marshall, who operates Immediate Medical Care on Main Street in Monroe pleaded guilty to illegally writing prescriptions at Carbone’s request for narcotic painkillers to patients he never saw.

The probe is continuing, and an unnamed Bridgeport lawyer and chiropractor are being investigated.

Netter’s actions cost insurers and the state at least $110,000. Court documents claim the scam involved a Bridgeport attorney, whose personal injury clients were receiving some form of state aid. As part of the conspiracy, the attorney sent clients to the chiropractor’s offices for treatment. Carbone, whose license to practice medicine was pulled by the state in 2005, would recommend narcotic pain killers, which Marshall prescribed, and required the patients to undergo nerve conduction velocity testing at a diagnostic testing center owned by an unnamed chiropractor. Each of these tests cost $2,000. After the lengthy treatments were completed, Carbone would author the final medical reports claiming the patients suffered permanent partial disabilities in the accidents. The attorney would then use the reports in obtaining settlements from insurers including Travelers, Metropolitan, Geico and Progressive.

Since many of the patients were receiving state aid, Connecticut was allowed to seek as much as 50 percent of the settlement. However, documents claim the lawyer, the chiropractor and Carbone would inflate their costs to reduce the amount of money the state could receive.

 Guilty of $25 Million Health Insurance Fraud 

Vicente Guerra-Nistal, 54, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Joan A. Lenard in Miami to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud.  Guerra was charged in a February 2011 indictment.  According to plea documents, Guerra was a patient recruiter for ABC Home Health Care Inc.  ABC was a Miami home health care agency that purported to provide home health and physical therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries. 

According to court documents, ABC was operated for the purpose of billing the Medicare program for expensive physical therapy and home health care services that were medically unnecessary and/or were never provided.  Court documents allege that the medically unnecessary services were prescribed by doctors, including Jose Nunez, M.D., and Francisco Gonzalez, M.D.  Nunez and Gonzalez were also charged in the February 2011 indictment along with Guerra, and 18 other co-conspirators.

According to court documents, beginning in approximately January 2006, and continuing until approximately March 2009, Guerra offered and paid kickbacks and bribes to Medicare beneficiaries in return for those beneficiaries allowing ABC to bill Medicare for home health care and therapy services that were medically unnecessary and/or never provided.   Guerra was paid kickbacks and bribes by the owners of ABC in return for recruiting the Medicare beneficiaries to ABC.  Guerra admitted that he knew the patients he recruited for ABC did not qualify for the services that ABC billed to Medicare.   In addition, Guerra knew that the patient files for his recruited patients were falsified in order to make it appear that the patients qualified for home health care and therapy services so that Medicare could be billed for medically unnecessary services.

As a result of Guerra’s participation in the illegal scheme, the Medicare program was billed approximately $194,000 for purported home health care services that were medically unnecessary and/or were never provided. Sentencing has been scheduled for Oct. 17, 2011.

The charge of conspiracy to commit health care fraud carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.   The defendant also face fines and terms of supervised release, as well as forfeiture of any property or proceeds derived from his criminal activities.

Co-defendants Lisandra Alonso and Luisa Morciego pleaded guilty for their roles in the fraud scheme on July 13, 2011.   Drs. Nunez and Gonzalez are scheduled to begin trial on Oct. 10, 2011.   An indictment is merely a charge and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

Since their inception in March 2007, Medicare Fraud Strike Force operations in nine locations have charged more than 1,000 defendants who collectively have falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $2.3 billion. In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.

 Washington Lets Fraud Bilk Taxpayers 

Forbes Magazine published an article titled: “Why Washington Lets Medicare and Medicaid Fraudsters Bilk Taxpayers of Trillions” at http://blogs.forbes.com/aroy/2011/07/21/why-washington-lets-medicare-and-medicaid-fraudsters-bilk-taxpayers-of-trillions/?partner=alerts. By stating the obvious the author explains that by “giving seniors more control over their own health dollars, and giving private insurers the competitive incentive to monitor wasteful medical consumption, fraud will drastically shrink, because seniors and insurers will stand to profit—oh no!—by addressing these problems.”

 Four Years in Prison for Wheelchair Fraud in Louisiana 

 Thompson W. Chinwoh, a Baton Rouge businessman has been sentenced to four years in federal prison in a scheme that defrauded Medicare of $878,280. Chinwoh’s attorney asked U.S. District Judge James J. Brady to consider a sentence of probation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan A. Stevens argued for a prison term of nearly seven years. Chinwoh’s business partner, Samuel B. Johnson was earlier sentenced to five years in prison.

Chinwoh worked with Johnson at their Medical Supplies of Baton Rouge Inc.
Both men admitted they defrauded Medicare by submitting bogus bills for power wheelchairs and other medical equipment that either had not been prescribed by physicians or were never delivered to patients.

 Five to NJ State Prison for Health Care Fraud 

Brian Kelly, 50, Lauren Cardinale, 29, Mark Cerello, 28, Joseph Burkhart, 51 and Orlando Rosario, 47, five New Jerseyans were sentenced to state prison on Monday as members of a Jersey City-based drug ring that trafficked prescription pain pills in Hudson, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Bergen counties.

The five, each of whom pleaded guilty in 2010, were sentenced by state Superior Court Judge Kevin G. Callahan in Jersey City. Kelly of Hoboken, was sentenced to six years, including three years of parole ineligibility, for distributing Percocet and conspiring to commit health care claims fraud. Cardinale of Union City was sentenced to three years for distributing Percocet and conspiring to commit health care claims fraud. Cerello of North Bergen was sentenced to five years, including 20 months of parole ineligibility, for distributing OxyContin. Burkhart of Rutherford was sentenced to five years, including 15 months of parole ineligibility, for possessing and distributing Percocet. Rosario of Jersey City was sentenced to four years for conspiring to distribute OxyContin. 

The leader of the ring, Louis Lisi, 32, of Union City, has pleaded guilty and faces a 24-year prison sentence, including 12 years of parole ineligibility.

According to state Acting Insurance Fraud Prosecutor Chillemi, the five sentenced were charged as a result of Operation MedScam, an investigation by the Jersey City police Special Investigation Unit and the Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. On July 6, Lisi pleaded guilty to leading a narcotics trafficking network, and Clifton Howell, 54, a doctor who had an office in Jersey City, pleaded guilty to health care claims fraud. They are scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 2. Howell faces four years in prison. Another doctor, Magdy Elamir, 58, of Saddle Brook, is scheduled for trial in September in the case.

Since October of 2009, 35 people, including doctors and pharmacists, have been arrested and have pleaded guilty in the joint investigation, which uncovered a major criminal narcotics network based in Hudson County that distributed thousands of black market prescription pills such as Oxycontin and Percocet. The network was obtaining fraudulent narcotics prescriptions and filling them at various pharmacies.

 $241 Million to Settle False Claims Act Suit in California 

 Quest Diagnostics, California’s biggest provider of medical laboratory testing agreed to pay the state $241 million to settle a charge brought by the Attorney General under California’s False Claims Act. The state had filed a lawsuit alleging illegal overcharges to the state’s medical program for the poor.

The settlement with Quest is the result of a lawsuit filed under court seal in 2005 by a whistleblower and referred to the Attorney General’s office. The lawsuit alleged that Quest systematically overcharged the state’s Medi-Cal program for more than 15 years and gave illegal kickbacks in the form of discounted or free testing to doctors, hospitals and clinics that referred Medi-Cal patients and other business to the labs. California law states that “no provider shall charge [Medi-Cal] for any service more than would have been charged for the same service to other purchasers of comparable services under comparable circumstance.”

Yet, Quest charged Medi-Cal up to six times as much as it charged some other customers for the same tests. For example, Quest charged Medi-Cal $8.59 to perform a complete blood count test, while it charged some of its other customers $1.43.

California law also prohibits Medi-Cal providers from soliciting and receiving “any kickback, bribe, or rebate, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in valuable consideration of any kind [in] return for the referral, or promised referral, of any individual for the furnishing of any service” paid for by Medi-Cal.

According to the attorney general’s complaint, Quest systematically offered doctors, hospitals and clinics low prices for lab tests in return for referrals to Quest of patients, including Medi-Cal patients. Quest then allegedly charged Medi-Cal a higher price to make up the difference – resulting in the loss of millions of dollars to the Medi-Cal program. Under the state’s False Claims Act, any person with previously undisclosed information about a fraud, overcharge, or other false claim can file a sealed lawsuit on behalf of California to recover the losses, and is entitled to a share of the recovery in some cases. Such individuals become plaintiffs and are known as “whistleblowers,” “qui tam plaintiffs,” or “relators.”

In this case, the whistleblowers were Chris Riedel and his company Hunter Laboratories. Hunter Laboratories found it could not compete in a significant segment of the marketplace where major medical laboratories such as Quest offered doctors, hospitals and clinics far lower rates than they were charging Medi-Cal. Riedel and Hunter were represented by Niall P. McCarthy of Cotchett, Pitre&amp;McCarthy, LLP.

The Attorney General’s Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse conducted an intensive three-year investigation that uncovered widespread abuse of Medi-Cal by medical testing laboratories in California.

Similar cases are still pending against four other defendants, including Laboratory Corporation of America, commonly known as LabCorp, the second largest medical laboratory service provider in California. Trial is scheduled for early next year.

I can only wonder why the staff at Medical did not discover this apparently massive fraud and needed the help of a competitor to discover the fraud. The competitor will get a healthy percentage of the settlement amount and deserves credit for blowing the whistle. The state needs controls on its program to catch this type of obvious fraud that could have been discovered by a simple audit of the provider comparing what Medical was charged with charges for same services to others.

LabCorp is paying $49.5 million to settle a Medicaid fraud lawsuit claiming the company overcharged California’s Medicaid program and gave doctors medical kickbacks for patient referrals. Burlington, North Carolina-based LabCorp disclosed the proposed settlement payment in a securities filing. During today’s second quarter earnings conference call, LabCorp executives did not discuss the lawsuit or the settlement other than to repeat what was disclosed in the filing that said that the company is settling “to avoid the uncertainty and costs associated with prolonged litigation.”

LabCorp said that because of the settlement the company has recorded a second quarter, pre-tax charge of $34.5 million, $20.7 million after tax. The settlement is subject to negotiation and execution of a settlement agreement and release. LabCorp competitor Quest Diagnostics is on the hook for even more money. In May, Quest reached a $241 million settlement agreement, which amounts to the largest recovery in the history of California’s False Claims Act. 

The 2005 suit against Quest, LabCorp and six other medical testing lab companies stems from a whistle blower who brought the claims to the attention of the California Attorney General’s office. A subsequent three-year investigation by the Attorney General’s office uncovered widespread abuse of Medi-Cal by medical testing laboratories operating in California.

The Attorney General’s office says that in the case of some companies, the fraudulent Medi-Cal billing had gone on for more than 15 years. It’s not the first time laboratory billing practices have come under scrutiny. The “Operation Labscam” probe in the 1990s investigated fraud in the form of unnecessary tests billed to Medicare. In that settlement, LabCorp paid $182 million; Quest paid $119 million.

California’s penalty for Medi-Cal fraud is $10,000 for each false claim. The Attorney General’s office places the total fraud to Medi-Cal in the millions of dollars. LabCorp’s proposed settlement resolves all claims brought against the company in the suit. LabCorp was scheduled to go to trial in early 2012.

 Fraudulent Physical Therapy Company Guilty in Tampa 

 Jorge Zamora, 48, a Miami-area resident and owner of a fraudulent physical therapy company in Lakeland, Fla., pleaded guilty for his role in a scheme to defraud Medicare. Zamora pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark A. Pizzo in Tampa, Fla., to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

According to court documents, Zamora was an owner of Dynamic Therapy Inc.  Zamora and his co-conspirators purchased Dynamic from its previous owners, and transformed it into a fraudulent enterprise. Dynamic purported to provide physical therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries, but in reality used the stolen identities of a physical therapist and scores of patients to bill Medicare for physical therapy services that were never provided.

According to court documents, from fall 2009 to summer 2010, Zamora and his co-conspirators submitted and caused the submission of $757,654 in fraudulent claims to the Medicare program by Dynamic.  Zamora admitted that he and his co-conspirators submitted claims to Medicare for physical therapy services that were never provided. Three officers of Dynamic Therapy also have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

At sentencing, Zamora faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  A sentencing date has not been set.

The guilty plea was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Robert E. O’Neill of the Middle District of Florida; Steven E. Ibison, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Tampa Division; and Special Agent-in-Charge Christopher Dennis of the HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Office of Investigations’ Miami office.

 Dr. Gets Only One Year for Fraud 

Allen R. Foster, 49 of Gatlinburg, an East Tennessee doctor was sentenced to a year behind bars and ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution for health care fraud and tax offenses.

Foster was sentenced to a year in federal prison and three years of supervised release in a Knoxville federal courtroom. According to US Attorney William Killian, the sentencing followed a guilty plea in February of this year. Foster must also pay $74,307 in restitution to Medicare, $65,837 to TennCare, and $596,761 to the IRS. 

Foster also agreed to surrender his license to practice medicine to the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners. Court documents show that Foster billed Medicare and TennCare for pain management patients who were never seen face-to-face, but who were provided prescriptions during monthly visits to offices in Knoxville and Morristown in 2006 and 2007.

 Fraud Causes Dr. To Lose License to Practice 

Dr. Mark G. Midei  had his license revoked by the Maryland Board of Physicians finding that the Towson cardiologist falsified patient records in order to justify unnecessary and expensive cardiac stent procedures. The findings cap two years of inquiry into Midei’s work at St. Joseph Medical Center. The allegations tarnished Midei’s career, pushed the hospital to enter into a multimillion-dollar settlement with the federal government and led the U.S. Senate Finance Committee to open an investigation into the doctor’s relationship with stent makers.

The revocation “validates what we’ve been saying all along, which is that Dr. Midei was engaged in egregious malpractice and fraud,” said Andrew G. Slutkin, a Baltimore attorney who has filed nearly 20 patient lawsuits against Midei. The board ruled that Midei violated five provisions of the state’s Medical Practice Act while working at St. Joseph through unprofessional conduct, false reports, gross overutilization of health care services, standards of care violations and the failure to keep adequate medical records.

Specifically, the board found that he inserted cardiac stents into arteries that weren’t clogged enough to need them — likely because of “pressure to produce.” “Dr. Midei testified that he understood that he was a big generator of business for the hospital, that the hospital had lost many patients to competition and that its goal was to hold onto the stent business that it saw slipping away,” board members wrote, noting that Midei was hired to run St. Joseph’s cardiac catheterization lab at a seven-figure salary that was triple his prior earnings.

Midei filed a lawsuit against St. Joseph, claiming he was made a scapegoat by hospital administrators who were trying to deflect attention from a separate kickback scandal. St. Joseph paid the federal government $22 million to settle the kickback claims, as well as to repay Medicare funds received for Midei’s suspicious stents. In a statement Wednesday, the hospital said it respects the board’s decision regarding Midei.

He is one of at least three Maryland doctors recently accused of unnecessary medical procedures. John R. McLean, a cardiologist who practiced on the Eastern Shore, is currently on trial on charges of fraud and false statements in Baltimore’s U.S. District Court, accused of implanting unnecessary stents. And the federal government sued a Baltimore eye doctor in March, claiming that he repeatedly performed unnecessary laser eye surgery. Concerns about Midei’s work were first raised in the spring of 2009, and he was relieved of hospital duties shortly thereafter. In November of that year, St. Joseph began notifying roughly 600 patients through letters that their stents might have been unnecessary.

The Maryland Board of Physicians, which disciplines and licenses state doctors, filed professional charges against Midei on June 7 of last year. A settlement conference was held in August, and evaluators recommended a lesser penalty than revocation. A settlement was not reached, and the case went before an administrative law judge, who held a seven-day evidentiary hearing, during which Midei was represented by nine attorneys. The judge recommended that Midei’s license be revoked, and the board concurred after a separate hearing last month.

Midei can reapply for his license in two years. ZIFL can only wonder why Maryland or US authorities have not filed criminal prosecutions against the doctor and the hospital.

 Another Medicare Fraud Family Member Convicted 

 Ahmad Hamad Hamad, 48, the last of four family members who were suspects in a Medicaid fraud ring that went on from 2006 to 2009 has been convicted in Washington County, Oregon Circuit Court.

In August 2010, three of the family members pleaded guilty to multiple counts of theft and fraud after an eight-month investigation by federal and state agencies. The family was accused of receiving more than $100,000 by filing false claims for progressive disabilities so they could qualify for government assistance. The ringleader, Rania S. Hamad, 34, received 13 months in prison, while her husband, Zack H. Maysi, 45, and her mother, Nahla S. Awad, 72, were given probation. The three paid the federal government $93,583.96 in restitution for money they defrauded from Medicaid. Awad was also ordered to pay $8,131 in restitution to the U.S. Social Security Administration.

Rania Hamad’s brother, Ahmad Hamad Hamad, fled overseas but was arrested on February 14 by U.S. Marshals upon discharge from a Portland hospital. Officials did not say when Ahmad returned to the United States and would not comment on how they discovered his whereabouts.

On June 23, Ahmad Hamad pleaded guilty to six of 99 counts he was facing. The 99 counts consisted of multiple charges of first-degree theft and of making false claims for health care payments. Hamad is scheduled to be sentenced August 29, in Washington County Circuit Court.

 Walgreens to Pay $2.8 Million for Overcharging State and Localities 

The Walgreens Company (Walgreens) will make a payment to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to approximately 75 cities and towns in Massachusetts totaling $2.8 Million.  The pharmacy chain has entered into a settlement with Attorney General Coakley’s Office after an investigation revealed the company was overcharging public entities for prescription drugs under the workers compensation insurance system. 

The Attorney General alleges that Walgreens billed and received payment from cities, towns and state agencies for filling prescriptions for workers compensation claimants at prices in excess of those permitted by Massachusetts laws. Under the terms of the settlement, filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Walgreens will make a payment to the Commonwealth totaling $2.8 million.  The city of Boston will receive approximately $200,000 in restitution. In addition the cities of Springfield, Holyoke, Fairhaven, Needham, Lowell, Auburn, New Bedford, Norwood, Revere, South Hadley, and Winchester will each receive refunds in excess of $10,000.  On average, municipalities will receive approximately $8,900 each.

According to the settlement, Walgreens allegedly overcharged Massachusetts towns, cities, and state agencies on prescription drug prices under the workers compensation insurance system by approximately $1.4 million since 2002.  Under the terms of the settlement, Walgreens will re-pay these overcharges, and will also pay an additional $1.4 Million to the Commonwealth.  The settlement is part of an ongoing investigation by the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division of prescription overcharges by pharmacies to public entities under the workers compensation insurance system.  The Attorney General has reached similar settlements with CVS, Shaws Supermarkets, and Stop&amp;Shop.

 Guilty of $25 Million Home Health Care Fraud 

Lisandra Alonso, 33, and Luisa Morciego, 39, The manager of a Miami health care agency and a registered nurse pleaded guilty in July for their participation in a $25 million home health Medicare fraud scheme.

Alonso and Morciego each pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Joan A. Lenard in Miami to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud.  Alonso and Morciego were charged in a February 2011 indictment.   According to plea documents, Alonso was a manager and patient recruiter for ABC Home Health Care.  Morciego was a registered nurse and worked for ABC and Florida Home Health Care Providers Inc.   ABC and Florida Home Health were Miami home health care agencies that purported to provide home health and physical therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries.  According to court documents, ABC and Florida Home Health were operated for the purpose of billing the Medicare program for expensive physical therapy and home health care services that were medically unnecessary and/or were never provided.   Court documents allege that the medically unnecessary services were prescribed by doctors, including Jose Nunez, M.D., and Francisco Gonzalez, M.D.  Nunez and Gonzalez were also charged in the February 2011 indictment along with Alonso, Morciego and 17 other co-conspirators.

 According to court documents, beginning in approximately January 2006 and continuing until approximately March 2009, Alonso taught the owners and operators of ABC how to operate a fraudulent home health agency. Alonso explained the structure of the corrupt scheme, specifically the importance of recruiters, kickbacks, doctors, beneficiaries and Medicare billing.  Alonso negotiated kickback payment rates between patient recruiters and the ABC owners and operators, and distributed the kickback payments to patient recruiters on behalf of the ABC owners and operators.  Alonso also served as a patient recruiter for ABC.   She paid kickbacks and bribes to beneficiaries in return for those beneficiaries allowing ABC to bill Medicare for services that were medically unnecessary and/or never provided.

Alonso also taught nurses at ABC how to falsify patient files for Medicare beneficiaries to make it appear that such beneficiaries qualified for home health care and therapy services from ABC. Alonso taught the nurses to do so by, among other things, describing in the nursing notes and patient files non-existent symptoms such as tremors, impaired vision, weak grip and inability to walk without assistance.  These symptoms were described to make it appear that the patients qualified for home health care benefits under Medicare.  Alonso admitted that the files were falsified so that ABC could bill Medicare for medically unnecessary services. Nurses employed by ABC also paid kickbacks to Alonso in return for being assigned patients at ABC.

As a result of Alonso’s participation in the illegal scheme, the Medicare program was billed approximately $17 million for home health care services that were medically unnecessary and/or were never provided.

According to court documents, from January 2006 to March 2009, Morciego worked as a registered nurse for ABC and Florida Home Health.  During that time, Morciego falsified patient files for Medicare beneficiaries to make it appear that the beneficiaries qualified for home health care and therapy services.   Morciego knew that the beneficiaries did not actually qualify for and did not receive the services.  Morciego described in nursing notes and patient files symptoms that were non-existent, such as tremors, impaired vision, weak grip and inability to walk without assistance.   Morciego admitted that the files were falsified so that ABC and Florida Home Health could bill Medicare for medically unnecessary services.

As a result of Morciego’s participation in the fraud schemes at ABC and Florida Home Health, Medicare was billed approximately $296,000 for services that were medically unnecessary and/or were never provided.

Morciego is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 5, 2011. Alonso is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3, 2011. The charge of conspiracy to commit health care fraud carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. The defendants also face fines and terms of supervised release, as well as forfeiture of any property or proceeds derived from their criminal activities.

 Defrocked Doctor and Chiropractor Guilty of Fraud 

Francisco R. Carbone, of Fairfield, a 53-year-old former doctor, became the second person convicted in the case when he pleaded guilty to two federal charges of conspiring to commit mail fraud, as well as single charges of conspiring to distribute narcotic substances and making a false statement related to health care. Earlier this year, Dr. James W. Marshall, who operates Immediate Medical Care on Main Street in Monroe, Connecticut admitted that, at Carbone’s request, he illegally wrote prescriptions for narcotic painkillers to patients he had never seen. Marshall, who wrote 145 prescriptions for more than 4,400 pills, faces up to 30 months in prison when sentenced.

Both Carbone and Marshall are cooperating with the investigation.

Carbone, whose license was suspended by the state for five years after he pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud in 1998, then pulled in 2005 after he was implicated in another FBI health care probe, faces up to 71 months in prison when he is sentenced on these charges by U.S. District Judge Stefan R. Underhill. Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Schmeisser said the fraud, which ran from December 2006 to February 2010, involved Carbone, the attorney and the chiropractor agreeing to exaggerate the extent of injuries to their clients, performing unnecessary treatment and diagnostic testing and prescribing narcotic painkillers in an effort to increase the eventual settlement paid out by insurance companies.

Additionally, the prosecutor said the attorney, who maintains an office in Bridgeport; the chiropractor, who has offices in Bridgeport and Stamford, and Carbone increased their expenses for clients receiving state aid or owing child support in order to reduce the amount of money the state could claim. Typically, the state seeks 50 percent of an insurance settlement made to a person receiving aid. Once the settlement was reached, a portion would be kicked back to the patient.

The prosecutor noted that the attorney would send clients to Carbone and the chiropractor, who also owns a diagnostic testing company. Even though Carbone was no longer licensed to practice medicine, he would fabricate reports overstating the injuries, declaring permanent partial disabilities and frequently ordering nerve conduction velocity testing. The chiropractor’s testing firm would then charge $2,000 for the tests. 

Carbone drafted the final medical report for patients, many of whom he never examined. They were given to the lawyer for use in settlement talks. Neither the attorney nor the chiropractor was identified by name in court or in documents. They are expected to be charged soon. An employee of the chiropractor is expected to plead guilty later.

Carbone, who practiced as an internist and a psychiatrist on East Main Street, spent four months in federal prison after pleading guilty in 1998 to receiving kickbacks from a local medical supply firm to which he referred Medicare patients. Four years later, he was sent back to federal prison for 13 months after being found in violation of his probation by being implicated in another FBI health care fraud probe. A second probation violation was brought in 2006 after postal inspectors claimed Carbone was representing himself as a medical doctor after his license was pulled. That violation was later vacated because the violation carried a maximum two-month prison term and Carbone has spent an additional five months being supervised by the U.S. Probation Office, according to court documents.

 An Effective Assault&amp;Battery Exclusion 
 Posted on August 9, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Artful Pleading Fails 

 Insurers who insure bars and other places where alcoholic beverages are sold are loathe to insure the bar against liability for bar room fights, acts of security personnel (bouncers) or any form of assault or battery. Plaintiffs’ lawyers recognize this fact and will therefore add to their pleadings allegations of negligence on the part of the bar or its owners to drag the insurer and its big pockets of cash into the case. Such a case was presented to the District Court, District of Nevada in Versatility, Inc v. Capitol Indemnity Corporation, et al, No. 2:10-CV-1942 JCM (D.Nev. 08/05/2011) who refused to submit to the artful pleading of the plaintiff’s lawyer and upheld an assault and battery exclusion.

 THE SUIT 

Capitol Indemnity Corporation (Capitol) asked Lewis T. Babcock, Judge of the District Court for the District of Nevada to dismiss the suit brought by Versatility, Inc. (plaintiff). 

Plaintiff filed the instant action alleging breach of contract and bad faith when Capitol declined to defend plaintiff in an alleged“assault and battery”lawsuit filed in Clark County, Nevada. Capitol claimed that the policy specifically excluded any coverage for any suit (including one founded on claims of negligence) arising out of or related to any assault, battery, and harmful or offensive contact or threat.

 MOTION PRACTICE 

 Generally, in federal court, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to‘state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.  Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a Capitol’s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. However, where there are well pled factual allegations, the court should assume their veracity and determine if they give rise to relief.

To state a claim for breach of contract, the plaintiff must allege, and eventually prove:

(1)     the existence of a valid agreement between the plaintiff and the Capitol;

(2)     a breach by the Capitol; and

(3)     damages as a result of the breach.

Once a plaintiff proves these prima facie elements, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that his nonperformance was excused or otherwise defensible.

Insurance contracts are interpreted like other contracts and an insurance company’s duty to defend and/or indemnify its insured arises from the provisions of the insurance policy and the insurer must defend any lawsuit brought against its insured which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy in Nevada. The general rule followed by courts when interpreting the language of an insurance policy, ambiguous terms will be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer bit when contract language is clear and unambiguous, a court cannot, under the guise of interpretation, distort the plain meaning of the contract.

 THE ISSUE 

Neither party disputed the existence of a valid agreement. The question arises as to whether Capitol’s coverage determination constitutes a breach of the insurance policy.

 FACTS 

In the underlying action, plaintiff was sued by a patron of its bar who alleged that an unidentified employee struck him in the face and head, severely injuring him. Specifically, the patron alleged claims of assault and battery; intentional infliction of emotional distress; vicarious liability; negligence; negligent hiring, supervision and retention; and punitive damages. Capitol contended that these claims all arise from the alleged“assault and battery.”It concluded that, as a result, the claim is not covered under the policy.

Upon the filing of the complaint, plaintiff provided Capitol with a video tape which proved no physical contact ensued between the patron and employee. Based on this evidence, plaintiff claims that the lawsuit was frivolous, and the Capitol had an obligation to defend because no apparent battery or assault ever occurred. Thus, the only viable claims were those alleging negligence, which were covered under the insurance agreement.

 With regard to the underlying suit, the patron’s negligence claims arose out of the alleged battery and assault damages that occurred between the patron and employee. The patron’s negligence claim in his complaint states that“[patron] suffered injury to his body, and [experienced] severe pain and suffering,”which occurred because of the“attack”by the employee. This claim is not independent of the alleged battery or assault.

Plaintiff eventually won the suit three years later; but incurred attorneys’fees and costs in excess of $54,000 for which plaintiff now seeks reimbursement.

 THE INSURANCE POLICY 

To resolve the dispute, the court was called upon to interpret the parties’insurance agreement, which outlines the parties’obligations as follows:
 
 Insuring Agreement 

 a.     We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of‘bodily injury’or‘property damage’to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any‘suit’seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any“suit”seeking damages for“bodily injury”or“property damage”to which this insurance does not apply. 

 Exclusion–Assault or Battery 

 We have no duty to defend or indemnify any insured or any other person against any claim or suit for bodily injury, property damage, or personal and advertising injury, including claims or suits for negligence arising out of or related to any: (1) assault, (2) battery, ( 3) harmful or offensive contact, or (4) threat, whether committed by a patron, employee, or any other individual. This exclusion applies regardless of fault or intent. . . . For purposes of this exclusion, negligence includes but is not limited to claims for negligent: (1) hiring, (2) employment, (3) training, (4) supervision. (Emphasis added) 
 
 DECISION 

The denial of coverage applies regardless of whether the underlying intentional claims are factually accurate. The insurance policy does not state that coverage was dependent upon there actually being facts to support the damages for an underlying claim. Therefore plaintiff’s proposed, extrinsic video evidence is irrelevant to determining the parties’obligations. The agreement makes it clear that Capitol’s duty to defend the plaintiff is contingent upon the underlying claims and damages alleged in the complaint, and not on the actual outcome of the case.

Because plaintiff’s alleged negligence caused the patron to suffer injuries which“arose out”of and were“causally connected”to his alleged assault and battery, plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract was dismissed by the District Court because it was not covered by the express terms of the insurance policy.

 LESSON 

 Insurance contracts can be drafted to avoid the artful legal drafting of a skilled attorney. 

The attorney for the injured person worked diligently to plead a cause of action for negligence that contradicted the basic facts of the incident in an effort to drag an insurer in to the action who would probably have entered into a settlement with the injured party. Because the insurer refused to defend the insured bar the case went to trial and the bar received a defense verdict. It was required, however, to pay its attorneys and sought that money from its insurer plus bad faith damages. It failed because the policy wording drafted by the insurer not only excluded assault and battery but also excluded claims of negligence resulting from the battery.

 Nevada Adopts Notice Prejudice Rule 
 Posted on August 8, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurer Must Prove Prejudice to Avoid Coverage 

Every third party liability insurance policy requires that the insured report a claim to the insurer promptly. They use different words in

 

different policies, most of which require reports immediately, as soon as possible, as soon as practical, as soon as the insured learns of the claim and various similar words.  Over the years insurers have denied claims for late reporting and some courts support the denial but the great majority of courts will only confirm a denial if the insurer can prove that it was prejudiced by the delay.

In Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department v. Coregis Insurance Company, N/K/A Westport Insurance Corporation, No. 54502,56638 (Nev. 08/04/2011) the Nevada Supreme Court was asked to decide whether insurance claim notice provisions are enforceable and whether an insurer may properly deny coverage to an insured based on late notice of a claim in the absence of prejudice to the insurer.

 FACTS
 

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) was named as a defendant in a federal district court action alleging civil rights violations. LVMPD had an insurance policy with respondent Coregis Insurance Company (Coregis) to protect against liability for police officer actions when the damages exceeded a certain amount. Coregis denied LVMPD coverage for the civil rights claims because LVMPD did not notify Coregis of LVMPD’s potential liability until ten years after the incident that led to the civil rights lawsuit. LVMPD settled the civil rights action, incurring fees and costs in defending the case. LVMPD then filed a declaratory-judgment action seeking a judicial determination that Coregis was required to defend and indemnify LVMPD for damages related to the civil rights claims. On Coregis’s motion, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of Coregis, concluding that LVMPD’s notice was clearly late and that Coregis was prejudiced by the late notice.

The civil rights action against LVMPD was filed by the Estate of Erin DeLew on grounds that LVMPD acted to cover up evidence in the Estate’s 1994 wrongful death action against an LVMPD officer’s wife, Janet Wagner. According to the wrongful death action, on September 27, 1994, DeLew was riding her bicycle when Wagner struck DeLew with her automobile, causing injuries to DeLew that ultimately led to her death.

In 1996, the DeLew Estate filed a separate civil rights cause of action, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against LVMPD and the Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP), arguing that the two organizations conspired and covered up the true cause of the accident, which affected the Estate’s ability to prosecute its wrongful death action against Wagner. NHP removed the civil rights case to the United States District Court and that court dismissed the action. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, concluding that the Estate had a possible claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, but that the claim was premature because the wrongful death cause of action had not been resolved. After the Estate settled the wrongful death claim with Wagner, it filed a second civil rights action against LVMPD and NHP on January 28, 2000, which was essentially identical to the 1996 lawsuit. In 2002, the U.S. District Court granted LVMPD and NHP summary judgment, but three years later, on November 15, 2005, it vacated LVMPD’s summary judgment as a discovery sanction. LVMPD had failed to provide the majority of the documents that the DeLew Estate had requested by the discovery deadline and had failed to comply with the discovery sanction order requiring it to provide those documents.

 In 1994, when the Estate filed its wrongful death action against Wagner, LVMPD was self-insured up to $1 million dollars in damages for liability related to police officer actions. Thus, it had no primary insurer and would cover each occurrence up to $1 million dollars itself. Through Coregis, LVMPD was insured for up to $10 million dollars if police officer actions resulting in personal injuries, including violations of civil rights, exceeded LVMPD’s $1 million self-insured retention amount.

 The Insurance Policies 

The insurance policy contained four different sections:

(1)     a general liability section,
(2)     an automobile liability section,
(3)     a public entity errors and omissions section, and
(4)     a law enforcement liability section.

Three of the sections contained the same notice requirement, which mandated that LVMPD notify Coregis of a claim when a claimant’s demand totaled 50 percent or more of the self-insured retention amount. The fourth section, the law enforcement liability section, required LVMPD to provide Coregis notice of an occurrence that may result in a claim as soon as practicable and to immediately provide Coregis copies of any demands or other legal documents.

The law enforcement liability section covered liability for bodily injury or property damage caused by a member of LVMPD acting in his or her law enforcement capacity. That section stated that LVMPD was“solely responsible for the investigation, settlement, defense and final disposition of any claim made . . . against [LVMPD] to which [the law enforcement liability section] would apply.”The section further stated that LVMPD is financially responsible for such defense, that LVMPD shall act diligently in defending claims, and that LVMPD shall agree to a reasonable offer within their self-insured retention amount. The law enforcement liability section also provided that LVMPD did not have a right to coverage“unless all of [this section&apos;s] terms have been fully complied with.”

 The Suit Against LVMPD 

In August 2006, the DeLew Estate made its first settlement demand against LVMPD in the civil rights action, seeking $4.5 million. LVMPD notified Coregis of the DeLew Estate’s civil rights lawsuit on November 6, 2006. Coregis sent LVMPD a letter acknowledging notice of the DeLew Estate lawsuit, reserving all rights concerning any coverage issues, and den ying coverage because LVMPD failed to provide timely notice of the DeLew Estate lawsuit. Despite the denial of coverage, LVMPD requested Coregis to reconsider and attend the settlement conferences between LVMPD and the DeLew Estate, but Coregis declined to participate in the settlement process.

LVMPD settled with the DeLew Estate in March 2007 for $1.475 million. LVMPD allegedly incurred $803,136.58 in fees and costs in defending the lawsuit.

Following the settlement, LVMPD filed a declaratory-judgment action seeking a judicial determination that Coregis was required to defend and indemnify LVMPD in the civil rights action under the Coregis policy. Coregis filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted, finding that LVMPD failed to provide timely notice of the claims against it, such that coverage was properly denied, and finding that while Coregis did not need to show that it was prejudiced by the late notice, it was able to do so because of the discovery sanction overturning LVMPD’s summary judgment in the civil rights cause of action. LVMPD now appeals.

 ANALYSIS 

 The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a legal question. The Supreme Court, therefore, reviewed the case as if it was originally presented to it without the decisions of the earlier courts.

LVMPD contended that the district court erred in granting Coregis summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remained concerning whether LVMPD timely tendered its insurance claim to Coregis. Notice during the years of dormancy of the suit would have been futile. LVMPD sent notice to Coregis on November 6, 2006, after it had received its first settlement demand that was in excess of its self-insured retention amount. Coregis refused to participate in the settlement negotiations, and LVMPD did not settle until March 2007.

Considering these facts and the conflicting notice provisions within the insurance policy in the light most favorable to LVMPD, summary judgment was inappropriate. Three sections of the 75-page insurance policy contained notice provisions requiring LVMPD to provide Coregis with notice of a claim once a demand was made in excess of $500,000. LVMPD relied on these notice sections. When Coregis originally denied LVMPD’s claim, it cited to the law enforcement liability section, which required notice as soon as practicable, and it cited to the public entity’s errors and omissions section, which required notice after a demand of at least $500,000. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for LVMPD to believe that it did not need to provide notice to Coregis until a demand was made in excess of $500,000.

LVMPD’s belief that it did not have to provide Coregis notice until the $500,000 self-insured retention amount was exceeded is supported by the notion that immediate notice of an insurance claim is not required in the excess insurance context. Excess insurers are generally only concerned with occurrences that may involve their policies. Accordingly, summary judgment was inappropriate here because the determination of whether notice was late is a much more fact-intensive inquiry when an excess insurance policy is involved than it is when a primary insurance policy is involved, and there were still genuine issues of material fact present concerning whether LVMPD’s notice was timely under any of the notice provisions.

 NOTICE-PREJUDICE RULE 

LVMPD urged adoption of a notice-prejudice rule that requires that in order for an insurer to deny a claim based on late notice, it must have been prejudiced by the late notice. In this case the Nevada Supreme Court agreed and adopted the rule and placed the burden to show prejudice on the insurer. The Supreme Court concluded that it is more practical and equitable to require the insurer to prove it has been prejudiced than it would be to place that burden on the insured party and require him or her to prove a negative, namely, that the insurer had not been prejudiced.

The Supreme Court admitted that upon its first reading of the briefs prior to argument and at the conclusion of the argument, it was strongly impressed with the cases presented to the effect that right of recovery under the policy would not be barred by failure to give timely notice, unless the insurer had been prejudiced by such failure. The arguments in favor of that rule seemed plausible and the rule itself appeared to the Supreme Court neither unfair nor inequitable.

Unlike courts who believe they are distinct from others and only follow their own precedent the Nevada Supreme Court concluded that “It would be presumptuous on our part to establish a rule of law in this state which departs from the overwhelming majority of decisions throughout the United States” regardless of Nevada precedent and because of the enactment of a statute relating to notice to an insurer.

 The Notice Prejudice Rule in Nevada 

Following the enactment of NAC 686A.660,  that seemed to require the notice prejudice rule and adopted the precedent in the majority of jurisdictions  the Supreme Court adopted a notice-prejudice rule as follows: 
 
 in order for an insurer to deny coverage of a claim based on the insured party’s late notice of that claim, the insurer must show (1) that the notice was late and (2) that it has been prejudiced by the late notice. Prejudice exists“ where the delay materially impairs an insurer’s ability to contest its liability to an insured or the liability of the insured to a third party. ”(emphasis added)
 
 
 CONCLUSION 

 Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to LVMPD, the Supreme Court concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the timeliness of LVMPD’s notice, such that summary judgment was not appropriate. Therefore, the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the district court’s summary judgment and adopted, as have the majority of states,  a notice-prejudice rule and sent the case back to the trial court to determine if the late notice prejudiced the rights of the insurer as prejudice was defined.

 LESSONS 

Strange fact situations and serious injuries make for difficult cases in insurance law.

The insurer in this case was its own worst enemy. It wrote a policy of insurance with different notice conditions.

It denied the claim presented by LVMPD without a thorough investigation since its first report was ten years after the damage causing incident and, as did the trial court, assumed that LVMPD violated the condition of the policy. It refused to participate in settlement negotiations even though it had timely notice.

LVMPD put itself in the position of needing to fund a settlement and sue its insurer by not reporting the suit:

1.    Initially upon learning that the plaintiff in the underlying suit was seeking damages in excess of $500,000 (half the Self Insured Retentition).

2.    Upon spending more than $500,000 in costs of defense.

3.    Immediately upon the suit being reinstated.

Even if the report would have been useless early on, especially after LVMPD won summary judgment it could have reported the claim before summary judgment was heard. After the summary judgment was vacated it could have given notice even if the SIR had not been exhausted. Prudence requires notice—nothing is lost by early notice—but something can be lost by late notice.

Insurers can avoid the notice prejudice rule by writing a notice requirement that is clear and unambiguous and that is consistent throughout the policy. The condition should require immediate, but no more than 30 calendar days from notice, written notice to the insurer upon any of the following:

 Service of a suit seeking damages equal to half the SIR. Expenditure of costs of investigation and expense equal to or greater than half the SIR. Receipt of a claim or demand from the plaintiff(s) in excess of or greater than half the SIR. Failure to report as required shall cause the policy to be void. 

 An insurer with a notice provisions in its policy, whether mixed like the Coregis policy, or not, after receiving notice, must conduct a thorough investigation of the claim to determine if facts exist that establish prejudice. Relying on a 60 year-old decision that had been changed by statute is not sufficient. Had Coregis done a thorough investigation it would have learned that the late report was really made within three months of receiving a demand. Since LVMPD had not expended in defense costs its SIR the only exposure faced by Coregis would be the difference between the settlement amount and less the $1 million SIR. They could have participated in the settlement conference under their reservation of rights and then, if their investigation established prejudice, litigate with LVMPD about whether there was coverage and avoided a great deal of trouble and expense. If there was not sufficient evidence to establish prejudice it would have paid its share of the settlement and avoided litigation with its insured.

The covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in every contract of insurance requires more than a quick denial of coverage if it appears that a condition has been breached. The covenant requires that the insurer conduct a thorough investigation to determine if facts truly exist to avoid coverage. Failure to do the investigation is dangerous and expensive.  If Coregis is unable to prove prejudice it will find itself facing serious damages. If it can prove prejudice it will prove it at trial and pay nothing more than the fees charged by its lawyers.

 What Is Insurance? 
 Posted on August 5, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 I Know It When I See It 

 As U. S. Supreme Court Justice Stewart said in Jacobellis v. Ohio , 378 U. S. 184, 197 (1964) when dealing with pornography “I know it when I see it,” most members of the public would be hard pressed to define insurance but claim to know it when they see it.

Many states have different definitions of the word“insurance”but each have the same essential elements that it is a contract where for consideration (payment of a premium) one party agrees to indemnify another against certain identified risks of loss arising from a fortuitous, contingent or unknown event.

For example Minnesota, defines insurance at Minn. Stat. § 60A.02, subd. 3(a) (2010) at“any agreement whereby one party, for a consideration, undertakes to indemnify another to a specified amount against loss or damage from specified causes, or to do some act of value to the assured in case of such loss or damage.”California defines the term at Insurance Code Section 22: “Insurance is a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.”  Without a fortuitous event there can never be insurance. The insurance must deal with an event which, so far as the parties to the contract are concerned, is dependent on chance.

New Mexico defines the term as follows:  “Insurance’is a contract whereby one undertakes to pay or indemnify another as to loss from certain specified contingencies or perils, or to pay or grant a specified amount or determinable benefit in connection with ascertainable risk contingencies, or to act as surety” [NMSA 1978, § 59A-1-5], and Nebraska statutes Under Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 44-102, the definition of insurance contains the following elements: “(1) the existence of a contract whereby, (2) for a consideration, (3) one party (the insurer) promises to pay money or perform a valuable act for the benefit of the other party (the insured), (4) upon the happening of a stated hazard or peril that results in a loss to the insured.” 

The Supreme Court of Minnesota in Timothy B. Allen v. Office of Appellate Courts Burnet Realty, LLC, D/B/A Coldwell Banker Burnet , No. A09-1963 (Minn. 08/10/2011) was faced with just that issue when it was asked to determine whether contracts the Plaintiff signed while he worked as a sales associate for respondent Burnet Realty LLC were contracts of insurance. Under the contracts, Timothy B. Allen (Allen) and Burnet Realty (Burnett) agreed to an allocation of expenses should a dispute arise related to Allen’s work for Burnet. In litigation commenced after he left Burnet, Allen claimed that Burnet violated Minn. Stat. § 60K.47 (2010) because the contracts were insurance, and as a result, Burnet was required to be, but was not,“authorized to engage in the business of insurance”in Minnesota. Allen also claimed other relief on the basis that the contracts were insurance. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Burnet, concluding that the contracts were not contracts of insurance. The court of appeals affirmed and the case was presented to the Supreme Court.

 FACTS 

Allen was a licensed real estate salesperson and an independent contractor for Burnet from 1999 through 2007. The parties’respective obligations and duties were set out in independent contractor agreements (ICAs) that Allen and Burnet signed in each of the years at issue in this case. On the same days that Allen executed the ICAs, Allen also executed agreements to participate in Burnet’s Legal Administration Program (LA Program).

T he LA Program was an agreement between Burnet and its sales associates designed to“limit”a sales associate’s“personal liability exposure”should an associate be“involved in a dispute or lawsuit.”The LA Program applied to“Covered Disputes,”which included“a dispute, arbitration proceeding, or lawsuit”initiated against the sales associate, Burnet, or both. The dispute also had to“relate[] to”the sales associate’s“actions which [were] contemplated within the scope of”the ICA between the sales associate and Burnet. There were certain exceptions to the disputes that were covered by the LA Program, including when the associate engaged in intentional or reckless wrongdoing or fraud, or when the associate acted as a buyer or seller in a transaction. All sales associates were required to either join the program or obtain“company approved outside coverage.”

When a covered dispute arose, the associate and Burnet had different rights and obligations. The sales associate and Burnet agreed to split all the legal expenses in connection with a covered dispute, which included errors-and-omissions insurance costs, attorney fees, and settlement costs. The sales associate and Burnet split these expenses in the same proportion as the commissions the associate received. The LA Program capped the sales associate’s liability at $1,500, and Burnet was responsible for all expenses above that amount. The sales associate also had to cooperate with Burnet in the defense of the dispute. Burnet retained the ability to choose the attorney and retained the authority to make decisions on resolutions and settlements, but agreed to discuss resolutions and settlements with the sales associate. The LA Program also prohibited Burnet from asserting any claims against the sales associate in connection with a covered dispute. The LA Program charged the sales associate an annual fee, which rose from $395 in 2002 to $450 in 2006.

About one year after leaving Burnet, Allen commenced an action against the company, alleging that Burnet (1) sold insurance through its LA Program (2) violated the Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act by failing to inform sales associates that the indemnification program was an errors-and-omissions insurance policy; and (3) obtained unjust enrichment by selling unauthorized insurance and keeping the proceeds. Burnet moved for summary judgment.

Before ruling on the summary judgment motion, the district court requested that the Minnesota Department of Commerce, which regulates both real estate and insurance, provide its view as to whether the LA Program constituted an unlawful insurance policy. The Commissioner of the Department concluded that the LA Program created a relationship that was“markedly different”from the typical insurer-insured relationship, and that the LA Program acted as“a self-insurance arrangement”that“would not be regulated under Minnesota’s insurance laws.”

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Burnet. The court relied on the fact that the LA Program was incidental to the independent contractor relationship and that Burnet, because of its statutory and common-law liability for the actions of sales associates, was not assuming new risks in exchange for a premium. The court also concluded the LA Program did not fall within our characterization of insurance as a contract providing indemnification for“losses with which the indemnitor had no connection and over which it had no control.” 

The court of appeals concluded the general statutory definition of insurance to be too broad, choosing to apply the“principal object and purpose”test to determine whether the LA Program was insurance.

 ISSUE 

Allen insists that the LA Program is insurance. Allen’s argument rested on the definition of insurance found in Minn. Stat. § 60A.02, subd. 3(a) (2010). This definition states that insurance is“any agreement whereby one party, for a consideration, undertakes to indemnify another to a specified amount against loss or damage from specified causes, or to do some act of value to the assured in case of such loss or damage.”

 CONCLUSION 

The Minnesota Supreme Court found that the LA Program is not insurance under the statutory definition because insurance requires indemnity“to a specified amount.”The LA Program, while stating the sales associate is liable for up to $1,500, does not specify an amount of liability for Burnet. Instead, Burnet is liable for“all expenses incurred”above the sales associate’s $1,500 maximum contribution. There is no specified amount of Burnet’s obligation to indemnify Allen.

 More than a century ago, the Supreme Court applied this definition of insurance to a contract and required that, in order to be a contract of insurance, a specific level of indemnity was required. Physicians’Def. Co. v. O’Brien , 100 Minn. 490, 495, 111 N.W. 396, 398 (1907). The Supreme Court concluded that all the elements of the insurance definition were met in that case.  In this case the Supreme Court was unable to identify the“specific amount”for which Burnet agreed to indemnify Allen because Burnet was responsible for“all expenses”above $1,500.

The conclusion that the LA Program is not insurance is confirmed by looking at the LA Program’s details and comparing them to case law and typical contracts for insurance. First, the LA Program does not expose Burnet to any additional risk for which it would not already be liable. An elementary principle of insurance is that in exchange for the payment of a premium, an insurer assumes certain risks that otherwise would be the obligation of the insured.

Burnet, as the real estate broker, is statutorily responsible for the sales associates’actions. Therefore, Burnet was not assuming new risk in exchange for Allen’s payment of a premium. Moreover, a covered dispute, as defined by the LA Program, would include an action brought only against Burnet that did not include the sales associate. Yet the LA Program still requires the sales associate to contribute to the costs of handling the action, despite the sales associate not being a named party. In this situation, Burnet would ordinarily be the only entity at risk. Therefore, in situations where Burnet is the only named party to a case, the LA Program does not allocate risk that otherwise would be the obligation of the insured.

In an insurance contract, the insurer will have no connection with or control over the losses sustained on the part of the insured. In order to qualify as disputes covered by the LA Program, the dispute must have been related to the sales associate’s actions“which [were] contemplated within the scope of [Burnet&apos;s] Independent Contractor Agreement.”Therefore, Burnet had a strong connection with, and a certain amount of control over, the actions of the sales associate that would lead to the covered dispute, and in turn any losses. Because the LA Program did not involve an insurer that lacks a connection with and control over the losses, it bears little resemblance to an insurance product. The LA Program appears to be merely a method of ensuring that the sales associate and Burnet are defending any disputes as a team, rather than as separate entities.

 LESSON 

Before making a decision that a contract is insurance it is important to use more than the concept of “I know it when I see it.” Insurance is always a contract. A contract, even one that agrees to indemnify another, is not always insurance. 

The Minnesota Supreme Court made clear that most do not know insurance when they see it. Before claiming that a contract is, or is not, insurance it is necessary to establish the following:

1.    The contract is in writing.
2.    Consideration passes between the parties.
3.    One party to the contract agrees to indemnify the other against a contingent or unknown risk of loss.
4.    The contract specifies the risks of loss it agrees to indemnify against.
5.    The contract specifies the extent of indemnity the insurer agrees to pay.

Even when all five elements are established the statutes of the state where the contract was made must be reviewed to determine if the contract meets with the requirements of the local statute and the parties have complied with statutory requirements.

 Heads I Win, Tails You Lose–2011 
 Posted on August 4, 2011 by Barry Zalma Heads I Win, Tails You Lose - 2011 
 This E-Book book started as a collection of columns I wrote and published in the magazines“Insurance Journal,”“Insurance Week,”and“The John Cooke Insurance Fraud Report”insurance trade publications serving the insurance community in the United States. Since the last edition I have added more stories that were published in my twice monthly newsletter, Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter which is available free to anyone who clicks the link. 

 The title,“Heads I Win, Tails You Lose”is meant to describe insurance fraud as it works in the Unites States. It means that whenever a person succeeds in perpetrating an insurance fraud everyone who buys insurance is the loser. If the fraud succeeds the insurer must charge more premium to cover the expense of defending the fraud and payment of funds to the fraud perpetrator. If the fraud fails the insurer must charge more premium to cover the expense of defending the fraud. Everyone, except the lawyers, lose. 

 The legislatures of the various states, the United States Congress, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, The National Insurance Crime Bureau and insurance industry groups have finally decided that the war against insurance fraud is worth fighting. Until the states, the local police agencies, the district attorneys, the United States Attorneys, and the Attorneys General of the various states join in the battle it will be fought to a stalemate. The insurance industry cannot successfully fight insurance fraud alone. 

 On the state level the effort has begun. California, and many other states, have forced the insurance industry to pay money into a special fund to create a Fraud Division, California Department of Insurance or Fraud Bureau whose only duty is to investigate and prosecute insurance fraud perpetrators. Proposition 103 and Special Fraud Investigation Unit Regulations forced insurers to pay monies into another fund to pay prosecutors to prosecute the crime of insurance fraud and to create their own special fraud investigation units. Defrauding an insurance company is a felony in most states. 

 All of these actions suggest that the Legislatures have concluded that insurance fraud is draining away the wealth of their states into the pockets of criminals yet they wish to pass the buck to insurers to do the investigations. California, by statute, state that it is the public policy of the state that insurance fraud must be stopped. 

 Insurance industry sources estimate insurance fraud from lows of $80,000,000,000 ($80 billion) a year to highs of $200,000,000,000 ($200 billion) a year. Regardless of which, if any, estimate is accurate the amount of money going to insurance criminals is staggering and approaches no less than 3% to 10% of premium collected. 

 What has been the result of these new statutes? Are insurance criminals going to jail? Have there been scores of arrests? Have the courts been inundated with prosecutions? No. The prosecution of an insurance fraud is as rare as snowfall on the on the Island of Oahu.. It happens, but not in the numbers that the extent of the crime would suggest. Convictions are even more rare. Prosecutors complain that insurance companies do nothing. The statutes compelling insurers to form fraud investigation units usually have no penalties if the insurer fails to establish such a unit [California imposed regulations that imposes a $5,000 fine for failure to establish a Special Investigation Unit or to train its integral anti-fraud personnel and other states are following that lead.]

 Is There a Right To Contract? 
 Posted on August 4, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance and Construction Contracts 

I n the United States the right to enter into any contract that does not violate law or public policy has been inviolate. The right to contract is a liberty which falls within the protection of the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. [ Adkins v. Children&apos;s Hospital , 261 U.S. 525] The U. S. Supreme Court has steadfastly upheld the general right to enter into private contract and has definitely disapproved attempts to fix prices by legislative fiat and eliminated a statute that would control the commissions paid to insurance agents. [ O&apos;Gorman and Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Company Same v. Phoenix Assurance Company , 51 S. Ct. 130, 282 U.S. 251 (U.S. 01/05/1931)]

In that regard construction contracts have been used by the people involved in construction of any building or structure the parties have used contracts to shift the risk of loss by requiring indemnity from one to another, by requiring one to make the other an insured on its insurance policy, and by requiring one party to waive the other’s insurer’s right of subrogation. The parties to construction contracts agree on how the risks of loss are to be borne and their insurers, for an appropriate premium, agree to pay for the risks agreed. That is the essence of insurance, to shift the risk of loss from a person to an insurer.
 
In 1909 the US Supreme Court stated in Mclean v. State Arkansas , 29 S. Ct. 206, 211 U.S. 539 (U.S. 01/04/1909) stated that an act of Congress: “violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution by restricting the right to contract, by taking property without due process of law, by unlawful discrimination and by denying to certain operators and workers in coal mines the right of civil liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It also concluded that laws declaring the public policy of the State, enacted for the protection of the public health, safety or welfare, the same may be valid, notwithstanding they have the effect to curtail or limit the freedom of contract.

 Subrogation 

Subrogation is an equitable remedy where a person who pays the debt of another is entitled to assume the rights of the person whose debt he or she paid. In insurance, when an insurer pays a claim, it assumes all of the rights of the person insured, to sue and recover the amounts paid from any third party who was responsible for the loss. When parties to an insurance contract wish to avoid disputes with their customers they enter into an agreement – for an appropriate premium – with the insurer to allow the insured to waive its insurer’s right of subrogation. A waiver of Subrogation Clause is a policy provision in property and liability insurance contracts which states that the insurer waives its rights to subrogation under the contract if certain preconditions are met. Usually granted to landlords who do not wish their insurer to sue their tenant.

 On June 23, 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber signed into law Senate Bill (SB) 961, an amendment to ORS 30.140 (Oregon’s anti-indemnity statute) that claims to avoid the problem of infringing on the constitutional right to contract by stating a public policy to protect subcontractors against the excesses of general contractors and owners. As you read the statute printed in full below consider whether it is a violation of due process as stated in O’Gorman and is depriving general contractors, owners and subcontractors to freely contract.

ORS 30.140 voids waiver of subrogation, indemnity or contribution provisions in construction agreements and insurance policies. It was reported that the new law was introduced by construction subcontractor interests to address a perceived inequality in bargaining power between subcontractors and prime contractors. What it does is, by fiat, change the terms of construction and insurance contracts without asking the parties to the contract whether they would agree to the change. It seems to be a law designed to cure a perceived problem where the cure is worse than the disease.

Oregon apparently was attempting to deal with Oregon’s Employer Liability Law (ELL).  The ELL allows a subcontractor’s injured employee to sue the prime contractor for failing to maintain a safe workplace. Because most construction contracts require every subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor and the owner and to waive the subcontractor’s insurer’s right of subrogation the risk of loss is shifted to the subcontractor and its insurer. Typically the general contractor would tender an ELL lawsuit to the subcontractor and its insurer to defend the ELL lawsuit. Depending on the subcontract language and the insurance policies involved, the subcontractor’s insurer would usually pay the entire cost of defense of the lawsuit and any indemnity owed to the injured party.

By its terms, the new law does not apply to waivers of subrogation, indemnity or contribution in wrap up insurance policies (policies issued pursuant to ORS 737.602) but the law seems to apply to void contractual and insurance policy requirements through which a subcontractor agrees to provide a “primary and noncontributory” defense to the general contractor or owner. 

This Oregon statute eliminates the insurer’s right of subrogation without allowing for it to collect appropriate premium for the additional risk. Therefore, all future contracts of insurance will – of necessity – increase to cover the increased risk. Similarly, the law voids construction agreement provisions that require waiver of right of subrogation, indemnity or contribution for amounts paid by reason of loss caused by negligence of another party.  As a result future contract terms that included in the subcontract price the cost of the additional risks it was taking will now be reduced. The subcontractors who sought this law will suffer because they will be forced to reduce their prices to allow the general contractor and owner to protect the rights they cannot shift.

This law appears to be a perfect example of the Law of Unintended Consequences that will harm rather than help the subcontractors who sought the law and seems to be a violation of the right of the parties to contract as they will. Legislators do not have the right to void contract terms freely entered into by two parties capable of entering into a contract.

 The O regon Statute 

 
 

 

 

 

The statute provides, in full:
 
 Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon: 

 SECTION 1. ORS 30.140 is 

 amended to read: 

 30.140. 

 (1)     Except to the extent provided under subsection (2) of this section, any provision in a construction agreement that requires a party or that party’s surety or insurer to indemnify another against liability for damage arising out of death or bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused in whole or in part by the negligence of the indemnitee is void. 

 (2)      Subsection (1) of this section does not affect any provision in a construction agreement that requires a party or that party’s surety or insurer to indemnify another against liability for damage arising out of death or bodily injury to persons or damage to property to the extent that the death or bodily injury to persons or damage to property arises out of the fault of the indemnitor, or the fault of the indemnitor’s agents, representatives or subcontractors. 

 (3)     Except as provided in this section, a provision in a construction agreement is void if the provision requires a party or that party’s surety or insurer to waive a right of subrogation, indemnity or contribution for amounts paid by reason of a loss caused in whole or in part by the negligence of another person. 

 (4)       Subsection (3) of this section does not affect a provision for waiver of subrogation, indemnity or contribution in an insurance policy issued pursuant to ORS 737.602, or a provision for waiver of subrogation, indemnity or contribution that applies to proceeds of a property insurance policy. 

 (5)    As used in this section,‘construction agreement‘means any written agreement for the planning, design, construction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of any building, highway, road excavation or other structure, project, development or  improvement attached to real estate including moving, demolition or tunneling in connection therewith. 

 (6)    This section does not apply to: 

 (a)     Any real property lease or rental agreement between a landlord and tenant whether or not any provision of the lease or rental agreement relates to or involves planning, design, construction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance as long as the predominant purpose of the lease or rental agreement is not planning, design, construction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of real property; or 
 (b)     Any personal property lease or rental agreement. 

 (7)    No provision of this section shall be construed to apply to a railroad as defined in ORS 824.200. 

 SECTION 2.  The amendments to ORS 30.140 by section 1 of this 2011 Act apply only to construction agreements entered into on or after the effective date of this 2011 Act. 

 SECTION 3.  this 2011 Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, an emergency is declared to exist, and this 2011 Act takes effect on its passage. 
 
 LESSON 

 Contracting freely is a right that has been recognized since before the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the US Constitution.

Laws should not be enacted to favor one party to a contract over another. This law not only favors subcontractors and their insurers over general contractors and their insurers without stating a public policy reason other than to state that it is needed in an emergency situation.

It appears, since the law changes contracts in existence and makes future contracts for indemnity or waiver of subrogation impossible, that the law fails to provide all parties to a construction contract with their right to due process under the 5th and 14th Amendments to the US Constitution.

In a free society it is best to allow people to enter into any contracts they desire to enter into as long as the contract does not violate the law or public policy. When governments get involved in private contracts the law of unintended consequences comes into play and those who are the intended beneficiaries of the law end up being hurt.

 Insurance fraud 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 An E-Book by Barry Zalma 

Insurance fraud continually takes more money each year than it did the last from the insurance buying public. Estimates of the extent of insurance fraud in the United States range from $87 billion to $300 billion every year.

In truth, no one really knows the extent of insurance fraud because most frauds succeed without the insurer even suspecting that it is being defrauded. Insurers and government backed pseudo-insurers can only estimate the extent they lose to fraudulent claims. No one will ever place an exact number on the amount lost to insurance fraud but everyone who has looked at the issue know – in their heart and gut – that the number is enormous and that when insurers and governments put out effort to reduce the amount of insurance fraud the number of claims presented to insurers and the pseudo-insurers drops logarithmically.

It is the purpose of this book to provide information to those who are engaged in the effort to reduce insurance fraud. It will provide information for the lawyers representing insurers so that they can adequately advise their clients who are victims of the crime of insurance fraud.

This book will provide information for insurance claims investigators, special insurance fraud investigators working at insurance company Special Investigation Units (SIU), Fraud Bureau Investigators, and Prosecutors will have the information needed to allow prosecution of insurance criminals to proceed. Prosecutors will also have sufficient information to understand the importance of the crime and the need to reduce the crime by effective prosecution and punishment of the insurance fraud perpetrators.

By including the full text of decisions from courts of appeal and supreme courts across the country the reader can understand what happens after the investigation is completed in order to better complete the investigation. The full text of appellate opinions dealing with insurance fraud and weapons available to insurers to defeat insurance fraud will give each person involved with information not available elsewhere.

The e-book is available at Zalma Books at http://www.zalma.com/zalmabooks.htm. 


 information to deal with state investigators and prosecutors. It is also necessary to read the full te 

 xt of decisions of the courts of appeal to fully understand the facts gathered by the investigators and prosecutors.

 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION DECEPTION FAILS 
 Posted on August 3, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Never Lie to Your Insurer 

 In Connecticut, a construction company obtained a workers’ compensation policy through an assigned risk plan that placed him with CNA Insurance Company (CNA) who determined premium based upon the contractors representation that he had only one employee who was a carpenter when, in fact he was engaged in roofing and had many more than one employee. CNA audited the construction company’s books and assessed a higher premium that was clearly material since on audit it increased from $750 to more than $51,000. The construction company failed to pay the additional premium and the policy was cancelled. A person claiming to be an employee was injured after the policy was cancelled and CNA refused to pay benefits. A suit resulted and after the trial court ruled in favor of the insurer an appeal was filed.

In Ed Construction, Inc. v. CNA Insurance, No. AC 31476 (Conn.App. 07/26/2011) the plaintiff, ED Construction, Inc., appealed An adverse declaratory judgment concerning the interpretation of a workers’compensation insurance policy (policy) that it purchased from CNA.

 FACTS 

Ed Devingo is the owner and president of the plaintiff. On August 26, 2002, Devingo met with Diane H. Silfen of the Haehl Agency, Inc., for the purpose of applying for workers’compensation insurance coverage for the plaintiff through the assigned risk market.  During this meeting, Devingo and Silfen completed and signed an“ACORD 130 worker’s compensation application form”and“ACORD 133 worker’s compensation insurance plan/assigned risk section form.”Devingo indicated on the application that the plaintiff had one employee and that it provided carpentry services. Silfen estimated the premium for the plaintiff’s policy to be $750, which was immediately paid by t he plaintiff.

The National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. (council), assigned coverage of the plaintiff to CNA via a randomized assignment process from a pool of participating insurance companies. On September 20, 2002, the council issued a workers’compensation and employer’s liability policy binder to the plaintiff, which had an effective date of August 27, 2002.

On October 28, 2002, after the policy period had commenced, CNA requested a detailed list of the plaintiff’s business operations and current certificates of insurance for all of its subcontractors. On December 18, 2002, CNA ordered a preliminary audit of the plaintiff’s policy because the plaintiff’s certificates of insurance failed to indicate current workers’compensation coverage for the listed subcontractors and because the plaintiff submitted“forms for exclusion of coverage by workers’compensation law”for individuals who appeared to be employees. On January 6, 2003, the preliminary audit was assigned to Suzanne Delvento, an employee in CNA’s audit department. On February 10, 2003, Delvento completed the audit survey and found that all of the workers whom the plaintiff had paid during the policy period had signed a sole proprietor exclusion form and were all carrying only general liability insurance. Delvento also found that the plaintiff performed roofing services rather than carpentry services.

On February 15, 2003, Delvento completed a premium audit analyst notification, which noted that the plaintiff’s estimated exposure of $1500 within the carpentry class was incorrect. The plaintiff’s exposure was increased to $114,802 pursuant to the roofing rate class. CNA also notified the plaintiff that its payroll was underestimated on its application and that the premium now reflected the new annualized payroll. On February 21, 2003, CNA issued a bill to the Haehl Agency that reflected a premium due of $51,718 by March 23, 2003.

On March 3, 2003, Silfen faxed a letter to CNA, stating that“[t]his letter is to appeal the enclosed $51,718 bill. The insured has no employees at all, how can he have a payroll of $114,802?”Stephanie Spellman, one of CNA’s employees, responded to Silfen’s letter on March 10, 2003, and explained the procedures that needed to be followed in order to place the audit in dispute. Specifically, Spellman wrote to Silfen that“[i]f insured wishes to dispute they need to provide proper documentation to show subs are independent. They need to fax [documentation] to audit dispute unit . . . .”She further stated that if“audit put in dispute, then billing will be suspended.”

On March 27, 2003, CNA issued a notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium and notified the plaintiff that the policy cancellation would take effect on April 11, 2003, and that the plaintiff still owed the additional premium of $51,718. CNA did not receive any additional payments from the plaintiff and cancelled the policy on April 11, 2003. On June 13, 2003, CNA received a letter from Robert Vogler on behalf of the plaintiff, disputing the audit and requesting an abatement of the additional audit billing. On June 14, 2003, Rodriguez sustained“catastrophic injuries”while performing roofing services on behalf of the plaintiff and filed a claim for workers’compensation benefits.
 Auditor 
During the pendency of Rodriguez’claim, on January 23, 2006, the plaintiff initiated this action, seeking a judgment declaring that the policy covered the injuries sustained by Rodriguez, and that CNA either defend the plaintiff against Rodriguez’claim or pay the plaintiff for all future costs and attorney’s fees in defending itself against the claim and award payment to the plaintiff for any costs and attorney’s fees already expended in defending itself against the claim. In its memorandum of decision, the court addressed the plaintiff’s complaint in three parts.

 TRIAL COURT DECISION 

 In part one, the court noted that“[t]he gravamen of this action is whether the insurance policy entered into between the plaintiff and [CNA] was in effect at the time of the alleged injury such that coverage was mandatory.”The court concluded that the unambiguous language of the policy contemplates cancellation of the contract by either party prior to the end of the policy term. The court further concluded that pursuant to part five of the policy, the plaintiff was required to pay all premiums when due and that CNA properly could increase the premium prior to the completion of the policy period.

In the second part of its decision, the court addressed the plaintiff’s claim that CNA failed to act on its appeal regarding the increased premium pursuant to the policy. The court noted that the plaintiff sent CNA a letter in response to the premium increase resulting from the audit. The court, however, also noted that CNA explained to the plaintiff the procedures that needed to be followed in order to place the audit in dispute but that the plaintiff did not even attempt to comply with those procedures.

Finally, the court addressed the plaintiff’s claim that public policy dictates that cancellation of an assigned risk workers’compensation policy during the period of the policy defies the humanitarian purposes of the Workers’Compensation Act (act), General Statutes § 31-275 et seq. The court concluded that CNA was entitled to cancel the policy for nonpayment of premium under both the policy’s terms and council guidelines. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not cite any authority supporting its claims that the humanitarian purpose of the act prohibits cancellation.

Accordingly, the court concluded that CNA properly cancelled the plaintiff’s insurance policy prior to the events of June 14, 2003, the day on which Rodriguez sustained catastrophic injuries, and, therefore, that CNA was under no obligation to defend the plaintiff against Rodriguez’claim or pay for any expenses incurred by the plaintiff in defending itself against the claim. This appeal followed.

 ANALYSIS 

The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly determined that (1) the policy could be cancelled so long as notice was provided to the plaintiff at least ten days prior to the date of cancellation, and (2) the final premium for the policy could be calculated and made due prior to the end of the policy period. The Court of Appeal disagreed.

Construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo (as if it were the trial court). The interpretation of an insurance policy, like the interpretation of other written contracts, involves a determination of the intent of the parties as expressed by the language of the policy.

The language of the policy is unambiguous and permits cancellation of the policy by CNA at any time so long as it provides“not less than ten days advance written notice stating when the cancellation is to take effect.”

To conclude that the cancellation of a policy would violate the humanitarian purposes of the act would contradict the act’s own language, which contemplates the cancellation of insurance policies. The court concluded that, although the policy indicates that final premiums will be determined after the policy ends, it nonetheless contemplates changes in the premium during the policy period.

The Court of Appeal also agreed with the trial court’s conclusion that the policy permits the collection of the increased premium during the policy period. The policy permits a change in premium during the policy period if the exposures of the insured are not accurately estimated when the initial premium amount is calculated.

As noted, CNA issued a notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium on March 27, 2003, and notified the plaintiff that the policy cancellation would take effect on April 11, 2003. CNA did not receive any additional payments from the plaintiff concerning the increased premium and cancelled the policy on April 11, 2003.

As to the premium increase, Devingo indicated in the plaintiff’s policy application that the plaintiff engaged in the business of providing carpentry services and only had one employee. CNA later completed a premium audit, which noted that the plaintiff’s estimated exposure within the carpentry rate class was incorrect, and adjusted the plaintiff’s premium to include exposure as paid with the roofing class. The audit also revealed that the plaintiff had more than one employee and that its previous annualized payroll was incorrect. CNA then issued a bill that reflected an endorsement to the policy resulting in an additional premium due of $51,718 by March 23, 2003.

At trial, the plaintiff argued that CNA failed to act on the plaintiff’s appeal regarding the increase in premium. CNA did initiate the process to resolve the plaintiff’s issue concerning the audit; however, the plaintiff made no attempt to comply with CNA’s request for supporting documentation and did not take any further action concerning the audit until after the policy was cancelled. Furthermore, the supplement requires that the plaintiff cooperate fully with CNA and provide all information requested by CNA for auditing and underwriting purposes. The plaintiff did not cooperate with CNA’s request for information and cannot now claim that it properly disputed the audit when it ignored CNA’s explicit instructions on how to initiate the dispute procedure and suspend billing.

 LESSONS 

 When purchasing any type of insurance, even workers’ compensation insurance, it is the duty of the insured to be honest in the application for insurance. Failure to do so be grounds to declare the policy void and in many states it is a crime. In Connecticut “Employers commit fraud when they lie to the insurer about the number of employees covered, past injury claims or the type of work what is really performed, to obtain lower premium rates.” [See http://www.ct.gov/cid/cwp/view.asp?q=254434 ]

ED, therefore, by its suit and the facts stipulated in this suit admitted to committing workers’ compensation premium fraud which could have resulted in a criminal complaint. Also, CNA could have, instead of cancelling the policy, rescinded it for misrepresentation of a material fact.

 PRIMARY vs. EXCESS 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Risk Shifting 

 Construction contracts are often used to shift risks of loss by contract terms and requirement that subcontractors insure general contractors and the owner. By doing so the risks of loss faced by the owner and general contractor are shifted to various subcontractors who are closer to the risk. Since owners and general contractors do not rely solely on the contract with the subcontractors they usually maintain a separate policy of insurance.  When a loss is covered by both the policy owned by the general contractor and by reason of an additional insured endorsement by the subcontractor’s insurance disputes arise over which policy is primary.

In Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc. and Acadia Insurance v. AIG Insurance Company of Canada, No. 10-1096 (1st Cir. 07/27/2011) the First Circuit Court of Appeal was asked to determine which of two commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policies should be considered“primary”for coverage of a claim arising from an accident at a construction site in Portland, Maine where both insurers claimed the other was primary.

At the time of the claim, Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc. (Wright-Ryan), the general contractor, was insured under its own CGL insurance policy, issued by Acadia Insurance Company (Acadia), and appeared as an“Additional Insured”on a subcontractor’s CGL policy, issued by AIG Commercial Insurance of Canada (AIG). Both insurers took a strong position against each other—Acadia defended the insured while AIG refused to do anything but refuse to pay.

 FACTS 

Wright-Ryan, a Maine construction company, was hired by the University of Southern Maine as the general contractor for the construction of a building known as University Commons. Wright-Ryan in turn subcontracted with the Canadian company Norgate Metal, Inc. (Norgate) for the fabrication and erection of structural steel for the project. Although Wright-Ryan had its own CGL insurance policy, Wright-Ryan required Norgate, as a condition of the subcontract, to obtain CGL insurance for the University Commons project in the amount of $2 million and name Wright-Ryan as an additional insured on the policy. Norgate procured the requisite coverage through AIG, which issued a certificate of liability insurance to Wright-Ryan and the University of Southern Maine naming them“Additional Insureds”to Norgate’s policy, providing insurance coverage on a primary and non-contributory basis for all liability“arising out of [Norgate&apos;s] premises or operations.”

In August 2007, Thomas Behrens, an employee of a company hired by Norgate fell four stories and landed on wet pavement at ground level, suffering serious injuries. Behrens sued. Upon receipt of the complaint, Wright-Ryan sent a letter to Norgate and AIG tendering to them the defense of the Behrens suit under Norgate’s CGL policy. With no response forthcoming from either AIG or Norgate, Wright-Ryan’s CGL carrier, Acadia, assumed responsibility for the company’s defense and settled the suit against all three defendants for $150,000 in 2009.

Wright-Ryan and Acadia sued for declaratory judgment against AIG in late 2008 in the federal court for the District of Maine, seeking a declaration that AIG was obligated to defend Wright-Ryan in the Behrens lawsuit. Following settlement of the Behrens lawsuit, Wright-Ryan and Acadia amended their complaint to seek reimbursement for the $150,000 settlement payment and over $40,000 of attorney’s fees incurred in Wright-Ryan’s defense.

 THE ISSUE 

 The sole and determinative question is whether the district court correctly held Wright-Ryan’s Acadia CGL policy to be primary and the AIG policy excess.

Under Maine law unambiguous provisions in insurance contracts, as with any other contract, must be interpreted as written, giving force to the plain meaning of the contract. The mere fact of a dispute over the meaning of a particular provision does not render that provision ambiguous; it will be so deemed only when an ordinary person would not understand that the provision has a single accepted meaning.

To untangle the priority of the Acadia and AIG policies, the First Circuit focused on the“Other Insurance”provision of the policies present in near identical form in both contracts of insurance. These provisions are not unique to the insurance contracts at issue in the dispute between AIG and Acadia.“Other Insurance”provisions are a standard element of liability insurance policies, intended to govern the relationship between and obligations of insurers whose policies provide overlapping coverage for the same claim or loss. There was just such an overlap in the dispute. Wright-Ryan had coverage for the Behrens claim under both the Acadia policy and the AIG policy. Wright-Ryan was a party to and appears as the Named Insured on the Acadia policy, and, while not a party to the AIG policy, Wright-Ryan has been added as an“Additional Insured”to that policy for all liability“arising out of [Norgate&apos;s] premises or operations.” 

“Other Insurance”provisions typically take one of three forms: an“escape”clause, which completely denies coverage when other insurance is available; a“pro rata”clause, which operates to share coverage of a claimed loss with other available insurance policies; or an“excess”clause, which extends coverage for a claim only when other insurance available for the claim has been exhausted. The First Circuit found that the provisions in both policies were of the third,“excess”variety.

The very first page of each policy states,“Throughout this policy the words‘you’and‘your’refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.”The Declarations page of both policies revealed that the Named Insured prominently identified as the sole insured. No other individual or entity is listed.

The definition of“you”in the policy is unambiguous: it refers solely to a person or organization listed as a Named Insured in the policy Declarations or“qualifying as Named Insured”by virtue of being newly formed or acquired by a Named Insured. Where a term is expressly defined within the four corners of an insurance policy, the court must defer to that definition and thereby give effect to the intent of the parties.

Since Wright-Ryan had primary insurance under the AIG policy for liability arising out of Norgate’s work at the University Commons site, having been added as an Additional Insured on the AIG policy by means of an endorsement. By definition the Acadia policy thus requires that it be treated as excess over the AIG policy. Norgate is not an additional insured on the Acadia policy. Moreover, the AIG policy unambiguously states that“[t]his insurance is primary except when”the excess coverage provisions, including the above, apply. Reading the two policies together, the First Circuit found that the AIG policy must be treated as primary and the Acadia policy as excess.

Because the First Circuit considered the operative language of the insurance contracts to be unambiguous it refused to resort to extrinsic evidence. Wright-Ryan required as a condition of its subcontract with Norgate that Norgate procure CGL insurance and name Wright-Ryan an additional insured on the policy. Wright-Ryan, of course, already had its own CGL insurance policy through Acadia; the only plausible explanation for the subcontract’s insurance requirement would be the desire to shift the risk to Norgate for liability arising out of Norgate’s subcontract work for Wright-Ryan, ensuring that claims related to that work were paid out of Norgate’s CGL insurance before Wright-Ryan’s was reached. This arrangement and the risk-shifting motivation underlying it appear to be typical of subcontracting relationships.

 LESSONS 

 Insurers must understand that construction projects involve multiple risk shifting devices including contract terms that require subcontractors to cause their insurers to name the general contractor and owner as an additional insured as well as multiple layers of indemnity agreements. AIG attempted to avoid the liability it assumed when it made its named insured’s general contractor an additional insured. It tried to read its policy narrowly to make a primary policy an excess policy in hopes of avoiding liability to the defend and indemnify the general contractor for the injuries suffered by Mr. Behrens.

The problem, as the First Circuit made clear, is that an insurance policy must be read as a whole to reach the clear intent of the parties.

To avoid the problem faced by Acadia and AIG in the interpretation of their policies could have been avoided by writing the policies differently. AIG could have used an “escape” other insurance clause rather than an “excess” other insurance clause. AIG could have caused the general contractor to be a “Named Insured” and would have paid the claim immediately. AIG could have written an exclusion that fit the situation. It did not.

Claims handlers should read their policies with an intent to find coverage not an intent to avoid coverage. Whenever a claims handler finds he or she must twist the language of a policy or use a creative interpretation of the language of the policy, that should act as a warning to the claims handler or lawyer advising the insurer that the conclusion is wrong. If there are two insurers and they cannot agree it is prudent for the two insurers to reserve their rights, work together to protect the insured and an equal basis, and then submit the coverage issue to a court or arbitrator for resolution of who owes what part, if any, of the obligation to defend and indemnify the insured. If the two insurers worked together in this case – rather than taking a stand and suing in federal court – a great deal of money would have been saved by both insurers.

 Zalma on California Claims Regulations—2010 
 Posted on August 2, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 

 

 

 Barry Zalma has updated and refined his seminal work on California Claims Regulations, available as an e-book from http://www.zalma.com/zalmabooks.htm , to be available for all insurers who must prove to the California Department of Insurance that all personnel have been trained and understand their obligations under California law.  The training must be completed by September 1 of every year. 

 The state of California compels all who are even tangentially involved in the claims process to comply with and have training in the Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations (the“Regulations”) and the Integral Anti-Fraud Personnel Regulations (the“SIU Regulations”). It is necessary that those insurance professionals and other persons who are engaged in any way in the presentation, processing or negotiation of insurance claims in the state of California be familiar with the Regulations and the SIU Regulations  imposed by the state of California on all insurers doing business in the state. 

 This E-Book and its appendices will enable insurers to effect compliance with the Regulations when training or assisting claims personnel in their obligations to read and understand the Regulations. The Appendices include an outline for an insurance company staff member, trainer, or lawyer to use in conducting a training class to all of the insurer’s integral anti-fraud personnel. Zalma provides insurers and their staff the information needed to comply with California SIU Regulations and the tools to train others to do the same. 

 The buttons will take you to a PayPal site where you can, with a credit card or your PayPall account purchase the e-book for only $25.00. After payment is effected the e-book will upload to your computer.  If it, for some reason, does not upload to your computer please send Barry Zalma an e-mail at zalma@zalma.com and it will be delivered to you immediately by e-mail.

 Fail to Read A Policy and Suffer the Consequences 
 Posted on August 1, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 It Is Necessary to Read the Insurance Policy 

 Many, if not most, insurance consumers, according to several studies and my experience, buy insurance based on price rather than on the terms or conditions of the policy. Doing so may save money for the insured at the time of acquisition of the policy only to cost the insured much when it is time to present a claim.

When an arbitration provision, or any other provision of an insurance policy, is clearly stated in the policy no provision of law requires that the insurer also disclose the provision in an application for insurance.  It is the obligation of every insured to read their policy or to retain the services of a risk manager or insurance consultant to read the policy wording before acquiring the policy.

Insurance is a contract. An insurance policy limitation is enforceable if it is clear and conspicuous. A policy provision is conspicuous if it is positioned and printed in a form which  adequately attracts the reader‘s attention to the limitation. California applies the objective theory of contract law.  Claiming ignorance of an insurance policy provision, if allowed to avoid a valid policy condition, would allow any party to a contract to avoid a disadvantageous provision by claiming that they were not aware it existed and would evicerate the terms of the policy contract.  Failure to read an insurance policy provision is, and should be, no excuse. A clear and conspicuous contract term, whether read or not, will be enforced.

 Recent Decision 

In Mission Viejo Emergency Medical Associates et al., v. Beta Healthcare Group et al., (Super. Ct. No. 30-2010-00342845) (Cal.App. Dist.4 06/29/2011) Plaintiffs Mission Viejo Emergency Medical Associates (MVEMA) and 12  physicians who are partners in MVEMA, sued defendants Health Providers Insurance Reciprocal, RRG (HealthPro) and Beta Healthcare Group (Beta) for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of contract, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Defendants moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration  provision in the insurance contract between the parties.

The trial court denied the motion,  ruling that the arbitration provision was unenforceable because it was not disclosed in the  application for the policy.

Beginning in January 2002 and renewing in 2003 and 2004, HealthPro issued professional liability insurance policies to plaintiffs.  These policies were  apparently obtained through a broker, James Murphy of Seaport Insurance Services.  In all three policies, the table of contents indicates a section of the policy entitled Arbitration of Disputes with Us.

The 2004 provision read, in part, as follows:
 
 ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES  WITH US.  Any dispute arising out of this policy will be submitted to and settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California.  The arbitration and discovery process will be  governed by the California Arbitration Act, Section 1280, et seq. of the Code of Civil  Procedure, except to the extent that it is inconsistent with this Section.  You and We waive the right to court remedies, including a jury trial. 
 
 The Malpractice Suit 

 On September 12, 2004, Joey Crumes went to the emergency medicine  department at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center complaining of a headache.  He was treated by Dr. Andrew Lawson, a partner in MVEMA.  Crumes was released after a  CT scan revealed no pathology.  On September 18, Crumes returned to the hospital in a semi-conscious state.  He underwent a craniotomy and suffered a stroke thereafter.  The  stroke was allegedly caused by a brain infection that had been present and went  undiagnosed during the September 12 visit.  He was in a prolonged coma and was eventually transferred to a skilled nursing facility.

In December 2005, Crumes and his wife filed a medical malpractice lawsuit  against multiple parties, including Lawson and MVEMA.  Defendants’ liability limit as to this claim was $2 million.  Representation was provided under the policy’s terms.  The case went to trial, and the jury awarded  Crumes a judgment in excess of $11.7 million.  The case settled in 2008 for $5.3 million.   Defendants paid the policy limits of $2 million toward the settlement.

 The Motion to Compel Arbitration 

In February 2010, plaintiffs sued its insurers. The  complaint alleged causes of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,  breach of contract, reckless infliction of severe emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Defendants moved to compel arbitration. 

Plaintiffs opposed the motion,  relying on the declaration of Dr. Robert Winokur, MVEMA’s managing partner.  He testified that none of the application forms he filled out mentioned arbitration and that no one informed him that the HealthPro policies would include an arbitration clause.  He stated he was unaware of the arbitration clause until the lawsuit was filed.  In  reply, defendants argued that irrespective of Dr. Winokur‘s professed lack of knowledge  of the arbitration provision in the policy, MVEMA and its partners had a duty to read the policy, and were therefore bound by its provisions, including the arbitration clause.

While MVEMA argues that the trial  court’s determination of the factual evidence is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, where, as here, the evidence is undisputed, appellate review of the  determination of the enforceability of an arbitration agreement is new, as if there was no order by the trial court.

 Public Policy 

C alifornia has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as an  expeditious and cost-effective way of resolving disputes. The strong public policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to those who are not parties to an arbitration agreement, and a  party cannot be compelled to arbitrate a dispute that he has not agreed to resolve by arbitration.

In Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394  (Rosenthal), the California Supreme Court stated, “[W]hen a petition to compel  arbitration is filed and accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to  arbitrate the controversy, the court itself must determine whether the agreement exists  . . . .  Because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to granting the  petition, the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the  evidence.”

 Applicable Law 

Once the moving party has established  the existence of the arbitration agreement, the burden shifts to the party opposing  arbitration to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the factual basis for any defense to enforcement.

The Court of Appeal noted that the defendants provided prima facie evidence in the form of the insurance policy containing the provision.  Plaintiffs admit the existence of the  policy through Dr. Winokur’s declaration, and implicitly through their undisputed  acceptance of policy benefits. In addition the Court of Appeal found that the arbitration provision is clear and conspicuous.  It is  included in the policy’s table of contents, in the  policy itself and it is the second provision of the General Conditions  section of the policy.  The arbitration condition is printed in the same typeface as the rest of the document and the heading is  underlined and in capital letters. 

Under the law pertaining to insurance contracts, an  insurance policy limitation is conspicuous if it is positioned and printed in a form which  adequately attracts the reader’s attention to the limitation. Given the existence of a  valid insurance policy (e.g., a contract) containing a clear and conspicuous arbitration  provision, the Court of Appeal found that defendants met their burden to establish a prima facie evidence of an agreement to arbitrate.

If the arbitration clause is to be found invalid, it is up to plaintiffs to establish a defense to the provision’s enforcement.  Plaintiffs’ primary claim is that they never consented to an arbitration provision.  Dr. Winokur‘s declaration states that “At no time did anyone inform me that the [HealthPro] professional liability policies would  include an arbitration clause.  I was not aware and did not expect that the policies would  include an arbitration clause.  I had no reason to suspect that the policies would include  an arbitration clause. Neither I nor any agent or representative of MVEMA ever signed or initialed anything consenting to arbitration of disputes arising out of the policies.”

In California courts follow the objective theory of contract law.  Under that  theory, “[i]t is the objective intent, as evidenced by the words of the contract, rather than  the subjective intent of one of the parties, that controls interpretation.” [ Founding Members of the Newport Beach Country Club v. Newport Beach Country Club, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 944, 956.]

Plaintiffs’ argument regarding Dr. Winokur’s lack of knowledge ignores the objective theory of contract law.  Further, if valid, it would permit any party to a contract to avoid a disadvantageous provision by claiming that they were not aware it  existed.

Fortunately for those who believe in the need to enforce contracts, the Plaintiffs’ argument is not the law.  Rather, it is a general rule that the receipt of a policy and its acceptance by the insured without an objection binds the insured as well as the  insurer.  It is a  duty of the insured to read his policy.

Plaintiffs cited authority for the proposition that insurers must call special attention to any unusual or unfair language in an insurance policy. None dealt with an arbitration provision and the court could not question  the premise that an arbitration provision qualifies as unusual or unfair language because an arbitration provision does not impact the basic duty to insure.

The Court of Appeal noted that even if it assumed that an arbitration provision does qualify as unusual or unfair language, it is enforceable if it is conspicuous, plain and  clear in the policy itself.

 Lesson 

 The Plaintiffs in this case failed because their real argument against the enforceability of the arbitration agreement is that they did not read the policy. They could not prove that the contract provision was illegal or unconscionable or that the insurer hid the provision from them. An argument that a party to a contract should not be held to it because the contract was not read is inadequate and an attempt to emasculate the language of the policy. Contract language that is clear and conspicuous, as was the arbitration language in the policy in this case, must always be enforced. If a person fails to read the policy acquired – a not unusual occurrence – is bound by the contract. To avoid an arbitration clause one must read the contract and refuse to accept the provision or acquire insurance elsewhere.

 Liability Claims Adjusting in California 
 Posted on July 29, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 The Duty to Defend 

 Every liability insurer in California knows that the duty of a third party liability insurer to defend the policyholder is greater than the duty to indemnify.

As a result it is necessary, before making a decision on a third party liability claim, that the insurer must thoroughly investigate the claim asserted against the policyholder as it relates to the allegations in the complaint and any facts not mentioned in the litigation that raise a potential for coverage. Ever since the California Supreme Court, more than 35 years ago, decided Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co. (1966) 65 Cal. 2d 263, 54 Cal. Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168, insurers have been aware that a liability insurer must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.

Making a decision about a liability claim requires a two-part analysis:

 Is there a potentiality for coverage that requires defense? Is there an obligation to indemnify the insured? 

The first question must be answered immediately. The second may not be answerable until a trial, jury verdict, and affirmance of the jury verdict on appeal.

To determine whether an allegation might reasonably be covered, thus triggering the insurer’s duty to defend, an insurer is obligated to:

 Review the complaint in the underlying action. Review the complaint along with any extrinsic evidence available to the insurer either at the inception of the lawsuit against the policyholder or at the time of tender. 

It has long been a fundamental rule of law in California that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.

The determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. ( Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1) Extrinsic facts are those known by insurer whether at the inception of the third party lawsuit, at the time of tender or after tender. ( Swain v. California Casualty Ins. Co. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1)

The duty to defend arises whenever the lawsuit against the insured, or the results of investigation performed by the insurer, allows the plaintiff to seek damages on any theory that, if proved, would be covered by the policy.  There is no requirement, when making a decision to defend a policyholder, that there must also be a right to indemnity. If the investigation reveals that the potentiality for coverage exists a defense must be provided even if the there is little or no chance of a need to indemnify the policyholder.

If an insurer believes its investigation establishes there is no duty to defend using extrinsic evidence the test for duty to defend is not whether an insurer has extrinsic evidence which reveals a covered liability, but rather whether the insurer has extrinsic evidence that conclusively eliminates a potential for liability. ( Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County , 6 Cal. 4th 287, 861 P.2d 1153, 24 Cal. Rptr. 2d 467 (Cal. 11/22/1993), Wausau Underwriters Insurance Co. v. Unigard Security Insurance Co ., 68 Cal.App.4th 1030, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 688 (Cal.App. Dist.2 12/22/1998), Horace Mann Insurance Co. v. Barbara B ., 4 Cal. 4th 1076, 846 P.2d 792, 17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 210 (Cal. 03/11/1993), Signal Companies Inc. v. Harbor Insurance Co. , 27 Cal. 3d 359, 612 P.2d 889, 165 Cal. Rptr. 799 (Cal. 07/03/1980), A nthem Electronics, Inc. v. Pacific Employers Insurance Co ., 302 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 09/05/2002) that held“an insurer must undertake a reasonable investigation into the circumstances of the claim before denying coverage…”.

 The Thorough Investigation 

The claims person presented with the tender of a lawsuit from a policyholder ins ured under a liability insurance policy that promises both defense and indemnity, seeking defense and indemnity must:

 Read the policy carefully. Read the lawsuit to determine if any of the allegations of the lawsuit raise a potential for coverage under the promises made by the policy. 
 If a potential exists retain counsel to defend the policyholder immediately with or without a reservation of rights. If the lawsuit does not allege facts that raise a potential for coverage immediately begin a thorough investigation. 
 The thorough investigation should include, at a minimum: 
 A personal interview with the policyholder or knowledgeable employees of the policyholder. An inspection of the site where the tort claimed occurred. A personal interview of the counsel for the plaintiff suing the policyholder. A review of all documents relevant to the allegations of the law suit. A personal interview of all independent witnesses. If needed, consultation with an expert in the fields involved in the litigation. 
 If it appears that both the allegations of the lawsuit and the extrinsic facts gathered by the investigation indicate what the claims handler concludes no potential for coverage exists, before refusing to defend or indemnify the policyholder, the insurer should seek the advice and counsel of a competent insurance coverage counsel. 
 If the insurance coverage counsel agrees with the claims handler and advises refusal of defense and indemnity, the insured must be advised in writing immediately of the decision of the insurer with a detailed explanation of the facts and legal authorities upon which the decision is based. 
 If the insurance coverage counsel concludes that upon the facts available there exists a potential for coverage under the policy for a defense but probably not for indemnity, with the assistance of counsel the insurer should: 
 Advise the policyholder that a defense will be provided under a full reservation of rights, including the right to recover from the policyholder all funds expended in defending the lawsuit if investigation or litigation determines there was no duty to defend. Advise the policyholder that, as a result of the reservation of rights, a conflict exists between the policyholder and the insurer that allows the policyholder to retain independent counsel of the policyholder’s choice. That, in accordance with California Civil Code Section 2860 the insurer will pay what it normally pays counsel in the jurisdiction to defend similar suits and that the policyholder will be obligated to pay the difference between what it usually pays and what independent counsel charges. Provide the policyholder with a complete copy of Civil Code Section 2860 and advise the insured of the various rights provided to the insurer by the statute. Pay the reasonable costs of defense of the policyholder – whether to panel counsel or independent (“Cumis”) counsel – and do everything possible to assist the policyholder in the defense of the lawsuit. As new facts are determined reevaluate the position taken by the insurer on a regular basis to determine if defense should be withdrawn or the reservation of rights should be withdrawn thereby eliminating the conflict of interest and need for independent counsel. Communicate regularly with the insured and counsel to assist in the eventual resolution of the claim. 


A less than thorough investigation as outlined above will expose the insurer to litigation for breach of contract and tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 Lessons 

 Every third party liability insurer doing business in the state of California must conduct itself in accordance with the requirements of California law. Unlike states that allow insurers to make a decision to defend based upon only the allegations of the suit against the policyholder in California the lawsuit is only the first step to be taken. Every third party liability insurer doing business in California must be ready to conduct a thorough investigation to determine if a potential for coverage exists even if a close reading of the lawsuit indicates that there is no potential for coverage for a defense.

Since California law allows the insurer to reserve its rights to refuse indemnity and the duty to defend at the end of the suit and obtain return of all monies paid for defense and/or indemnity the decision to defend under a reservation of rights may be less expensive and more risk averse than making a decision to refuse defense only to be found to be incorrect in a suit by the policyholder against the insurer.

Therefore, before refusing to defend a policyholder a prudent insurer will seek the advice and counsel of an expert insurance coverage lawyer.

 Liability Insurance Claims Handling 
 Posted on July 28, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 The History of Liability Insurance 

 The essence of insurance is the spreading of risk from one person to many. As early as 300 BC the Babylonians developed a system of loans for shipments by sea where the loan was not repayable if the ship was lost. Merchants found the risks of shipping by sea to be too great to take alone since the loss of one ship could bankrupt a merchant. With insurance, the risk of shipping was equitably spread among those subscribing to the loan.

 Third Party Insurance 

Third party insurance comes in various guises all of which are designed to protect a person or entity, the insured, against the risks of loss to third persons due to acts or omissions of the insured.

In modern insurance the insured (the first party)  acquires insurance from the insurer (the second party) that promises to defend and indemnify the insured from claims of tort damages by a third party. Third party liability policies evolved over many decades into multiple volumes of different specialized coverages.

 The Need for An Insurance Adjuster 

Third party liability insurance policies do not mention the existence of the insurance adjuster. The policy merely makes various promises limited by the terms and conditions of the policy wording. Insurers found that adjusters were needed to protect the interest of the insured and the insurer since most individuals are unable to deal with claims of tort damage and litigation.

Insurance adjusters are called upon to read and understand the various types of liability insurance policies and apply the coverages provided to fulfill the promises made by the insurer. The third party liability adjuster is an investigator, an insurance contract expert, and a person of empathy who fulfills the promises made in the policy to defend and indemnify the insured. In doing so, the adjuster also protects the assets of the insurer so that only the claims owed are paid in the amount agreed.

The adjustment of a liability claim commences with the loss notice.

The adjuster’s duty is to both the insurer, the adjuster’s principal, and the Policyholder. If the adjuster fails to adjust the claim in good faith or deal fairly with the Policyholder the insurer will be liable to the insured for damages that flow from such conduct. The adjuster, acting as an agent of a disclosed principal, is not a party to the contract and has no legal duty to the insured. [ Gruenberg v. Aetna Insurance Co. , 510 P.2d 1032 (Cal. 1973)] The adjuster, if not an employee of the insurer, can only be held to indemnify the insurer if it is compelled to pay an insured more than is owed under the policy of insurance.

 Promises Made by Insurer and Insured 

 Insurance is a means of spreading the risk of loss by mutual promises. The creation of an insurance policy is an exchange of promises between the insurer and the person seeking insurance. The insurer promises to indemnify (compensate the person seeking insurance for loss or damage) the person seeking insurance against certain specified risks of loss.

Insurance is created when the potential insured makes the following promises:

1.     To honestly inform the insurer of the risk it asks the insurer to take;

2.    To answer all questions about the insured and the risk asked by the insurer;

3.    To not conceal any facts material to the decision of the insurer to insure;

4.    To pay the premium charged; and

5.    To report and prove its claim to the insurer.

The insurer, in return, promises the following:

1.    To thoroughly investigate the claim presented;

2.    To investigate the claim in good faith;

3.    To apply the facts of its investigation to the policy wording to determine if the loss reported is one of the risks assumed; and

4.    To promptly pay the indemnity promised once coverage is determined and the amount of the loss is proved.

The promises made by the insurer are fulfilled by the insurer’s claims personnel. Many insurers train their personnel to fulfill the promises made by the policy and reduce their instructions to writing. Some, as a marketing tool or an expression of wishful thinking, write manuals that exceed the promises made by the policy and the abilities of its claims staff. 

Most insurers tell their customers that their claim specialists understand the Policyholder and the Policyholder’s industry and know the types of losses that can occur. The insurer further contends in its marketing materials that its claims professionals work to deliver prompt, efficient, knowledgeable service to resolve claims quickly and fairly. By so doing the insurer expresses a desire it hopes it can fulfill. The promise, albeit excellent marketing, can cause problems for the insurer.

Every insurer must understand that it is essential that its claims people actually understand each industry insured, are insurance professionals who are knowledgeable, prompt and efficient enough to resolve claims quickly and fairly. Failure to fulfill the promise can be exceedingly expensive to the insurer when it is explained to a jury that the promises were made to induce the Policyholder to purchase the insurance knowing that the claims staff was not trained, experienced or knowledgeable enough to fulfill the promises made by the policy and marketing because its claims personnel were not trained, professional, knowledgeable, prompt, efficient nor equipped to resolve claims quickly and fairly.

 The Claims Manual 

 Many insurers have a claims manual or a statement of claims handling best practices that explain to the claims, sales and underwriting staff what the insurer wants its claims personnel to fulfill. These are often set forth with the best of intentions even though they are requirements that, in some cases, cannot be met. Claims handling manuals may include requirements like:

 That the claim be acknowledged immediately with a description of available coverages presented to the Policyholder. That a factual investigation should begin promptly and, where possible, be substantially completed within one calendar month from the date of the report of loss. The investigation should be focused to obtain relevant information that describes the facts and circumstances of the loss. The claims people must determine the exposure of the Policyholder to liability tp third parties and all exposure of all other parties to liability. The claims people must determine contractual obligations and risk transfer issues with respect to all parties, including insurance availability. 

Similarly, states are putting into effect Fair Claim Settlement Practices Regulation that require similar timelines. For example, in California the following timelines are in effect:

 Maintain all files – open or closed  for inspection by the Department of Insurance;  Current year and four preceding years (five years). [Section 2695.3(b)(1)(3)] Acknowledge Receipt of Notice of Claim 15 calendar days from receipt. [Section 2695.5 (a)] Respond to any communication from a claimant regarding a claim that reasonably suggests a response is expected 15 calendar days after receipt.  [Section 2695.5 (g)] Provide necessary claim forms, instructions and reasonable assistance, except in cases where the first notice of claim is a notice of legal action immediately, but in no event more than 15 calendar days with respect to personal policies.  [Section  2695.5 (h)] Begin any necessary investigation of the claim immediately, but in no event more than 15 calendar days later. [Section 2695.6(a)] Adopt, and communicate to its insurance agents and claims agents, written standards for the prompt investigation and processing of claims within  90 days after the effective date April 14, 1993. [Section 2695.6(b)] After receipt of Proof of Claim accept or deny the claim, in whole or in part, and affirm or deny liability immediately, but in no event more than 40 calendar days later.  [Section 2695.7(b)] Give notice and Explain inability to affirm or deny coverage in writing 40 days after proof of claim and every 30 calendar days thereafter.  [Section 2695.7(c)] Give notice of running of statute of limitations or private limitation of action Unless the claimant is represented by counsel at least 60 days before the date on which the limit is to expire. [Section 2695.7(f)] Tender payment after the insurer’s affirmation of coverage with respect to first party claimants immediately, but in no event more than 30 calendar days after.   [Section 2695.7(h)] 

The California Regulations give the claims people an excuse for failure to meet the time requirements by allowing the claims person to delay completion by advising the policyholder of the inability to meet the time deadline and providing the policyholder with an estimate of the time needed to complete the investigation.

When the insurer fails to fulfill its manual, best practices or the limits set by the local state Regulations it can face claims of failing to meet the standard of care for the handling of claims regardless of the state where the claim is being adjusted. For example, expensive litigation seeking bad faith tort damages will result if the Insurer:

 Fails to advise the Policyholder of the coverages available to it promptly. Fails to conduct a thorough investigation of the claim presented by Policyholder or any investigation at all. 
 In that regard the California Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations, (10 Cal.  Code Reg. § 2695 et.seq. hereinafter the “Regulations”) Section 2695.2 defines the term as follows: “(k) ‘Investigation’ means all activities of an insurer or its claims agent related to the determination of coverage, liabilities, or nature and extent of loss or damage for which benefits are afforded by an insurance policy, obligations or duties under a bond, and other obligations or duties arising from an insurance policy or bond.” Investigation, therefore, requires personal contact with the Policyholder, the claimant, claimant’s counsel, and independent witnesses as well as obtaining official agency investigation information, and necessary documents. 
 Fails to respond to specific inquiries from representatives of the Policyholder in a complete and prompt fashion. Fails to follow the requirements of its own manual. Fails to comply with the minimum standard of care set by the state Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations. Fails to perform a complete and thorough analysis of the policy wording before making a decision with regard to the claim presented by Policyholder. Fails to perform a complete and thorough analysis of the litigation naming the Policyholder as a defendant. Fails to consider any extrinsic facts surrounding the litgation that caused the Policyholder to seek defense and indemnity. Misrepresent to the Policyholder the extent of its investigation, the analysis done with regard to the policy wording, the claim presented by Policyholder, the applicable law and when it would provide Policyholder with its decision with regard to coverage. Fails to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications  with respect to claims arising out of its insurance policies. 

In the best of all possible worlds the Insurer’s claims personnel will apply the custom and practice of the liability insurance industry and conduct an immediate and thorough investigation. Unfortunately most insurers do not, as did Candide, live in the best of all possible worlds. Rather, they often fail to fulfill the custom and practice of the industry and fail to follow their own requirements and those of the various state regulations.

 Adopt Reasonable Standards 

 The prudent insurer will adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt  investigation and processing of claims arising under insurance policies. The prudent insurer will also not impose unreasonable requirements on its claims personnel. They will train their liability claims personnel to recognize that custom and practice require the insurer the adjuster represents to provide the Policyholder with a defense to suits pending against the Policyholder even where only the potential for coverage exists. The insurer will also instruct its claims personnel to resolve the claim against the Policyholder promptly and on behalf of the insured persons.

When the Insurer does not handle the claim for defense by the Policyholder in a  manner consonant with fair claims handling practices or in a manner that has provided the Policyholder with either an “immediate,” or a “complete,” defense. The insurer that fails to comply with industry custom and practice; fails to fulfill the minimum standards of third party liability claims handling to provide an immediate and complete defense to the Policyholder; fails to communicate its decision promptly and in good faith; improperly denies the claim of the Policyholder based upon an improper application of an exclusion; and fails to pay the claim in whole or in part after it admits it owes a duty to defend the Policyholder it faces what will probably be a successful suit for breach of contract and the tort of bad faith.

 The Exposure to Bad Faith Damages 

The insurance industry does not like the tort of bad faith. They recognize, h owever, that almost every state recognizes the tort in some manner. With that knowledge no prudent insurer will employ claims personnel who cannot fulfill the promises made by the wording of the policy and the marketing the insurer uses to convince the Policyholder to acquire the policy.

Failure to do so will provide full employment for the plaintiffs’ bar and will reduce profits of the insurer logarithmically.

Insurers that deal fairly and in good faith with each Policyholder will always succeed. They will avoid unnecessary litigation and will never be required to pay anything more than the indemnity promised by the policy.

 Property Insurance 
 Posted on July 27, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
Contrary to the belief of those insured, property insurance does not insure property. As a risk spreading device property insurance only insures people, partnerships or corporations against the risk of loss of property described in the policy.

 Insurance against the loss of property is a contract of personal indemnity. It only insures the person(s) named in the policy against certain risks of loss to property in which that person has an interest. A person who has an interest in the property, but is not named as an insured, cannot recover under the policy unless the policy is changed. Similarly, a person named on a policy who has no interest cannot ever recover.

As the California Supreme Court observed in Garvey v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co ., 48 Cal. 3d 395, 770 P.2d 704, 257 Cal. Rptr. 292 (Cal. 03/30/1989), a first party insurance policy provides coverage for loss or damage sustained directly by the insured (e.g., life, disability, health, fire, theft, and casualty insurance). A third party liability policy, on the other hand, provides coverage for liability of the insured to a third party (e.g., a Commercial General Liability (CGL), a directors’ and officers’ (D&amp;O) liability, or an errors and omissions (E&amp;O) policy).

The term “perils” in traditional property insurance language refers to fortuitous, active physical forces such as fire, lightning, wind, and explosion, which bring about or cause the loss.

The cause of loss in the context of a property insurance contract is totally different from that in a liability policy. On the contrary, the right to indemnity in the third party liability insurance context draws on traditional tort concepts of fault, proximate cause, and duty. The liability analysis differs substantially from the coverage analysis in the property insurance context, which draws on the relationship between perils that are either covered or excluded by the contract of insurance. In liability insurance, by insuring for personal liability, and agreeing to cover the insured for his own negligence, the insurer agrees to cover the insured for a broader spectrum of risks than those insured by a property policy.

For example, in Smith v. Jim Dandy Markets, 172 F.2d 616 (1949) the Ninth Circuit found that “regardless of Smith’s interest in the building, he suffered no loss from its destruction. Under California law, which the federal court was required to follow, a fire insurance policy is a personal indemnity contract and a showing of pecuniary damage is prerequisite to recovery. See also Davis v. Phoenix Insurance Co ., 111 Cal. 409, 415, 43 P. 1115; and Alexander v. Security-First Nat’l. Bank, 7 Cal.2d 718, 62 P.2d 735; 14 Cal.Jur. 464, 37.”

 Do Not Practice to Deceive Your Insurer 
 Posted on July 26, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Policy Void for Misrepresentation 

 Saeed Moslem (“Moslem”) learned the true meaning of Sir Walter Scott’s Poem“Marmion”(1808) where it stated: “Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive…” Moslem first attempted to get coverage from an insurer based upon false statements in an application and when the insurer resisted because of material misrepresentations he sued his agent. Both attempts failed because, at least in the state of New York, an insured who lies on an application for insurance may recover nothing from his insurer or his insurance agent.

 Suit for Rescission 

In Vermont Mutual Insurance Co. v. Moslem , No. 07 Civ. 7962 (SAS), NYLJ 1202504266878 (SDNY, Decided July 14, 2011) the court granted a motion for summary judgment on Vermont Mutual Insurance Company’s (“Vermont Mutual”) request for an order rescinding the homeowner insurance policy it issued to Defendant Moslem (the“policy”). Plaintiff asserts that Moslem made material misrepresentations in his application for the policy, each of which constitutes an independent basis for rescission. Vermont Mutual now moves for summary judgment.

 Background 

In June, 2005, Moslem purchased a single family home at 2276 Route 302 in Middletown, New York (the“Property”). At the time of the purchase, he insured the Property with a policy from Foremost Insurance Company. On January 6, 2006, Moslem listed the Property for sale but continued to live in the house. In early June, 2006, with the Foremost Policy about to expire, Moslem engaged Douglas Parietti, an insurance broker, from the agency of Parietti&amp;McGuire, to provide a quote for a homeowner’s policy covering the Property.

Parietti used information he obtained from Moslem to complete an application for insurance with Vermont Mutual. On June 14, 2006, Parietti met with Moslem to review the application for the Policy. The final application, dated that day, represented that:

 Moslem was the owner of the house, that he occupied the premises daily, that the house was to be used as a primary dwelling, and that the house was not for sale. It also noted that the house was a new purchase, and that any questions about prior policies were therefore inapplicable. 

The application also contained a warning that insurance benefits may be denied upon the submission of false information, and required applicants to specifically attest that they had read the application in its entirety and believed the information contained therein to be complete and correct.

Moslem signed the application without asking Parietti to make any changes to the document. On June 22, 2006, Vermont Mutual approved the policy for the period from June 22, 2006 through June 22, 2007. Moslem vacated the Property sometime in the first half of 2006 and began leasing it in July without informing anyone at Vermont Mutual.

The Declarations page of the policy summarized its terms as represented in the application.   The rating information for the policy noted that it was a“primary residence”occupied by the owner of the premises. The policy also noted that it would be entirely“void if, whether before or after a loss, an `insured’has . . . [m]ade false statements relating to this insurance.”

On October 8 , 2006, the Property was destroyed by fire. Moslem subsequently filed a claim for property damage under the Policy but was denied coverage by letter dated September 12, 2007, which advised him that“due to material misrepresentations in his application for insurance the homeowner’s Policy was void ab initio. Specifically, during the course of its investigation into the fire, Vermont Mutual discovered the following inaccuracies in Moslem’s application:

(1)”at the time of the Homeowner’s Application, the Premises was a new purchase;”

(2)”there was no prior insurance, and thus no prior Policy number;”

(3)”Moslem has no other residence owned, occupied or rented;”and

(4)“the Premises were not for sale.”

Vermont Mutual found that these representations“were material to the risk to be insured since, had Vermont Mutual known the true state of facts, it would have led to a refusal by Vermont Mutual to issue the Policy.”

 Rescission 

Under New York Law,“`to establish its right to rescind an insurance policy, an insurer must demonstrate that the insured made a material misrepresentation. A misrepresentation is material when the insurer would not have issued the policy had it known the facts misrepresented’” 

Materiality is usually a question of fact for the jury. However, where the evidence concerning the materiality is clear and substantially uncontradicted, the matter is one of law for the court to determine. To establish materiality as a matter of law, the insurer must present documentation concerning its underwriting practices, such as underwriting manuals, bulletins, or rules pertaining to similar risks, that show that it would not have issued the same Policy if the correct information had been disclosed in the application.

 Analysis 

The court concluded that the policy may be rescinded because there is documentary evidence that Moslem’s misrepresentations were material to its issuance. Vermont Mutual’s Homeowners Policy Program Manual (the“Manual”) lists eligibility requirements for applicants and properties for homeowners policies. The true facts made Moslem and his home inelligible for insurance with Vermont.

Moslem stated in has application for the Policy that he, the owner of the house and occupier of the house on the Property. This was a misrepresentation of fact that induced Vermont Mutual to approve a policy it would not have otherwise almost immediately after the application was submitted. The Misrepresentation was material as a matter of law, and Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is granted.

 Suit Against Agent 

 In Moslem v. Parietti&amp;Mcguire Insurance Agency , Dist. Court, SD New York 2011 (February 24, 2011) Moslem sued his agent for putting him in the position of finding his policy rescinded by Vermont Mutual. That also failed.

Moslem asserted that he did not read the insurance application in its entirety, and that any misrepresentations in the document were generated by Parietti. However, even assuming that Moslem played no role in supplying the false information incorporated in the insurance application, he remains liable under New York law for the misrepresentations on the final document because he had an independent obligation to verify the insurance application before it was submitted. Under New York law, the signer of a contract is conclusively bound by it regardless of whether he or she actually read it.  An insured cannot remain silent while cognizant that his insurance application contains misleading or incorrect information but has a duty to review the entire application and to correct any incorrect or incomplete answers.

Whether or not plaintiff intended to provide inaccurate statements or misrepresentations at the time he filled out the application is irrelevant, as he was bound by those answers and swore to their accuracy by signing the application. It is undisputed that Moslem in fact signed the application, and thus effectively endorsed the misrepresentations and made them his own.

The court, on the agent’s motion for summary judgment, concluded: “Moslem cannot seek legal protection from the consequences of his own culpable or negligent acts in submitting the Vermont Mutual Policy.” To the extent that Moslem suffered damages because Vermont Mutual would not compensate him for property damage under the policy, his injury is directly traceable to his own independent conduct in signing the application.

 Lessons 

It does not pay to lie when you apply for insurance. When you lie it does not pay to blame someone else if you sign the application containing the lies. Insurance is a contract of utmost good faith. That means the insured must act fairly and in good faith when applying for insurance. Failure to do so, deceiving an insurer that would not insure a particular risk, will create a policy that is less viable than a wisp of smoke.

 Extrinsic Evidence Must Be Considered in Texas to Determine Duty to Indemnify 
 Posted on July 25, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Eight Corners Rule Only for Duty to Defend in Texas 

 The state of Texas is now officially confused, dyslexic or performing a wild balancing act with regard to interpretation of an insurance policy’s duty to defend and indemnify. When asked to determine a duty to defend the courts in Texas are required to apply the eight corners rule and limit their analysis of coverage to the allegations of the complaint filed by the plaintiff but when it is asked to determine whether there is coverage for indemnity it must look to both the eight corners and extrinsic evidence. Why extrinsic evidence cannot be used to determine coverage for a defense, as it is in other states, is not explained by the Texas Supreme Court in The Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company F/k/a the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company v. National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa , NO. 10-0064 SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS, 334 S.W.3d 217; 2011 Tex. LEXIS 130; 54  Tex. Sup. J. 599, February 25, 2011.

Since the Supreme Court sent the case back down there will probably be another appeal.

 The Facts 

The Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) sought a declaratory judgment that National Union Fire Insurance Company owed duties to defend and indemnify BNSF in a personal injury suit resulting from a collision between one of its trains and an automobile. The trial court granted National Union’s motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals affirmed. 

In 1994, BNSF contracted with SSI Mobley (Mobley) to control vegetation along certain areas of BNSF’s right-of-way. The contract term was“1994 through 1996.”Pursuant to the contract, which required Mobley to purchase a comprehensive general liability (CGL) policy naming BNSF as an additional insured, Mobley purchased a CGL policy from National Union. Mobley also purchased an umbrella policy from National Union.

On August 25, 1995, a collision took place at a railroad crossing between a BNSF train and an automobile. The driver of the car and one of the passengers were killed; the second passenger was injured. Separate suits filed by survivors of the driver and deceased passenger were eventually consolidated. Pleadings in the consolidated suit alleged that excessive vegetation near the crossing obstructed the driver’s view of the oncoming train. The pleadings, in part, stated that the Railroad had a contract with SS Mobley Company to carry out chemical weed control. SS Mobley failed to use reasonable care to carry out its chemical weed control, and because of its improper timing and application of chemical weed control, there was excessive vegetation at the crossing at the time of the collision, which proximately caused the collision.

 BNSF tendered defense of the case to National Union. After National Union denied that it had either a duty to defend or indemnify, BNSF filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that National Union had both duties. While the declaratory judgment suit was pending, BNSF settled the claims arising from the death of the driver. It also reached a high-low settlement agreement with the other claimants: BNSF and the claimants agreed that the claimants would receive $1 million if the jury returned a verdict less than that amount, $8 million if the verdict exceeded that amount, or the claimants would receive the exact amount of the verdict if the jury awarded between $1 million and $8 million. The case was then tried to a jury which returned a plaintiff’s verdict of over $27 million. BNSF paid $8 million according to the high-low settlement agreement.

 The Lower Courts 

The trial court granted National Union’s motion, and entered a take-nothing judgment against BNSF. The court of appeals affirmed. The trial court and court of appeals court applied the eight-corners rule in determining National Union’s duty to defend. T he court of appeals first determined that National Union did not have a duty to defend. It then concluded that National Union did not have a duty to indemnify because BNSF’s arguments as to National Union’s duty to indemnify were“based entirely on its duty to defend arguments.”

The court of appeals did not consider evidence extrinsic to the policy and the pleadings when reaching its decision that there was no duty to indemnify. BNSF challenged the court of appeals’conclusions as to both National Union’s duty to defend and its duty to indemnify. It maintains that the court of appeals:

(1)     incorrectly applied the eight-corners rule when determining whether National Union owed a duty to defend, and

(2)     erred in failing to consider extrinsic evidence when determining whether National Union had a duty to indemnify.

National Union responded that:

(1)     the court of appeals correctly applied the eight-corners rule, and

(2)     even if the court of appeals had analyzed National Union’s duty to indemnify in light of extrinsic evidence, its conclusion would have been the same: National Union does not

have a duty to indemnify BNSF.

 Analysis 

 As relevant to the Supreme Court’s consideration of this matter, National Union’s policy coverage contains a“completed operations”exclusion which excludes coverage for“all‘bodily injury’and‘property damage’occurring away from premises [Mobley] own[s] or rent[s] and arising out of‘[Mobley&apos;s] product’or‘[Mobley&apos;s] work.’”However, the policy also excepts from the completed operations exclusion“[w]ork that has not yet been completed or abandoned.”

The duty to defend and the duty to indemnify“enjoy a degree of independence from each other.”The duty to defend arises before litigation is completed, thus the determination as to duty to defend is according to the eight-corners rule wherein only the pleadings and the policy language are considered. On the other hand, the insurer’s duty to indemnify is determined based on the facts actually established in the underlying suit.

In some circumstances the pleadings can negate both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. The Supreme Court noted that the principle underlying its earlier decisions did not control because National Union did not have a duty to defend because the language in the plaintiffs’pleadings referenced Mobley’s actions as having happened in the past, so the policy’s“completed operations”exclusion precluded a duty to defend.  But, in this case the pleadings do not show that contractual provisions and other extrinsic evidence cannot possibly bring Mobley’s vegetation control operations within coverage of National Union’s policy for the 1995 accident when Mobley’s contract unquestionably extended through 1996.

 Conclusion 

Because the court of appeals did not consider evidence extrinsic to the pleadings and insurance policy in determining whether National Union owed a duty to indemnify, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings.

 Lessons 

All litigators and litigants—and their insurers—must understand that nothing is ever certain in the law and that courts will invariably confuse the litigants and their co unsel. When trying to understand an insurance policy it is odd to limit the decision to the allegations a plaintiff makes in a law suit. Lawyers are creative and intelligent people who prefer to have defendants with insurance than defendants without insurance. If that lawyer can carefully plead the suit in a way that would provide coverage to the defendant than a suit that would deprive the defendant of coverage, the plaintiffs’lawyer will opt for allegations that provide coverage. That is why a lawyer—in a state like Texas that applies the eight corners rule—will plead a assault and battery with an alternative claim of negligence to be certain that coverage would be available even if there was no evidence of negligence.

It would appear that the rule that allows extrinsic evidence to be used to determine both defense and indemnity is best. Had extrinsic evidence been used to determine a duty to defend in this Texas case that evidence might have provided coverage as it might for indemnity.

I know of at least one case where Plaintiffs’counsel was instructed by his clients to plead the suit solely in intentional torts so that the defendant would have no coverage and would be forced to pay his own attorneys fees. To not use extrinsic evidence to make a coverage decision is to give control to the plaintiffs’attorney and either provide a defense and indemnity not owed or deprive a policy holder of defense or indemnity owed.

The Texas Supreme Court was correct when it returned the case to determine if extrinsic evidence required the insurer to indemnify and should have considered reversing the decision on duty to defend for the same reason. The eight corners rule and the four corners rule should go the way of the DoDo Bird.

 Exhaustion of Policy Limits 
 Posted on July 22, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Failure of Attempt to Avoid Costs of Defense 

 Every insurer and defense lawyer knows that the most expensive part of a third-party liability claim when the insured has small limits is the cost to defend. Insurers spend their wits and energies to avoid payment of defense costs and limit their exposure to the indemnity limits of liability stated in the policy.

In a serious automobile accident case where one person was killed and another seriously injured a $30,000 liability limit of liability would never be sufficient to compensate the injured parties. When the insurer was unable to settle with the injured parties for the policy limit it attempted to avoid the cost of defending its insured by claiming it had no interest in the funds, deposited them into the court, and claimed the policy was exhausted thereby eliminating the duty to defend.

When Benchmark, an insurer, attempted to avoid its obligation to defend its insured it failed. The Nevada Supreme Court found Benchmark’s policy provision was ambiguous with regard to exhaustion of limits and found that Benchmark was obligated to defend the insured until its limits were exhausted by payments of settlements or judgments in Benchmark Insurance Company vs. Robert M. Sparks, Individually; and Universal Underwriters’Insurance Company, Robert M. Sparks; Individually vs.  Universal Underwriters’Insurance Company; and Benchmark Insurance Company , 127 Nev. Adv. Op. 33, 127 Nev. Adv. Op. 33 (Nev. 2011) .

 FACTS 

Sparks was test-driving a vehicle owned by a Las Vegas car dealership. During the test-drive, Sparks was involved in an accident in which one person was killed and another was seriously injured. The victims and their families brought a negligence action against both Sparks and the dealership. Realizing that Sparks’liability for the accident could far exceed the $30,000 liability limit on his insurance policy, Benchmark filed an interpleader action, seeking permission. to deposit the policy limits with the district court for dispersal to the appropriate parties. It then filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a determination that once the court accepted the deposited funds, Benchmark would have no further obligation to defend Sparks in the underlying tort lawsuit.

Benchmark’s justification for its summary judgment motion was a provision in its policy with Sparks, which stated: 
 
 We will pay damages for“bodily injury”or“property damage”for which any“insured”becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident. . . . We will settle or defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or suit asking for these damages. In addition to our limit of liability, we will pay all defense costs we incur. Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted . (Emphasis added)
 
 
 Benchmark argued that its liability under the policy was“exhausted”once it deposited the policy limits with the court. Benchmark’s position prompted Sparks to file a complaint seeking alternative coverage against the car dealership’s insurer, Universal Underwriters’Insurance Company, contending that he was a permissive user of the dealership’s vehicle at the time of the accident. Universal filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that its policy with the dealership effectively withdrew coverage for any permissive user who was already covered under his or her own insurance policy.

The district court granted Benchmark permission to deposit the policy limits but denied Benchmark’s motion for summary judgment, determining that Benchmark’s duty to defend Sparks extended beyond its tender of the policy limits. Pursuant to the court’s order, Benchmark provided a defense for Sparks throughout the underlying trial and the subsequent appeal from the judgment on jury verdict.

 The Issue 

Benchmark challenged the district court’s order denying its summary judgment motion. The sole issue presented by Benchmark’s appeal is one of contract interpretation: whether the exhaustion provision in Benchmark’s auto liability policy was effective to terminate its duty to defend Sparks once the policy limits had been deposited with the court.

It is axiomatic that an insurer may contractually limit its duties if it does so unambiguously. An insurance policy is a contract between a policyholder and an insurer in which the policyholder agrees to pay premiums in exchange for financial protection from foreseeable, yet unpreventable, events.  As such, the duties undertaken by the policyholder and the insurer are defined by the terms of the policy itself. 

The Supreme Court concluded that Benchmark did not unambiguously convey that it could terminate its duty  to defend by depositing the policy’s liability limits with the district court.  Analyzing whether the exhaustion provision in Benchmark’s policy is susceptible to more than one interpretation. Specifically the insurer plainly stated to the policyholder that it will settle or defend, as it considers appropriate, any claim or suit. The Supreme Court noted that courts in other jurisdictions concluded that an insurer does not truly“exhaust”its liability simply by depositing the policy’s limits with the court.  The term‘exhaust’does not encompass the paying into court of the policy limits, but interpret that term to mean the payment either of a settlement or of a judgment wholly depleting the policy amount.

The insurer expressly promised the policyholder to do one of those two things.  Given the provision’s ambiguity the Supreme Court concluded that the provision must be interpreted favorably to the insured. So interpreted, it means that the insurer’s duty to defend continues until its coverage limits have been exhausted in the settlement of a claim or claims against the insured or until judgment against the insured is reached. The Nevada Supreme Court held that the exhaustion provision in Benchmark’s auto liability policy is ambiguous because it is“reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.”

The Supreme Court noted that that several jurisdictions have found this same language to be unambiguous but was not convinced because the insurers in the cases from other jurisdictions had actually used the policy’s limits to procure a settlement on behalf of their policyholders.

 The Supreme Court concluded that Sparks would have reasonably expected that Benchmark would continue to provide him with a legal defense until it used his policy’s liability limits to procure a settlement on. his behalf or until the limits were used to satisfy a judgment entered against him in the tort lawsuit. Because Benchmark did not procure a settlement on Sparks’behalf, its duty to defend him continued until the policy’s limits were used to satisfy a judgment in. the lawsuit.

While Benchmark was free to contract its way around the general rule regarding an insurer’s duty to defend its policyholder, the exhaustion provision in its policy was ambiguous with regard to whether depositing fund in court exhausted the policy the Supreme Court required it to defend until judgment was entered or the suit was settled.

Because the jury apportioned no monetary liability to Sparks, Benchmark never actually used the policy’s limits to satisfy a judgment. As such, its duty to defend continued through the tort lawsuit’s appeal process.

 Lesson 

The duty to defend, as most policies are written, extend until its limits are paid in settlements or judgments. The only way to avoid the duty to defend with low policy limits is to change the wording of the insurance policy to define the term to avoid payment of defense costs. If that is done it will change the promises most people believe their insurer are making and would require a knowing and intelligent decision of the insured to take less coverage than he, she or it expects.

To do what Benchmark attempted its policy would have had to read something like: that which follows. I don’t recommend such language being used any more than I would recommend a policy that said“we insure nothing and will pay you nothing in the event of a loss”because it is not insurance and could not be sold.
 
 We May Exhaust The Limit By Paying it into Court
 

Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted by payment of settlements, judgments or, at our sole option, the deposit of the policy limits in the court for the benefit of the person(s) who claim they were injured by you.
 
Even if such language is included the insured must agree to it and must be advised and agree, for a major reduction in premium, that the insured would be required to pay for the insured’s cost of defense at the option of the insurer.

Of course, by so doing, the coverage provided is much less than that provided by other insurers and takes away from the insured the coverage he, she or it is most interested in buying. It can be written but may such a policy would not be saleable. As the court stated the insurer is free to contract with its insured in any terms it can sell. It could even write a policy that states “we will pay nothing if you make a claim to us nor will we ever pay a claim.” No one with any sense would buy it but it could be written.

What Benchmark tried in this case was unconscionable. Its one saving grace was that it defended Sparks through trial and obtained a defense verdict. It should have kept the promise it made and if it thought exposure faced by the insured exceeded its limits it should have settled.

The real question is who will get the $30,000 deposited into court now that the court found that Sparks owed nothing. Perhaps it will go to Mr. Sparks. It should not be returned to Benchmark as punishment for an obvious attempt to avoid paying the defense costs it promised to pay.

 Certificate Of Insurance Does Not Modify Terms Of Policy To Include Additional Insured 
 Posted on July 21, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Never Rely on a Certificate Alone 

 Insurance agents and brokers often issue, at the request of the named insured, certificates of insurance representing the insurance in effect as a matter of course. Sometimes, they do so without the authority of the insurer. That failure exposes the agent or broker to serious errors and omissions law suits claiming negligence and fraud.  In Janusz Golasiewski v. Waste Management of Pennsylvania, Inc ., 2011 WL 2133788,  No. 09-CV-5180 (RRM) (E.D.N.Y. 05/27/2011)  Waste Management of Pennsylvania, Inc. (“Waste Management”) was named as an additional insured on two certificates of insurance issued by the broker of Waste Management vendors as required by contract.

Unfortunately for the agent or broker, the vendors and Waste Management the policies had not been endorsed to name Waste Management as an additional insured or insured.

 Facts 

Janusz Golasiewski (Plaintiff) brought a lawsuit against Waste Management in connection with injuries Plaintiff sustained at a solid waste transfer station. National Union Fire Insurance Company (“National Union”) was named as a third party defendant and moved to dismiss defendant Waste Management’s third-party claims against it because its policy did not insure Waste Management. 

Waste Management is a Pennsylvania corporation in the business of providing solid waste transportation services. Waste Management entered into a Transportation Service Agreement (“the Service Contract”) with WB Services, Inc. (“WB”), another Pennsylvania corporation. Under the Service Contract, WB agreed to transport waste from the Forge Transfer Station, a waste transfer station located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that Waste Management operates.  The Service Contract required WB to indemnify Waste Management against any damages arising from any personal injury suffered at the Forge Transfer Station, including injuries suffered by employees of WB.

In addition, the Service Contract obligates WB to obtain certain insurance coverage, including workers compensation, employer’s liability, and general liability, and to name Waste Management as an additional insured under its coverage. To evidence compliance, WB was required to deliver a certificate of insurance naming Waste Management as an additional insured before performing its waste transportation duties. The Service Contract permitted WB to hire subcontractors and obligated WB’s subcontractors to comply with the terms and conditions of the Service Contract, including its insurance and indemnification provisions. WB subcontracted its waste transportation responsibilities to LU Transport, Inc., (“LU”) an Illinois corporation.

Both WB and LU retained Invincia Corporation (“Invincia”) to obtain the insurance coverage required under the Service Contract. Invincia procured workers compensation and employer’s liability coverage from the National Union Fire Insurance Company (“National Union”), general liability coverage from Delos Insurance Company (“Delos”), and excess umbrella coverage from the Lexington Insurance Company (“Lexington”). On June 12, 2008 Invincia produced certificates of insurance with respect to both WB’s and LU’s policies. The certificates indicated that the insurance coverage was effective from June 16, 2008 through June 16, 2009.  Both certificates listed“Waste Management”as an additional insured for Auto Liability and General Liability. At no time, however, did Invicia obtain an endorsement from the insurer naming Waste Management as an additional insured. Contrary to the representations made in the certificates of insurance as to Waste Management the certificates recited the following in capital lettering:
 
 THIS CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED AS A MATTER OF INFORMATION ONLY AND CONFERS NO RIGHTS UPON THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER. THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT AMEND, EXTEND OR ALTER THE COVERAGE AFFORDED BY THE POLICIES BELOW. 
 
On the reverse side, both certificates of insurance state,“If the certificate holder is an ADDITIONAL INSURED, the policy(ies) must be endorsed. A statement on this certificate does not confer rights to the certificate holder in lieu of such endorsement(s) .”[Emphasis added]

On December 5, 2008, Plaintiff sustained injuries at the Forge Transfer Station operated by Waste Management. On October 26, 2009, Plaintiff filed suit in the Supreme Court of New York, Kings County alleging that Waste Management’s negligent supervision over the Forge Transfer Station caused his injuries. Waste Management then removed this case to federal court.

 The Litigation 

On July 8, 2010, Waste Management filed a third-party complaint asserting claims against WB, LU, Invincia, National Union, Delos and Lexington. Waste Management’s third-party complaint alleged that LU and WB are related entities and that Plaintiff was acting within the scope of his employment at the time he was injured. With respect to National Union, Waste Management sought a declaratory judgment that National Union is obligated to defend and indemnify Waste Management as an additional insured under either or both of WB’s and LU’s policies.

Waste Management’s third-party complaint attaches the Service Contract and the certificates of insurance as exhibits and they are therefore deemed part of the complaint. In addition, Waste Management’s complaint relies heavily on the terms and provisions of the insurance policies that National Union provided to WB and LU. National Union submitted both policies in connection with its motion to dismiss.

Waste Management argued that dismissal of its claims against National Union would be premature because it should be entitled to investigate whether it is an additional insured under either or both of WB’s or LU’s insurance policies with National Union, and whether Plaintiff was employed by WB by operation of law. For the following reasons, neither argument has merit.

An insurance policy is a contract between the insured and the insurer. A court must interpret a contract of insurance to give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed by the policy language. The court concluded:
 
 The obligations of an insurer are governed exclusively by the contract and will not extend beyond the language of the policy. While ambiguity is resolved in favor of the insured, where the provisions of a contract are clear they must be applied in a manner that effectuates their plain meaning. 
 
 Conclusion 

Since the policy clearly and unambiguously stated that the only agreements relating to this insurance are stated in the policy. The terms of the policy may not be changed or waived except by endorsement issued by us to be part of the policy. Since neither policy lists Waste Management as an insured or an additional insured covered under the policy the clear and unambiguous language provides that Waste Management is not covered under either of the policies issued by National Union. The fact that Waste Management is listed as an additional insured on the certificates of insurance do not alter the court’s conclusion. The policies clearly state that they may be amended only through an endorsement issued by the insurance company. No such endorsement was issued. 

Moreover, the certificates, which were issued by Invincia, the insurance broker, state that they do not amend, extend, or alter the coverage that is provided. Courts in both New York and Pennsylvania, when confronted with certificates of insurance that include similar disclaimers, have concluded that the certificates do not extend coverage beyond that which is provided for in the policy. Waste Management cannot establish that it is an additional insured under either WB’s or LU’s insurance policies with National Union.

Simply because a party is listed in a Certificate of Insurance as an additional insured does not make that party an additional insured. 

 Lesson 

Certificates of insurance do not change the wording of a policy. An agent or broker issuing a certificate naming some one as an additional insured must be certain that the policy has been endorsed to name the additional insured. Failure to do so will expose the agent to errors and omissions litigation. The agent or broker must not issue certificates as a matter of course but are obligated to comply with its professional responsibility. Invincia, in the Waste Management case, failed to do what it was asked to do by its customers and exposed them and Waste Management to litigation that should not have been necessary.

Waste Management, and any insured like it, faced with certificates of insurance like those presented to Waste Management should protect itself by requiring presentation of a copy of the endorsement issued by the insurer naming it as an additional insured to avoid litigation and lack of coverage.

 An Intentional Act Can Never Be an Accident 
 Posted on July 20, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 I Didn’t Mean to Hurt Him When I Hit Him in Groin
 

By definition insurance only provides indemnity for a contingent or unknown event. Intentional acts—whether they intend to cause harm or not—are neither contingent nor unknown and cannot be insured. In most liability insurance policies the term“occurrence”must be an accident. Therefore, punching someone vigorously, whether intended to cause harm or not, is not an accident and is not insurable as an occurrence.

One of the most extreme situations where an insured almost got coverage for an intentional act was in State Farm General Insurance  Company v. Patrick Frake et al., Court of Appeals, 2nd Appellate Dist., 7th Div., 2011 the California Court of Appeal. It reversed a trial court by concluding that an intentional act that causes injury, whether intended by the actor or not, is not an “accident” nor an “occurrence” as those terms are used in a liability insurance policy and the concluded that the insurer neither owed defense nor indemnity.

 Facts 

After consuming several beers, Patrick Frake (Frake) struck his friend,  Respondent John King, in the groin, causing significant injuries.  King filed a complaint  against Frake for negligence, assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional  distress.  Frake tendered the c ase to State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm) under a renter’s policy that provided coverage for bodily injury “caused by an  occurrence,” which the policy defined as “an accident.”

Frake told State Farm he struck  King as part of a consensual game and that he did not intend to injure King.  Although  State Farm did not believe Frake’s conduct qualified as “an accident,” it agreed to defend  the action with a full reservation of its rights.  The King case proceeded to trial and the  jury awarded King over $400,000.

On November 9, 2006, State Farm informed Frake that, based on its investigation,  there was no “potential for coverage for this lawsuit” because “the plaintiff has alleged no  accidental conduct on your part, as is required in order to constitute an occurrence as  defined [in the policy].”

State Farm explained that “the defense provided is without a waiver of our position that  there is no coverage afforded for these claims,” and specifically reserved its right to “file  a declaratory relief action to obtain the court’s determination with respect to whether  there is a duty to defend or indemnify your client from these claims,” and “seek  reimbursement of attorney‟s fees and costs expended on your client‟s behalf in the  defense of this matter.”

 State Farm’s Declaratory Relief Action 

Following the hearing, the trial court issued a minute order denying State Farm’s  motions for summary judgment, stating that “a triable issue of fact remains as to whether  or not State Farm had knowledge of extrinsic facts that created a potential for coverage at  the time that its insured Frake demanded a defense.” 

In February of 2009, Frake and King filed motions for summary adjudication  arguing that because the trial court found there were triable issues of fact precluding State  Farm’s motion for summary judgment, State Farm was, as a matter of law, required to  tender a defense in the underlying action.  The trial court agreed.  The trial court concluded that an insurer has a duty to defend  “where the facts [are] such that the insured acted deliberately, but did not intend the  resulting injury.”

Following the trial court’s ruling, the parties entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment against State Farm, which was intended to facilitate State Farm’s appeal of the  dispositive coverage issue in this case. On March 5, 2010, the trial court entered  judgment in favor of Frake and King in the stipulated amount of $670,000.  State Farm  filed a timely appeal.

 The Injury Trial 

King’s case against Frake proceeded to trial solely on a negligence theory.  Frake’s trial testimony was substantially consistent with the statement he had given State Farm during its initial investigation of the claim.  Specifically, Frake stated that, since  high school, he and his friends had engaged in a “physical touching game,” which he  described as “hitting each other in the arm, the back, the stomach, grabbing . . .the  groin . . . as well as the butt.”  Frake stated that such acts were not intended to elicit a  “temporary response of pain,” but rather it was a game, “just like tag.” 

The jury found that Frake had acted negligently and awarded King over $450,000  in damages.  After the judgment was entered, “Frake and King entered into an agreement  in which, in exchange for a covenant not to execute on the judgment, Frake assigned  King all assignable claims against State Farm arising from its failure to defend and  indemnify him.”

 Declaratory Relief Action 

State Farm then filed a declaratory relief action alleging that it had no duty to  defend or indemnify Frake because his conduct did not qualify as an accident within the  meaning of his insurance policy.  Frake and King each filed cross-complaints alleging  breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Several months later, the parties filed cross-motions for summary adjudication  regarding State Farm’s duty to defend.  The trial court concluded that the term “accident”  applied to deliberate conduct that resulted in unintentional injury and, as a result, there  was a triable issue of fact regarding State Farm’s duty to defend.  The court further ruled  that because there was this potential for coverage, Frake and King had established that  State Farm had a duty to defend.  The parties thereafter entered into a stipulated judgment  against State Farm in the amount of $670,000.

 The Appeal 

 On appeal, State Farm argued that the trial court erred in concluding that a  deliberate act may qualify as an “accident” if the insured did not intend to cause the  resulting injury.  The Court of Appeal agreed and reversed the trial court’s judgment.

The issue was whether State Farm had a duty to defend its insured,  Patrick Frake, in an action brought by King. The duty may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop. To prevail in an action seeking declaratory relief on the question of the duty to  defend, the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage, while the  insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.  In other words, the insured need  only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage; the insurer must  prove it cannot.

The evidence establishes that State Farm did not have a duty to defend because the term “accident” does not apply to deliberate conduct that directly  causes injury regardless of whether the injury was intended. Under California law, the word “accident” in the coverage clause of a liability policy refers to the conduct of the insured for which liability is sought to be imposed on the insured. The term “accident” refers to the nature of the conduct  itself rather than to its consequences.

 The insured’s subjective  intent is irrelevant. 

Under the policy, “an “occurrence” is  a causal event, defined as an “accident.”  In this context, an “accident” cannot mean  unintended damage because the causal event also would be the result.  Logically, a  consequence cannot cause itself. An intentional act is not an “accident” within the plain  meaning of the word.
 
 The term “accident” and the term “occurrence” as used in a liability policy refers to the nature of the act giving rise to liability; not to the insured’s intent to cause harm.

 Liability Insurance Claims 
 Posted on July 19, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
Insurance was originally designed to protect individuals against the risk of loss to property in which the individual had an interest. The growth of major cities and the Industrial Revolution brought on a need for insurance against claims by third parties for tort damages. Third party liability insurance was created to fulfill this need.

 Understanding Third Party Insurance 

 The insured (the first party)  acquires insurance from the insurer (the second party) that promises to indemnify the insured from claims of tort damages by an injured person (the third party). Almost all third party liability policies also promise to defend the insured. Third party liability policies evolved over many decades into multiple volumes of different specialized coverages.

Third party liability insurance policies do not mention the existence of the insurance adjuster. The policy merely makes various promises limited by the terms and conditions of the policy wording such as a promise to pay indemnity or costs of defense.  Insurers quickly learned that simply waiting for a need for indemnity that it was important to appoint adjusters to protect the interest of the insured and the insurer since most individuals are unable to deal with claims of tort damage and litigation.

Insurance adjusters are called upon to read and understand the various types of liability insurance policies and apply the coverages provided to fulfill the promises made by the policy. It is the obligation of the adjuster to complete an investigation of a liability insurance claim and fulfill the promises made by the insurer at the time the policy was acquired by the insured.

The third party liability adjuster is, therefore, an investigator, an insurance contract expert, and a person of empathy who fulfills the promises made in the policy to defend and indemnify the insured. The adjuster is charged with protecting the assets of insured and the insurer so that all claims owed are paid and that no payments are made if not owed by the insurer.

 Third-party insurance 

The intent of a third party liability policy is to pay to defend or indemnify the insured against claims that actions of the insured caused damage to the person or property of some other person or entity. It reserves to itself the option to investigate and settle claims against the insured. Applying the strict language of the policy the insurer need only sit back, pay the costs of defense and pay any judgment entered up to the limits of the policy.

Insurers found that applying the terms of the insurance policy passively did not work. The adjuster became necessary to protect the insured from an inadequate or incompetent investigation or defense and to protect its insurer against the expenditure of excessive defense costs and judgments entered against the insured as a result of inadequate investigation and defense of litigation.

 Types of Policies 

Third party insurance comes in various guises all of which are designed to protect a person or entity, the insured, against the risks of loss to third persons due to acts or omissions of the insured. For example, the California Insurance Code defines liability insurance as follows:
 
 Liability insurance includes: 
 (a) Insurance against loss resulting from liability for injury, fatal or nonfatal, suffered by any natural person, or resulting from liability for damage to property, or property interests of others but does not include worker’s compensation, common carrier liability, boiler and machinery, or team and vehicle insurance. 

 * * * 

 (c) Insurance covering injuries sustained by an insured resulting from a tort committed by a third party against which such third party is not himself covered by liability insurance; 

 (d)  Insurance coverage against the legal liability of the insured, and against loss, damage, or expense incident to a claim arising out of the death or injury of any person as the result of negligence or malpractice in rendering professional services by any person who holds a certificate or license. (California Insurance Code § 108.) 
 
The legislation is a detailed summary of years of common law defining the purpose and types of liability insurance.

The California Supreme Court observed in Garvey v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co ., 770 P.2d 704 (Cal. 1989) that a first party insurance policy provides coverage for loss or damage sustained directly by the insured (e.g., life, disability, health, fire, theft, and casualty insurance). A third party liability policy, in contrast, provides coverage for liability of the insured to a third party (e.g., a Commercial General Liability insurance policy (CGL), a directors’ and officers’ liability policy, or an errors and omissions policy).

 In the typical third party liability policy, the carrier assumes a contractual duty to pay judgments the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by the insured. The difference in the nature of the risks insured against under first party property policies and third party liability policies is also reflected in the differing causation analyses that must be undertaken to determine coverage under each type of policy.

Unlike first party policies the insured is not paid by a third party policy. The insured only obtains indemnity and a defense from a third party policy to claims made by the third parties. Payment, if any is made, is made to the claimant and to the lawyers needed to defend the insured.

In a simple liability claim commonly seen by liability insurers a homeowner insured by a basic homeowners policy receives a claim for bodily injury from the postman who serves his house. A neighbor alleged he tripped and fell over a rake negligently left in the walkway to the insured’s front door resulting in a broken nose. The homeowner reports the accident to the insurer  whose adjuster investigates, meets with the neighbor carrier and resolves the claim by negotiating an amicable settlement on behalf of the insured.

If the claim is reported promptly to the insurer and investigated quickly it can be resolved without the need for a lawyer.

Late reports of loss or less than prompt settlement can result in unnecessary litigation.  Serious injuries that cannot easily be resolved by an adjuster become litigated. The insurer then retains the services of an attorney to defend the insured to the allegations of the claimant. Before a lawyer can assist an insured or an insurer in a dispute arising from a third party liability claim a thorough knowledge of insurance claims adjustment process is necessary. The lawyer must understand the tasks insurers expect adjusters to accomplish, how the adjuster will work to accomplish those tasks and what a lawyer can provide the adjuster to aid in the task.

Every lawyer retained to prosecute or defend a civil suit should begin the representation with efforts to find insurance coverage for the benefit of the client. Indeed, a lawyer that does not know insurance and how an adjuster deals with insurance claims is litigating through a veil of ignorance. 

Since insurance is an important source of funds for success of a civil law practice it is imperative that every lawyer have a basic understanding of the law of insurance and insurance claims adjusting. In the U.S., California has, by statute, created one of the clearest definitions of insurance. The California Insurance Code states: 
 
 Insurance is a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event. [California Insurance Code § 22] 
 
The California Legislature, by Insurance Code Section 22, merely codified three centuries of common law defining insurance. This definition should apply in most states. Whether codified, or only part of the state’s common law, there can only be insurance if there is an agreement to indemnify against a contingent or unknown event.

The California Legislature also made the following clear: 
 
 “Insurer”for the purposes of this article includes every organization organized for the purpose of assuming the risk of loss under contracts of insurance or reinsurance,…[California Insurance Code § 826] 
 
The insurer’s claims adjuster can be an employee of the insurer or an independent contractor retained by the insurer to adjust insurance claims on behalf of the insurer. The claims adjuster is the contact between the insured and the insurer.  The claims adjuster meets with the insured (either in person or by telephone) to explain to the insured the coverages available, complete a thorough investigation and to negotiate a settlement.

 The Adjuster as a Dispute Resolution Expert 

 It is the basic role of the third party claims adjuster to keep lawyers out of the claims process if possible. The adjuster’s investigation is designed to gather sufficient facts to determine whether the insured is liable to the third party claimant and, if so, to negotiate a prompt and equitable settlement of the claim. If the claim is settled there is no need for a lawyer to become involved for either the insured or the insurer.

The adjuster is the ultimate alternative dispute resolution process. The adjuster resolves the dispute before the parties become emotionally involved in the process that litigation becomes necessary. The adjuster who does the job properly resolves almost all claims assigned by the insurer without the involvement of counsel. It is only when the issues of the applicability of coverage arise or the efforts of the adjuster to resolve the claim fail that lawyers are needed.

Adjusting third party liability insurance claims requires skill, patience and knowledge of insurance and investigation techniques.  The claims adjuster is faced with the following basic obligations:

1.    To thoroughly investigate all claims assigned.

2.    To conduct the investigation fairly and in good faith with an intent to find coverage for the loss presented by the insured.

3.    To analyze the insurance coverage and apply the facts established by the thorough investigation to the policy wording.

4.    To pay promptly all claims the insurer owes under the contract.

5.    To resist, and not pay, all claims the insurer does not owe under the contract of insurance.

The claims adjuster is faced with the obligation to thoroughly investigate all claims assigned. The adjuster is required to conduct the investigation into the third party claim fairly and in good faith with an intent to find coverage for the loss presented by the insured. The adjuster must also analyze the insurance coverage and apply the facts established by the thorough investigation to the policy wording. If coverage is established and the insured’s liability to the third party is clear the adjuster must pay promptly all claims the insurer owes under the contract. The adjuster must, if there is no coverage for the loss or the insured is not liable to the third party, resist, and not pay, any claims the insurer does not owe under the contract of insurance. 

The adjuster knows that there is little difficulty resolving a claim with a third party if the claim is paid as presented. Holding a plaintiff down to what he asks for will always result in a settled claim. Properly evaluating the claim so that a fair and reasonable settlement is reached takes skill, experience, knowledge, and tact to reach an agreement with the claimant and the claimant’s counsel.

The adjuster also knows that if a claim is resisted or denied the insured will be unhappy, will become a defendant in a lawsuit. All claims adjusters are aware of the difficulty faced by any person who is a party to a lawsuit.

The adjuster is an important function of every insurer that provides third party liability insurance to properly protect the insured and the insurer.

 Potential for Coverage Requires Defense 
 Posted on July 18, 2011 by Barry Zalma 




 

 Horrible injuries often change law or emphasize the reasons for benefits. In a case where children were engulfed in flames their parents, present when the fire occurred, sued for their personal emotional distress. The insurer for the defendant did not want to defend the emotional distress portion of the claim because there was no physical injury. 

The Supreme Court of New Jersey disagreed.

 Plaintiff Need Not Suffer Actual Physical Injury to Receive Emotional Distress Damages 
 

 In 2007, defendants Jack and Sally Pomeranc, doing business as Mansard Gardens Associates, LLC (Mansard), were the owners of an apartment building in Bayonne, New Jersey.  Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company (GNY) was  Mansard’s insurer under a commercial general liability insurance policy (Policy).  The Policy provided that it would defend any lawsuit against the insured for property damage or bodily injury, but would not defend a lawsuit that did  not involve property damage or bodily injury, which the Policy defined as “bodily injury, sickness or disease  sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.” Abouzaid, et al. v. Mansard Gardens Associates, LLC, et al. (A-5-10) No. 066223 (N.J. 06/21/2011) SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY A-5 September Term 2010 

Plaintiffs Magdy and Manal Abouzaid and their son, Moustafa, were tenants in a Mansard apartment on August 22, 2007.  Plaintiff Eman Kandil was visiting with her sons, Omar and Tarek Osman.  Earlier that day, repairs had  been performed on the apartment on behalf of Mansard.  A liquid paint thinner had been applied to the kitchen floor to remove tile adhesive.  A flash fire erupted when vapors from the paint thinner were ignited by the stove’s pilot  light.  The fire spread rapidly through the apartment and trapped the three boys.  The mothers heard the explosion  and saw their sons “engulfed by a fireball.” The flames injured the boys, but did not physically injure the women.

The history of the tort of negligent infliction of  emotional distress has had many twists and turns.  Historically, a plaintiff could not recover for emotional  distress resulting from negligent conduct without the showing of  a contemporaneous physical injury.

 Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Mansard that included claims for the boys’ injuries, pain and suffering, and  damages.  The third count of the complaint asserted emotional distress by the mothers for suffering that arose from watching their sons become engulfed by flames.  It demanded damages for pain and suffering, impairment,  disability, loss of enjoyment of life, any medical or economic losses, and other relief.  It did not allege physical  injury to the mothers or specify that their emotional distress was accompanied by physical manifestations.

Mansard forwarded the complaint to GNY, which issued a reservation of rights and partial disclaimer.  GNY  agreed to provide a limited defense in the underlying litigation, but denied coverage and representation for the third  count, explaining that the emotional distress claim did not satisfy the bodily injury requirement of the Policy.   Mansard retained an attorney, who filed a third-party complaint against GNY asserting that it was obligated to defend against the count.  GNY filed a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint.  Meanwhile, Mansard filed a  motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ third count as inadequately pled.  The trial court denied both motions, reasoning that it was premature to dismiss the third-party complaint and finding that plaintiffs had asserted a viable claim in the third count under New Jersey precedent.

The Supreme Court granted certification. 205 N.J. 14 (2010).

 Precedent 

With the passage of time and the decisions in a series of  cases in which practically nonexistent impact was the peg upon which recovery for serious emotional disturbance was allowed,  the impact rule came under nearly universal criticism. Eventually, the physical impact requirement fell by the  wayside. Modernly New Jersey adopted what was denominated the “zone of danger” rule,  which recognized that immediate fear of personal injury could  serve as the basis for recovery for emotional distress from  negligent conduct so long as substantial bodily injury or  sickness resulted. 

The New Jersey Supreme Court specifically recognized that severe “mental and emotional harm,” standing alone, can trigger recovery.  That distinguishes such a claim from ordinary emotional  distress, which requires substantial bodily injury or sickness to survive.

An insurer is contractually obliged to provide the insured  with a defense against all actions covered by the insurance  policy. The duty to defend is  triggered by the filing of a complaint alleging a covered claim.  When the complaint raises  allegations that fall within a risk covered by the insurance  contract, the insurer has a duty to defend.

As a practical matter, the determination of an insurer’s  duty to defend requires review of the complaint with liberality  to ascertain whether the insurer will be obligated to indemnify the insured “if the allegations are sustained.”  Thus, if “the complaint comprehends an injury which may be within the policy,” a duty to  defend will be found.  In  other words, “potentially coverable” claims require a defense.

The Supreme Court concluded that the trial  judge’s order requiring GNY to defend plaintiffs’ Portee complaint was proper.  It noted that it is well-recognized in New Jersey that “emotional distress  can and often does have a direct effect on other bodily  functions.” Although that count was silent regarding the  existence of physical manifestations, it did not exclude the  possibility that such manifestations would be proved during the  course of the litigation.  Accordingly, it was indefinite  whether the claim was within the scope of coverage.  In those  circumstances, a potential for plaintiffs to prove a covered  claim existed and doubts regarding the duty to defend should have been “resolved in favor of the insured.

 Decision 

A policy  providing coverage for claims of “bodily injury” will be understood to require a defense from the filing of a Portee complaint unless such defense is specifically excluded by other  contract language.  That is reasonable from the perspective of  the insurer, who is on notice that the plaintiff may, in fact,  prove physical sequelae, and from that of the insured, who  expects to be defended against potential claims, regardless of  the imprecision in the third-party’s pleadings.

 Lesson 

 Insurers should recognize that the defense duty is very broad and the test across the country is potential for coverage not certainty. Even if the suit is false and fraudulent if there is a potential that the plaintiff can prove a covered loss exists a defense must be provided.

If the insurer is confident that the potential is weak and that when the case is over it will be established that the insurer owed no duty to defend or indemnify it may protect itself with a clear and unambiguous reservation of rights that reserves the right to a return of the money expended in the defense. The prudent insurer will also advise the insured that he, she or it has the right to independent counsel and that it intends to limit the independent counsel to payment of the amounts the insurer pays independent counsel in the same jurisdiction.

If, as the insurer believes, the final resolution of the case establishes there was no coverage for defense or indemnity it may then seek return of the amounts paid from the insured.

 $161 Million Wasted in Attempt to Stop Medicare Fraud 
 Posted on July 15, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Can“Good Enough for Government Work” 

 Fight Fraud? 

 The United States is losing anywhere from $80 billion to $300 billion a year in Medicaid and Medicare fraud. The US created what was described as a Medicare cost saving program that was supposed to save about $187 million between 2006 and 2018 probably saved nothing and makes clear that anti-fraud efforts of the government are inadequate or incompetent. The report is, rather, an invitation to those who would defraud Medicare and Medicaid to pursue as much fraud as possible because the chances of discovery of Medicare or Medicaid fraud is small although the government spent $161,000,000 to institute the programs.

It appears that $161,000,000 spent to prevent waste, fraud and abuse was wasted.

Joel Willemssen, managing director of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), gave that assessment on July 12, 2011 in testimony presented at a hearing organized by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee’s federal financial management subcommittee. The subcommittee held the hearing to look at efforts to protect the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that runs Medicare, started an Integrated Data Repository (IDR) program and a One PI program in 2006. The IDR program was supposed to create a single source of Medicare and Medicaid claim data, and the One PI program was supposed to create a centralized portal for analyzing the data and looking for signs of fraudulent billing. 

CMS officials wanted analysts to be able to look to see, for example, when Medicare enrollees had apparently used ambulance services without using any other type of medical care. Of course they should also be looking for medical providers who provide services to Medicare enrollees that would take more than 24 hours in any one day. CMS hired contractors to develop the tools and was supposed to have tools in place by 2009. In fact, only parts of the IDR system have been in place since 2006, but the repository is still incomplete according to a written version of his remarks provided by the GAO.

“Program officials have not defined plans and reliable schedules for incorporating the additional data into IDR that are needed to support the agency’s program integrity goals,” Willemssen said. Because of the project management problems, CMS officials stopped efforts to add more data to the repository after spending more than $80 million and more than 3 years on the effort.

CMS deployed the One PI analysis system in 2009, but it is not widely used, in part because of problems with analyst training. There were supposed to be 639 analysts trained to use the system by October 2010, but only 42 were actually trained. “Because IDR and One PI are not being used as planned, CMS officials are not yet in a position to determine the extent to which the systems are providing financial benefits or supporting the agency’s initiatives to meet program integrity goals and objectives,” Willemssen said.

 CMS officials have suggested that the IDR project should cost about $90 million through 2018, provide a total of $187 million in financial benefits, and lead to $97 million in net benefits. As of March 2011, program officials had not identified actual financial benefits of implementing IDR. Similarly, because of the relatively low level of use of the One PI system, there are not enough data available to quantify financial benefits attributable to the use of the system.  In essence after spending millions of dollars not one fraud has been detected and the system designed to detect them does not work and only a few people have been trained to use the ineffective and incomplete system.

In his testimony Mr. Williamson admitted that “analysts are not able to access certain data from IDR that would  help them identify and prevent payment of fraudulent claims. According to  IDR program officials, the shared systems data were not incorporated as  planned because funding for the development of the software and  acquisition of the hardware needed to meet this requirement was not  approved until the summer of 2010. Since then, IDR program officials  have developed project plans and identified user requirements, and told  us that they plan to incorporate shared systems data by November 2011.”   In addition, IDR does not yet include the Medicaid data that are critical to  analysts’ ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in this program.

While  program officials initially planned to incorporate 20 states’ Medicaid data into IDR by the end of fiscal year 2010, the agency had not incorporated  any of these data into the repository as of May 25, 2011. Program officials  told us that the original plans and schedules for obtaining Medicaid data did not account for the lack of funding for states to provide Medicaid data to CMS, or the variations in the types and formats of data stored in  disparate state Medicaid systems. Consequently, the officials were not  able to collect the data from the states as easily as they expected and did not complete this activity as originally planned.

In addition while program officials deployed the One PI portal and two  analytical tools, the system is not being used as widely as planned  because CMS and contractor analysts have not received the necessary training for its use. Program officials responsible for implementing the system acknowledged that their initial training plans and efforts had been insufficient and that  they had consequently initiated activities and redirected resources to  redesign the One PI training plan in April 2010; they began to implement the new training program in July of that year.

The current implementation of One PI has not yet produced  outcomes that position the agency to identify or measure financial  benefits. CMS officials stated at the end of fiscal year 2010—more than a  year after deploying One PI—that it was too early to determine whether  the program has provided any financial benefits.

They explained that,  since the program had not met its goal for widespread use of One PI,  there were not enough data available to quantify financial benefits  attributable to the use of the system. These officials said that as the user  community is expanded, they expect to be able to begin to identify and  measure financial and other benefits of using the system.

 Guaranty Association Funds Only Benefit Insureds of an Insolvent Insurer 
 Posted on July 14, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Sharing 

 Insurers promise to indemnify their insureds for losses that are covered by the terms and conditions of their policy. In situations where there are losses that spread over multiple policy years with different insurers the insurers will usually share the costs of repair.  However, when one or more of the insurers are insolvent the only available entity who has assets to share is the local state Guaranty Association.  In New Jersey the Guaranty Association statute requires that it does not pay until all viable insurers exhaust their available limits. In Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Salem v. New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association As, No. A-0015-10T3, A-0016-10T3 (N.J.Super.App.Div. 07/11/2011) an insurer unsuccessfully sought contribution from the Guaranty Association when the insolvent insurer also insured a long running loss.

In the consolidated appeals the New Jersey Appellate Division considered whether the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (PLIGA) should indemnify solvent insurer, Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Salem (Farmers Mutual), for environmental cleanup costs where an insolvent insurance carrier is also partially responsible for the cleanup costs. The Appellate Division concluded that the issue is controlled by the 2004 amendment to the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act, N.J.S.A. 17:30A-1 to -20 (PLIGA Act) and that the policy behind the PLIGA Act requires the exhaustion of all insurance benefits from solvent insurers on the risk before PLIGA, standing in the shoes of an insolvent insurer, must pay statutory benefits.

 Facts 

The consolidated appeals involve disputes that arise out of the attempts by Farmers Mutual to recover cleanup costs it expended to remediate contamination at two residential sites, each of which was covered by an insurance policy issued by the insolvent carrier, Newark Insurance Company (Newark). 

On August 19, 2003, environmental contamination was discovered on property owned by Ramnath and Ashmin Sookoo in Asbury Park. Farmers Mutual insured the Sookoo family for the period of December 13, 2002 to December 13, 2003 with $500,000 liability coverage limits. Previously, Newark had issued four policies of insurance covering the same Sookoo property.

In accordance with its policy’s coverage, Farmers Mutual paid $25,958.39 in remediation costs associated with the environmental contamination. Although the contamination was found at the time that Farmers Mutual was insuring the property, it is undisputed that the contamination began at some point in time when Newark was the sole insurer of the property.

The second site involved in this appeal is located in Linden. On March, 19, 2009, environmental contamination was discovered at the property owned by Edward and Carolyn O’Brien. Farmers Mutual insured the O’Brien family with $500,000 liability coverage limits. Newark had previously issued three policies of insurance to the O’Briens covering the same property.

In accordance with its policy coverage, Farmers Mutual paid $112,165.13 in remediation costs associated with the environmental contamination. As is the case of the Sookoo property, it is undisputed that the environmental contamination of the O’Brien property began at some point before Farmers Mutual’s insurance coverage.

Prior to the discovery of the environmental contamination, on August 9, 2007, an order of liquidation was entered for Newark by the Chancery Division, Mercer County. As a result of Newark’s insolvency and its purported share of the environmental remediation costs, Farmers Mutual filed a complaint against PLIGA to collect contribution as to both properties.

 Continuous Trigger 

 The New Jersey Supreme Court adopted the“continuous trigger”theory of liability, holding that when progressive indivisible injury or damage results from exposure to injurious conditions for which civil liability may be imposed, courts may reasonably treat the progressive injury or damage as an occurrence within each of the years of a CGL policy. That is the continuous-trigger theory for activating the insurers’obligation to respond under the policies.

Since the adoption of the continuous-trigger theory meant that more than one insurance policy would bear the responsibility of providing coverage, the Supreme Court concluded that any allocation should be in proportion to the degree of the risks transferred or retained during the years of exposure. The resolution of the issue was guided by the Court’s concern for the efficient use of resources to address the problem of environmental disease. Because insurance companies can spread costs throughout an industry and thus achieve cost efficiency, the law should, at a minimum, not provide disincentives to parties to acquire insurance when available to cover the risks.

 The Statute 

PLIGA is a non-profit, unincorporated entity created by the Legislature to provide a mechanism to deal with the consequences of an insolvent insurer, to protect policyholders of insurance companies which become insolvent. In order to preserve its assets and provide recovery for the greatest number of persons affected by an insurer’s insolvency, PLIGA’s liability for a covered claim is capped at $300,000.

The PLIGA Act, N.J.S.A. 17:30A-1 to -20, was adopted by the Legislature to provide recovery to New Jersey residents after an insurer has been declared insolvent. The Legislature stated: “The purpose of this act is to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies, to avoid excessive delay in payment, to minimize financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer, to assist in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies, to provide an association to assess the cost of such protection among insurers.” [N.J.S.A. 17:30A-2(a).]

As defined by the statute,“covered claim”means an unpaid claim, including one of unearned premiums, which arises out of and is within the coverage, and not in excess of the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this act applies, issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after January 1, 1974, and (1) the claimant or insured is a resident of this State at the time of the insured event provided that for an entity other than an individual, the residence of the claimant or insured is the state in which its principal place of business was located at the time of the insured event; or (2) the claim is a first party claim made by an insured for damage to property with a permanent location in this State.

The PLIGA Act excludes from the definition of a“covered claim,”“any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise[,]”and a solvent insurer’s claim for“subrogation recoveries or otherwise. . . .”N.J.S.A. 17:30A-5. Under the PLIGA Act, PLIGA is“deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.”N.J.S.A. 17:30A-8(a)(2). However, the Appellate Division emphasized that the PLIGA Act was not designed to require PLIGA to assume all the obligations of an insolvent insurer, and the legislative intent that conservation of PLIGA’s resources is necessary to achieve the Act’s stated goals.

 Exhaustion of Limits Required 

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 17:30A-12(b), a claimant must first exhaust all of its rights against solvent insurers prior to relying on PLIGA for statutory benefits.“Exhaust”means with respect to other insurance, the application of a credit for the maximum limit under the policy, except that in any case in which continuous indivisible injury or property damage occurs over a period of years as a result of exposure to injurious conditions, exhaustion shall be deemed to have occurred only after a credit for the maximum limits under all other coverages, primary and excess, if applicable, issued in all other years has been applied.

 Statutory Construction 

The resolution of the issue presented turns on statutory construction and interpretation. Courts are to presume that the legislative intent of a statute is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. Since the PLIGA Act was amended in 2004, the court agreed with PLIGA that the most logical interpretation of the exhaustion provision in the statute is that in cases of environmental contamination once a solvent insurer’s policy limit is exhausted, the claimant may then seek payment of statutory benefits from PLIGA for amounts remaining unpaid.

 The language of the statute is clear that in continuous indivisible injury or cases when property damage occurs over a period of years as a result of exposure to injurious conditions, exhaustion shall be deemed to have occurred only after a credit for the maximum limits under all other coverages, primary and excess, if applicable, issued in all other years has been applied. Although Farmers Mutual was the insurer of both properties for only one year, its policy limit was $500,000. Farmers Mutual accepted a premium to cover the risk up to that limit. As to the Sookoo family, the remediation costs were $25,958.39 and for the O’Briens, the costs were $112,165.13. As the remediation costs associated with the environmental contamination did not exceed Farmers Mutual’s policy limits, the Appellate Division concluded that PLIGA is not subject to sharing the costs of such remediation.

The court emphasized that the PLIGA Act is meant to protect insureds not insurers. It noted that the PLIGA Act is remedial legislation deserving of liberal construction. Although requiring Farmers Mutual to pay the entire environmental contamination period due to Newark’s insolvency may have the effect of making it a guarantor of its predecessor(s) on the risk, the solvent insurer’s obligations are not disturbed insofar that it still is only required to pay up to its policy limits on risks covered under the terms of the policy.

 Lesson 

Guaranty Associations are designed to protect insureds from losses that an insolvent insurer is unable to pay. It is not designed to make it easier for solvent insurers to increase their profits. Guaranty Associations are not insurers but are, rather, a safety net created by statute and it is not in the best interest of insurers who are solvent to attempt to dip into the assets designed to protect those who were unlucky enough to be insured by an insurer declared insolvent.

Most Guaranty Association statutes require admitted insurers to contribute to a fund that gives assets to the Guaranty Association to pay claims of insureds who were insured by an insolvent insurer. Attempting to dip into that fund to get back some of their contributions was appropriately unsuccessful.

 Tresspass Can Never be an Accident 
 Posted on July 13, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance Is 

Insurance is a contract where a person (the insurer) agrees to indemnify another (the insured) against certain defined risks of loss, damage, or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event. Intentional acts can never be “contingent” or “unknown.”

 Building On Property Without Right is Not an“Occurrence” 

 In Mississippi the Fifth Circuit was called upon to resolve a dispute between an insured and an insurer whether the acts of the insured were an “occurrence,” as defined in the policy in National Builders and Contractors Ins. Co. v. Slocum Construction, LLC, 2011 WL 2416924 (5th Cir. June 15, 2011) [Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.].

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify a contractor under applicable Mississippi law with respect to an underlying lawsuit relating to the contractor’s mistaken construction of a home on the incorrect property as the same did not constitute an“occurrence”under the CGL policy in question and the only allegations against the insured was that he had intentionally trespassed upon the property of the plaintiff.

 The Facts 

Kelvin Anderson contracted with Slocum to build a house. Anderson staked out a parcel of land, but Slocum was unaware that the land was not Anderson’s. When Anderson could not pay Slocum for the house, Slocum tried to sell it. During due diligence, Slocum discovered that Youngblood owned the land and offered to purchase it from him. When Youngblood refused, Slocum sued Youngblood and Youngblood counterclaimed for trespass, seeking lost rental profits. Slocum requested that its insurer, NBCI, defend and indemnify Slocum with respect to the Youngblood counterclaim.

The district court entered summary judgment in favor of NBCI. Slocum appealed, and the Fifth Circuit

 Analysis 

Since Slocum intended to build a house on the land that Anderson staked out its actions were not an accident under the terms of its policy, and NBCI was found to have no duty to defend or indemnify.

Slocum’s insurance policy, like nearly all CGL policies, provides coverage only if the damage is caused by an“occurrence,”which is synonymous with an“accident.”Mississippi looks to the actions of the insured, not the resulting damages, to decide whether there was an accident.

Slocum’s appeal turns on the distinction between an inadvertent action and a mistake. The former is an accident, as described above, but the latter is not, because the insured intended the action underlying the mistake, even if he did not intend the results or if he based his action on erroneous information.

The Fifth Circuit looked to the allegations in the complaint to determine whether NBCI has a duty to defend Youngblood’s countersuit against Slocum for trespass, an intentional tort under Mississippi law that requires entering another’s property, without right, for one’s own purpose. To trigger coverage under the policy, therefore, Slocum must have accidentally built a house on Youngblood’s land. The court concluded that Slocum intended to build a house on the land that Anderson staked out. It may not have intended to build one on property that did not belong to Anderson, but that is the unintended result of its intentional actions. Therefore, its actions were not an accident under the terms of its policy, and NBCI has no duty to defend or indemnify.

The counterclaim against Slocum does not allege that Slocum“damaged”Youngblood’s property by building the house on it. What it does allege is that Slocum has and continues to commit the intentional tort of willful trespass on Youngblood’s property. Under Mississippi law,“willful trespass”must be knowing, as one who acts in good faith and with reasonable prudence, under a belief that land in question is his own, is not criminally liable for willful or malicious trespass in going upon land of another.  The only claim asserted against Slocum is that it has intentionally and knowingly trespassed and continues to trespass intentionally and knowingly on Youngblood’s property. In no way, then, can Slocum’s behavior — as alleged by Youngblood within the four corners of his counterclaim — be considered an accident or an“occurrence”within the four corners of NBCI’s policy, even if Slocum’s act of building the house arguably was an“occurrence.”

In sum, Youngblood’s one and only allegation — the only claim that NBCI is asked to defend against — is that Slocum committed the intentional and knowing tort of willful trespass. That just can’t, by definition, be an accident. As NBCI’s insurance policy only covers negligence and does not cover intentional torts such as willful trespass, NBCI does not have a duty to defend Slocum against Youngblood’s counterclaim for only an intentional tort. In Mississippi there is no tort of “negligent tresspass” and there can never be insurance for an intentional act.

 Lesson 

Don’t build without checking title. Don’t expect insurance for any intentional tort.

 The Ancient Equitable Right to Rescission 
 Posted on July 13, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Rescission is an equitable remedy as ancient as the common law of Britain. 

 When the United States was conceived in 1776 and the Constitution was written some years later, the founders were concerned with protecting their rights under British common law. They adopted it as the law of the new United States of America modified only by the limitations placed on the central government by the U.S. Constitution.

The viability and ability to enforce contracts was recognized as essential to commerce. Courts of law were charged with enforcing legitimate contracts. Courts of equity were charged with protecting contracting parties from mistake, fraud, misrepresentation and concealment since enforcing a contract based on mistake, fraud, misrepresentation or concealment would not be fair. 

The common law developed rules that courts could follow to refuse to enforce the terms of a contract that was entered into because of mutual mistake of material fact, a unilateral mistake of material fact, the breach of warranty (a presumptively material promise to do or not do something), a material concealment, or a material misrepresentation. The remedy – called rescission – created a method for void a contract and instructed the courts of the nation to refuse to enforce such a contract.

Insurance contracts, unlike common run-of-the-mill commercial contracts, are considered to be contracts of utmost good faith. [ Carter v. Boehm , S.C. 1 Bl.593, 3 Burr 1906, 11th May 1766] Each party to the contract of insurance is expected to treat the other fairly in the acquisition and performance of the contract. For example, the prospective insured is required to answer all questions about the risk he, she or it are asking the insurer to take and about the person the insurer is asked to insure.

Rescission, since before the U. S. Constitution, became an important remedy for insurers. As a contract of utmost good faith insurers and the courts recognized that the parties to a contract of insurance were more vulnerable than other contracting parties to misrepresentation or concealment of material fact. The remedy is available to either party to the contract and when one determines it was deceived into entering into the contract it may declare the contract void from its inception, return the consideration and treat it as if it never existed.

When an insurer or the insured discovers the existence of a factual basis for rescission they have the opportunity, but not the duty, to exercise the remedy of rescission. In California the remedy is available to both parties to the contract of insurance whether the party deceived believes the deceit was the result of a fraud or an innocent misrepresentation of a material fact. To do otherwise would be to make a gift to the person who deceived the insurer of rights not available to the truthful.

E quitable remedies, like the remedy of rescission, are expected to be fair. California follows the ancient equitable remedies and has codified the right to rescission of insurance contracts because the legislature considered it unfair to make a contracting party abide by a contract that was not obtained fairly. The ancient maxim that “No one can take advantage of his own wrong” [California Civil Code § 3517] is applied when a court is faced with a request to confirm rescission.

Before a party considers rescission, whether insured or insurer, the following must be established:

 The facts represented in the acquisition of the policy. 

 Evidence that establishes whether an fact was misrepresented. 

 Evidence that establishes that a material fact was concealed. 

 Evidence that establishes that the fact(s) misrepresented was material to the decision of the insurer to insure or not insure. 

 Evidence that the person seeking rescission did not have better knowledge of the facts claimed misrepresented or concealed. 

 A sworn declaration from the underwriter who made the decision to insure or not insure concerning the effect true facts would have had on the underwriting decision. 

 A review of the policy, application process, investigation results and applicable law by a competent insurance coverage lawyer.

 The Failure of Punitive Damages 
 Posted on July 12, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 The Reasons for Punitive Damages 

 Civil juries have a difficult enough time establishing appropriate numbers to indemnify a plaintiff so that he or she is back the way he or she was before the incident. To ask them to set an appropriate civil punishment without the protection given criminal defendants is asking too much. The wild differences in awards of punitive damages from a single dollar to billions of dollars is evidence of the difficulties punitive damages give juries.

Punitive damages are “private fines levied by civil juries.” [ Electrical Workers v. Foust , 442 U.S. 42, 48 (1979)] They are not awarded to compensate for injury, but rather to further the aims of the criminal law: “to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence.” [ Bankers Life&amp;Casualty Co. , 486 U.S. 71, 87 (1988) (O&apos;Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(1) (1979)] They are a windfall to the plaintiff and a boon to the plaintiffs’ lawyer. The role of punitive damages runs counter to the normal function of tort and contract remedies to put the plaintiff back in the condition he or she was in before the tort.

Precedents are legion with the recognition of the penal nature of punitive damages . [e.g. Tull v. United States ,481 U.S. 412, 422, and n. 7 (1987); Memphis Community School District v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, 306, n. 9 (1986); Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp ., 464 U.S. 238, 260-261 (1984) (Blackmun, J., dissenting); Smith v. Wade , 461 U.S. 30, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc ., 453 U.S. 247, 266-267 (1981); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc ., 418 U.S. 323, 350 (1974); Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc. , 403 U.S. 29, 82 (1971) (Marshall, J., dissenting); Lake Shore&amp;M. S. R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101, 107 (1893).] 

The purposes of punitive damages are to punish the defendant and to deter future misconduct by making an example of the defendant.

Punitive”damages – sometimes referred to as exemplary damages, vindictive damages, or smart money – exceed actual damages. Punitive damages are not generally thought to be solely or even mainly compensatory. Until well into the 19th century, punitive damages frequently operated to compensate for intangible injuries, compensation which was not otherwise available under the narrow conception of compensatory damages. This function reached its peak in the 1960′s and 1970′s when courts began to allow people to recover tort damages (including punitive damages) for breaches of insurance contracts. In so doing, the desire to compensate for intangible injuries as a result of the breach of insurance contracts, the courts created a major source of income for lawyers suing and defending insurers and increased litigation against insurers with hopes of hitting a jackpot with a punitive award.

When an American is damaged by the tortious conduct of another his or her ability to reason analytically disappears. The damaged person becomes angry and wants to punish the person who caused the harm. Indemnity, the general measure of tort or contract damages, is insufficient. The injured person wants revenge. The injured person wants the person who caused the injury to be punished.

 The law of almost every state, either by statute or court decision, allow the injured person to punish the person who caused the injury and profit from that punishment. The stated purpose for the award of punitive damages is to deter the defendant and others from the wrongful conduct being punished not to allow the plaintiff to profit. Punitive damages seldom effect the stated purposes, other than punishment,  for which they were intended. Rather, their effect is to punish those who are not parties to the suit.

 Who Profits From Punitive Damage Awards? 

History has shown that massive punitive damage judgments that make headlines in the press  are often reduced, reversed or sent back for retrial. The news of the judgments, however, effect all litigants with similar cases. The press seldom reports with the same vigor, if at all, the reversal of massive punitive damage awards. The damage to the insurance industry is done by the news of the verdict. Copies of the news stories are immediately delivered to insurer defendants with a settlement offer. They are told that a settlement will allow the insurer to avoid similar punishment. Insurers, fearing being painted with the same brush as that of their fellow defendants,  no matter how strong their case, will settle. The innocent, therefore, pay money they do not owe. The insurer that acted in bad faith does not. It gets a new trial or a severely reduced verdict. Its bad acts, therefore, make it more competitive than the innocent insurer who is wrongly sued and convinced to settle because of the fear of a potential punitive damages award.

The plaintiff who recovers a punitive award is also punished because he pays 40% to 50% of the punitive damages to his or her lawyer on a contingency fee bases and 39% to the U.S. Government of the total award and if he lives in a state like New York or California with almost 10% income tax the plaintiff will receive almost none of the punitive damages awarded. [See post, Punitive Damages and Taxes Posted on April 7, 2011 by Barry Zalma ]

It is imperative that those who are potential defendants in a suit seeking punitive damages to understand its history and application across the country. Every corporation, whether they provide services like insurers and credit providers or manufacture goods are potential defendants. Every corporation with assets that a lawyer believes can fund a judgment or settlement is subject to a suit seeking punitive damages. This book will give the potential defendant and the potential plaintiff the information needed to successfully pursue or defend against a suit seeking punitive damages.

Potential litigation participants must understand that punitive damages are fixtures of US law that allows courts to assess punishment damages in excess of that needed to indemnify the plaintiff for his, her or its loss. The US Supreme Court has clearly sated that“[p]unitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.”[ BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore , 517 U. S. 559.] These damages often exceed the fines assessed by the state if the same person had acted criminally to damage the plaintiff.

The skills of plaintiff’s trial lawyers have convinced juries to award damages in sums that exceed the annual budget of Greece. The jury assesses the enormous damages because it becomes inflamed by the wrongful conduct of the defendant and agrees with the lawyer’s suggestion that the jury“teach the defendant a lesson”to stop it from doing the same to others. The argument has been successful in thousands of suits brought from Vermont to California and  Florida to Washington.

For years punitive damage awards were unlimited. A $40 compensatory damage award resulted in a $5,000,000.00 verdict. Some juries assessed billions of dollars in punitive damages with no constraint from the courts other than the wealth of the defendant. In 2003 the US Supreme Court put limited punitive damages in the United States when in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell , 123 S.Ct. 1513, 538 U.S. 408, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (U.S. 04/07/2003) by a 6-3 vote, overturned a $145 million verdict against an insurer. The Supreme Court concluded that a punitive damages award of $145 million, where full compensatory damages were $1 million, is excessive and violates the Due Proces s Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority limited the ability of state and federal courts to award huge punitive damages awards and concluded that it was improbable that a punitive damage award more than a single digit multiplier of the compensatory damages award would seldom, if ever, pass the due process test. The Supreme Court, in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore , 517 U. S. 559, set forth specific tests that must be met before punitive damages could fulfill the requirements of due process.

The State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell case arose out of an automobile accident where one party was killed and another severely injured. The Campbells, insured by State Farm attempted to pass six vehicles on a two lane highway, failed, and caused the driver of an oncoming car to drive off the road to escape collision with the Campbells’vehicle. The Campbells only had $25,000 coverage per person and $50,000 in the aggregate. The Campbells felt they were not at fault because there was no contact between the two vehicles. State Farm ignored the advice of its adjuster and counsel to accept policy limits demands and took the case to trial. The verdict at trial was more than $180,000 and the State Farm appointed counsel told the Campbells to put their house on the market since they would need the money to pay the verdict. State Farm refused to pay the judgment and to fund an appeal. The Campbells retained personal counsel to pursue an appeal that was not successful, entered into a settlement with the plaintiffs where the plaintiffs agreed to not execute on their judgment in exchange for an assignment of 90% of all money received in a bad faith action by the Campbells against State Farm. Before suit was filed, State Farm paid the full judgment.

At trial the plaintiffs brought in evidence of actions of State Farm in first party cases across the country, in third party cases not similar to the Campbells’auto accident and other evidence not related to the facts of their case.

The Supreme Court found that State Farm’s“handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise,”but concluded“a more modest punishment could have satisfied the State’s legitimate objectives“instead, this case was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm’s operations throughout the country. However, a State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred.”

 State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell created a major, precedent changing, limitation on the right of a jury to assess punitive damages settling limits on total amounts that can be assessed and the types of wrongful conduct a jury can consider. It did not eliminate punitive damages. They still exist to allow some lawyers to profit and to increase the tax revenues of the state and federal governments.

 Knowledge of Insurance is Required to Adequately Investigate Insurance Fraud 
 Posted on July 11, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurance Is A Contract 

 Before insurance fraud can be understood, it is important to understand what insurance is and how it works. Politicians continue to misunderstand insurance.

Insurance is not a right awarded by the Constitution to every resident of the United States.  It is a contract between an insurer and a person or corporation called the insured whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the insured against loss, damage, or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.
That is all insurance is: a contract.

Insurance is a special type of contract where the insurer agrees to indemnify the insured against a loss, damage to property or liability as long as the event for which indemnity is ought is contingent or unknown at the time the insurance is acquired. A condition pre-existing the contract is not contingent or unknown. One should not be able to buy insurance against the fire loss of a home after it burns down. A person should not be able to buy medical care insurance to treat a cancer only after the cancer is diagnosed. Auto liability insurance purchased after an accident is not insurance and should not indemnify the insured for injuries caused.

 Why Insurance Fraud? 

Next to tax fraud, insurance fraud is the most practiced crime in the world. It is perpetrated by members of every race, religion, and nationality. It is found in every profession. The possibility of a tax-free profit when coupled with the commonly held belief that criminal prosecution will probably not occur, is sometimes too difficult for normally honest people to resist. 

Insurance fraud exists because its perpetrators wish to profit by failing to comply with the definition quoted above. Those who perpetrate insurance fraud intend to create the loss, damage or liability rather than join the pool of those who have no losses but wish to protect themselves against contingent or unknown events.
Because politicians and the public they serve do not understand what insurance is and what promises the insurers and insureds make to each other insurers are not liked. As a result, insurance fraud in North America and Europe is rampant and almost universally unpunished.

In simple language, fraud can be defined as a lie told for the purpose of obtaining money from another who believes the lie to be true. Civil insurance fraud exists if an insured:

•     makes a representation to the insurer that the insured knows is false;

•     conceals from the insurer a fact he or she knows is material to the insurer;

•     makes a promise he or she does not intend to keep. For example, “I will sweep the grocery store floor every hour,” or “I will regularly patrol aisles in search of debris”; and

•     makes a misrepresentation on which the insurer relies in issuing the policy, and the insurer is damaged.

 Insurance fraud professionals who are engaged in the attempt to reduce insurance fraud have estimated that insurance fraud takes between $87 billion and $200 billion from the insurance buying public every year. Every year an additional  $100 to $200 billion is stolen from Medicare and Medicaid programs across the United States.

I wrote an e-book“Insurance Fraud”to provide information to those who are engaged in the effort to reduce insurance fraud. It will provide information for the lawyers representing insurers so that they can adequately advise their clients who are victims of the crime of insurance fraud. By including the full text of decisions from courts of appeal and supreme courts across the country the reader can understand what happens after the investigation is completed in order to better complete the investigation. The full text of appellate opinions dealing with insurance fraud and weapons available to insurers to defeat insurance fraud will give each person involved with information not available elsewhere. The e-book will also provide information for insurance claims investigators, special insurance fraud investigators working at insurance company Special Investigation Units (SIU), Fraud Bureau Investigators, and Prosecutors will have the information needed to allow prosecution of insurance criminals to proceed.

Prosecutors will also have sufficient information to understand the importance of the crime and the need to reduce the crime by effective prosecution and punishment of the insurance fraud perpetrators. 

Since the effort to reduce insurance fraud requires the assistance of courts – both civil and criminal – the prudent fraud investigator, insurance adjuster, insurance attorney or insurance Special Investigation Units, and insurance management will have the information to deal with state investigators and prosecutors. It is also necessary to read the full text of decisions of the courts of appeal to fully understand the facts gathered by the investigators and prosecutors.

The e-book“Insurance Fraud”includes the full text of important or informative decisions that should be read in full so that those involved in trying to defeat fraudulent claims can be aware of what courts look at after a suspected fraudulent claim is denied. It is available at Zalma Books.

 Conviction for Workers’ Compensation Fraud Upheld 
 Posted on July 7, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Circumstantial Evidence Sufficient to Prove Intent to Commit Crime 

 Insurance fraud is seldom prosecuted and when prosecuted the punishment is often minimal and then subject to appeal. The expense of prosecuting insurance fraud chills the vigor of prosecutors who would rather prosecute violent criminals.

In The People v. Kinya Jeanette Atlas-Hearn, No. E049871 (Cal.App. Dist.4 04/22/2011) a bus driver intentionally created a false Workers’ Compensation claim for stress due to an unruly customer. Unfortunately for the defendant the bus was equipped with a video camera that established her claims were false. Although convicted on four counts and sentenced to only three years probation and 180 days in county jail, the defendant appealed her conviction. The California Court of Appeal, faced with a spurious appeal, affirmed her conviction.

 Facts 

 Kinya Jeanette Atlas-Hearn (Kinya) challenged a jury verdict finding her guilty of four felonies consisting of two counts of workers’compensation insurance fraud in violation of Insurance Code section 1871.4, subdivision (a)(1) and two counts of insurance fraud in violation of Penal Code section 550, subdivision (a)(1), all of which stem from Kinya’s claim that she suffered stress while working on December 5, 2006. 

The trial court suspended imposition of sentence in order to place Kinya on probation for three years, a term of which required that she serve 180 days in county jail.

Kinya contended in her appeal to the California Court of Appeal that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury regarding the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove an element of the charged crimes. Kinya also contended the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s implied finding that Kinya harbored the intent necessary to commit the charged crimes.

Kinya was employed by Omnitrans as a bus driver. On December 5, 2006, at 8:44 a.m. Kinya called the company dispatch operator and reported that she had a headache and also had pain down her left arm as a result of stress caused by being assigned that morning to drive a small bus that did not accommodate all potential passengers. Kinya asked to be relieved so she could go to the clinic to obtain medical aid. Kinya’s request was granted and as a result she returned to the office where she reported her injury to a company field supervisor. Kinya signed a workers’compensation claim form that described her injury as head and neck tension and pain. On a form entitled “Employee’s Report of Injury,” Kinya wrote that she had “stress from driving busy route w\a full bus #510–passengers aggravating driver.”

 In the space on the form that asked for a description of how the accident occurred, Kinya wrote, “Once the passenger started yelling and calling me name [sic]&amp;beating on the windows I got a headache that made tention [sic] down my left side.” The field supervisor sent Kinya to a doctor.

At U.S. Healthworks, Omnitrans’s medical provider, Kinya completed an information form on which she described her injury as “tention [sic] down my left side with a headache blood pressure was high.” According to the “Doctor’s First Report of Occupation Illness or Injury” Kinya reported “she had some unrulely [sic] passengers and she became very angry. She got a [headache] with pain radiating into left [cervical spine] area.” The examining physician directed Kinya off work for the rest of her shift, and to return to her regular work shift the next day.

Paul Daneker, an Omnitrans field supervisor, investigated Kinya’s workers’compensation injury claim among other things by reviewing videotapes recorded by cameras installed in various locations inside the bus Kinya drove on December 5, 2006, the date of her claimed injury. The videotapes did not reveal an incident or problem that would support Kinya’s stress claim.

 Discussion of the Law 

With regard to circumstantial evidence, the trial court instructed the jury explaining the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. The trial court also instructed the jury explaining the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove intent.

When the prosecution’s evidence of guilt is primarily circumstantial the trial court must instruct the jury that “to justify a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the facts and circumstances must not only be entirely consistent with the theory of guilt but must be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.”

The prosecution in this case relied on direct evidence, namely Kinya’s various statements explaining the cause of her stress and pertinent segments of the videotape recordings taken by the cameras in Kinya’s bus, to prove the charged crimes. The video recording showed that although Kinya’s bus was crowded, there were no rude or disruptive passengers either on the bus or attempting to board the bus. Kinya does not dispute that the statements and videotape are direct rather than circumstantial evidence. Instead Kinya contends that the question of whether the conditions on the bus caused her to have stress, tension, and a headache “can only be determined by circumstantial evidence.”

Kinya identified specific circumstances as the cause of her stress, tension, and headache. If the evidence presented at trial showed that those specific circumstances did not exist, then the issue of whether Kinya suffered stress is irrelevant because that stress could not have been work related and only work-related injuries are compensable under workers’compensation. In other words, the trial court was not required to give the standard jury instruction Kinya asked for with respect to whether Kinya suffered the claimed injury of stress, tension, and a headache because the evidence presented at trial did not support giving that instruction.

 Kinya also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s implied finding that on December 5, 2006, she had the intent to defraud when she signed the workers’compensation application. The Court of Appeal disagreed. The evidence showed that Kinya knew the workers’compensation claim process and the significance of signing a claim form. Moreover, the videotapes from the cameras in Kinya’s bus show that the events Kinya claimed were the sources of her stress, namely a disgruntled rider hitting the bus windows and yelling at Kinya, and another disgruntled rider calling her a bitch, did not necessarily occur.

 LESSONS 

Insurance fraud is profitable and seldom prosecuted because even when caught, tried and convicted, the punishment is minimal. Perhaps Ms. Atlas-Hearn would not have attempted fraud if the news reflected that if caught and convicted the criminal will serve a serious amount of time in prison – like the five years maximum penalty for violation of California Penal Code § 550.

 I’m 69-Years-Old&amp;Still Going Strong 
 Posted on July 7, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 When I was 20-years-old, I thought 60 was old and that I would retire by the time I was 65 – if I lived that long.  Boy was I wrong.

As the author of Zalma on Insurance, the only lawyer with Barry Zalma, Inc. and the only consultant with Zalma Insurance Consultants I love what I do and intend to keep doing it until I am no longer able. This June I became 69-years-old. I started in the insurance business in 1967.

My education was interrupted by service in the military so I was 30-years-old before I was licensed to practice law.

In January 2012 I will celebrate the 40th anniversary of receiving a license to practice law in California. Regardless, I am almost as physically healthy and am certainly as mentally healthy as I was when I was first licensed to practice law in January 1972.

My 30-year-old self would have been shocked to learn that I am, at this stage in my life, able both physically and mentally to act as counsel, consultant or expert witness for anyone who asks as I was when I was first licensed to practice law. The only difference between the lawyer I was then and the lawyer I am now is that I now have more than 40 years of experience, education, training and knowledge in insurance and insurance claims handling. 

For example, as recently as June 2011 I testified as an insurance claims handling and insurance fraud expert retained by counsel for an insurer in a successful effort to avoid a fraudulent claim in the San Bernardino County, California Superior Court. Some months earlier I testified as an expert retained by a policyholder’s attorney who obtained a major verdict against an insurer. As a consultant and testifying expert I am ready to consult with any insurer or policyholder who seeks my advice and counsel or need expert testimony for whom I have no conflict. This year, like the last twelve, I acted as a consultant for counsel for both policyholders and insurers who resolved their cases without going to trial.

I am presently consulting with counsel for several policyholders who believe they were wronged by their insurers and several insurers who believe they were wronged by their insureds. As long as there is no conflict of interest my consulting business will continue to be split approximately equally between insurers and policyholders.

 As an attorney I will continue to represent those clients in the business of insurance who seek my advice and counsel concerning insurance coverage issues or insurance fraud issues. I continue to act as an insurance coverage lawyer for insurers and policyholders who need insurance coverage advice and counsel. I refuse all litigation and have not acted as litigation counsel since 1997.

I will continue to write and publish Zalma on Insurance almost every day, Zalma’s Insurance Fraud Letter (ZIFL) twice a month, update my books for Specialty Technical Publishers, and write books and e-books until I can no longer type or talk into a voice recognition system.

I write this to give notice to all of my readers and clients that I feel wonderful, healthy, and intend to continue to work until I am no longer able. Since my mother is presently 99-years-old and going strong it appears I may have a good thirty years to continue working and helping the court, juries and lawyers who retain me or cross-examine me, understand insurance and proper claims handling.

If you need the assistance of an experienced insurance coverage lawyer with expertise in all property and casualty insurance, need legal assistance in the investigation of a potential fraudulent claim, need a consultant or expert witness who can testify on claims handling, insurance fraud or bad faith issues, or just need to talk to someone who understands insurance please call. I have no employees. I answer my own phone and I am usually in the office by 7:00 a.m. California time. My phone forwards all calls to my cell phone when I am out of the office and I will answer if I am in a place where the cells are strong enough to hear you. If you leave me a message, I will return your call promptly – really.

I work fast and avoid unnecessary or irrelevant work. My rates are all inclusive. My gross fees are often less than those who charge a lower hourly rate. My hourly fee takes account of all incidentals from telephone calls and postage to computer time, computer legal research and word processing. As for third-party costs, I pass along all discounts and vendor savings. You pay what I pay. Not a penny more. I’ve made the billing process simple.

 The Need For A Thorough Investigation 
 Posted on July 6, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Insurers Must Report Suspected Fraud 

 Insurers across the country are required to report to state insurance fraud investigators and prosecutors when they have sufficient information that cause them to suspect that an insurance fraud is being attempted. The statutes do not require that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt or even beyond a preponderance of the evidence, they only require suspicion.

To encourage insurers to make the reports the statutes also provide a qualified immunity for making the report. The qualified immunity provided to insurers for reporting suspicious claims to a state fraud unit under most insurance fraud statutes is not, however, an absolute immunity. In a case where American International Group Inc. (AIG) made a report of its suspicion that a workers’compensation claimant was committing insurance fraud was sued by the claimant. AIG moved to dismiss the case because of the immunity. 

The Massachusetts Supreme court ruled that the claimant can pursue a lawsuit against  AIG on grounds it maliciously prosecuted him by using criminal processes to gain leverage in his workers’ compensation case. In Jesse Maxwell vs. AIG Domestic Claims Inc. , http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ma-court-of-appeals/1144243.html Maxwell alleged successfully that he suffered injury when the AIG claims unit referred his workers comp claim to an insurance fraud bureau, which passed it on to prosecutors.

Mr. Maxwell, because of what he alleged was an inadequate investigation, suffered serious injury, lost workers’ compensation benefits, became homeless, and was accused of criminal conduct. Mr. Maxwell’s legal proceedings included a related workers compensation case stemming from an October 2002 injury. The AIG unit denied the claim because he failed to provide medical documentation. Mr. Maxwell, who appealed the AIG unit’s rejection of h is workers’ compensation claim, alleged he became homeless and lived in shelters since he had no benefits and was unable to work.

 What AIG Found 

The court found that as a condition of living at a YMCA, Mr. Maxwell participated in a community service training program for “disabled and challenged individuals.”  The organization placed Mr. Maxwell in a commercial cleaning training program, where he performed limited janitorial work while receiving a stipend. The organization “did not consider Maxwell to be an employee, did not consider his stipend to be wages or earnings, and did not believe that his participation in the training program indicated that he was capable of working in the open market.”

During a medical exam Mr. Maxwell signed a statement that he was not working. After the exam, however, an AIG investigator followed him to a site where the community service organization had assigned him. The investigator videotaped him performing janitorial work and reported to the AIG unit that that Mr. Maxwell was employed. Thus the AIG unit had reason to believe Mr. Maxwell was working and its investigation concluded he worked for a temp agency. It opened a fraud investigation the same day an administrative judge ordered the claims unit to pay Mr. Maxwell workers’ compensation benefits. 

The AIG unit filed a fraud report with the Massachusetts Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) that eventually led the Suffolk County district attorney to file fraud charges. An AIG claims examiner also knew that Mr. Maxwell was on probation for a drug charge and allegedly contacted Maxwell’s probation officer and prosecutors seeking to have him incarcerated. In jail AIG would not be required to pay him workers’compensation benefits. A series of legal proceedings ensued including the civil lawsuit Mr. Maxwell filed alleging malicious conduct on the part of the AIG unit.

The AIG unit, however, argued that workers’ compensation’s exclusive remedy and a statutory requirement to report fraud provided the company with immunity in its efforts to have the suit dismissed. But the trial court, an appeals court and the Supreme Court ruled summary judgment was not appropriate.

 Qualified Immunity Only Issue 

 On appeal, the sole issue before Massachusetts Supreme Court was whether the qualified immunity was sufficient to support the motion for summary judgment filed by AIG. The high court concluded that although AIG enjoyed a qualified immunity, summary judgment was inappropriate because “all of Maxwell’s claims rely, at least in part, on conduct falling outside the scope of the immunity.” The state high court upheld the trial court’s denial of summary judgment and remanded the case back to the trial court.

The Supreme Court noted that Maxwell’s claims were based fundamentally on AIG’s inadequate investigation not on the reports to the IFB.  This alone was sufficient to defeat the defendants’special motion to dismiss. However, in addition, Maxwell’s emotional distress claims are based on other activities, including AIG’s efforts to compel Maxwell to relinquish his benefits, and its refusal to pay for required surgery despite the administrative judge’s order.

The defendants asked the Supreme Court to ignore the outside the qualified immunity and argued that Maxwell’s claims rested solely on the defendants’report to the IFB, the urging of criminal charges, and the request to the chief of probation that Maxwell be surrendered.  The Supreme Court concluded the argument failed for two reasons.

1.    The defendants did not meet their burden of showing that Maxwell’s claims rest solely on the defendants’petitioning activity, and the fact that some petitioning activity is implicated is not enough where, as here, the root of the claims (the investigation) is nonpetitioning.

2.     Even had Maxwell’s claims been based solely or substantially on the defendants’petitioning activities, he met his burden of showing that the defendants’exercise of their “right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law” and that the defendants’acts caused him actual harm. 

The Supreme Court also noted, in a damning fashion, that defendants referred Maxwell’s claim as a case of suspected insurance fraud to the IFB based on what can, at best, be characterized as an incomplete investigation into the alleged fraud. AIG’s conclusion that Maxwell was “employed” and earning “wages” was based on nothing more than the private investigator’s observation of Maxwell though a window while he mopped and took out the trash at the recruitment center. The investigator did not contact the recruitment center to verify the conclusion reached looking through the window. The Supreme Court concluded that it was not reasonable factual support, for the conclusion Maxwell was working, particularly because AIG knew at the time it referred the matter to the IFB that Maxwell was involved in community work services.

Moreover, AIG’s referral to the IFB claimed the community agency was temporary employment agency, an assertion that the record showed was flatly incorrect. Even if AIG’s report was based on some factual support on the day it reported the case to the IFB, it certainly became so in June, 2001 when it received documentation directly from the agency showing that Maxwell was in a training program and not employed.

The record does not show that AIG submitted this information to the IFB, or that it ever corrected the misstatement it had previously made to the IFB. AIG had this information in hand before the  IFB referred the matter to the district attorney’s office for criminal prosecution.

 he court concluded that the defendants’subsequent urging of criminal charges and seeking to have Maxwell surrendered on unrelated criminal charges, rested on even fewer facts.  The defendants continued to urge enforcement of the restitution order even though they knew that the uncontradicted evidence was that Maxwell had not been employed and had not received wages.

They alleged, without any basis, that Maxwell was feigning mental illness and “conveniently” checking himself residentially into McLean Hospital. Nothing but conjecture and cynicism supported this statement, which was the sole basis in turn for requesting that Maxwell be surrendered on unrelated charges so that AIG could stop paying benefits.

 The Second Supreme Court Decision 

After being sent back to the trial court the parties engaged in discovery and AIG again unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment. The Supreme Court, in June 2011, concluded that although  AIG enjoys qualified immunity regarding its reporting of potentially fraudulent activity summary judgment is inappropriate because all of Maxwell’s claims rely, at least in part, on conduct falling outside the scope of the immunity. It gave some hope to AIG by concluding that portions of Maxwell’s claims may be barred by workers’compensation exclusivity under G.L. c. 152, but that not one of Maxwell’s counts is barred entirely such that the Superior Court would be without subject matter jurisdiction.The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the Superior Court denying summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. [ Maxwell v. AIG Domestic Claims, Inc ., Mass. , --- N.E.2d ----, 2011 WL 2556944 (Mass 2011) Decided June 30, 2011].

There is still no final result and the case will either go to trial or will be settled.

 Lessons 

When facts exist sufficient for an insurer to suspect insurance fraud it is required to report that suspicion to the IFB of whatever state has jurisdiction. It is not required, however, to push the prosecution of the insured by means other than providing the prosecutors and the IFB with the facts determined by its investigation.

Where AIG fell afoul of the Supreme Court was when it gave inaccurate information to the IFB. The qualified immunity provided by the statute is useful but it is a shield with as many holes as a chain link fence.

Insurers and their Special Investigation units must be thorough in conducting a potential fraud investigation and must accurately report the results of its investigation to the IFB.  It was the failure of the investigation, the assumption of fraud without sufficient proof, the failure to talk to the people at the YMCA to see if Maxwell was actually working, that caused problems in Massachusetts.

Similarly, in California, As early as 1974 the California Supreme Court in The California Supreme Court, in Gruenberg v Aetna Insurance Co ., 9 Cal 3d 566, 108 Cal Rptr 480 (1973), concluded that unfounded actions by an investigator which caused an insured to be arrested for arson required implementation of what was then the new tort of bad faith and subjected Aetna to punitive and exemplary damages. Also, in a case called Frommoethelydo v. Fire Insurance Exchange , 42 Cal. 3d 208, 721 P.2d 41, 228 Cal. Rptr. 160 (Cal. 07/24/1986) found an insurer in difficulty even though the insured was taken to trial for insurance fraud, the court found the insurer could be sued for bad faith regardless of the partial immunity existing for reporting a suspicious claim to the Fraud Bureau. The California

Supreme Court said:
 
 On the other hand, the evidence shows that after the dismissal of the criminal charges the insurer breached its duty to investigate. (citation omitted) In Egan the evidence was undisputed that the insurer failed to properly investigate the plaintiff’s claim, and we held that the trial court correctly instructed the jury that a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was established.  In the instant case, once the insurer was advised of the existence of witnesses who had observed the equipment in plaintiff’s house, it had a duty to fairly investigate to determine whether plaintiff had a valid claim. The evidence is undisputed that the insurer failed to investigate when after dismissal of the criminal charges it learned of the existence of the witnesses. The undisputed evidence establishes a breach of the covenant. 
 
Insurers should think carefully and be wary of filing suit against an insured or accusing anyone of fraud. They should be aware that if they lose they will be punished as was Aetna, the Fire Insurance Exchange and so will AIG is Maxwell’s case goes to trial.

SIU investigators must always perform a complete and through investigation before accusing an insured or claimant of fraud. It must never assume facts as part of the investigation and should cover all issues in detail before making a report of their suspicion of fraud.

Insurers owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to their insureds and even when they suspect that fraud has been attempted, unless it is ready to prove its suspicion beyond a preponderance of the evidence, it must limit its activities with police agencies and prosecutors to the report of suspected fraud.

Fraud must be defeated by legal means. Fraud can never be defeated by innuendo.

 Independent Counsel 
 Posted on July 5, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 The History of Cumis Abuse 

 In 1995 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal dealt with a criminal conspiracy by a team of lawyers who used the decision of the California Court of Appeal in San Diego Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Ins. Society, Inc . (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 358 (Cumis) to defraud hundreds of insurers out of millions of dollars. The ringleader, Lynn Boyd Stites was eventually prosecuted. From the perspective of the government, it was established at trial that Stites had been the mastermind of a massive set of breaches of professional responsibility and of the criminal law, the more heinous because Stites was a lawyer and at least twelve other lawyers were his principal confederates in carrying out the fraud. The mentality that sees law as a business was taken to reductio ad absurdum–litigation was unconscionably churned to make money for the lawyers. The essence of Stites’s scheme, repeated over and over again, was for Stites to control both sides of suits in which insurance companies were paying for counsel, and to assure that the plaintiffs’ lawyers would not settle until the insurance companies would no longer pay the costs of defendants’ counsel. Stites’s network of lawyers was known as “the Alliance.” According to the jury verdict, Stites’s scams extracted at least $50 million from the insurers in the period 1984 to 1987. [ United States v. Stites , 56 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir., 1995).] His conviction was affirmed. At the same time one of the victims, Fireman’s Fund, sued Stites and his confederates.

The Cumis fraud attorneys were caught only when several insurers began comparing copies of the billings that had been submitted. This, coupled with the testimony of an honest attorney who was solicited to join the conspiracy, brought the Cumis attorneys to the attention of an Assistant United States Attorney who put together one of the largest insurance fraud cases in the history of California. After the convictions several insurers sued Stites and his co-conspirators for damages in Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. v. Stites , 258 F.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 08/03/2001).

 The abuses the Alliance imposed on insurers by misuse of the Cumis decision resulted in the Legislature enacting California Civil Code § 2860 to allow some protection to insurers including allowing them to limit Cumis counsel fees to those fees usually paid to counsel in the community by the insurer and to allow the insurer to compel arbitration of excessive fees.

 Dispute Over Cumis Fees 

Lawyers who defend people insured as independent counsel because an insurer reserved its rights to deny coverage usually charge higher rates than that paid by counsel who regularly work defending people who are insured and whose fees are regularly paid by insurers. They usually ask their client to agree to pay the difference between that paid by the insurer and that charged by the lawyers. Unlike private counsel lawyers who regularly represent insurers independent counsel are not concerned with billing an insurer more than the value of the case because their client is only required to pay the difference between what the insurer pays and what is billed. 

In Michael C. Behnke v. State Farm General Insurance Company , [No. D056898. Fourth Dist., Div. One. May. 31, 2011] the temptation to do everything possible to defend the client even when the amount of the exposure faced by the defendant is less than that billed, resulted in a situation where Michael C. Behnke (Behnke), the client, sued State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm) for breach of contract, insurance bad faith, and fraud. The suit resulted because of an attorney fees dispute between State Farm and the law firm of English&amp;Gloven, which Behnke had selected as his independent Cumis counsel to defend him against a third-party lawsuit.

Behnke agreed with English&amp;Gloven to be personally liable for the firm’s fees in the event State Farm failed to make full and timely payments. After objecting that English&amp;Gloven’s fees were excessive and attempting to replace the firm as Behnke’s independent counsel, State Farm allowed English&amp;Gloven to continue representing Behnke and allegedly promised at a January 2004 meeting to pay all of English&amp;Gloven’s fees that State Farm had not paid as of the time of the meeting.

State Farm eventually paid $50,000 to settle the underlying lawsuit against Behnke. By that time, English&amp;Gloven had billed State Farm a total of about $199,000 in fees and costs, four times the settlement amount. Although the fees billed did not even approach the churning done by the Alliance and Mr. Stites, the attorney fees charged resulted in dispute when State Farm paid $140,000 to English&amp;Gloven but refused to pay the remaining $59,000. Behnke signed a promissory note in the amount of $127,000 in favor of English&amp;Gloven secured by a deed of trust on his home. State Farm obtained an order compelling mandatory binding arbitration under Civil Code section 2860, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 2860(c)), and the arbitrator reduced the disputed $59,000 attorney fees claim by $16,000 to $43,000, which the arbitrator awarded to English&amp;Gloven with interest.

English&amp;Gloven, dissatisfied with the arbitration award and payment by State Farm, foreclosed on the deed of trust given by Behnke, and State Farm paid English&amp;Gloven’s reduced attorney fees claim with interest. Behnke unsuccessfully appealed from a judgment entered in favor of State Farm, after the trial court (1) sustained without leave to amend State Farm’s general demurrer to the fraud, promissory fraud, and equitable estoppel causes of action asserted in Behnke’s second amended complaint; and (2) granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm on Behnke’s remaining claims for breach of contract, bad faith denial of insurance benefits, and punitive damages.

 Factual and Procedural Background 

In its letter to Behnke dated February 28, 2003, State Farm informed him that it agreed to defend him in the Castaneda action, but that it was reserving its right to deny coverage on various grounds. State Farm reserved its right to deny coverage on the ground Behnke’s concealment of the mold was not an“occurrence”within the meaning of the policy, which defined“occurrence”as an“accident.”State Farm also reserved the right to deny coverage based on an exclusion that applied to any personal injury or property damage that was intended or expected by Behnke as the insured. 

As the fees mounted past the exposure faced by its insured State Farm changed its reservation of rights to avoid the conflict that allowed Behnke to originally demand independent counsel. State Farm took steps to retain new defense counsel but the lawyers refused to step aside. Rather, English&amp;Gloven disputed State Farm’s position that Behnke was no longer entitled to independent counsel.

In March 2004 the underlying Castaneda action was mediated, and the parties reached a settlement under which State Farm agreed to pay $50,000 to settle the claims against Behnke. The settlement was ultimately finalized in mid-June 2004.

By the time the Castaneda case ended, English&amp;Gloven had billed State Farm a total of about $199,000 for fees, almost four times the settlement amount.

 The Insurer Need Only Pay Reasonable and Necessary Defense Costs 

The Court of Appeal concluded that it is well established that an insurer that retains Cumis counsel to defend its insured is legally obligated to pay only reasonable and necessary defense costs. In light of both the fee limitation and mandatory arbitration provisions of section 2860(c) and State Farm’s letter to English&amp;Gloven expressly reserving the right to submit any disagreement over fees to arbitration under section 2860 effectively reserved that right. The undisputed material facts established that Behnke has no viable claim for breach of contract damages because State Farm paid all policy benefits Behnke was entitled to receive. Behnke claimed he suffered various uncompensated damages when State Farm disputed the reasonableness of English&amp;Gloven’s fees and asserts there are triable issues of material fact regarding the damages element of his breach of contract claim. 

Specifically, he alleged State Farm“breached its duty to defend when it ceased making any payment of defense fees and costs beginning in September 2003 and when it failed to make any payment for defense fees incurred on his behalf for over a year thereafter.”In sum, Behnke claimed that, as a result of State Farm’s failure to pay the full amount of fees and costs that English&amp;Gloven billed, including the amount the arbitrator determined was unreasonable, he suffered foreseeable and compensable harm because he became personally obligated under his own retainer agreement with English&amp;Gloven to pay for English&amp;Gloven’s unpaid fees and costs.

Since Behnke had no viable breach of contract claim against State Farm his claim for bad faith denial of insurance benefits fails as a matter of law.

Behnke’s bad faith claim also failed for the additional reason that, under the judicially recognized“genuine dispute”rule, State Farm’s decision to dispute English&amp;Gloven’s excessive billings was objectively reasonable as a matter of law. An insuer, like State Farm cannot be liable for bad faith if its conduct was objectively reasonable.

 Lesson 

Insurers must carefully and thoroughly investigate a third party liability claim against its insured before deciding to reserve rights in such a way that would require it to accept independent counsel. If a reservation of rights is necessary the insurer must ca refully advise the insured of the insurer’s rights under Civil Code § 2860, that if it disagreed with fees billed that it will arbitrate, that it will never pay more than the hourly rates it pays its panel counsel, that the insured will be personally responsible for the difference between what it agrees to pay and what is billed and that is ready to provide a competent attorney to defend the insured at no cost to the insured. The insurer must then carefully monitor the fees charged and when it appears they are being churned or are excessive it must immediately demand arbitration in accordance with California law.

 Happy Birthday USA 
 Posted on July 4, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 
 Today is the official birthday of the United States of America when it declared its independence from Great Britain.

I am thankful that my parents emigrated from what was then the Ottoman Empire as small children. My mother was five years old in 1917 when she arrived at Ellis Island and, as a resident of the Ottoman Empire had a life expectancy of about 45 years. Since the town where she was born was overrun by the Nazi armies in 1939 or 1940 she would have been killed, as were all Jewish residents of that town, before she reached the age of 30.  As a citizen of the US she is still going strong at 99 and appears indestructible.

No member of my family had a greater than third grade education until my elder brother. I was the first member of my family to graduate from college. My father—although not well educated—was a brilliant man who opened his own business and made it a success which my older brother inherited and made a greater success.

 We have lived the American dream. I have three grown children all of whom are college graduates and successful adults. I am able to practice law and consult with lawyers across the country in my field of expertise.

I am a native born citizen of the United States and proud to be the son of immigrants. There is no greater nation nor place to live. No other country in the world provides immigrants and the children of immigrants to succeed.

Happy Birthday USA and may you continue forever.

 The Absolute“Work Product”and“Attorney Client”Privileges 
 Posted on July 1, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Attempted Fraud 

 Insurance fraud is a serious crime in California. When a lawyer is provided with information that a fraud has been committed must work to protect the lawyer’s client from the fraud. In doing so the lawyer will collect information and after collecting the information will also form opinions and conclusions concerning the facts and the application of the law to the facts collected. In Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company et al v. Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles , No. B229880 (Cal.App. Dist.2 06/28/2011) the California Court of Appeal issued a rare writ of mandate ordering the trial court not to enforce its order requiring a lawyer to answer questions relating to protected work product and items protected by the attorney client privilege. The Court of Appeal found that the trial court’s decision misread the statutory privileges and that enforcing the trial court’s orders would produce an absurd result that would emasculate the privileges enacted by the Legislature.

The Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company and National Surety Corporation (hereinafter, collectively Fireman’s Fund) sought a writ of mandate vacating the trial court’s order which required an attorney, who was a member of a law firm that had formerly represented Fireman’s Fund in this litigation, to answer at her deposition five questions to which objections of attorney-client privilege and/or work product privilege had been asserted. In overruling these objections, the trial court generally held that:
 
 (1)     the attorney-client privilege applies only to communications directly between an attorney and his or her client, but does not extend to communications among and between multiple counsel (or other reasonably necessary parties) who are representing the client and 

 (2)     the absolute work product privilege applies only to an attorney’s work product that has been reduced to written form. 
 
The Court of Appeal by Justice Croskey explained the trial court’s ruling improperly restricted the scope of the two privileges and granted the writ sought by the Fireman’s Fund.

 Factual and Procedural Background 

 Front Gate Plaza LLC (hereinafter Front Gate) owns and operates a shopping mall in Lancaster, California. In April of 2008, Front Gate filed this action against Fireman’s Fund alleging, among other things, bad faith in the handling of certain property damage claims that had allegedly been sustained by Front Gate on July 20, 2006 as the result of wind and rain storms. Front Gate claimed that Fireman’s Fund had conducted an improper investigation and evaluation of the claims and, as a result, monetary benefits due under Fireman’s Fund’s policy were unreasonably delayed or denied.

In May of 2009, Fireman’s Fund’s counsel, Carlson, Calladine&amp;Peterson, LLP (CCP), was contacted by Sunil Chand (Chand), the acting director of accounting for Primero who claimed to be a whistleblower in possession of evidence demonstrating that Front Gate’s insurance claims were fraudulent. Chand spoke with attorney Melissa Dubbs, an associate at CCP. According to Chand, he had discovered that his employer was engaging in financial and accounting irregularities with respect to Front Gate. According to Chand, Front Gate sought insurance compensation for expenses which did not arise from covered events, submitted inflated repair bids from vendors who split insurance proceeds with the vendors who had submitted the inflated bids.

Chand was fired shortly after he informed his employer that he had filed amended 1099 forms for certain vendors and asserted that he no longer wished to be a party to fraud. According to Front Gate, Chand was a vindictive former employee who had lied on his resume, saw conspiracies where none existed, and had a history of making baseless accusations against prior employers. 

On or about June 7, 2009, Chand met with Dubbs and investigator Pierce in CCP’s office in San Francisco. He brought with him and delivered documents that he had copied from Primero’s records. At the request of Dubbs, CCP partner Donald Carlson wrote a check to Chand for $1,000 to reimburse him for his time and travel expense in coming from Los Angeles to San Francisco.

The parties became embroiled in protracted discovery disputes over the so-called“Chand documents/incident”because real parties refused to produce copies of the documents that Chand had provided to CCP and sought to preclude Fireman’s Fund from using these documents in this litigation.

Over Fireman’s Fund’s objections, the trial court ordered that Dubbs answer the five questions and reasonable follow-up questions seeking non-privileged information.

 The Decision 

 The Court of Appeal concluded that the Referee (and the trial court) took a very narrow and restricted view of the attorney-client privilege and the absolute work product privilege. The Referee expressed the view that the attorney-client privilege protects only communications between an attorney and a client, but not an attorney’s communications with members or agents of her law firm about client matters. In addition, because he was of the view that the communications at issue were not reduced to writing and did not seek an attorney’s legal opinions, the Referee concluded that only the qualified work product privilege applied and therefore those communications should be divulged to avoid unfair prejudice to real parties.

Fireman’s Fund responded with the petition for writ relief.

 The Attorney-Client Privilege Is Not Limited to Communications Directly Between a Client and His or Her Attorney 

The fundamental purpose of the attorney-client privilege is the preservation of the confidential relationship between attorney and client, and the primary harm in the discovery of privileged material is the disruption of that relationship. 

To effectuate this purpose, the attorney-client privilege gives a client the right to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between client and lawyer. A confidential communication between client and lawyer is information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so far as the client is aware, discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted, and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.

While most instances in which an assertion of the privilege is upheld involve communications between an attorney and client, the statutory language is not so narrow. The definition of a protected“confidential communication”includes“a legal opinion formed”by counsel. Legal opinions formed by counsel during representation of the client are protected“confidential communications,”even if the opinions have not been transmitted to the client.

 Moreover, Evidence Code section 952 provides that a“confidential communication”remains such when it is disclosed“to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted.”Surely, third persons to whom the information (in this case, an attorney’s legal opinions) may be conveyed without destroying confidentiality include other attorneys in the law firm representing the client. The California Supreme Court has recognized that it is an everyday reality that attorneys, working together and practicing law in a professional association, share each other’s, and their clients confidential information. Such sharing cannot abrogate the privilege protecting an attorney’s legal opinions.

The issue also arises as to whether the legal opinions may be shared with a non-attorney agent retained by the attorney to assist with the representation without losing their confidential status.

 The questions clearly invaded the attorney client privilege. 

 The Absolute Work Product Privilege Depends Not On the Existence of a Writing but Rather on the Nature of the Claimed Privileged Matter 

The work product privilege is currently codified in California and provides an absolute privilege for a writing that reflects an attorney’s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories, and subdivision (b) provides a qualified privilege for all attorney work product other than a writing described in subdivision (a). 

An attorney’s work is reflected in interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways–aptly though roughly termed the “Work product of the lawyer.”

If such materials are open to opposing counsel on mere demand much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten. An attorney’s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own. Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial. The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.

The Court of Appeal, therefore, concluded that the statute provides absolute protection to written opinion work product and qualified protection to written non-opinion work product, with the implicit understanding that unwritten opinion work product is already entitled to absolute protection. Based on considerations of legislative history, interpretation of the similar federal work product privilege, and to avoid absurdity the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate to protect the lawyer from the need to answer the questions protected.

If the trial court’s opinion was the law its interpretation of the privilege would inevitably result in attorneys documenting their every thought (in order to obtain complete protection for their work product) at the expense of higher client bills for the time taken in documentation, and at the risk of malpractice lawsuits if the failure to document an opinion resulted in its being held discoverable. Such a result, in the opinion of the trail could not have been the intent of the Legislature to create such absurd results. 

 Applica tion of Work-Product Privilege 

The courts concluded “that unwritten opinion work product is entitled to the protection of the absolute work product privilege in California.”

 

The Court of Appeal granted the petition for writ of mandate and ordered that upon remand, the trial court is directed to vacate its order of November 18, 2010 and to enter a new and different order sustaining the petitioners’objections to most of the deposition questions to which Fireman’s Fund objected.

 Lesson 

It is not only not nice to seek the work product or attorney client communications of an adverse party it is strictly prohibited. Any lawyer who is called upon to testify must diligently and vigorously refuse to so testify.

 The Need for Simple Declarative Sentences 
 Posted on June 30, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 CGL Exclusion for Injuries to Children Ambiguous in Florida 

 The most difficult task faced by an underwriter, and those representing underwriters, is to write insurance policy provisions in clear and unambiguous language. It has become even more difficult when the underwriter is required to use language that is “easy to read” for a person with only a fourth grade education. People who write insurance policy wordings must be precise. Sesame Street English is, by its very nature, imprecise. Underwriters when writing an insurance policy should limit their writing to simple declarative statements. The use of multiple commas, semi-colons,  conjunctions and contractions will not assist the insurer in its effort to convey clear meaning. Such use will cause the insurer nothing but trouble.

In North Pointe Casualty Insurance Company v. M&amp;S Tractor Services, Inc. , 36 Fla. L. Weekly D1365a (Fla. 2d DCA June 24, 2011), the Court of Appeals of Florida found that the failure to use precise language that was understandable was fatal to an attempt to exclude a loss. In fact, the court found that it could not understand how to accurately apply an exclusionary provision at all. Since the provision was ambiguous the court also found that coverage was not excluded even though it appeared to the Court of Appeal that it was the intent of the insurer to exclude the loss.

The critical endorsement, entitled “Exclusion of Injury to Employees, Contractors and Employees of Contractors,” is identified as NP-08-16-02-06 and was different from the exclusion in the Insurance Service Office Commercial General Liability Policy (CGL).

 Facts 

North Pointe Casualty Insurance Company (North Pointe) appealed a declaratory judgment determining that its liability insurance policy issued to M&amp;S Tractor Services, Inc. (M&amp;S), provides coverage for an accident in which the young son of Glenn and Aimee Hines was severely injured. Mr. Hines is the president of M&amp;S and was operating a farm tractor in the course and scope of his employment with the corporation when his son sustained these injuries by falling off the tractor. The Court of Appeal noted that although North Pointe undoubtedly intended to exclude coverage for this claim it concluded that the liability policy’s exclusion for injuries to children of employees of the named insured was not effective to exclude North Pointe’s coverage for the claim.

In June 2007, Mr. Hines allowed his seven-year-old son to ride on a John Deere tractor operated by Mr. Hines in the course and scope of his employment with M&amp;S. M&amp;S is apparently a small, family corporation. Mr. Hines is both president of the corporation and an employee. The young boy fell from the tractor, and one of the tractor’s wheels hit him. He sustained serious injuries.

Aimee Hines, as parent and natural guardian, filed a lawsuit against M&amp;S alleging that the tractor’s operator, her husband, had been negligent and that his negligence resulted in these injuries. The parties to this appeal agreed to stay that lawsuit while they determined whether North Pointe provided coverage for this occurrence. 

 The Policy 

 It was undisputed that North Pointe issued a comprehensive liability insurance policy (CGL) to M&amp;S for the period in which this accident happened. The policy provides coverage and a duty of defense for claims involving bodily injury and property damage as defined within the policy.

There is no dispute that the primary policy provides coverage for a bodily injury of the sort sustained by this young boy. The main body of North Pointe’s policy contains a standard exclusion for bodily injury to a child of an employee of the insured when the injury was a consequence of the employment. If that language applied in this case, it would appear to exclude coverage for this claim. But in this particular policy, a special endorsement has replaced the standard exclusion language. This case concerns primarily provision III of the endorsement.
 
 
 This insurance does not apply to: 
 * * * 
 III.“Bodily injury”sustained by the spouse, child, parent, brother or sister of any employee of any insured, or of a contractor, or of an employee of a contractor of any insured as a consequence of“bodily injury” to such employee, contractor, or employee of such contractor, arising out of and in the course of such employment or retention by or for any insured. (Emphasis added) 
 
The controversy in this case centers on the restrictive clause “as a consequence of ‘bodily injury’ to such employee, contractor, or employee of such contractor.” There are eight commas in the critical sentence that make it difficult to determine the subject that this clause restricts.

 Analysis 

North Pointe asserts that the plain language of this sentence means “ [t]his insurance does not apply to . . . [b]odily injury sustained by the . . . child . . . of an employee of any insured . . . arising out of and in the course of employment or retention by or for any insured.” This is essentially the same language contained in the standard policy before the special endorsement superseded it. This reading of the exclusion requires that the restrictive clause apply only to the phrase,“of an employee of a contractor of any insured.”

This interpretation arguably excludes coverage for the claim in this lawsuit, but it would exclude coverage for the children of employees of contractors only if those injuries were the consequence of injuries to“such employee, contractor, or employee of such contractor.”This interpretation would result in better coverage for the children of employees of contractors of the insured than for those of employees of the insured for no apparent reason. The Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that the exclusion should be read as follows: “This insurance does not apply to . . . ‘[b]odily injury’ sustained by the . . . child . . . of any employee of any insured . . . as a consequence of ‘bodily injury’ to such employee . . ., arising out of and in the course of such employment or retention by or for any insured.”

Consequently, the Court of Appeal found, because the young boy’s injuries were not the result of an injury to an employee of an insured, the exclusion does not apply to his injuries. The Court of Appeal concluded that the exclusion is unlikely to address the underwriting concerns of the drafter. Nevertheless, the court found that it could not ignore the restrictive clause. The drafter included it, and so the court was required to give it meaning. After grappling with the cumbersome critical sentence, the Court of Appeal concluded that the exclusion at issue was ambiguous. It commented that “the plethora of commas that punctuate this provision, along with the placement of the restrictive clauses, probably allows for no interpretation that has a clear meaning, and the provision is susceptible to more than one debatable meaning.”

 Lesson 

Insurers should not tinker with standard policy language unless they can write more succinctly and clearly than the ISO drafters. In this case the drafters of the policy wording in issue was so ambiguous that the court concluded that there was “no interpretation that has a clear meaning.” I have written policy wordings. It is the most difficult writing I have ever done. It is essential, when writing a policy or endorsement to a policy must use simple language without complexity. Each term that is used that is not clear on its face should be clarified by a definition that gives it a special meaning. Each sentence in the provision should be limited to a single verb. There should be no contractions, no conjunctions, and as little punctuation as possible. Failure to create a policy wording without simple declarative sentences will find insurers like North Pointe paying claims they had no intention of covering.

 “CSL” Standing Alone Is Ambiguous 
 Posted on June 28, 2011 by Barry Zalma 
 Key Terms Must Be Defined 

 A major automobile accident between a bus carrying developmentally disabled people and a driver on the wrong side of the road resulted in multiple deaths and major injuries to those not killed. The responsible driver had limited insurance. The bus operator – whose driver was claimed to have been inattentive and using her cell phone – had a policy with $1 million underinsured motorist coverage and $1 automobile liability insurance.

The insurer interpleaded $1 million—by depositing the funds in court—because it alleged its policy limit was stated to be “$1 million CSL”. In the insurance industry “CSL” is well known to mean “combined single limit.” It is not a widely known definition to those who are not involved in the business of insurance. The policy did not define CSL and as a result the insurer found it must make available another $1 million to the injured parties with the insurer assuming its insured was liable to the injured for up to $1 million in liability coverage.

In Philadelphia Indemnity v. Luther Austin, et al, 2011 Ark. 283 (June 23, 2011) the Arkansas Supreme Court found an ambiguity in the policy issued by Focus appealed an order of the Craighead County Circuit Court denying appellant’s motion for declaratory judgment and motion to dismiss and ruling that the language of its insurance policy is ambiguous. Luther Austin, et al were successful at the trial court. The basis of the trial court’s decision was its finding that the Focus policy was ambiguous. The Arkansas Supreme Court agreed.

 Facts 

On May 27, 2009, Heath T. Bakken, driving a maroon Chrysler PT Cruiser, traveled southbound in the northbound-inside lane of Highway 63 in Craighead County. At that same time, Angela F. Austin, who drove a white Ford F450 bus, traveled northbound on Highway 63 in the inside lane of traffic. Austin drove the bus as a transport vehicle for Focus, a nonprofit entity formed for children and adults with disabilities. The two vehicles collided, causing several passengers’deaths and serious injuries to others. Following an investigation, an Arkansas State Police officer concluded that fault of the accident rested with Bakken because he drove his vehicle the wrong way on a one-way roadway at an excessive speed.

Bakken was insured by a policy of liability insurance with 21st Century Insurance. The policy had a property-damage limit of $25,000 per accident and bodily-injury coverage that provided a limit of $50,000 in the aggregate. Because most of the subsequent claims exceeded Bakken’s policy limits, the Bakken vehicle was underinsured for the damages caused by its driver. At the time of the accident, Focus was insured by appellant for underinsured-motorist coverage with an alleged damage limit of $1 million.

 On August 13, 2009, appellant filed a complaint for interpleader.  Focus, upon deposit of the insurance-policy proceeds into the registry, requested to be discharged from further liability with respect to the proceeds. On September 30, 2009, the circuit court entered an order interpleading appellant’s funds, and appellant tendered funds totaling $1 million to the circuit clerk.

The injured passengers and the administrators of the deceased passengers’estates filed counterclaims against the insurer for the charitably immune Focus, and alleged that Focus negligently failed to restrict its driver, Austin, from using her cell phone while driving the bus.

 The Insurer’s Contention 

The insurer filed a motion for declaratory judgment and motion to dismiss the counterclaims, alleging that the insurance policy was a combined-single-limit (“CSL”) policy that provided coverage for the maximum amount of $1 million, regardless of whether the liability coverage or the underinsured-motorist coverage applied. The insurer stated that it had already paid the full amount and requested a dismissal of appellees’counterclaims. Focus also requested that the court grant its motion for declaratory judgment and motion to dismiss and that the court issue an order ruling that it could not be liable for any funds beyond the $1 million previously tendered to the circuit clerk.

 The Claims of the Injured 

The injured argued that the interpleaded $1 million was specifically limited to the underinsured-motorist coverage that appellant had with Focus, its insured. They contended that the insurer provided an additional $1 million in liability coverage in the business-auto declarations of its liability policy. They supported the claim because Focus paid a separate premium of $2502 under the business-auto provision, a separate premium of $82 for an auto-medical-pay limit of $5000, and a separate premium of $96 for the underinsured motorist coverage of $1 million. The insureds argued there was separate coverage for underinsured motorist and liability.

 The Trial Court’s Conclusions 

 In its order, the circuit court ruled that the language of the policy was ambiguous. Specifically, the court noted that the Declarations Page of the policy clearly showed coverage limits of $1 million for both liability and underinsured-motorist coverage followed by the letters“CSL.”The court ruled that“nothing before the court . . . indicate[d] that Focus, Inc., the insured, was familiar with the abbreviation‘CSL’and its meaning”and that nothing clearly confirmed that the policy was a“CSL”policy.

 The Ambiguity 

Different clauses of an insurance contract must be read together and the contract construed so that all of its parts harmonize, if that is at all possible, and, giving effect to one clause to the exclusion of another on the same subject where the two are reconcilable, is error.

The issue the Supreme Court was called upon to decide is whether the insurance policy, which reflects liability coverage of“$1 million CSL”and underinsured-motorist coverage of“$1 million CSL,”provides an aggregate coverage of $2 million or a coverage limited solely to $1 million. Finding ambiguity the Supreme Court noted that the “CSL” term is not defined in the 248-page policy, nor is it found anywhere else in the policy other than the“Schedule of Coverages and Covered Autos.”

For the same reasons articulated by the trial court, the Supreme Court concluded that:
 
 [T]he CSL notation plus any alleged limiting language of the policy does not automatically create a CSL policy. The term CSL was not adequately defined in the policy, and any limiting language emphasized by appellant as setting a $1 million limit is inapplicable. 

 
 
 Lessons 

This case is proof that serious injuries, low policy limits and inadequate underwriting makes for bad law. Philadelphia could have saved a million dollars and avoided a finding by a state Supreme Court that the use of“CSL”creates an ambiguity when all they needed to do was add a simple definition stating:
 
 “CSL”when used any where in this policy means“combined single limit”and that regardless of the different coverages the most we will pay regardless of the number of persons injured or property damaged in a single occurrence is $1 million. 
 
The failure to explain gave the court authority to cause the insurer to pay $1 million more than they though the would have to pay in a worst case scenario and deprived themselves of adequate premium for the risk the insurer was taking.  On the other hand the decision indicates that the claims department misread the intent of the policy when it caused only $1 to be interpleaded and caused the insurer, the insured and the injured much litigation and unnecessary expense.

Four New E-Books
 
&quot;Zalma on Insurance Fraud - 2012&quot;

Barry Zalma has totally rewritten his seminal E-Book on insurance fraud and has added over 600 pages to the original book.

Insurance fraud continually takes more money each year than it did the last from the insurance buying public. Estimates of the extent of insurance fraud in the United States range from $87 billion to $300 billion every year.

In truth, no one really knows the extent of insurance fraud because most frauds succeed without the insurer even suspecting that it is being defrauded. Insurers and government backed pseudo-insurers can only estimate the extent they lose to fraudulent claims. No one will ever place an exact number on the amount lost to insurance fraud but everyone who has looked at the issue know – in their heart and gut – that the number is enormous and that when insurers and governments put out effort to reduce the amount of insurance fraud the number of claims presented to insurers and the pseudo-insurers drops logarithmically.

It is the purpose of the E-book to provide information to those who are engaged in the effort to reduce insurance fraud. It will provide information for the lawyers representing insurers so that they can adequately advise their clients who are victims of the crime of insurance fraud.

This E-book will provide information for insurance claims investigators, special insurance fraud investigators working at insurance company Special Investigation Units (SIU), Fraud Bureau Investigators, and Prosecutors will have the information needed to allow prosecution of insurance criminals to proceed. Prosecutors will also have sufficient information to understand the importance of the crime and the need to reduce the crime by effective prosecution and punishment of the insurance fraud perpetrators.

By including the full text of decisions from courts of appeal, state supreme courts, and federal courts across the country the reader can understand what happens after the investigation is completed in order to better complete the investigation. Since the effort to reduce insurance fraud requires the assistance of courts – both civil and criminal – the prudent fraud investigator, insurance adjuster, insurance attorney or insurance Special Investigation Units, and insurance management will have the information to deal with state investigators and prosecutors. It is also necessary to read the full text of decisions of the courts of appeal to fully understand the facts gathered by the investigators and prosecutors.

&quot;Zalma On Diminution In Value Damages - 2012&quot;

The 2012 edition of Zalma On Diminution In Value Damages. It has been totally rewritten with more than 240 pages of new cases and statutes. It is the most extensive and detailed coverage of the issue and how to apply diminution in value damages to losses to property. The E-book Zalma on Diminution In Value Damages – 2012 was written to provide sufficient information to those who became interested in the issue since the Georgia Supreme Court decided State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Mabry, 274 Ga. 498, 556 S.E.2d 114 (Ga. 11/28/2001).

Because confusion has reigned across the United States concerning the proper measure of damages for property damage to property has been repaired. It will assist you in answer the questions concerning the proper measure of damage in each of the fifty United States and federal United States jurisdictions. It will allow you to find the answer in the appropriate jurisdiction if the proper measure of damage:

* Is it cost of repair?
* Is it the difference between fair market value before and fair market value after it is damaged?
* Is it the cost of repair plus stigma damages?
* Is it the cost of repair plus the difference between fair market value before and fair market value after it is damaged?
* Is it something in the middle?

The subject of diminution of value damages caused serious concern to the insurance industry because insurers believed their policies were clear and were only required to pay the cost of repair. It also caused concern to appraisers, adjusters, lawyers and every person who incurred property damage. The methodology used to establish true indemnity is different in each decision. The application of which measure of damages is to be used is different from state to state and from U.S. District Court of Appeal to District Court of Appeal.

Because of the differences in the various jurisdiction and apparent confusion concerning diminution of value damages this E-Book was created to more thoroughly review how each jurisdiction in the United States deals with the issue. The E-book covers each of the fifty states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the 12 Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court.

Every lawyer retained to prosecute or defend a civil suit should begin the representation with efforts to find insurance coverage for the benefit of the client. Indeed, a lawyer that does not know the law of insurance is litigating with duct tape firmly placed across his or her mouth.

The E-book, in more than 1100 pages, begins with a history of insurance starting with a 1776 decision of the British House of Lords that established the existence of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and pushes through to issues relating to interpretation of insurance contracts, remedies available to insurers and the policyholder, and the litigation of issues. The E-book provides the full text of definitive cases and analysis by Mr. Zalma, an internationally recognized insurance coverage, insurance claims handling, insurance fraud and insurance bad faith expert and consultant.

It also contains appendices including the full text of the California Standard Fire Insurance Policy, a glossary of insurance terms, and some insurance fraud statutes from across the country.

Zalma On Insurance—The Blog
 After more than 40 years acting as a claims person and insurance coverage lawyer I enjoy reading court decisions concerning insurance. The idea of this blog is to find new cases that are interesting to me and then write a summary. Some of the cases reviewed will be important. Some may be of first impression. Others will be totally unimportant. All will be interesting.

The blog is also intended to act as an almost daily update of the E-Book &quot;Zalma on Insurance&quot; available at http://www.zalma.com/zalmabooks.htm. 
Insurance Claims: A Comprehensive Guide
 by Barry Zalma, J.D., C.F.E

Now available on CD and electronically so that you can take it with you on your I-Pad, book reader or laptop.

This one-of-a-kind Guide covers the fields of property insurance claims, liability, and fraud. It is ideal both as a detailed reference for the insurance professional and as a plain language guide for those—such as attorneys and business owners—who frequently interact with the industry. In addition to examining the nature of property and liability policies and the processing of claims under these policies, the Guide discusses the complexities of such topics as underwriting, bad faith, subrogation and salvage, duties of the insured and insurer, and declaring a policy void.
