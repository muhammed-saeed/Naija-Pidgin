A hostess gift is a small gift to say thank you for the invitation and the hospitality. Since your host or hostess is obviously someone who entertains others in their home, a theme of gifts for decorating or serving when entertaining are usually a safe bet.

POTTED PLANTS:

A small pot of mini roses or ivy in the spring, a fragrant potted herb like chocolate mint or basil to compliment summer recipes, a colorful mum in the fall or an elegant poinsettia in winter are always appropriate and ready to be delivered.
 
LOCAL TREASURES:

People appreciate local and homemade. Honey, jams or jellies, salsas, wines or maple syrups are also welcome choices. Simply tie a ribbon appropriate to the season or theme of the get together around the top and you&apos;re ready to go!

COCKTAIL or DESSERT NAPKINS:

There is a pack of napkins that is just right for every hostess. For close friends, consider the ones with comical slogans. There are also napkins with initials, hobbies or seasonal themes. People who like to entertain enjoy fun and unique napkins.

SPECIALTY COFFEES OR TEAS:

Flavored coffees or hot teas, like the health beneficial green or black teas are an appropriate hostess gift. After all the hard work cooking, cleaning and entertaining, a cup of java or hot tea may be just the treat your hosts need.

A PHOTO ALBUM&amp;A PROMISE TO FILL IT:

If you have a good camera and enjoy taking pictures, consider taking your host or hostess a small photo album and let them know that you&apos;ll soon be sending them photos from the party to fill it up.

JAR CANDLES:

Jar candles come in a variety of colors and scents appropriate for every season and to please any host or hostess. A baker might enjoy Yankee Candle&apos;s cinnamon bun or chocolate cupcake scents. For holiday hosts and hostesses there are mulling spice or eggnog scents. If your hostess is eco-conscious, consider soy candles.

GIFTS OF THE SEASON:

Keep in mind the season and the reason for the dinner party or party. If it is Christmas, consider a personalized tree ornament. For a New Year&apos;s party, how about a unique calendar? For summer time party, consider fresh, locally grown vegetables, herbs or fruits.

Just in case the hostess is busy when you arrive, always put a small tag with greetings and your name on the gift.
