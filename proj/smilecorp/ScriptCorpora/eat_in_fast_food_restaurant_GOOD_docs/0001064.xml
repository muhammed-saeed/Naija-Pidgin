JPECT and gratitude having en- 
me to compile a memoir of my 
deceafed Mafter and Patron Mr. Bowyer, 
in the fame performance I included anec- 
dotes of all the eminent perfons any way 
connected with him. A note of about a 
&apos; page&apos;s length was allotted to Hogarth. 
&apos; While it was printing, Mr. Walpole&apos;s 
Fourth Volume on the fubjedt of Englilh 
Painters came out, and was followed by 
an immediate rage for collcdting every 
I icrap of our Artift&apos;s defigns. Perfever- 
I ing in my enquiries among my friends, 
Ll had now amalfed fo much intelligence 
I relative to thefe engravings, that it could 
f no longer be crowded into the fituation 
I originally meant for it. I was therefore 
advifed to publilh it in the form of a Iix- 
penny pamphlet. This intended publi- 
cation, however, grew up by d grees into 
a three-fliilling book, and, within a year

THE author of thefe imperfedt fheets cannot 
prefcnt them a fecond &quot;time ro the world, before ho 
has cxpreffed his gratitude for the extreme candour 
ivith which they have been treated by the Menthlf 
Rcviezvers. If J. N. ha? hoe availed himfclf of all 
the corrcftions defigned for his fcrvice, it is becaufe 
the able critic who propofes them has been deluded 
by intelligence manifellly erroneous. _/, W. received 
each particular he has mentioned, in refpeil to the 
affillanca beftowed on Higarib while his Anahjis was 
preparing, from Dr. More!!, a gentleman who on that 
fubjcdt could not eafily miftake. Implicit confideuce 
ought rather to be repofed In a literary co.idjutor lu 
the deceafed, than in any confiftory of females that 
ever &quot;mumbled their wifdom over a goffip&apos;s bowl.&quot; 
Authors rarely acquaint domeftic women with the 
progrefs of their writings, or the projiorrion of aid 
they folicic from their friends. If it were needful 
that Dr. Morell fhould tranflate a Greek paffage * for 
Hogiulh, how chanced it that our artift Ihould wane 
to apply wh:it he did not previoufly underftand ? I

rvtewer concerning thefe /fnecdotes, bear no rcfetn- 
blaiicc to the opinion circulated by tlie cavillers with 
whom he appears to have had a remote connexion. 
The patties who fumiflied every circumftance on 
which he founds his reiterated charges of error and 
mtfin formation^ are not unknown. Ever fince this 
little work was edited, the people ibout Mrs. Ho- 
garth have paid their court to her by decrying it as 
** low, ftupid, or falfe,&quot; without the Jlighteft ac- 
knowledgement for the fums of money it has con- 
duded to The Golden Head in Leicefier Fields. While 
the talents of the writer alone were queftioned by 
fuch inadequate judges of literary merit, a defence 
on his part was quite unneceflary. He has waited, 
however, with impatience for an opportunity of 
making fome reply to their groundlefs rcAeftions on 
his veracity. This purpofe he flatters himfelf will 
have been completely executed after he has ob- 
ferved that all credentials relative to his difputed 
aflertion (hall be ready (as they arc at this moment) 
for the Reviewer&apos;s iufpeftion. J. N. cannot indeed 
difmifs his prcfent advertifement without obferving, 
that though the amiable partialities of a wife may 
apologize for any contradiction fuggcftcd by Mrs. 
Hogarth hcrfelf, the EngHJb language is not ftrong 
enough to cxprcfs the contempt he feels in regard 
to The accumulated ceafure both of her male and 
her female ParaCtes. y. N,

Advertisement to the first Edition* 

WHEN this pamphlet was undertaken, the 
Author had no thought of fwelling it to it&apos;s prefcnt 
bulk ; but communicating his defign to his friends, 
they favoured him with various particulars of in- 
formation. Some of thefe accommodated themfelves 
to his original plan, if he can be luppofed to have 
had any, but others were more intradable. Still 
aware of the value even of disjointed materials, which 
his profeffion would not afford him leifure to com- 
pad into a regular narrative, and confcious that thefe 
fheets, rude and imperfedt as they are, may ferve to 
promote a publication Icfs unworthy of its fubjedt, 
he difmifTes his prefent work without any laboured 
apology for the errors that may be detedted in it ; 
claiming, indeed, fome merit on account of intelli- 
gence, but not the leaft on the fcore of arrangement 
or compofition. He takes the fame opportunity to 
obferve, that many curious anecdotes of extraordi- 
nary perfons have been unfortunately loft, becaufc 
the pofleflbrs of thofe fugitive particulars had not 
the power of communicating them in proper form, 
or polilhed language, and were unwilling to expofe 
them in fuch a ftate as thefe are offered to the world.

The ingenious Mr. Crayen of Leipzig hav- 
ing tranflated theFirft Edition of thcfe Anec- 
dotes,&amp;c. into the German Language, dif- 
patched a copy of his work to y. N. attended 
by the obliging letter here fubjoined : 

SIR, 
THOUGH I have not the honour of being 
acquainted with you, I hope your goodnefs will ex- 
cufc the liberty I take of fending you a German 
tranilaiion of the Biographical Aiiccdetes of Mr. Ho- 
garth you published. Being convinced of the merits 
of your produdlion, and its ufefulnefs to fuch col- 
Icflors of prints and connoiflcurs in our country as 
don&apos;t undcrftand the En^lijb language, I undertook 
this tranllation, and flatter myfelf you will be 
pleafed to accept of it as a proof of my real efteem 
for you. 

You will find, that I did not always adhere lite- 
rally to the original, but made fomc abridgments, 
alterations, notes,&amp;c.&amp;c. But I hope you will do 
me the juftice to confider, that I wrote for my coun- 
trymen, and therefore left out fuch palTages, poems, 
anecdotes,

inrerefting to them, and have fwelled the volume to 
no purpofe. 

As to the typographical performance, I think you 
will be tolerably laclsfied of it. Though the noble 
art of printing is of Gennan origin, your nation has 
improved and brought it to the higheft pitch of 
perfection in point of neatnefs, elegance, and cor- 
reftncfs. 

I remain, with all pofEble efteem.

PREFACE. 



To the GzRMAS Reader. 



COIXECTORS of the Fioc Am were already 
polleircil ot Catdsguts and Mfxoires Raijonaees of the 
engraving! of many great maflers, for which their 
ackno&apos;A&apos;lcdgemenis are due to the iaduflry of a 
Ger/aint, ijemiert, a Hec^uet, a VtrtiUf i dc tf^attTf&amp;c. Sec 

But a fimilar illuftralion of Hosarth&apos;s copper- 
plates was ftill wanting; though it may be aflied 
what works have a juftcr claim to a diflinguifticd 
place in a compleat collcdion, than thole of this 
inflruftive moral painter, this creative genius ? 

On this account, it ts prefumed that the German 
Lover of the Arts will deem himfelf indebted to 
the T(anflator, for giving him, in his own tongue, 
a concife and faithful verfton of a book that has 
lately made its appearance in London, under the 
title of &quot; Biographical Anecdotes of fl&apos;. Hcgarth, 
** and a Catalogue of bis Works chronologically ar- 
*&apos; ranged.&quot; 

7 The&lt;I 




The Compiler as well as Editor of this work h 
Mr. John Nichols, a PriHler and Bvekfvlltr m 
/,&apos;/«&lt;/,)», who, bymuch reading, and an intimate ac- 
quaintance with the Arts and Literature of his 
Country, has honourably diftinguiflied himfelf a- 
mong his profeffional brethren. Ho&apos;k modeftly he 
himfelf judges of this his ufeful performance, ap- 
pears from hia preface to the work. 

It is true, Mr. Ko:!ack Walpolr, who pofll-ffes 
perhaps the comple-itcrt collection of the prinrs of 
this Marter, fomc years ago publitlied a Catalogue 
of them -, but this is only to be found in his work, 
intituled, &quot;&apos; Anecdotes of Puitilhg in Eng&apos;.j&gt;uf coUeiied 
*• by G. Vcrtui;, and ■publijktd by U. WalpUi&quot; a per- 
formance confifting of four volumes in 410, too 
coltly for many collcflors, and inconvenient foj 
others. Moreover all that is to be found there re- 
lative to Hogarth, is not only included in Mr. 
Nichh&apos;i publication, but is alfo improved by confi- 
derable additions, fo that the curious reader has H^al- 
pole&apos;s Catalogue incorporated with the prefent wotk. 

The liberty of abridgement, as mentioned in thft- 
title, is venrurcd only in regard to fuch diflufe illuf- 
trations, repetitions, anecdotes, and local flories, as 
would be alone intcrcfting to an Etiglijhman; in a word, 
in fuch parts as do not immediately contribute to 
the illuftration of Hogarth&apos;s plates, and would have 
tired the patience of the Gtrman reader. Of the verfe* 
affixed to each copper-plate the firft and laft words 
only are given, as thofe afford fufficient indication 

for 



I 



for a coUeilor who wiftics to become acquainted 
wirh any particular print. How far fome remarks 
of the TranQator are ufcful, or otherwife, is left fo 
the indulgent decifion of Judges in the Arts. 

He ttiuft not however forget it is his duty to ac- 
knowledge the goodnefs of old &quot;Mr. Hansen of 
Ltipjig. fhis gentleman&apos;s readinel&apos;s in permitting 
him to examine his excellent colleftion of the en- 
gravings of 5r//;yl&amp;artifts, for the purpofe of com- 
paring and illuftrati:ig fcveral paffigcs in the origi- 
nal of this work, claims his warmefl thanks, and a 
public acknowledgement.

^ HOGARTH&apos;S ORIGINAL WORKS. 

^&apos; AS an opinion generally prevail?, that the genuine 
impreffions of HogartVs works are very bad, and the 
plates retouched ; Mrs. Hogarth is under the neceffity 
of acquainting the public in general, and the ad- 
mirers of her deccafed hufband&apos;s works in particular, 
that it has been owin^ to a want of proper attention 
in the conducing this work for fome years paft, that 
the imprefions in general have not done juftice to 
the condition of the plates ; and fhe has requefted 
fome gentlemen moft eminent in the art of engrav- 
ing/ to infpei^ the plates, wiio have given the fol- 

lowing opinion ; 

^ London^ Jan. 21, 1783. 

** We, whofe names are underwritten, having care- 
fully examined the copper-plates publilhed by the 
late Mr. Hogarth^ are fully convinced that they hf viJ 
Slot been retouched lince hU death.

&apos; N. B. All* the original works arc now properly 
and well printeJ, and to be had of Mrs. Hogarth, at 
her houfe at The Golden Head, in Leicefter-FUldi.&quot; 

This is one of the mod extraordinary tcftimonials 
ieverla\d before the public. Hogarth died in 1764. 
Since [hat time his plates have been injudicioufly 
and unmercifully worked, fo as to leave no means 
of afcertaining, through any obfcrvaiion or proccfs 
of art, the exa£t period when they were laft repair- 
qd. Notwithftanding this difficulty, in the year 
1783, we 6nd feveral engravers of eminence declar- 
ing their full conviftlon on the fubjeft. All we can 
do is. to fuppofc their confidence was grounded on 
the veracity of Mrs. Hcgarth. 1 believe the parties 
as to the h€t ; and yet It was impoffiblc for Meflieurs 
B. W. and R. to be adequate judges of the truth to 
which they have fct iheir names as witnefles.

HOGARTH. 

THIS gf eat and original Genius is faid by Dr« 
Burn^ to have been the defccndant of a family 
originally from Kirkby Thore^ in Wefimor eland : and I 
am affured that his grandfather was a plain yeoman, 
who poffefled a fmall tenement in the vale of Bomp^ 
toiij a village about 15 miles North of KenJal^ in 
that county. He had three fons. The eldeft affifted 
his father in farmings and fucceeded to his little free- 
hold. The fecond fettled in Troutbeck^ a village 
eight miles North Weft of Kendaly and was remar- 
kable for his talent at provincial poetry -f*. The

However Aid Hogard might have fucceeded in the dramatic 
line, and before a rudic audience, his poems of a different 
form are every way contemptible. Want of grammar, metre, 
fenfe, and decency, are their invariable chara^teriftics. This 
opinion is founded on a thorough examination of a whole 
bundle of them, tranfmitted by a friend fince the firft publi- . 
cation of this work.

During his apprenticelhip, he fet out one Sunday^.

a public-h6ufe, where they had not been long, be- 
fore a quarrel arofc between fome perfons in the

^&apos; ihould purfue,*&apos; with too laughable a fu&quot;bjed to 
be oviprlooked* He drew out his pencil, and pro- 
duced on the fpot one of the mod ludicrous figures 
that ever was feen. What .rendered this piece the 
more valuable was, that it exhibited an exaft like- 
ncfs of the man, with the portrait of his antagonift, 
and the figures in caricature of the principal perfons 
gathered round him. This anecdote was furniflied 
by one of his fellow apprentices then prefent, a 
pcrfon of indifputable charadcr, and who continued 
his intimacy with Hogarth long after ihey both grew

&apos;^ lencc. It was charaftcr, the paffions^ the foul, 
*&apos; that his genius was given him to copy. In co- 
•• louring he proved no greater a maftcr : his force 
*&apos; lay in cxprcflion, not in tints and chiaro fcuro/* 

To a man who by indefatigable induftry and un- 
common ftrength of genius has been the artificer of 
his own fame and fortune, it can be no reproach to 
have it faid that at one period he was not rich. It 
has been aflerted, and we believe with good founda- 
tion, that the fkill and afliduity of Hogarth were, 
even in his fervitude, a fingular affiftance to his own 
family, and to that of his maftcr. It happened, 
however, that when he was firft out of his time, he 
certainly was poor. The ambition of indigence is 
ever produdtive of diftrcfs. So it fared with Ho^ 
garthy who, while he was furnifhing himfclf with 
materials for fubfequcnt perfcdlion, felt all the con- 
tem-»t which penury could produce. Being one day 
diftrcircd to raife fo trifliPig a fum as twenty (hillings, 
in order to be revenged of his landlady, who ftrove 
to compel him to payment, he drew her as ugly as 
pofliblc, and in that fingle portrait gave marks o^ 
the dawn of fupcrior genius *• This ftory I had

&apos;^ thoufand .pounds in his pocket/&apos; Let me add, 
that my firft authority may be to the full as good 
as my fecond. 

How long he continued in obfcurity we cannot 
exa&amp;ly learn ; but the firA piece in which he diflin* 
guiflied himfelf as a painter, is fuppofed to have been 
a reprefentation of Wanftead Ajfembly *. In this arc

was not however lucky in all his refemblances, and 
has fometimes failed where a crowd of other artifls 
have fucceeded. The whole-length of Mr. Gar rid 
fitting at a table, with his wife behind him taking 
the pen out of his hand *, confers no honour on the 
painter or the perfons reprefcnted &quot;f-. He has cer- 
tainly mifled the charadter of our late Rofcius^s coun-

lucky in feizing his features when aggravated by 
terror, as in the tent fcenc of King hicbard III. It 
is by no means aftoniftiing, that the elegant fymmetry

tt was likewife Mr. Hogarth&apos;s quftom to iketcd dAt 
the fpot any remarkable face which particularly 
Uruck him, and of which he wilhed to preferve the 
remembrance. A gentleman ilill living informs toe, 
tlxat being once with our painter a,t the Bedford 
Oqffee-boufey he obiierved him to draw fomeihiqg^ 
^^ith a pencil on his naiU Enquiring what had bccit 
hi3 employment^ he was fliewn the countenance (a 
whimfical one) of a perfon who was then at a (imall 
^iftance. 

It happened in the early part of HogattVs life^ 
that a nobleifiah, who was uncommonly ugly and 
^efarmed^ came to fit to him for his. pi&amp;ure. It was 
Executed with a ikill that did honour to the artift&apos;s 
abilities ; but the likenefs was rigidly obferved, with^ 
Cut even the neceffary attention to compHm.ent oif 
flattery. The peer&gt;difgufled at this counterpart o£ 
his dear felf, never once thought of payiiig for a re&apos;^ 
fleAor that would only infult him with his deformities.* 
Some time was fuffered to elapfe before the artift ap* 
plied fot his money j but afterwards many applica^ 
tions were made by him^ (who had then no need of ^ 
banker) for payment, without fuccefs. The painter^ 
however, at laft hit upon an expedient, which hef 
knew mull alarm the nobleman&apos;s pride, and by that 
means anfwer his purpofe. It was couched in the 
following card : 

•* Mr. Hogarth&apos;s dutiful refpefls to Lor^ ti&gt;m ;. 
^ finding that he does not mean to have the pifture 
•• whiahi was drawn for him/ is informed again of 






&apos;* Mr. Ks netfeffity for the money j if, thcfcfortf, 
** his lordfliip docs not fend for it in three days, it 
wjll be difpofed of, ^ with the addition of a tail, 
and fome &apos;other little appendages, to Mr. HarCy 
*^ the famous wild-beaft man ; Mr. H. having given 
*&apos; that gentleman a conditional promife of it for an 
** exhibition -pidure, on his lordfliip&apos;s refufal.** 

This intimation had the defired effedt. The pic- 
ture was fent home, and committed to the flames. 

To the other anecdotes of this comic Painter may 
be added the following. Its authenticity mull apo- 
logize for its want of other merit 

A certain old Nobleman, not remarkably gene- 
rous, having fent for Ho^rarth, defired he would re- 
prefent, in one of the compartments on a ftaircafe, 
Pharaoh and his Hoft drowned in the Red Sea ; but 
at the fame time gave our artift to underftand, that 
no great price would be given for his performance. 
Ho^irth agreed. Soon after, he waited on his cm- 
plover for payment, who feeing that the fpace al- 
lotted for the pidure had only been daubed over 
with red, declared he had no idea of paying a pain- 
ter when he had proceeded no further than to lay 
his ground. *&apos; Grcun ! faid Hogarth, there is no 
grouyid in the cafe, my lord. The red you perceive, 
is the Red Sea, Pharaoh and his Hoft are drowned 
as you defir d, and cannot be made objedts of Cght, 
for the ocean cowts then all.*&apos; 

Mr. Walpole has remarked, that if our artift &quot; in- 
*^ dulr;fd his fpirit of ridicule in ] crlonalities, it 
** never procLeded beyond fketches and drawing^,** 

and 



and wonders ^&apos; that he never, witjKyti ^ ^fi^^ If ^ 

&quot; livcrcd the very features of anyftakntical perfon.^nL !| 
But this elegant writer, who may|h|fij^^^y Kavp re. 
ccived hisT education in a Courts 
opportunities of acquaintance among the low popular 
cbaraderi with which Hogarth occafionally peopled 
bis fccncs ♦. The Friend to whom I owe this re- 
mark was afTured by an ancient gentleman of unqueC* 
tionable veracity and acutenefs of obfervation, that al- 
moft all the perfonages who attend the levee of the 
Rake were undoubted portraits ; and that, in South- 
vjork Fair and the Madem Midnight Converfatiorty as 
many more were difcovcrable. In the former plate 
he pointed out EJfex the dancing*maker ; and in the 
latter, as well as in the fecond plate to the Rak^s 
Fiopefsy Figg the prize-fighter -f. He mentioned 
fcYcral others by name, from his immediate know- 
ledge both of the painter&apos;s defign and the charafters 
rcprcfcnted j but the reft of the particulars, by which 
hefupported his affertions, have efcaped the memory 
of my informant, I am alfo affured, that while Ho^ 
garth was painting the Rakers Progrefsj he had a 
fummcr refidence at IJleworth ; and never failed to 
queftion the company who came to fee thefe pic- 
^rcs, if they knew for whom one or another figure 

* I have heard that he continually took iketches from na- 
ture as he met with them, and put them into his works -, and 
&apos;^ is natural to fuppofe he did fo.

Mr« fVdlpoIe has a iketch in oil, given to him by 
Hogartbj who intended to engrave it. It was done 
at the time when the Houfe of Commons appointed 
a committee to inquire into the cruelties exercifed on 
prifoners in the The Fleeiy to extort money from them. 
•* The fcene,** he fays, ** is the committee ; on the 
&quot; table are the infti umcnts of torture. A prifoner 
** in rags, half-ftarved, appears before them; the 
&apos;&apos; poor man has a good countenance, that adds to 
** the interefl. On the other hand is the inhuman 
*&apos; gaoler. It is the very figure that Sahator Roja 
*&apos; would have drawn for hgo in the moment of de- 
&quot; tedtion. Villainy, fear, and confcience, are mixed 
*&apos; in yellow and livid on his countenance ; his lips 
&quot; are contracted by tremor, his face advances as 
eager to lie» his legs ftep back as thinking to 
make his cfcape ; one hand is thruft precipitately 
•* into his bofom, the fingers of the other arc catch- 
*&apos; ing uncertainly at his button-holes. If this was a 
&apos;* portrait, it is the moil ftriking thit ever was

The Defendant is an upholAcrer and tapeflry-worker, and

In J 730, Mr. Hifgartb married the only daughter 

of 

was recommended to Plaintiff as a perfon (kilful in painting 
patterns for that pufpofe ; the Plaintiff accordingly cume to 
Defendant, who informing him that he had occnlion ror a ta&lt;* 
pcftry defign of the Element of Earth, to be pointed on can- 
vas. Plaintiff told Defendant he was well ikiHcd in painnng 
that way, and promifed to perform it in a workmanlike man- 
ner ; which if he did. Defendant undertook to pay iiim for it 
twenty guineas. 

Defendant, foon after, hearing that Plaintiff was an engraver^ 
and no painter, was very unegfy about the work, and ordered 
his fervant to go and ncqnairu Plaintiff what he h. d heard ; 
and Plainti^ then told the laid fervant, * tl.ut it was a bold 

♦ undertaking, for that he never old iiay thing of that kuid 

* before \ and that, if his mailer did not like it, he ILould n ^t 

• pay for it/ 

Thar ieveral times fending after Plaintiff to brin&lt;j the f .me 
to Defendant&apos;s houlc, he did not chink tit f&lt;« co do ; but c if- 
ried the fame to a private place where T*vteridant keeps Ibiuc 
j&gt;eople at work, and there left it. A^ j-ot \s Defendant was 
informed of it, ht fent for it homt;, and confuked with his 
workmen whether the defign was fo painted as they could 
work tapcdry by it, and they were all unauunous that it waf 
not finidied in a workmanlike manner, and that it was impo£&gt;fible for them to work tapellry by it. 

Upon thk, Defendant lent the paiatingback to Plaintiff bjr 
ills fervant, whojicqur^intcd him, ^ that the lame did not aufvi^

Defendant employs fome of the fined hands in Europe la 
working tapelhy, who are mod of them foreigners, and have 
worked abroad as well as here, and are perfect judge* of per- 
formances of this kind. 

The Plaintiff undertook to 6ni(h faid piece in a month, but 
it was near three months before he fent to the Defendant to 
view it ; who, when he faw it, told him that he could nut uiake 
any ufc of it, and was fo dif»ppointed for want of it, ih^r he

This unioDi indeed^ was a flolen one, and cohfe- 
quently without the approbation of Sir James^ who, 
confidering the youth of his daughter, then barely 
dghteea, and the ilender finances of her hufband, 
as yet an obfcure artift *, was not eafily reconciled to 
the match. Soon after this period, however, he be- 
gan his Harlot^s Progrefs (the coffin in the laft plate 
is infcribed 5f//^wiA^r 2, 1731)5 arid- was advifed by 
Lady TbomhiU to have fome of the fcenes in it placed 
i&gt;the way of his father-in-law. Accordingly, one 
Morning early, Mrs, Hogarth undertook to convey 
^eral of them into his dining-roonu When he 
*^ofe, he enquired from whence they came ; and 
^itxg told by whom they wdre introduced, he cried 
out^ a Very well ; the man who can furnifli repre- 
^ntations like thefe, can alfo maintain a wifd 
Without a portion.&quot; He defigned this remark as 
^ excufe for keeping his purfe-ftrings clofe ; but, 
*^On after, became both reconciled and generous to 
^•^^ young couple. 

Our artift&apos;s reputation was fo far eftablilhed iii 
1731, that it drew forth a poetical compliment from 
Mr. Mtchelly in the epiftle already quoted^ 

An allegorical cieling by Sir James Tbornhsll is at 
the houfc of the late Mr. Huggins^ at Headley Parkf 
Hants. The fubjeft of it is the ftory of Zephyrus 
and Flora ; and the figure of a Satyr and fome others 
were painted by Hogarth.

In 1732 (the year in which he was one of the 
party wiio made A Tour by land and Water ^ which 
will be duly noticed in the Catalogue) he ventured 
to attack Mr. fopCj in a plate called *&apos; The Man 
*^ of Tafte ;** containing a view of the Gate of £«r- 
lhigt:7i&apos;houje ; with Vope whitewalhing it, and bc- 
fpattcring the Duke of Cbandos^s coach *. This plate 
was intended as a fatire on the translator of Horner^ 
Mr. Kent the arcbitedt, and the Earl of Burlington. 

♦ ^&apos;^ Pope piibliflicd in 173 1 a poem cMt^ Falfe Tafte ^ in 
•• which he very particularly and fcvcrcly criticifes the houfe, 
•* the furniture, the g.irdcns, and the entertainments of Timon^ 
&apos;^ a man of great wealth and little tade. By 7imon he was 
** univerfally liippofed, and by the £arl of Burlington^ to 
&apos;* whom the poem is addrefled, was privately faid to mean 
*^ the Duke of Ciandos ; a man perhaps too much delighted 
*&apos; with pomp and Ihew, but of a temper kind and beneficent, 
** and who had confequently the voice of the publlck in hit 
** favour. A violent outcry was therefore raifed againfl the 
** ingratitude and treachery of Pope^ who was faid to hive 
** Leeri indebted to the patronage of Chandos for a prefent of 
&apos;^ a thousand pounds, and who gained the opportunity of 
** infulting him by the kindnefs of his invitation. The receipt 
&apos;^ of the thoul&apos;and pounds P^/r publick^y denied; but from tho&gt;^* reproach which the attack on a character fo amiable brought 
*• upon him, he tried all meant of cfcaping. The nanic&lt;&gt;f 
** Cltla&gt;id\sz% employed in an apology, by vihich no man was 
** fatiiHed \ and he was at Ull reduced to (lieltcr his ttmuiity 
*^ behind diiUmulation, and endeavour to make that dlfbtlicvcd 
** which he never had confidence openly to deny. He wrote 
•• an exculpatory letter to the Duke, which was anfwered 
** with great magnanimity, as by a man who accepted his 
*&apos; excufe without believing his proklTions. He laid, that to 
•* have ridiculed his tafle, or his buildings, had been an indif-

It was fortunate for Hogarth that he efcaped the laih 

of the former. Either Hogartb^s obfcurity at that 

time was his protedtion, or the bard was too prudent 

to cxafperate a pahiter who had already given fuch 

proof of his abilities for fatire. What muft be have

Soon after his marriage, Hogarth had fummer- 
lodgings at Soutb&apos;-Lambetb ; and being intimate with 
Mr. Ty^/, contributed to the improvement of The 
Spring Gardem at VauxbaU^ by the hint of embellilh- 
ing them with paintings, fome of which were the 
fuggeftions of his own truly comic pencil. Among 
thefe were the &quot; Four parts of the Day,&apos;* copied 
by Hayman from the defigns of our artift. The 
fcenes of &quot; Evening&quot; and &quot; Night&apos;* are ftill there ; 
and portraits of Henry VIII. and Anne BuUjn once 
adorned the old great room on the right hand of the

in his Danae [for which the Duke of Ancajlir

fo it is in &apos; the latter infinitely on the fide of the writer : for 
the Monflrons is much eafier to paint than defcribe, and the 
Ridiculous to defcribe than paint. And though perhaps this

•of his fucceifors who have indulged themfelves in the fame do* 
lorous Urain of complaint. To whatever oblivion the cele- 
brated aftors of the laft age have been refigned, the pencil of 
Hogarth^ Dancey Zoffani^ and Reynolds^ had left Mr. Garrick 
not the flighted reafon to be apprehcnfive that, in his own 
particular cafe, the art and the artift would alike be forgotten. 
Aleanwhile, let our heroes of the (lage be taught to moderate 
their anxiety for podhumous renown, by a recollection that 
their peculiar modes of excellence will, at lead, be as well 
preferved to futurity as thofe of the lords Chatham and Man/*

He^hgrfh Iiad projcdcd a Happy Marriage, hj waf fl 
of counterpart to his Marriage A la Mode. A defigo J 
for the firft of his intended fix plates he had ikctched &apos; 
out in colours ; and the following is as accurate aa&apos; 
account of it as could be furnifhcd by a gentleman 
who, long ago enjoyed only a few minutes&apos; fight of , 
fb imperfcft a curiofity. 

The time fuppofed was immediately after the re- 
torn of the parties from church. The fcenc lay in 
the ball of an antiquated country manfion. On one 
fide, the married couple were reprefcnted fitting. , 
Behind them was a group of their young friends of 
botb fexes, in the aft of breaking bride-cake over 
their heads. In front appeared the father of the 
young lady, grafping a bumper, and drinking, with 
a fcemiiig roar of exultation, to the future happinefs 
of her and her hutband. By his fide was a table 
covered with refrcftiincnts. Jollity rather than po- 
Ittenefs was the defignation of his charaifter. Under 
the fcreen of the hall, feveral ruftic muficians In 
grotefque attitudes, together with fervants, tenants,&amp;c. were arranged. Through the arch by which 
the room was entered, the eye was led along a paf- 
fcgc into the kitchen, which afforded a glimpfe of 
faccrdotai luxury. Before the dripping-pan flood a 
well-fed divine, in his gown and caflbck, with his 
watch in his hand, giving direftions to a cook, dreft , 
all in white, who was employed in balling a baunch-l 
of venifon. 

Among the faces of the principal figures, none*

l:M]t diat of tbe young ladf was completdy fioHhed. 
JEJfigartb had been often reproached for his inability 
«o impact grace and dignity to his heroines. The 
&quot;fcride was therefore meant to vindicate his pencil 
£rom fi&gt;degrading an imputation. The effort^ how* 
^vecy was unfuccefsful. The girl was certainly 
pretty ; but her features, if I may ufe the tenxij^ 
ivere uneducated. She might have attra&amp;ed notice 
as a chambermaid, but would have failed to extort 
applaufe as a woman of faihion. The parfon, and 
hb culinary aflbciate, were more laboured than any 
other parts of the pi^re. It is natural for us to 
dwell longefl; on that diviiion of a fubjed: which is 
mod congenial to our private feelings* The painter 
(at down with a refolution to delineate beauty im« 
proved by art ; but feems, as ufual, to have deviated 
into meannefs ; or could not help negle&amp;ing his ori« 
ginal purpofe, to luxuriate In fuch ideas as his iitua« 
tion in early life had fitted him to exprefs. He 
found, himfelf, in ihort, out of his element in the 
parlour, and therefore haftened, in queft of eafe and 
amufement, to the kitchen fire. ChurcbiUy with 
more force than delicacy, once obferved of him, 
that he only painted the backfide of nature. It mult 
be allowed, that fuch an artift, however excellent 
in his walk» was better qualified to reprefent the low- 
bom parent, than the royal preferver of a foundling. 
The iketch already defcribed (which I believe is 
in Mrs, Garrick^s poflTeflion) was made after the ap- 
pearance of Marriage d la Mode, and many years be« 

fore 



fijrt tifr^ffifi&apos;s dcaili. Why he did not pirfevcre iii&apos;^^H 
Ms plan, during fuch an inren&apos;al of timr, we cail^^^| 
only gucfs. It is probable that his undertaking re-^^H 
quired a longer fucccflion of images relative to do-&apos;^^| 
mcftic happtnefs, than had fallen within his notice, ^^| 
or courted his participation. Hogarth had no chiU&apos; ^^| 
drcn ; and though the nuptial union may be happ/^^B 
without them, yci fuch happinefs will have nothing j^H 
pifturefque in it; and we may obfcrve of this truljT ^^| 
natural and faithful painter, that he rarely ventured ^ 
10 exhibit fcenes with which he was not perfeftly 
well acquainted. 

Let us, however, more completely obviate an ^J 
objciSion that may be raifed agaioft the propriety of ^^| 
ihe foregoing criticifm. .Some reader may urge, that ^™ 
perhaps, all circumftances confidercd, a wedding ce- 
lebrated at an old manfion-houfc did not require the 
appearance of confummate beauty, refined by the 
powers of education. The remark has feeming juf- 
tlce on its fidei but Hogarth had previoufly avowed 
his intent to exhibit a perfect face, divefted of vnal- 
garlty ; and fuccecdcd fo well, at lead in his own 
opinion, that he carried the canvas, of which WK^^fil 
are now fpeaking, in triumph to Mr. Carrick, whovB^^V 
private ilritturcs on it coincided with thofe of the 
perfon who furnifhes this additional confirmation of 
our painter&apos;s notorious ignorance in what is ftyled— 
THi; GRACFFiTL. From the account I have receive* 
concerning a defign for a previous compartment t 
longing to the fame ftory, ihcrc is little reafon to ta- 

menc

fnent the lofs of it. It contained* no appeal either 
to the fancy or to the hearts. An artift^ who^ re- 
prefenting the marriage ceremony in a chapel^ ren- 
ders the clerk, who lays the haflbcks, the principal 
figure in it^ may at lead be taxed with want of 
judgement. 

Soon after the peace of Aix la Chapelle^ he went 
over to France f and was taken into cuftody at Calais, 
while he was drawing the gate of that town&gt;a cir- 
cumftance which he has recorded in his pidlure^ in- 
tituledj &quot; O the Roaft Beef of Old England T pub- 
lilhed Marth 26&gt;1749^ He was. adually carried 
before the governor as a fpy^ and, after a very ftriO: 
examination, committed a prifoner to Grandjire^ his 
landlord^ on bis promifing that Hogarth fliould not 
go out of his houfe till it was to embark for England. 
This account, I have good authority for faying, he 
himfelf gave to his friend Mr. Goftling at Canterbury^ 
at whofe houfe he lay the night after his arrivd. 

The fame accident, however, has been more cif- 
cumftantially related by an eminent Engiijh engraver, 
who was abroad when it happened. Hayman^ and 
Cbeere the ftatuary, were of the lame party* 

While Hegartb was in France^ wherever he went, 
he was&apos;fure to be diffatisfied with all he faw. If ah 
elegant circumftance either in furnirurci or the or^- 
namcnts of a room, was pointed out as deferving 
approbation, his narrow ^nd conftant reply wa?j 
*&apos; What then? but it is French I Their houfes

£ often

often clamouFODfly rude. A tattcr&apos;d bag, or a pair 
of filk flocking5 with holes b them, drew t tor- 
rent of imprudent language from him. In vain 
did my informant (who knew that many Scotch and 
Irijh were often within hearing of thefc reproaches,

cautious in his public remarks. He laughed at all 
fuch admonition, and treated the offerer of it as a 
pufillanimous wrc&apos;ci:, unworthy of a refidence in b 
free country, n-.iking him the butt of his ridicule 
for fevcral evenings afterwards. This unreafonablc 
pleafjnTry was at length completely extinguilhed by 
what happened while he was drawing the Gate at 
■Calati ; for though the innocence of his defign was 
rendered perfectly apparent on the tcftioiony of other 
fltctcbcs he had about him, which were by no mean* 
fuch as could ferve the purpofc of an engineer, he 
was told by the Commandant, that, had not the 
peace been a&lt;5tually jigned, he Ihould have been 
obliged to have hung him up immediately on the 
Tamparts. Two guards were then provided to con- 
vey him on Clipboard i nor did they quit him till he 
was three miles from the fliore. They then fpun him 
round tike a top, on the deck; nnd told him he »-u 
at liberty to proceed on his voyage without farther 
attendance or moleftation. With the fllghtcft allu- 
lioa to the ludicrous particulars of this affair, poor 
Hegarth was by no means plcafed. The leading cir-

ACUJwick ; where he ufiully paffed the greateft

In 17 jj5 he appeared to the world in tdie charac*

*&apos;view of fixing the fluAuating Ideas of Tafie.&apos;* 
In diis. performance he Ihe ws» by a variety of ex« 
amplesy that a curve is the line of beauty^ and that 
iDUod fwelling figures arc mod pleafing to the eye ; 
and the truth of his opinion has been countenanced 
by fubfequent writers on the fubjed:. 

Aax)Dg the letters of Dr. Bircb is the following 
iix)rtone^ fent with the &apos;* Analyfis of Beauty/&apos; and 
dated .Nfev. 25, 1 753 : &quot; Sir, I beg the favour of you 
&apos;^ to prefent to the Royal Society the enclofed work, 
&quot; which will receive great honour by their accept- 
&apos;^ ance of it. I am. Sir, your moft obedient hum*

In this book, the leading idea of which was 
hieroglyphically thrown out in a frontifpiece to his 
works in 17451 he acknowledges himfelf indebted 
to his friends for afliftance, and particularly to one 
gentleman for his corre&amp;ions and amendments of at 
lead a third part of the wording. This friend, I am 
aflured, was Dr. Benjamin Hoadly the phyfician, who 
carried on the work to about a third part, Chap. IX.

proceeded no farther than about a iheet, and they 
then parted friends, and feem to have continued fuch. 
In the Eftimate of the Manners and Principles of the 
Times, vol. I. p. 47, publilhed in 1 757 by Dr. Brown, 
that author pays a compliment to Mr. Hogarth&apos;s ge- 
nius. Mr. Ralphs animadverting on the work, 
amongft other things, fays, &apos;* It is happy for Mr. 
^* Hogartbf in my humble opinion, that he is brought 
*&apos; upon the flage in fuch company, rather for the 
*^ fake of fattening fome additional abufe upon the 
** public, than of beftowing any fpecial grace upon 
him. ^ Neither the comic pencil, nor the ferious 
pen of our ingenious countrymen (fo the Efti- 
•* mator or Appraifer&apos;s Patent of Allowance runs) 
** have been able to keep alive the tafte of Nature 
&apos;* or of Beaut)&apos;.* For where he has chofcn to be a 
niggard of his acknowledgements, every other 
man would chufe to be a prodigal : Nature had 
&quot; played the Proicus with us, had invited us to 
*&apos; purfuc her in every Ihape, but had never fuffered 
&quot; U3 to overtake her : Beauty all had been fmitten 
•&apos; with, but nobody had been able to aflign us a

The office of finifiiing the work, and fuperintend* 
ing the publication, was laftly taken up by Dr. Mo^ 
relly who went through the remainder of the book *. 
The preface was in lik? manner corredled by the 
Rcy.Mr.Townley. The. family of //(?rjr/^ rejoiced 
when the lad fhcet of the Analyfts was printed- olF; 
as the frequent difputes he had with his coadjutors, 
m the progrefs of the work, did not much harmonize 
his difpoiition. 

This work was tranflated into German by Mr^ 
Mylinsy when in England^ under the author&apos;s infpec-

author, and was obliged to employ the friends al- 
ready mentioned tp cotre^ his Analyfi$ of Beauty *y 
he did not fecm to have difcovered that even fpelling 
was a neceflary qualification ; and yet he had ven- 
tured to ridicule f the late Mr. Riches deficiency as 
to this particular, in a npte which lies before the 
Rake whofe play is refufed while he remains in con- 
finement for debt. Previous to the time of which 
we are now i[5eaking, one of our artiiPs common 
topicks of declamation was the ufcleflhei^ of book% 
to a ipan of his profefiioQ. In Deer^ftreiU among 
other vplumes configned by him tp the paftry cppk, 
we find ^urnbuU on ancient Fainting^ a treatife which 
Hogarth Ihould have been able to underftand, before 
be ventured to condemn* Garrick himfelf, however, 
was not more dudile to flattery. A word in favour 
of Sigi/munda, might have commanded a proof print, 
or forced an original fkctch out of our artift&apos;s hands. 
The furnifher of this remark owe? one of his fcarceft 
performances to the fucccfs of a compliment, which 
might have ftuck even in Sir Godfrey KnelUr^s throat. 

• The Anal^^: itfclf however alfords fufficicnt fpccimens of 
inaccuracy in fpclling. Thus we have (prcf. p. xix.) Sychmen 
ipifead of Cyclamtn ; (p. 44.) calc/donian for C/j»a!crdonian ; 
{p. 65.) nuckles for inucklcs ; (p. 97.) Irif-^-ftitch for Iris- 
fiicch,&amp;c.&amp;:c. In the (heeci that contain thefe errors , it is 
eafy to conceive that Ho^artb mud have been his owncorre&amp;or

prcfcnting a futling booth, with the Duck of Cianber-

Hogarth was alfo the moft abfcnt of men. At

he had finished eating, and as fuddcaly would return 
it. and fait to his meal again. I may add, that he 
pnce diEcficd a letter to Dr. Headiy, thus, — &quot; To

a very iilcafing (hiall pifture by Hogarth marfc its

intituled, Piiquet^ or Virtue in Danger, and (hews

age. He is reprefcnted in the aft of returning her 
a handful of bank bills, with the boj&gt;e of exchang- 
ing them for a foftcr acquifuion, and more delicate 
plunder. On the chimney-piece is a watch-cafe and 
a figure of Time over it, with this motto — NUNC 
Hogarth has caught his heroine during this moment 
of hciication, this ftruggle with herfelf, and has 
marked her feelings with uncommon fuccefs. &quot;Wa- 
vering chaftity, as in this inftance, he was qualified 
to difplay ; but the graceful referve of Iteady and 
exalted virtue he would certainly have failed to ex* 
prefs. He might have conveyed a perfeft idea of 
iuch an IpbtgetUa as is defcribcd by Mr. Hayley, in 
one of the cantoes of his. beautiful poem on the 
Triumphs efTtmfitr ; but the dignity of the fame fe- 
male at the fauric altar would hare baffled the moll

the following explanation : 

Ye fair^ ht warned, and {bun thofe arts^ 

That farithtefs men do life for hearts : 

Weigh o&apos;6r and o^er the deftinM man^ 

And oft this little lefibn fcan ; 

If he his charafter don&apos;t fear. 

For yours he*tt very little care : 

With fcorn repulfe the wretch lb bold. 

Nor pawn your virtue for his gold ! 

Of gaming (cards or not) beware^ 

Tis very 6ften found a fnare ; 

But^ left my precept tlill fliould fail. 

Indulge me — whilft I tell a tale : 
Dorinda^ chearful, young, and gay. 

Oft Ihone at Balls, at Park, and Play ^ 

Bleft with a free, engaging air, 

In IhoYt, throughout quite debonnair ; 

(Excufe me — fliall I tell the truth ?) ^ 

That band of mifled, heedlefs youth, 

Graming— had quite poflefsM her mind. 

To this (no other vice) inclinM : 

She oft would melancholy fit. 

No partner near for dear Picquet ! 

** At laft a cruel fpoiler came,&quot; 

And deeply learn&apos;d in all the game ; 

A fon of Mars^ with iron face, 

Adorn&apos;d with impudence and lace ! 

Acquaintance with her foon he gains. 

He thinks her virtue worth his pains : 

F % Cards 



^^^Wf 



Cards (after nonrenfe) amc in courfci 
By fap advances, not by force. 
The tabic fct, the cards arc laid, 
Dorinda dreams not ftie&apos;s betray&apos;d ; 
The cards run crofs, ftic fumes and frets, 
Her brilliant necklace foon flic betts&gt;She fears her watch, but can&apos;t refill, 
A mtniature can fcarce be mill I 
Jit lafl both watch and trinkets go, 
A prey to the devouring foe : 
Nay more (if fame but tells us troc). 
She loll her di&apos;mond buckles too I 
Her bracelets next became his prize. 
And in his hat the treafure lies. 
Upon her Virtue next he treats, 
And Honour&apos;s facred name repeats : 
Tenders ihc trinkets, fwears and lies. 
And vows her pcrfon is a prize I 
Then fwears (with hand upon his breafl) 
That he wiibout her can&apos;t be bled ! 
Then plies her with redoubled pains, 
T&apos; exchange her virtue for his gains : 
Shame&apos;s purple wings o&apos;erfliade her face. 
He triumphs over her difgracc ; 
Soon turns to jeft her fcruplcs nice. 
In fiiort, Ihc falls ! — a facrificcl 
Spoil&apos;d of her virtue in her prime. 
And, knoi-ving Heaven detcfts the crime, 
Is urg&apos;d, perhaps, to dare his rod, 
&apos;* And niHi unfummoo&apos;d to her God V

In the *^ Miier&apos;s Feaft/&apos; Mr. Hogarth thought 
proper to pillory Sir Ifaac Shard j a gentleman pro^ 
yerbially avaricious. Hearing this, the* fon of Sir 
Ifaac, the late Ifaac Pacatus Shard •, efq, a young 
Twn of fpirit, juft returned from his tsravels, called 
at the painter&apos;s to fee the pidure ; and, among the 
reft, aiking the Cicer$ne ^^ whether that odd figure 
^ was intended for any particular perfon^** on his 
replying, ^^ that it was thought to beyery like onfe 
** Sir Ifaac Shard ;*&apos; he immediately drew his fword&quot;, 
and daihed the canvas* Hogarth appeared inftantly 
in great wrath ; to whom Mr. Shard calmly juftified 
what he had done, faying, ^&apos; that&apos; this was a verjr 
^ \2nwarrantable licence ; that he was the injured 
^^ party&apos;s fon, and that he was ready to defend any

tilted. 

About 1757, his brother-in-law, Mr. Thomhill, 
refigned the place of king&apos;s ferjeant-painter in favour 
of Mr» Hogarth ; who foon after made an experi- 
ment in painting, which involved him in fome dif- 
grace. The celebrated collcftion of pidhires be* 

longing to Sir Luke Schaub was in 1758 fold by pub-

efteemed. He had ibme good piflures, and a very fine li-

&apos;* fuaded himfclf that the praifcs btftowcd on thofe

^ at laft produced his Si^fimmda^^hvLt no more like

** prefentation of a maudlin (trumpet juft turned out

^ ufquebaughy tearing off the ornaments her keeper

haodf i« employed in rending oi:nament8 from her head, or 
any other part of her perfon. In this inftance Mr. H^alpoU*s 
foemory mull have failed him, as I am con6dent that his roif* 
reprefentation was nndefigned. It is whifpered (we know not 
with how much truth) that Mrs. H. was hurt by this defcrip- 
tioo of the picture, and that ihe returned no thanks for the 
volume that contains it, when it was fent to her as a prefeiit 
by its author. It ihould feem that (he dill deligns to difpofc 
of this ill-fated performance, and thinks that its reputation 
required no additional biaft. 

1 hare reprinted this note, without corre&amp;ion^ that I might 
diereby obtain the fairer opportunity of doing juilice to Mr. 
JFalpoIe^ concerning the faithfulnefs of whofe memory I had

ways to be had ; nor (hall I hefitate a moment to apologize

The concluding obfervation of Mr. Wdlpok is mor-

account given of this fquabble, which long engrdTed 
the attention of the town, with the narrative of it 
printed by Mr. WiUies ; who dates the circumftances 
of it in the following manner : 

*• Mr. Hogarth was one of the firft&apos; who, in the 
*^ paper war begun by lord Bute on his acceffion to 
*^ the Treafury, facrificed private friendlhip at the 
^ altar of party madnefs. In 1762, the Scotch mi-

droll ^^ Epiflle from Jacob Henriques^ born lanho Domini,&amp;c.

t For this the Satariil unmercifully apologizes in the c^- 
clulion of his poem, which may be fcen in the Catalogue^

** has never failed to make himfelf perfectly ridiculous. I 
*&apos; need only make my appeal to any one of his hifttrical or

^* phael^ Fandyke^ and others, were made to yield the palm of 
** beauty, grace, expreilion,&amp;c. to Jiim, for this long la- 
** lK)ured, yet flill, uninterefting^ fingle figure. The value be 
&apos;** himfelf fet on this, as well as on fome other of his ^orks, 
** almoft exceeds belief; yet from poUceacfs or fear, or fome

^* fums, as the price, not of his merit, but of his unbounded 
&apos;• vanity. 

** The darling paiHon of Mr. Hogarth is to (liew the faulty 
*• and dark fide of every object. He never gives us in perfec- 
** tion the fair fact of nature^ but admirably well holds out 
** her deformities to ridicule. The reafon is plain. All ob« 
** jeds are painted on his retina in a grotefque manner, and 
&apos;* he has never felt the force of what the French call is helU 
** tiotwri. He never caught a fingle idea of beauty, grace, or 
** elegance ; but, on the other hand, he never milled the leaft 
** flaw in almoft any produ^ion of nature or of art. This is

^^ It is perhaps worth remarking, that the painter 
&apos;* propofed to give a feries of political prints, and 

*« that 

** hli true charader. He has fucceeded veiy happily in the 
** way of humour, and has mifcarried in every other attempt, 
*&apos; This has arifcn in fome meafure from his bead, but much 
&apos;* more from his heart. After Marriage a la MoJe^ the public

** made the attempt, but the rancour and malevolence of his 
** mind made him very foon turn with envy and difguft from 
** objeds of fo pleafing contemplation, to dwell and feaft a 
** bad heart on others of a hateful caft, which he purfued, 
^ for he found them congenial, with the moll unabating zeal, 
** and unrelenting gall. 

** I have obferved fonae time his fiulngjwn. He has long 

** been very dim^ and atmofi ^rm if his beams, &apos; He feems To 

** confcious of this, that he now glimmen with horrovued light m 

** Jebn BuU*s hottfe in flames has been hackneyM in fifty diffc- 

*^ rent prints ; and if there is any merit in the figure on (lilts, 

** and the mob prancing around, it is not to be aCcribed to 

** Hogartby but to Callot. That fpirited ItaUan^ whom the 

&apos;* Engiyb painter has io carefully ftudied, has given us in the 

&apos;* Balli diSfeJfania di Jacomo Callot^ the very fame ideas, but 

&apos;^ infinitely more ludicrous in the execution. The piece it

In the form of a framed picture on the painter^s

allude to a former fpcech of his, wherein he faid 
that he would rather fubfift a week on a Che/hire 
chccfc and a iboulder of mutton, than fubmit to the 
implacable enemies of his country. 

But to ridicule this charadtcr fiill more, he is, as 
he lies down, firing a piece of ordnance at the ftan- 
dard of Britain, on which is a dove with an olive- 
branch, the emblem of peace. On one fide of the 
pyramid is the City of London, reprefented by the 
figure of one of thQ Guildball giants, going to crown 
the reclining hero. On the other fide is the king of 
Fruffia^ in the charader of one of the Ca/ars^ but 
fmoking his pipe. In the center fiands Hogarth 
himfelf, whipping a Dancing Bear (Churchill) which 
he holds in a firing. At the fide of the Bear is a 
Monkey, defigned for Mr. Wilkes. Between the legs 
of the little animal is a mop-fiick, on which he 
feems to ride, as children do on a hobby-horfe : at 
the top of the mop-ftick is the cap of liberty. The 
Monkey is undergoing the fame difcipline as the 
Bear. Behind the Monkey is the figure of a man,

At the time thefe hoftilities were carrying on in a 
manner fo virulent and difgraceful to all the parties, 
Hogarth was vifibly declining in his health. In 
1762, he complained of an inward pain, which, 
continuing, brought on a general decay that proved 
incurable *• This laft year of his life he employed 
in retouching his plates with the aflliftance of feveral 
engravers whom he took with him to Chifwick. On 
the 25th of OSober, 1764, he was conveyed from

Bteti^tlAt Utmbft of his focial ambition ; but even in 
thcfe allehiblies he was oftener fent to Coventry for mif- 
behaviour; than any other perfon who frequented 
them. To fome confidence in himfelf he was cer- 
tainly entitled ; for, as a comic painter, he could have 
claimed no honour that would not moft readily have 
been allowed him ^ ; but he was at once unprinci^ 
pled and variable in his political conduct and attach- 
ments. He is alfo faid to have beheld the rifing 
eminence and popularity of Sir Jojhua Reynolds with 
a degree of envy ; and, if I am not mifinformed, 
frequently fpoke with afperity both of him and his 
performances. Juftice, however, obliges me toadd^ 
that our artift was liberal, hofpitable, and the mod 
pundhialof pay-maftcrs; fothat, in fpite of the emo- 
luments his works had procured to him, he left but an

he kindly took her home, and generoufly fupported 
her, making her, at the fame time, ufefql in the 
difpofal of his prints. Want of tendernefs and !!• 
berality to his relatiofis was not among the failings 
of Hogartb. 

Of HogartFs drawings and contributions towards 
the works of others, perhaps a number, on enquiry, 
might be found. An acquaintance of his, the late 
worthy Mr. John Sanderfony architcA, who repaired 
tFoburn Abbey ^ as well as Bedford Houfe in Bloomjburf&apos; 
fquare, pofleffed feveral of his curioiicies. One 
was a fketch in black-lead of a celebrated young en- 
graver (long fiuce dead) in a (alivation. The bed 
that can be faid of it is, that it was mod difguflingly 
natural Even the coarfe ornaments on the corners 
of the blankets which enwrapped him, were charac- 
teriflically expreffed. Our artiil feems to have re- 
peated the fame idea, though with lefs force, and 
fewer adjun&amp;s, in the third of his Elcdlion prints, 
where a figure fwaddled up in flannel is conveyed to 
the huftings. Two other works, viz. a drawing in 
Itidian ink, and a painting in oil colours, exhibited 
Bedford Houfe in different points of view ; the figures 
only by Hogartb. Another rcprefented the corner of 
a ftrcct, with a man drinking under the fpout of a 
pump, and heartily angry with the water, which, 
by iffuing out too iaft, and in too great quantities,

&quot; had ddugcd his face. Our great pabter had obliged 
Mr. Sanderfon with feveral other comic iketches,&amp;c» 
but moft of them had been either begged or flolen^ 
before the communicator of thefe particulars became 
acquainted with him. 
In the year 1 745, one Launcelot Burton was ap- 

&apos; pointed naval officer ztDeal. Hogarth had feen him 
by accident ; and on a piece of paper, previouily 
imprefled by a plain copper-plate, drew his figure 
with a pen, in imitation of a coarfe etching. He was 
repxefented on a lean Canterbury hack, with a bottle 
(ticking out of his pocket ; and underneath was an 
infcription, v intimating that he was going down to 
take poileffion of his place. This was inclofed to ^ 
him in a letter ; and fomeof his friends, who were, in 

■ 

the fecret, protefted the drawing to be a print which 
they had feen expofed to fale at the ihops in London ; 
a circumftance that put him in a violent pafHon, du* 
ring which he wrdte an abufive letter to Hogarth^ 
whofe name was fubfcribed to the work. But, after 
poor BurtorCs tormentors had kept him in fufpcnce 
throughout an uneafy three weeks, they proved to / 
him that it was no engraving, but a fketch with, a 
pen and ink. He then became fo perfeftly recon^ 
oiled to his refemblance, that he fhewed it with ex- 
ultation to Admiral Vernon^ and all the reft of his 
friends. 

In 1753, Hogarth returning with Dr. Morell from 

&apos; a vifit to Mr. Rich at Cowley^ flopped his chariot, and ^

made a fketch of it wiih triumph ; it was a St, 
Cco&apos;it &quot;fid trjt Utagon, ail in ftrait lines. 

H&apos;-gartb iv.ade one eflay in fculpturt. He wanted 
a (ign to diHinguifti his houfe in IjheJier-fieUU ; and 
thinking none more proper than the Golden llind, 
he, out of a mafs of cork made up of fevcral thick- 
peiks compafted togctlKr, carved a bufl of Vandyck, 
which hr g^U and placed over his door. It is long 
fince dec:i.)cd, and was fucceedcd by a head in 
plafler, Mhich has alto petifticd ; and is fupplied 
by a head of Sir tpac l^ewton. Hr^arlb modelled 
another rcfemblance of Vandjck in clay ; which is 
likew&apos;fe dt-ftroycd. 

It is very properly obfcrved by Mr. WalpoU, that 
&quot; If ever an author wanted a commentary, that none&lt;* of bis beauties ir.ight be lofi, It is Hogarth \ not&lt;* from being obfcure (for he never was that but in 
*• two or three of his firll prints, where iranfient na- 
*&apos; tional fullies, as Lotteries, Iree-mafonry, and the 
&quot; Satitb Sea, were his topics) but for the ufe of fo-

a fuperficial one, of many of his prints, which, 
it was faid, he had drawn up for the ufe of Mar- 
shal BellciJIe, then a prifoner in England*^ 
However great the deficiencies in this work may 
be, it was certainly fuggefted by Hogarth^ and 
drawn up at his immediate requeft. I receive this 
information from undoubted authority. Some ef 
the circumftances explanatory of the plates, b^ com-^ 
municatcd ; the reft he left to be fupplied by Rouquet 
his near neighbour, who lived in the houfe at which 
Gardelle the cnameiler afterwards lodged^ and mur- 
dered his landlady Mrs. King. Rouquet^ who (as I 
learn from Mr. Walpole) was a Swifs of French ex- 
tradion, had formerly publifhed a fmall traft on the 
ftate of the Arts in England, and another, intituled 
** L&apos;Artdepeintureen fromageouen ramequin, 1755;&apos;* 
1 2 mo. (V. &quot; La France litteraire, ou Diftionaire des 
&quot; Autcurs Franfois vivans, par itf. Formey^ 1 757 .*&apos;) On 
the prefent occafian he was liberally paid by Hogarth, 
for having cloathed his fentiments and illuftrations in 
a foreign drefs. This pamphlet was dcfigned, and 
continues to be employed, as a conftant companion to 
all fuch fets of his prints as go abroad. Only the le^ 
ter defcriptive of the March to Finchley was particu- 
larly meant for the inftrudlion of Marfhal BelUiJU *.

It was added after the three former epiflles had been 
printed off, and before the plate was publUhed. The 
entire performance, however, in my opinion, exhi- 
bits very (Irong marks of the vivacious compiler&apos;s 
tafte, country, and prejudices. Indeed many paf- 
fagcs mud have been inferted without the privity of 
his employer, who had no fkill in the French lan- 
guage. That our clergy always affe^ to ride on white 
horfeSy and other remarks of a fimilar turn,&amp;c.&amp;c« 
could never have fallen from the pen of Hogarth, or

This epiftle bears alfo internal evidence to the

fufficiently vifible in the following paiTage ?

** ever, it oiiifl be owned, was fuited only to low, or famiiiir 
** fubjeSl. It never foared above common life : to fubjefis 
** naturally fublime, or which from antiquity, or other acci*

*&apos; tion we fee little in him to admire. In many of his prints, 
** the deficiency is fo great, as plainly to imply a want of all 

•^^ principle; which makes us ready to believe, that when we 
&apos;^ do meet with a beautiful group, it is the effeft of chance. 
&apos;* In one of hit minor works, the Idle Prentice, we feldom 

^^ fee a crowd more beautifully managed, than in the laft 
** print. If the (heriff*s officers had not been placed in a line, 
^* and bad been brought a little lower in the pifture, fo at to 
** have formed a pyramid with the cart, the compofition had 
** been unexceptionable : and yet the firil print of this work 
** is fo flriking an inftance of difagreeable compofition, that 

. ** it is amazing, how an artift, who had any idea of beailti- 
** ful forms, couldfuffer ib unroafterly a perf[&gt;rmance to leave 
*\ his hands. Of the diftribation of light Mttgmrth had as 
*^ little knowledge as of compofition. In fome of his piedes 
** we fee a good effect ; as in the execution juft mentiooed ; 
** in which, if the figures at the right and left comers had 
^^ been kept down a little, the light would have been beaufi* 
*&apos; fully diAributed on the fore*ground, and a little fine le« 
*&apos; condary light fpread over part of the crowd&apos;: but at the 
*^ fame time there is fo obvious a deficiency in point of eiTecl, 
*^ in moft of his prints, that it is vecy evident he had no prin* 
** ciples. Neither was Hogmrtb a aiafter in drawing. Of the 
^* roufcles and anatomy of the head and handli he had perfe£t 
** knowledge ; but his trunks are often badly moulded, and 
*^ bb limbs ill fet on. I tax him with plain bad drawing ; I 
*^ fpeak not of the niceties of anatomy, and elegance of out* 
&apos;* line t of thefe indeed he knew nothing $ nor were they of&lt;* ufe in that nnode of defign which he cultivated x and yet his

pendu(to it ifi 1780, have given the whole of Mr. 

Hogartb^s 

** of its tnclination to (Sod fault. The ancborof the Analyfii 

** of Beauty, it might be fuppofed, would have ghren ui more 

** inikaoces of grace, than we find id the works of i/i^«r/i$ ; 

** which fliev;s drongly that theory and prafiice are not always 

** united. JMany op|)ortUDitics his fuhjc^s naturally afford of 

** introducing graceful attitudes ; and yet we have very few 

*^ examples of rhem. With toftaiices of pidurefque grace 

^* his works abound. Of hit expreffion, in which the force 

*^ of his genius lay, we cannot fpeak in terms too high. In 

«* e\iery mode of it he was truly excellent. The paflions he 

** thoroughly underftood, and all the effects which they pro- 

** duce in every part of the human frame : he had the happy 

&apos;* art alfo of conveying his ideas with the fame precifion with 

** which he conceived them. — He was excellent too in cx- 

** preffing any humormis oddity, which we often fee ftamped 

** upon the human face. All his heads are caft in the very 

*« mould of nature. &apos; Hence that endlefs variety, which is dif- 

^ played through his works : and hence it is, that the differ- 

** cncc arifei between his heads, and the affe£led caricaturas 

&apos;&lt;of rhoie matters, who have fometimes amufed therofelves 

.** with patcl|ing together an alTemblage of features from their 

^^ own ideas. Such are Sfagniokt^s ; which, though admirably 

** executed, appear plainly to have no archetypes in nature. 

«* H0gsrih\ on the other hand, are collections of natural cu- 

*&apos; riqlilies. The 0.v/Iyr4/-heads, the phyficians*arms, and fome 

** of his other pieces, arc exprefsly of this humorous kind. 

** They are truly comic ; though ill-natured effufions of 

** .mirth : more entertaining than SjnignioUt* t^ as ihey are pure 

*» nature; but Icfs innocent, as they contain ilUdire^ed ridi-

f^ every profclTion coatrad ; and which, for that reafon, be*

At Lord Effx&apos;i fale, in January 1777, Mr. Garrick&lt;bought a picture by Hogarth, being the examination . 
of the recruits before the jufticcs ShaU&lt;nv and Silenct* 
For this, il was faid in the news-papers, he gave 350 j 
guineas. 1 have Unce been told, that remove the |

remains. In private he allowed that he never gave 
the former of thcfe Turns, though in the public ; 
prints he did not think fuch a confefljon neceSary* j 
It was in reality an indiifcrent performance, as tfaolis j

[ m6 ] 

twenty^five years ago at Hackney^ for a mere trifle^ 
together with the plates to the prefent work. The 
latter, in all probability, are defiroyed* This book 
was originally publifhed in Englijb at Lond^n^ il%il 
afterwards in French at Thi Haguif in ijzy ; and 
again in Englijh * at London^ revifed by the. author; 
with the addition of two new cuts, in 1730. In the 
French edition, Plate V. Tom. I. is engraved by 
R. Smithy inftead of Hogarth, fo that this interme* 
diate copy contains only fourteen plates by him. Ic 
is probable alfo, that fome other anonymous ones, in 
all the editions, were by the fame engraver. His 
reputation, indeed, will fave more than it iofes by the 
want of his fignature to ellabliih their authenticity. 

2. Five Mufcovites. This (biall print appears at 
the corner of one of the maps to the fecond volume 
of the foregoing work. It has no intelligible refer- 
ence ; but, in the Englijh copy now before me, is 
the lad plate but one, and is marked C — T. 11. In 
a former edition of the prefent catalogue, it was 
enumerated as a feparate article, but muft now be 
reckoned as one of the fifteen plates to Motraye&apos;s 
Travels. 

To thefe I might add three plates more. If Ho^ 
garth engraved the Mufcovitei at the corner of the map 
already mentioned, he likewife furniihed the figures 
in the corner of another, marked T. L— B. And 

* This, (ln6\ly fpeaking, was not a re- publication ; it is the 
identical edition of 1723, with the addition of m Preface and 
.an Appendix. New title-pages were again printed to it, and 
a thii&apos;d volume added, in 173^*

difpofed of them at the price of the copper. As 
our artift could have difplayed no marks of genius

ed alfo in p. 1 34. were dcfigned for a continuation of 
the fame work, which was never printed, as I guefs 
from the coiiclufion of the Author&apos;s preface. &quot; This 
&quot; regularly divided my book into two parts; one 
** treating of the Roman, the other of the Modern Mi- 
&quot; litary Pmifimients. The firft I now fend into the 
&quot; world, as a man going into the water dips his foot 
*&apos; to feel what reception he is like to meet with \ by 
** that rule refolving, either to pubUfli the fecond

may be jullifiecl by the following quotation from a 

Pamphlet, intituled, Rejlcdions upon Theatrical Ex^ 

prcjfion in Tragedy^ i^c. printed for W. Johnjon,&amp;c.

1755* &apos;&apos; I ihaU therefore, io my further remarks 
^* upon this article, go back to the Old Italian 
&apos;* Theatric when Farineili drew every body to the 
&apos;^ Uaymarket. What a pipe ! what modulation ! 
*^ what extafy to the ear ! But, heavens ! what 
^&apos; clumfineis ! what ftupidity I what offence to the 
^^ eye ! {leader, if of the city, thou may eft probably 
^&apos; have feen m the fields of Iflingion or MiU-^nd, of

&apos;^ muft have obferved in the park, with what ealie 
** and agility a G)w, heavy with Calf, has rofe up 
f* at the conunand of the Milk*woman&apos;s foot. Thus 
** frpm the mofly bank fprung up the Divine Fari^ 
^^ nelU. Then with long ftrides advancing a few 
^ paces, his left hand fettled upon his hip, in a beau* 
f&apos; tiful bend like that of the handle of an old-faihioA- 
&apos;^ ed caudle-cup, his right remained immoveable 
^^ acrofs his manly breaft, till numbnefs called its 
*• partner to fupply its place ; when it relieved itfelf 
^* in the pofition of the other handle to the caudle*

Under a copy of the print abovementioned, which 
muft have been made foon after its publication, appear

^&apos; one pair of llairs at the fign of the celebrated 
&apos;* Anodyne Necklace recommended by Doctor Cham&quot; 
^&apos; berlen for Children&apos;s teeth,&amp;c.&quot; 

The original drawing from which the plate pro- 
mifed in Miji^s Journal was taken, remained in the 
poffeflion of Mr. James Virtue, and was probably de- 
figned by his brother George. It was fold in 17S1 
in the coUeftion of George Scott, Efcj. of Cbij^zvell in 
Effex^ together with eight tracts relative to the fame 
impofture, for three guineas, and is now in the col- 
ledtion of Mr. Gougb. 

St. Andre&apos;s Mifcarriage^ a ballad, published ia 
1727, has the following ftanza on this fubjcdt : 

&apos;^ He difledtcd, compar&apos;d, and dilVinguilh&apos;d likewifc

&quot; He preferv&apos;d them in fpirits, and — a little too late

There is alfo a copper-plutc, confiding of twelve 
compartments, on the fame (lory. It exhibits every 
ilagc throughout this celebrated fruid. St. Andre 
aj)pears in the habit of a Merry- Andrew. The gene-

In A///?&apos;/ Journal for Saturday^ Dec. 17, 1726, is 
alfo the following paragraph, which Ihews that the 
playhoufe joined in the general ridicule of S/. Andre. 
** Laft week the entertainment called 7be Necro^ 
^^ mancer was performed at the Theatre in Uncoln^s* 
&apos;* If:n Fields y wherein a new Rabbit -fcenc was intro* 
&apos;^ diiced by way of cpifode ; by which the Public 
** may underfland as much of that affair, as by the 
&apos;* prefent controverfy among the Gentlemen of the 
&quot; faculty, who are flinging their bitter pills at one 
^* another, to convince the world that none of them 
*^ undcrftand any thing of the matter/&apos; I am told 
by one of the fpcdtators ftill alive, that in this new 
fcene, Harlequin^ being converted into a woman, 
pretended to be in labour, and was firft delivered of 
a large pig, then of a footcrkin,&amp;c.&amp;c. 

From the fame paper of Saturday, Jan. 21, 1727, 
we learn, that ** The pretended Rabbit-breeder, in 
&quot; order to perpetuate her fame, has had her pifture 
** done in a curious mezzotinto print by an able 
^^ hand.&quot; It was painted by Lap^uerre^ and fcraped 
by Faber. She has a rabbit on her lap, and difplays 
a countenance expreffive of the utmoft vulgarity. 
In Hogartb^s comic rcprcfcntarion, the remarkable 
turn-up of tho nofe is prefcrved. This, perhaps, 
was the only feature in her face that could not be 
altered by the convulfions of her pretended agony,

or our aftift would have given her refeinblance with 
greater exa&amp;ncfs. 

Mr. Dtliingbam^ an apothecary^ in Red-IJon-Square^ 
laid a wager of ten guineas with St. Andii^ that in a 
limited time the cheat would be detcfted. The 
money was paid him, and he expended it on a piece 
of plate, with three rabbits engraved by way of 
arms. 

I learn from 7be Weekly Mifcellany^ for April 19, 
1740, that a few days before, *^ The celebrated 
*&apos; Rabbit-woman oiGodalmin in Surry was committed 
•&apos; to Guildford Gaol, for receiving ftolen goods.&quot; 

In The Gazetteer , cr Daily London Advertifer^ Jan. 
%\, 1763, was this paragraph, which clofcs the ftory 
of our heroine : ** Laft week died at Godalming in

hence into the firft plate to the Analyfts of Beauty^ as 
well as into his Satire on the Methodifts See the or- 
naments of an altar compofed of a concatenation of 
different periwigs, and the barometers exprcfling the 
different degrees of animal hear. At the corners of 
the dial on the top of this print is the date of the 
year (1727), and the face of HeiJtgger appears under 
the figure XU. In the earlieft imprefiions, the word 
&quot; Provocati^•es has, inftead of V -the open vowel U. 
This incorreSncfs in fpelling was afterwards amended, 
though in a bungling manner, the round bottoms of 
the original letters being ftill viiible &quot;f^. 

Concerning John James Heidegger j whofe face has 
been more than once introduced by our artift, the 
reader may cxprefs fome curiofity. The following 
account of him is therefore appended to the fore- 
going article. 

&quot; This extraordinary man, the fon of a clergyman, 
*^ was a native of Zurich in Switzerland^ where he 
&quot; married, but left his country in confequence of an 
*&apos; intrigue. Having had an opportunity of vificing 
** the principal cities of Europe^ he acquired a talle 
^&apos; for elegant arid refined pleafures, which, united to 
** a ftrong inclination for voluptuoufnels, by degrees 

qualified him for the management of public 

amufements. In 1 708, when he was near 50 years

*• and infinuiiting addrcl&apos;s, he loon worked himfclf

&quot; from whom he obtained the appellation of *&apos; the

** Mrs. Salmon^s daughter was introduced, who took

&apos;^ him, told him, &apos; the king was in a violent paffion ; 
&apos;* that his beft way was to go inftantly and make an 
** apology, for certainly the mufic were mad, and 
&quot; afterwards to difcharge them.&apos; Almoft at the 
** fame inftant, he ordered the falfe Heidegger to do 
** the fame. The fcene now became truly comic in 
** the circle before the king. Heidegger had no 
&apos;* iboner made a genteel apology for the infolence of 

&quot; bis 



4&lt;C «59 }&lt;» his muficians, but the iklfe Heidegger advanced^ 
&apos;* and, in a plaintive tone^ cried out» ^ Indeed, Sire, 
** it was not my fault, but that devil&apos;s in my likecefs/ 
** Poor Heidegger turned round, flared^ ftaggered^ 
&apos;&lt;grew pale, and could not utter a word. Thp duke 
&apos;^ then humanely whifpered in his ear the fum of his

his mafl:. Here ended the frolick ; but Heidegger 
*&apos; fwore he would never attend any public amufe* 
^* ment, if that witch the wax- work woman did not 
&apos;^ break the mould, and melt down the maik before 
** his face •. ^ 

&apos;* Being once at fopper with a large company^&lt;^ when a queftion was debated, which nationalift of 
** Europe had the greateft ingenuity ; to the furprifc 
^* of all prefent, he claimed that cbarader for the

This plate reprefents the removal of Rich and 
his fcenery, .authors, adors^&amp;c. {xotti Lincoln&quot; s^lnn 
Fields to the JVirw Houfe ; and might therefore be 
as probably referred to the year 1733, when that 
event happened* The fcene is the area of Covent 
Garden, acrofs which, leading toward the door of the 
Theatre, is a long proceflion, conflfting of a cart 
loaded with thunder and lightning ; performers,&amp;c* 
and at the head of them Mr. Rich (invefted with the

* The Perffus and Andromedn^ for which Hogarth engraved 
the plates mentioned in p. 170, was not publiflied till 1730 ; 
bi:t there was ode under the fame title at Drury-Lane in i7iS.

• The reafon why our artift has affigned fuch an 
tmplcJyment to him, we can only guefs. It fcems,* 
Indeed, from Dr. Johnjons Life of Gay^ that Pope did 
ftot think the Beggar* s Opera would fucceed. Szvifii 
however^ was of the fame opinion ; and yet the 
former fupported the piece oh the firfl. night of ex-

There are beGdcs (bme allufions in the verfes al«

which I confefs my inability to illuflrate. Thofe

moft fuccefsfiil commentators on the prefent occa- 
iion ; but not many can p jfiibly be now alive who 
were at that period competent judges of fuch 
matters. 

This prints however, was not only unpublifhcd, 
but in feveral places is uniiniihed. It was probably 
fupprefled by the influence of fomc of the charadters 
reprefcnted in it. The ftyle of compoiition, and 
manner of engraving,&amp;c. Sec. would have fufiicicntly 
proved it to be the work of Hogartby it* the initials

Perhaps the original print was tbQ Work of Gra^*

idea of it is borrowed from a French book, called 
Les Chats J printed at Amjlcrdaht in 1728. In this 
work, facing p. 117, is reprcfented an opera per- 
formed by cats, fuperbly habited. The defign is by 
Coypeii the engraving by T. Otten. At the end of • 
^hc rreatirc, the opera itfelf is publiflitd. It is im- 
probable that Hbgarth fhould have met with this^^w

explanation to it.

cafily fufpcft Hogarth of fuch plagiarifm as he might 
joftly be charged with, could he afterwards have

it probable tliat any youth could have produced a 
figure fo charaOcriQic as this ; or, if he could, that 
he ihould have publifhed it without any co^.comitant 
circumftaiices to explain its meaning. The above 
title, which fomc- collector has bellowed on this

tell from it whether he is to look for a boy emaciated 
by hun;rcr, or fiiivcring v\ith cold ? It is mentioned 
here, o:^.!y that it may be reprobated. If every

Let this fmall monument record the name 
Of Cadman^ and to future times proclaim 
How, by an attempt to fly from this high fpirc 
Acrofs the Sabrine ftream, he did acquire 
His fatal end. *T\vas not for want of fkill. 
Or courage, to perform the taik, he fell : 
No, no, — a faulty cord, being drawn too tight, 
Hurry&apos;d his foul on high to take her flight, 
Which bid the body here beneath, good night. 

A prelate being aiked permiffion for a line to be 
fixed to the fteeple of a cathedral church,- for this 
daring adventurer, replied, the man might fly to the 
church whenever he plcafed, but he fliou Id never 
give his confent to any one&apos;s flying from lU It feems 

As quick as lightning down his line he ikimo. 

Secure in equal poize of agile limbs. 

But fee the trufted cordage faithlcfs prove !. 

Headlong he falls, and leaves his foul above : 

The gazing town was Ihock&apos;d at the rebound 

Of fhatter*d bones, that rattled on the ground ; 

The broken cord rolls on in various turns. 

Smokes in the whirl, and as it runs it burns. 

So when the wriggling fnake is fnatch&apos;d on high 

3n eaglets claws, and hides in the iky, 

Around the foe his twirling tail he flings, 

And twifts her legs, and writhes about her wings. 

Cadman laid low, ye rafli, behold and fear, 

Man is a reptile, and the ground his fphcre. 

Unhappy man ! thy end lamented bc; 

Nought but thy own ill fate fo fwift :.s thee.

funeral licentjous, like the courfe of her life, as if 
the oontagioa of her example had reached all the

double trade of fedu&amp;ion and thievery. A lecood

ncer, is ihamefully employed; nor does a fingle 
circumftance occur, throughout the whole fccne, that 
a reflcdting female would not wifh (hould be alienated 
from her own interment. — Such is the plate which 
our illuftrator, with too much levity, has ftyled a 
farce appended to a tragic reprefentation. 

He might, however, have exercifed his critical 
abilities with more fuccefs on HegariVs negled of 
propriety, though it affords him occafion to difplay 
his wit. At the burial of a wanton, who expired 
in a garret, no cfcutcbcons were ever hung up, or 
lings given away ; and I much queflion if any bawd 
ever cbofc to avow that charadcr before a clergy&lt;»

not fufficiently vcrfed in Alfatian annals to decide on

charafter) was to be found during the youth of our 
artift. More have heard and been afraid of thcfe 
vulgar heroes, than ever met with them. This fet 
of prints was engraved by Scotin chiefly ; but feveral 
of the faces were touched upon by Hogarth. In 
the fecond plate the countenance of the man with 
the quarter- (laves was wholly engraved by Hogarth. 
In fomc early proofs of the print, there is not a (in- 
gle feature on this man&apos;s face ; there is no writing 
either in the mufician&apos;s book, or on the label ; nor is 
there the horfc-race cup, the letter, or the poem 
that lies at the end of the label, that being entirely 

. blank. I mention thefe circum (lances to (hew that 
our artid would not entrud particular parts of his

that the man drawing lines againll the wall juft ov«r : 
the half-penny, alludes to Whijion&apos;s propofcd methotl 
of difcovering the Longitude by the firing of bombs,

each comer of the print appears to have been taken 
from Cibbcr&apos;s llatues at Bedlam, The faces of the two i

a fan, is entirely alreri;d ; fhc has now a cap on, in- 
ftead of a hood^ and is turned, as if fpeaicing to the

PLATEL 

O Vanity of Age^ untoward. 
Ever fpleeny, ever froward ! 

Why 

^^ fingering the gold. You enter at once into bis charaAcx« 
&apos;* — ^The young woman might have funiiflied the arcift with 
&apos;* an oppoitunity of pre&amp;nting a -graceful figure ; whicK woi^d 
^* have been more pleafing* The figure he has introduced, is 
^^ by no means an objedi of allurement.-^The perJpeHhH is 
&apos;* accurate, but ^affe^ed. So many windows, and open doprs, 
** may (hew the author&apos;s learning ; but they break the back 
^^ ground, and injure the fimplicity of it. 

&apos;* The decoad print introduces our hero into all the difli-* 
^&apos; pation of modifli life. We became firft acquainted with 
** him, when a boy of eighteen. He is now of age ; has 
•• entirely thrown off the clownifh fchooUboy ; and afiumes 
^* the man of fafliion. Inftcad of the country taylor, who 
** took roeafure of hira for his father&apos;s mourning, he is now 
** attended by French barbers, French taylors, poets, milUncrs, 
&apos;* jockies, bullies, and the whole retinue of a fiae gentleman. 
** —The exfrejfion^ in this print, is wonderfully great. The 
** dauntiefs front of the bully ; the keen eye, and elafticity of 
** the fencing- mafter; and the fimpering importance of the 
•• dancing-mailer, are admirably exprclTcd. The laft is per- 
** haps a little tfJK/r/. The architect * is a ftrong copy from na- 
•* ture. — ^Thc compofuion Iccras to be entirely fubfervient to th« 
** expreffion. It appears, as \i Hogarth had fiwetched^ in his 
•• memorandum -book, all the characlcrs which he has here 
•* introduced ; but was at a lofs how to group them; and 
^* chofe rather to introduce them in detached figures, as he 
•&apos; had fltetched them, than to lolc any part of the exprellion 
•&apos; by combining them. — The light is ill diilributed. It is 
^&apos; fpread indifcriminarely over the print; and deftroys the 
•* KMhole — ^We have no indance of grace in any of the fvgiires. 
•* The principal figure is very deficient. There is no contra (I 
^ in the limbs ; which is always attended with a degree of 
•* ungracefulnefs. — Tlie execution is very good. It is elabo- 
** rate, and yet free. — The fatire on operas, though it may be 
** well directed, is forced and unnatural.

** We meet 0ur hero efigstged in one of h?! e^eftxag amufe- 
** meots. This print, on the whole^ is no very extraordbary 
^ effort of genius. — The difign is good ; and niay be a very 
*^ exad defeription of the huffioun of a brotheU— The ccm^- 
** pafiUn too is not amifs. But we bare few of cKofe mafterly 
** llrokes which difiinguifli the works of Hogarth. The whole 
*^ IS plain hiftory. The lady iettmg the world on fire is the 
*&apos; beil thought : and there ii fome humour in fumi(hing the 
** room with a iet oiCsefars \ and not placing theili in order. — 
** The light is ill managed. By a few alterations, which are 
•• obvioufy particularly by throwing the lady drcfling into 
&apos;* the fhade, the difpofition of it might have been tolerable. 
** But dill we fliould have bad aaf dbfurdrty to anfwer^ whence 
&apos;* comei it ? Here is light in abundante ; but no viiible 
*• fource. — KxprcJJion we have a little through the whole&lt;* print. That of the principal figure is the belt. The ladiet 
** have all the nir of their profeflion ; but no variety of cha* 
•* rafter. HogartV s ^^orntn are, in general, very inferior to 
•• his men. For which rcafon I prefer the Rakers Prcgrefs to 
** the Harlot*!. The female face indeed has feldom ftrcngth 
.&apos;* of feature enough to admit the ftrong markings of cx^ 
*• predion. 

** Very difagrccable accidents often befall gentlemen of 
&quot; pleafure. An event of this kind is recorded in the fourth 
*• print ; v.hich is now before us. Otir hero going, in full 
&apos;* drefs, to piy his compliments at court on St. DaviJ&apos;s day, 
*&apos; was accoftcd in the rude manner which is here reprefentcd* 
*• -—The compojiiion is good. The form of the group, made 
&quot; up of the figures in aftion, the chair, and the lamp-lighter, 
•* is pltaling. Only, here we have an opportunity of re- 
*• marking, that a group is difgulVmg when the cxiremitica 
•* of it arc heavy, A group in fome rcfpc&lt;5l fliould refemble 
•* a tree. The heavier part of the foliage (the cap as the 
&apos;* landfcape painter calls it) is always near the middle; the 
•• outfide branches, which arc relieved by the fky, arc light 
** and airy. An inattention to this nile has given a hcavincfs 
•* to the group before us. The two bailiffs, the woman, and 
^ the cbairmaoi aix all huddkd together in that pirt of the 

&quot; group

^* is chiefly introduced to fettle the chronology of the ftory.— 
&apos;&apos; In point of gracc^ we have nothing flriking. Hogarth might

X. Two prints of Before and After. The two 

pi£bures, from which thefe prints are taken, were 

painted at the particular requeft of a certain vicious 

nobleman, whofe name deferves no commemoration. 

The hero of them is faid to have been deiigned for 

Chief Jufiice tViUes. Hogarth repented of having 

engraved them ; and almoll every poflefibr of his 

works will wiih they had been with-held from the 

public, as often as he is obliged to ihew the volume 

that contains them to ladies. To omit them, is to 

mutilate the colleAion ; tp pin the leaves^ on which 

they are pafted, together, is a circumflance that tends 

only to provoke curiofity ; and to difplay them, 

wpuld be tp fet decency at defiance. The painter

Thcfc prints, however, difplay almoft the only inftance 
in which Hogarth condelcended to execute a fubje£t

* J^Jlma Ward WAS one of the younger fons of an ancient 
and refpe^tabie family fettled at Guijhorougb in 21»rit^irr» where 
he was born ibroe time in the laft century. He feeobt, from 
every defcription of him, to have had fmall advantages from 
education, though he indifputably poflefled no mean natural 
parts. The iirft account we have of him is, that he was aflb* 
ciated in partnerfhip with a brother named WiiUam^ as a diy- 
lalter, in Jhamts-fireet* After they had carried on this bull* 
nefs fome time, a fire broke out in an adjoining houfe, which 
communicated itfeif to their warehoufes, and entirely deftroyed 
ail their property. On this occafion Mr. iVitri^ with a goi- 
. tleman from the country who was on a vifit to htm, efcaped 
over the tops of the houfes in their ihirts. In the year 1717 
he was returned member for Marlborough \ but, by a vote of the 
Houfe of Commons, dated May 13, was declared not duly 
eleded. It is imagined that he was in fome meafure conneded 
with his brother Joijn Ward (who is ftigmatizcd by Mr. Fafe^ 
Dunciad III. 34,) in fecrcting and protecting illegally the pro* 
perty of fome of the South&amp;ea dired^ors. Be this as it may, he 
fpon after fled from England^ relidcd fome years abroad, and 
has been frequently luppofed to have turned Roman Catholic. 
While he remained in cxilo, he acquired that knowledge of 
medicine and chemiilry, which afterwards was the means of 
railing him to a (late of affluence. About the year 1733 he 
began to pradile phyfic, and combated, for fome time, the 
united efforts of Wit, Learning, Argument, Ridicule, Malice, 
andjealoufy, by all of which he was oppofed in every (hape 
that can be fiiggcrted. At length, by fome lucky cures, and par- 
ticularly one on a relation of Sir Jofepb Jekyl Mafter of the 
Rolls, he got the better of his opponents, and was fuffered to 
praCtife undidurbed. From this time his reputation was eda* 
blilhed : he was exempted, by a vote of the Houfe of Com* 
mons, from being vifited by the ccnfors of the college of phy- 
iicians, and was even called in to the affidance of King George 
the Second, whofe hand he cured, and received, as a reward, 
a commiffion for his nephew the late General GanfeL It was 
his cuflom to diflribute his medicines and advice, and even 
pecuniary afliftancc, to the poor, at his houfe, j^a//i; and thus

a ftero oatfide, and rough deportment, he was not wanting m 
benevolence. After a continued feries of fuccefs, he died DeCm

medicines to Mr. Page^ member for Chichefter^ who beftowed 
them on two charitable inAitutions, which have derired coo*

I have been told, that Mr* Garrickf when he firft 
appeared in the charader of Bayes, taking the fame 
libercr, received inftantly fuch a meflage firom one 
oftheflnge boxes, as prevented him from pra&amp;ifing 
fo infolcnt a ftroke of mimickry a fecond time. 

In fpite of the confidence with which this p^ate has 
been attributed to Hogarth, I by no means beliey^ 
it was bi« performance. It more refemblcs the 
manner of Vandergucht^ who was equally inclined 
to perfonal fatire, however his talents might be in- 
adequate to his purpofes. Witnefs feVcral Scattered 
defigns of his in the very fame ftvle of engraving. 
I may add, thar he always exerted his ta&apos;ents in the 
fervicc of the Tory fa&amp;ion. Befides, there is no- 
thing in the plate before us which might not have 
been exp^-fted from the hand of any common artift. 
The conceit of the blafts ifluing from the pofteriors 
of the JEcV&apos;!tn tribe, is borrowed from one of the 
prims to Scarr n\ &apos;Travefiy cf Vi&apos;git ; and the figure 
of Br::an&gt;iij is altogether ir.fipid and unworthy of 
Thga^ih. Our artift alio w:i5 too nuich accuftomed

obfervcs that thefe plates^ *^ except the lafl^are infe*

It feems that thejfigure of the Old Maidj in the print

or relation of bis* &apos; At firft ihe was well enough Xattf* 
fied with her refemblance; butfome defigning pei&gt;pie teaching her to be angry&gt;Ihe ftruck the painter 
out of her will, which had been made confiderably in 
his favour. This ftory we have heard often related 
by thofe whom^ on other occafions^ we could* readily 
believe. In the fame print is a portrait of Dr. Rock^ 
who fornierly attended Coveni-Garden market every 
morning. 

To the propriety of Hogarth^s having intra* 
duced a fcene of riot within Kin^s Coffee-bcufe^ 
the following quotation from ^be Weekly Mifcellany 
for jfuflegy 1739, bears fufBcient teftimony : ** Mok- 
,day Mrs. Mary Kinz of Covent^Garden was brought 
up to the King&apos;s Bench Bar at Weftminjler^ and 
received the following fentence, for keeping a dif- 
orderly houfe ; viz. to pay a fine of £. 200, ta^fuf- 
fer three months imprifonment, to find fecurity for 
.her good behaviour for three years, and to remain in 
prilon till the fine be pavd.*^ As it was impoffible 
Ihe could carry on her former bufinels, as foon as the 
time of her imprifonment was ended, ihe retired 
with her (avings, built three houfcs on Huverjiock

. .Ufig^fb&apos; 4l9^^efer; giade feveral alterations and 
additions in this plate when it4ippeared to be fiaiflied. 
He changed in fooie tneafure all |the countenances^ 
and indeed the entire head and limbs of thechimney-

Mtfs had alfo a D^i/, (ignificantly placed under the

vance being defigned by fome boy for the purpofe of 
taking birds; but when occupied by Mifs&apos;s Play- 
thing, became emblematic of the art of catching 
men. What relates, however, to this young lady

It was ifitcBded to rklicale Monf, Difiwyer^ and

profped: of a theatre. The openings between the 
fide fcenes are crowded with applauding fpeftators. 
The two performers are capering very high, A fun 
over-head (I fuppofe the emblem of public favour) 
is darting down its rays upon them. The reprefen- 
tadves of Tragedy and Comedy are candle-holders 
on the occafion. Underneath is the following in«

Painted by Mr. Ihgartb. It was ibid by Mr. Jandti^

of Mr4 Biribj furgeon, Effex-firut^ in ^The Strand. 

It difplays (as we leam frohi an infcription on the 
pedeftal.tmder a Femu drefled in a hoop-petticoat) 
the rcigniiijg modes of the year 1 742. It was painted 
for the opulent Mifs Edwards, who paid our artift 
fixty guineas for it. Her reaibn for choofing fuch a 
fubgeft was rather whimfical. By her own fingula-* 
rities having incurred fome ridicule; Ihe was defirous^ 
by the affiltance of Hogariby to recriminate on the 
publtck. As he defigned after her ideas^ he had 
little kindneis for. his performance^ and never would 
permit a print to be taken from it. The prefent one 
was from a drawing made by connivance of her fer« 
vants. The original was purchafed by the father of 
its prefent owner, at her fale at Kenfington. 

The figure of the beau holding the china-faucer 
is faid to have been that of Lord Tortmorey dreiled 
as he firfl appeared at court after his return from 
France. The young female was defigned for a cele- 
brated courtezan, who was the Kattj Fijher of her* 

S 2 time. 



tiflie* n^ fintiiliarhy with the black boy alludes to 
H dihilar weaknefs in a noble duchefi, who educated 
two brats of the fame colour* One of them after* 
wards robbed her, akd the other was guilty of fome 
offence equally unpardonable. The pi&amp;ures with 
which the room is adorned, contain many ftrokes of 
temporary fatire. See the Venus with fiays, a hoop, 
and high-heerd ihoes r Cupid burning all thefe parts 
9f drefsi together with*a modilh wig,&amp;c. ; a fecond 
Cupid paring down a plump lady to the faihionable 
(landard ; and [in a framed pidure dafled with a 
fiumber of infe^] the figure of Defnojer the dancing- 
matter in a grand ballet. The ridicule oo the folly 
of coUeding- old china,&amp;c fcc* are alike circum- 
fiances happily introduced, and explanatory of the 
falluons then in vogue. The colouring is better than 
that in mod of Hogarth&apos;s pictures. The plate is now 
the property of Mr, Sayer.

In the very firft impreffions of the fccond of them

added by our artift, after Baron had finilhed the

t In the third plate of this work, the figure of the fnnale 
unclaiping a penknife, is faid to hare been defigned for the 
once eeiebrated BctPf Cartkfs. This remark is fnppofed to be 
countenanced by the initials £• C. on her bofom. From being 
in a date to receire company, this woman had been long re« 
duced to (how it,- and, after repeated confinements in various 
prifoos, was buried from the poor&apos;s honfe of St. Paml^ Covent

prints had been publiihed. Such a reprefentation of her de- 
cline from beauty, as may be given in the plate before us, is 
juftified by various pafiages in Lo^eling^s poems, Latin and 
EmfjUfb^ written about the year 1738, and publiihed in 1741.

The reader will perhaps ihiile, when, after fo much grave 
ratiocination, and this long dedudtoa of particulars, he is 
informed that the letters are not £. €• but F. C. the initials 
of Famt^ Cock^ daughter to the celebrated au^ioneer of that 
name, with whom our artift had had ibme cafual difagreement* 

The following, fomewhat difierent, explanation has alfobeea 
communicated to nne by Charles Rogers^ efq. who fays it came 
from Sw!Uv4m^ one of Hogarib^s engraven : ** The nobleman 
** threatens to cane a quack-do6tor for having given pills which 
** proved ineffedtuai in curing a girl he had debauched ; and 
** brings with him a woman, from whom he alledges he caught 
** the infe^ion ; at which fhe, in a rage, is preparing to fiab 
** him with her clafp koife. This wretch is one of the loweft 
*^ clafs, as is manifeft by the letters of her name marked with 
•* gunpowder on her breaft. She, however, is brought to the 
** French barber-furgeon for his examination and inlpe^ion, 
^&apos; and for which purpofe he is wiping his ipedades with hh 
** coarfc muckendcr/* 

The explanation |;hren by Rouqttet^ however, ought not to 
be fupprelTed, as in all probability he received it from Hogarth^ 
** II falloit Indiquer la ftiauvaife conduite du heros de la piece.

die following anecdote-; but there muft be fome 
miilake in it^ as Herring was not arcbbllhop till fe* 
veral years after the defigns for Marriage d la AMe 
were made. 

&quot; Edward Swallow^ butler to Archbiihop Herrings 
** had an annuity of tea pounds given to him in his 
** Grace&apos;s will. For the honefty and fimplicity of 
^&lt;his phyfiognomy^ this old faithful fervant was io 
^^ remarkable, that Hd^arfb, wanting fuch a figure in 
^^ Mahii^e i la Mode, actompanied the late dean of 
•* SanM, Dr. Thomas Greene, on a public day, to 
&apos;&apos; Lifmbeth, on purpofe to catch the likenefs. As 
** they were coming away, he whifpered, * 1 have 
&apos;^^ hiiii !&apos; And he may now be feen to the life pre- 
^ ferved in the old (teward^ in Plate 11. with his hands 
•« held up,&amp;c.&quot; 

In Plate V. the back ground, which is laboured 
with uncommon delicacy (a circumitance that will 
be remarked by few except artifts), was the work of 
Mr. Ravenet*s wife. Solomon* s wife judgement is re- 
prefented on the tapeftry. When Ravenet^s two plates 
were finiihed, Hogarth wanted much to retouch the 
faces ^, and many dlfputes happened between him 
and the engraver on this fubjed. The firft im- 
preffions, however, efcaped without corredlion. Thofe 
who poflefs both copies, may difcover evident marks 

* In his advertifemeat for thii dt of plates, he had engaged 
tp engrave all the facet with hit own band. See p. a6ji« Note.

Tbe Daily Advertifer of 1750 affords the following

•* propofcs to publifli by fubfcription two large 
^*&apos; prints, one reprefenting Mo/es brought to PbaraobU

•* fubfcribing, and Five Shillings more on the deli- 
** very of the print. On the firft payment a receipt 
will be given, which receipt will contain a new 
print (in the true Dutch tafte) of Paul before Felix. 
^* Note, The above two prints will be Seven Shillings 
** and Six Pence each after the fubfcription is over ; 
** and the receipt-print will not be fold at a le(s price 
^* than One Guinea each. Subfcriptions are taken in 
&apos;* till the 6th of June next, and no longer, at The 
&quot; Golden-Head in Leicejler- Fields ^ where the drawings 
** may be feen ; as likewife the author&apos;s fix pidures

** in the following manner : That every bidder fign

* The. account given in a former edition of this volume 
concerning the fale of the original pidures of Marriage a-lm^ 
madi^ being fomewhat erroneous, I am happy in the preient 
opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to Mr. Lam 
abovementioned, who has corrected my mi (lakes by a comma* 
nication of the following particulars relative to the purchife : 

&apos;* Some time after they had been finiflied, perhaps fix or 

** fcven years, during which period Mr. Hogarth had been 

** preparing and pubiifliing prints from them, in the year 

** 1750 he advertiied the fale of the originals by a kind of 

^* au^ion not carried 00 by perfonal bidding, but by a written 

** ticket on which every one was to put the price he would 

&apos;* give, with his naipe fubi&apos;cribed to it. Thefe papers were td 

** be received by Mr. Hogarth for the fpgce of one month ; and 

*&apos; the hii^heft bidder, at twelve o&apos;clock on the laft day of x\\t 

** month, was to be the purchafer : and none but thofe who 

** had in writipg made their biddings were to be admitted oa 

*^ the day that was to determine the fale. Thisnouvelle me* 

&quot; thod of proceeding probably difobliged the public ; and 

*^ there feemed to be at that time a combination againft poor 

&apos;* Hogarth^ who perhaps, from the extraordmary and frequent 

&apos;* approbation of his works, might have imbibed fome degree 

&apos;* of vanity, which the toxvn in general, friends and toes, 

&apos;^ (cemed refolved to mortify. If this was the cafe (and to 

^&apos; me it is very apparent), they fully effe^ed their dt^lign ; for 

** on the memorable (ixth of June 1750, which w&lt;)s to decide 

^&apos; the fate of this capital work, about eleven o&apos;clock Mr. Lane^

^* more than once by Hogarth to part with his bargain at a

The memory of this occurrence ought always to attend the 
work which afforded Mr. Lane an opportunity of difplaying 
fo much difinterefted generoiity. 

Another correfpondent begins the fame ftory as follows—^ 
A little time before the audion, Hogarth publickly declared, 
th^t no pi^ure-dealer fhould be allowed to bid. He alfo called 
on his friends, requeuing them not to appear at the fale, at 
his houfe was fmali, and the room might be over crowded. 
They obeyed his injunctions. Early in this mortifying day he 
dreiled himfelf, put on his tye^wig, ftrutted away one hour^

^ Near the center of the pifture, the painter hfjk&lt;&apos; exhibited bis principal figure, which is a handfome 
# young grenadier, in whofe face b ilrongly depicted

^* tual indifference only excites our laughter.&quot; To render 
his fpedtacle, however, more fhocking, our artid has per- 
haps deviated fron^ nature, againft whofe laws he fo rarely 
oftends. He has imprelTed marks of agony on the face of 
the criminal under diffedtion ; whereas it is well known, that, 
the mod violent death once paft, the tumult of the features 
fubfides for ever. But, in Uogarth&apos;^s print, the wretch who

treatifes of profligacy ? or, if painters have a right to chaf- 
tife indelicacy, by exhibiting grofe examples of it in their own 
performances ? To become indecent ourfelves, is an nnwar* 
rantabie recipe for curing indecency in others* The oUceni* 
tits of JwmiHol have hitherto met with no very fiicceisfui rin* 
dicarion : ** Few are rhe converts j^cfnsrhas made/* Accor* 
ding ro our critic&apos;s mode of rcaiSraing, a homicide might urge 
that the crime of which he fiands accufed was commitred 
only as a falutary example of the guiit of murder ; nay, thus 
indeed every human offence might be allowed to bring with 
it its own apology.— I forbear to proceed in this argument, 
or might obfervc in behalf of our ** foreigners,&apos;* thai their 
incidents infinnate fome rcfieclioas as well as Hogarth* s. The 
evacuations introduced in Dmtcb pidures, moft certainly in« 
culcate the neceffiry of temperance, for ihofe only who eat 
and drink too much at fairs, or in ale houiies, are liable to 
fuch public and unleemly accidents as Htemjkirk^ OfiaJg^ and 
TeiucTiy have occafionally reprd&apos;entcd. If we are to look for 
** Sernions in fiones, and good in every thing,&quot; this inference 
is as fair as many which Mr. H^, leems inclined to produce 
in honour ot f«H)r Hogarth^ who, like Sbai/pesre^ often fought 
to entertain, without keeping any moral purpofe in view» 
But was there either wit or morality in Hogarth^i own eva» 
cnation againft the door of a church, a circumtbnoe recorded

2. Analyfis of Beauty. Two plates. Mr ^Walpole 
obferves^ that Hogarth&apos;s *&apos; famples of grace in a 
*• young lord and lady are ftrikingly ftiff and affec- 
** ted. They are a Bath beau and a county beau« 
**&quot; ty.** The print is found in three different ftates. 
** In the original plate the principal figure reprefent- 
&quot; ed the prefent king, then prince, but Hogarth was 
&apos;* defired to alter it. The prefent figure was taken 
•* from the laft duke of • King/fon ; yet, though like 
** him, is ftiff, and far from graceful *.&quot; In Plate t. 
Fig. 19. the fat perfonage dreft in a Roman habit, 
and elevated on a pedeftal, was defigned, as Hogarth 
himfelf acknowledged, for a ridicule on ^uin in the 
charafter of Coriolanus. Effex the dancing-mafler is 
alfo reprefented in the aft of endeavouring to reduce 
the graceful attitude of Antinous to modern ftiflfnefs^ 
Fig. 20. was likewife meant for the celebrated Dej^ 
noyer^ dancing in a grand ballet. 

Dr. Beat tie y fpeaking of the modes of combination, 
by which incongruous qualities may be prefented to 
the eye, or the fancy, fo as to provoke laughter, ob- 
ferves *^ A country dance of men and women, like 
** thofc exhibited by Hogarth in his Analyfis of Beau- 
*^ ty, could hardly fail to make a beholder merr}&apos;&apos;, 
** whether he believed their union to be the cfFcdt&lt;* of defign or accident. Moft of thofe perfons 
** have incongruities of their own in their ihape, 
** drcfs, or attitude, and all of them are incongruous 
&quot; in refpedt of one another ; thus far the aflfemblage

Tbe original pidhires are now in the pofieffiod of 
Mrs. Garrick^ at Hampton. The infcription on die 
banner^ &quot; Give us our eleven days,** alludes to the 
alteration of the Style in 1752 ; in which year, from 
the 2d to the 14th of September^ eleven days were 
not reckoned by aft of parliament. In the eiedion- 
dinner, Mr. Hogarth aflured the writer of thb para- 
graph, that there is but one at table intended for a 
real portrait ; and that is the hijh gentleman [dlie 
prefent Sir John Pamell, nephew to the poet, and 
remarkable for a very flat nofe], who is diverting the 
compattt]^ by k face drawn with a burnt cork upOQ 
the back of his hand, while he is fuppofed to be 
fingiiig — Jin otd woman chat bed in grey. This gen- 
tleman (then an eminent attorney) begged it as % 
favour ; declaring, at the fame time, he was {o ge^ 
nerally known, that the introdudion of his face 
would be of fervice to our arcifl in the fale of hit 
prints at Dubtin. Notwithftanding Hogarth^s aller*^ 
tion, the handfome candidate is pronounced to be 
the late ^omat Potter, efq. and the effigy, feen 
through the window, with the words &quot; No Jewf^ 
about its neck, to be meant for the late Duke of 
Newcajlle. Of yet another real perfonage we receive

^he Writs arc iffued :— to the Town 
^he future Mettibers hailen down ; 

The merry bells their welcome foiindi 

And mirth and jollity abound, 

The gay retinue now comes in. 
The crouds, with emulative din, 
Proclaim th* arrival, rend the iky. 

And Court and Countf^s all the cry. 

Each joyous houfe, of fre% accefs, 

For patriot plebeians^ moVe or iefs, 

Is now feveard, in printed bills ; 

So quacks contrive to veAd their pilUw 

So Bayes makes Earth, and Sun, and Mooo^ 

Difcourfe melodtoufly in tune ; 
\ And, full of wit and complaifance, 

Cry, ** Firft of all we&apos;ll have a dance !** 

So at Elections *tis difcreet 

Still firfl of all to have a treat ; 
\ The pulfe of every man to try. 

And learn what votes they needs muft iti^\ 

No freeman well Can tell his fide, 

Unlefs his belly^s fatisfied. 
Behold the feftive tables fct. 

The Candidates, the Voters met ! r 

And Ip, againft the wainfcot placM, 

Th&apos; efcutcheon, with three guineas gracM^ 

The motto and the creft explain, 

Nvhich way the gilded bait to gain. 

There WilUam^s mangled portrait telU 

What rage in party bofoms dwells ; 

And here the banner fpeaks the cry 

For ** Liberty ahd Loyalty.&apos;* 

While fcratches dignify his face. 

The tipfy Barber tells his cafe ; 

How well he for his Honour fought ! 

How many deviliili knocks he got ! 

While, forcM to carry on the joke.

The above four articles are ail etched by S. Haynis,

The fix prints which follow, were published by

No. 5. was engraved by Bartolozzi, and the reft by 
R, Livefiiy, 

5. The Shrimp Girl, a head, from ari original 
iketch in oil, in the poflcffion of Mrs. Hogarth. 

This plate, which is executed in the dotted manner 
fo much at prefent in fafliion, ihould have been etched 
or engraved like thofe excellent performances by 
Bcurluzzi after the drawings oi Guercino. Spirit, 
rather than delicacy, is the charaifterifticof our artift&apos;s

Mr. IValpole&apos;s is probably a later or a retouched 
impreffion from the fame plate, after it had fallen 
into the hands of one Andrew Miller, who effaced the 
name of Ford, and fubftituted his own. 

This fcarce print will undoubtedly fuffer from com- 
parifon with the works of Smith, M&apos;Ardelt, Earkmt 
Jonetf&amp;c. and yet perhaps it is tlie beft mezzotinio 
that Ireland has hitherto produced. It muft be con- 
fefled, however, that Hogarth&apos;s whole-length figure

&quot; an exaft account of the whole, for the ufe of

As this plate was found among others engraved

It Ihould be obferved that, being founded oik « 
jirivate occurrence, this print was never dcfigned fof 
general circulation. Mr. Wghmore the manager of 
Druij-Lane, who bought Giber&apos;s fliarc in the pa- 
tent, is the Hero of it. A few copies only were 
diftnbutcd among Hogarth&apos;s parricuKir friends, and &quot; 
the gentlemen whofe portraits it contains. At the I 
boitoin of the plate there is no defcriptive title. 
Difiovery was that by which Mrs. Ho^jur/ /j mentioned 
it when Ihe recolle&lt;Sed the very laughable circum«l 
llance here cominemorarcd by her hulband&apos;s pencil.

Mr. S. Ireland.

underftood as a fatire on Hogarth, rather than a dc- 
figo by him. Mr. Ireland once told me it was etched 
hy D^zveSt and that our arcift gave a copy of it, as 
his own defign, to Mr. IZirby. But 1 am a0ured 
with fupcrior confidence by another gentieman, that 
the true author of it is v-t be fought among thofe ar- 
lifts whom Hogarth had provoked by his contemp- 
tuous treatment of their works. If Pu^ was not de- 
signed as his rcpreftntative, why is the animal exhi- 
bited in the Z&amp;. of painting the ridiculous figure of

and why fupprcfied (for no one has hitherto met 
ttitb even a proof from it) it is vain to cnquircjij

of my own. 

53. &quot; A very rare hieroglyphic print, reprefeorii 
*&apos; Royalty, Epifcopacy, and Law, compofed of em* 
&quot; bleniatic attributes, and no human features or 
&quot; limbs ; with attendants of fimilar ingredients. Be* 
•* neaih is this infcripiion. Some of the principal; 
*&apos; mbabitants of the Moon, as rhey were difcovered&apos;

A kind of fcaffold above the clouds is the theatre 
of this reprefcntation. Monarchy, Epifcopacy, and 
X-aw, appear charaderitlicaliy feated. &apos;Iheir faces 
are — a Crown-piece — a Jc^&apos;i Harp, and — a Mallet* 
The monarch holds a globe and fceptre, with ere-&apos; 
fcents on the tops of them. Inftead of a collar of 
tjfes, he wears a firing of bubbles ; his fide is or- 
namemcd wllh a pointed liar ; and a circle, the em-

blfm of perpetuity, is embroidered on the cIotK ub- 
der his throne. Epifcopacy is working at a pump 
(a type I fuppofe of the Church) by the ailiftancc of 
a bellrope. The Bible is fattened to the handle of 
the pump, and out of the nofc of it ilTues money 
that falls into a cheft difcriminated by an armorial 
efcuccheon, containing a knife and fork, properly 
emblazoned, with a mitre by way of crcft. The 
lid of the coffer leans againlt a pillar, that ferves alfo 
to fupport a triple pile of cufhions. Over the top of 
the pump (which is fafhioned much like a ftecple) is a 
weathercock on a fmall pyramid fupported by balls ; 
and below it, throLigh a circular opening, a little bell 
appears to niig. Under the facerdotal robe, a cloven 
foot peeps out. Law fuftains a f-vord ■, and behind 
him appears a dagger ihruft through the bottoni of 
a fieve. The attendants on Monarchy are of various 
materials. The bodies and legs of fuch as fecm de- 
figncd for foldiers, are compofcd of circular firc- 
fcieensrefemblingfliields. The trunks of the courtiers 
arc large looking glafles, the fconccs with candles in 
them lerving for hands and arms. The face of the 
chief of thefe is the reverfc of a fixpence ; and a key 
fignificantly appended to his fafh, at oncedtnotes his 
fex and office. Under the figure of law are a male and 
female modilhly drcft. Her head is a tea-pot, her 
neck a drinking giafs, and her body a fan half fprcad. 
On the oval that forms the countenance of her para- 
mour, is a coat of arms with fupponcrs. His right 
honourable legs arc fan-fticks, and he fccms in the

«ft of courrihip. How this couple are immediately 
conneded with Law, is not very clearly pointed out. 
Hogarlhy however, we may fuppofe, had planned 
fbme explanation of his hieroglyphics, as the letters 
a, ^&gt;c,&lt;/, e,f, gy are placed over fome of them, and 
beneath others. j 

From the form of the perukes exhibited in this &apos;

The merits of Hogarib, as an engraver, are incon. 
lidcrable. His hand was faithful to charafter, but 
had little acqLiainlance with the powers of light and 
fliade. In fome of his early prints he was an aOidu- 
ous imitator of Caiiot, but deviated at laft into i 
manner of his own, which futfers much by compa* 
rifon with that of his coadjutors, Ravt-net and Sul- 
livan. In the pieces finilhed by thefe makers of 
their art, there Is a clcarnefs that Hogarth could 
never reach. His ftrokcs fometimcs look as if fortul- 
toufly difpoled, and fomeiimes confufedly thwart

I may add, that, fincc the appearance of Mr. 0&quot;^&apos; 
pole&apos;s Otaiogue, a dtfj^ofitlori to attribute feveral 
anonymous plates on ludicrous fubjeds, to Hogarth, 
has Iirtr:i;&apos;cd itfelf in more than a fingle inlUncc** 
A fuppoJition h:is alio prevailed that there was a time 
when Hogarth had the whole field of fatire tei&apos;him- 
felf, and we could boaft of no defigners whdfe per- 
formances could be miftaken for his own* The Isttct 
notion is undoubtedly true, if real judges are to&apos; de- 
cide ; and yet many prints, very flightly impreg- 
nated with humour, continue to be afcribed to him. 
It fhould therefore be obferved, ^hat, at the fame pe- 
riod, Bickbam^ Vanderguckt^ Boitdrd, Gravclot, La- 
guerre the younger^&amp;c. were occafionally publifliing 
fatirical Sketches, and engraviftg laughable frontif- 
pieces for books and pamphlets. To many of thefe, 
for various rcafons, they forbore to fet their names; 
and we have at prcfent coUeflors, who, to obtain the 
credit of having made difcoveries, are willing to 
adopt fuch performances as the genuine efTulions of 
Hogarth, although every way beneath his talents, and 
repugnant to hU ftyle of engraving. Perhaps alfo the 
names of other painters and defigners have been oc- 
cafionally obliterated, to countenance the fame fallacy.

t productions are by far the fcarccft 
that when, at an immoderate expeace, we have pro- 
cured impreflions from tankards omamcDted by him, 
or armorial enfig;:* engraved for the boots of his cuf- 
tomerg, we fiiall be found at lad to have added no- 
thing to his fame, or the entertaining quafity of our 
own colledions. By fuch means, however, we may 
open a door to impofition. A work like T/je Har- 
iot&apos;i Pregrefs will certainly remain unimitated as well 
as inimitable ; but it is in the power of every bungler 
to create freih coats of arms, or fliopbilis with our 
artift&apos;s name fubfcribed to them : and wherein will 
the Lion or Griffin of Hogarth be difcovered to ex- 
Cell the fame reprefentalion by a meaner hand ? A 
crafty feleftion of paper, and a flight attention to 
chronology and choice of fubjefls, with the aid of 
the hot-prefs, may, in the end, prove an overmatch 
for the fagacity of the ableft connoiffeur. A llngle 
detedion of fuch a forgery would at leaft give rife 
to fufpicions that miglft operate even where no faU 
lacy had been defigned. How many fraudulent imi- 
tations of the fraaller works of Rembrandt are known 
to have been circulated with fuccefs I — But it may 
be aflced, perhaps, from what fource the author of 
this pamphlet derives his knowledge of fuch tranf- 
aftions. His anfwer is, from the majority of col« 
leftors whom he has talked with in confequencc of 
his prefent undertaking. 

He ought not, however, to conclude without ob- 
ferving, that feveral genuine works of Hogarth yet

renujn to be engraved. He ii happy alfo to add. 
that a young artill, every way qualified for fiich a 
ia&amp;, has., already published a few of tbefe by fub- 
fcripttOQ. 






7. N. bad cHicc thoughts of adding a Itft 
coj&gt;ies made from ihc works of Hogarth ; but finding 
ibcm to be numerous, beyond expeaation, has de- 
filed from a talk, he could not eafiiy accomplUfa. 
&apos;fbis purfuit, however, has enabled him to fugged 
jet another caution to his readers. Some of the early 
invaders of Hogarth&apos;s propcny were lets audacious 
[ban the red; and, forbearing to make cxaift itnita- 
tions of his plates, were content with only borrowing 
particular circumftanccs fronkcachof them, which 
ihey worked up into a fimilar fable. A fct of The 
Rake&apos;i Pregrsfs, in which the figures were thus dif- 
guifed and differently grouped, has been lately found. 
But fince the rage of coltcctlon broke out with its 
prefcnt vchenience, thofe dealers who have met 
with any fuch diverfi^d copies, have been dcGrous 
of putting them off either as the firll thoughts of 
Ht^arthf or as the inferior produfftions of eider ar» 
tills on whofc dcfigns he had iinproved.. There is 
alfo a very fmall fet of Tl:e Rukc&apos;i /&apos;ra^t-^/i, comrlvwi 
and executed with the varieties already mentioaed^i^

and even this has been offered to fale under tKc for- 
mer o{ thefe defcriptions. Thus, as Shtikfpcare iays. 
While we fl;ut the gate upon owf impoficion, another 
knocks at the door. 

Ic may not be impertinent to conclude thcfc cau- 
tions with another notice for the benefit of unexpe- 
rienced colleflors, who in their choice of prints ufu* i 
ally prefer tha blackcft. The earlieft copies of iftwl 
gartl/s works are often fainter than fuch as haveb 
retouched. The excellence of rhe former confifta 
in ciearnefs as well as ftrcngth ; Uut ftrcngth only is 
the charadteriftic of the latter. The firft arid third 
copies of The Harlet&apos;s Progrcfs will abundantly illuf- 
irate my remark, which, however, is confined to good 
impreffions of the plates in either ftate ; for forac 
are now to be met with&apos; that no more poITcfs the re- 
commendation of tranfparency than that of force. I 
may add, that when plates arc much worn, ic is cuf- 
tomary to load them, with a double quantity of co- 
lour, that their wcaknefs, as far as poflible, may ef- 
cape the eye of the purchaler. This pradice the 
copper-plate printers faceiioLifly entitle — coaxing ; 
and, by the aid of it, the deeper Ilrokes of the graver 
tthich are not wholly obliterated, become clogged 
with ink, while every finer trace, which was of a na- 
ture lefs permanent, is no longer vifible. Thus in 
the modern proofs of Garrick in King Richard HI. 
the armour, tent, and habit, continue to have confi- 
derable ftrength, though the delicate markings in 
the face, and the fhadows on the ir.fide of the hand, 

have

fcave 1(Ag fince difa^peared. Yet this print, even in 
its fainteft ftate, is ftill preferaljle tofuch fmutiy im- 
pofitions as have been recently defcribed. The mo- 
dero imprcHions of 7he Fair, and 7he March to Finch- 
Ir/y will yet more forcibly illuftrate the fame remark. 

To the •rig&apos;nal paintings o( Hogarth already eniK 
mcrated may be added a Breakfaft-piecc^ preferved 
in Bill-Streit, Derkeiey Square, in the pofTclEoD of 
WiBiam Strode, Efq; of NartbaWt Herts. It contains

&quot; his pencil, has written too difadvantageoufly of&apos; 
&apos; the late Mr. St. Aadrf. One who knew him inti- 
&apos;mately(but was never under the ImaUcft obiiga- 
&apos; tion to him) for the laft tw»cnty yeari of his life, 
&apos; and has learned the tradition of his earlier con- 
&apos;* dudl feemingly better than the editor of the article 

* in qucftion, takes the liberty to give a more 

* favourable idea of him, and without intending to 

* enter into a controverfy with this agreeable Col- 
&apos; leflor of Anecdote^, to vindicate this notorious 
&apos;* man, who muft be allowed to have been fuch ; 

* but it is to be hoped in the milder fenfe Lord 
^ Clarendon often or always ufes the epithet. The 

* making a fiibjed of Mr. Si. /.ndre is therefore 
&apos;* merely accidental. The writer cxpcfts to derive 
■&apos; no praife from exhibiting that perfon as the Hero 

* of a page. He thinks it is only doing juftice (for 
&apos;* the Dead defcrve juftice as well as the Living) 
■&apos; when he draws his pen againfl fome very inju- 
&apos;&quot; rious infinua:ions, thrown out with more inad-

Id the firft place, I avow that the epithet noterioas 
was not meant to be employed in the milder fenfc of 
Lord Clarendon. Had I undertaken to compile the 
life of a man eminent for virtue, I fhould have been 
happy to have borrowed the fofter application of the 
aforefaid term from our noble hiHorian. But having 
engaged to delineate a mere impotlor&apos;s charafler, 
there is greater propriety in adopting the difputcd 
word with that conftant fignification affixed to it by 
the biographers of Bet Cannings or Fanriv the Phan- 
tom of Cock Lane. — I ihall abfolve myfelf no farther 
from the charge of &quot; malice,&quot; than by obferving 
that there are always people who think fomewhat

.tious, who can no longer be affefled by human praife 
or ceofure, flioiild be fparcd. 

Our apologift next aflures lis, that perhaps more 
tenderners is due to a foreigner than to a native. 
The boafted amor patria is not very conCpicuous in 
this remark, which indeed was dropped, to as Uttle 
purpofc, by a learned counfel on the trial of the 
Fiencb Spy who was lately executed. 

&quot; Next to his countryman Heidegger&quot; adds our 
apologift, ** Mr. Si. Andre becanK the moft conjider^ 
•* able perfou that has been imparted from SzuUzer~ 
&apos;* land,&quot; To judge of the comparative vaUie of the 
latter, we miin: cftimate the merits of the former. 
Hddeg^er is known to us only bj&apos; the uncommon ug- 
linefs of his vifage, and his adroitncfs in conducing 
. Operas and Mafqucrades. If St. Andre is to be re- 
garded as a pcrfon ftill kfs confideruble than Heidegger, 
can his confequence be rated very high ? 

That St. Andre arrived here in a menial ftition, is 
not improbable. The fervility of his youth afforded 
a natural inrroduitlon to the infolence of his riper 
years. He was indeed (if I am no: mis-informed) 
of the fame farfiily with the fencing and dancing-

ftrudted in the management of the foil and kitt, no 
marvtl that he fo otten prated about tke art of de- 
fence, or that &quot; his gratitude to his bcncfaftors&quot; 
broke out in the language of a minuet or a rtgadoon. 
That he became famous enough in his profcfljon 
to have anatomical works occafionally dedicated to 
him, will eafily obtain credit among our apologift&apos;s 
readers ; for many of them muft have feen a book.

addreiTed to Buckborfcj and a treaiife on religion

reader of anatomical leftures in London. Buffterc, 
the furgeon who attended Cuifcard (the alTaflia of 
HarUy), was our hero&apos;s predeceffbr in this office, and 
I am told even he was not the firft who offered public 
inftruftions to the ftudents at our hofpitals. Dr. 
Hunter, who has been applied to for intelligence on 
this occaCon, declares that he never defcribed St. 
Andre as &quot; the wonder of his time,&quot; but as a man 
who had paflcd through no regular courfe of (ludy,

prehenfion of any fubjcd, but was unable to have 
put two propofirions together : — that he neither ex- 
teoded the bounds of the chlrurgical art by dtfoo- 
verics, nor performed any extraordinary curci; and, 
boalling fomewhere rhat he h;id deiedeii vcflcU ia 
the cuticle or fcarf-ft.in, a foreigner of eminence m 
the fan^e profclTioti offered (through tlie medium of

which he prudently declined. I am alfo told, liiaC 
when folicitcd to exhibit his preparations, !ic aUvayi 
declared the majority of them to have biicn diliroyed 
in a fire. What remain, 1 am inrtruftcd to add, dc-

finks our &quot; enthufiaft in an.itomy&quot; down to a frigid 
dabbler in the fcisncc ; while his &quot; noble prcpara-

to this fingle tranfai^ion. The following is a well- 
attefted ftory — Two gentlemen at Southampton, who 
felt an inclination to banter him, broke a nutfhell 
afqnder, filled the cavity with a large fwan-ihot, and 
clofed up the whole with glue fo nicely that no 
marks of reparation could be detcdcd. This curio- 
fity, as they were walking with St. Audi/, one oF- 
them pretended to pick up, admiring it as a niif 
ancommonly heavy as well as beautiful. Our hero 
fwallowed the bait, diflefted the fubjett, difcovercd 
the lead, but not the impofition, and then proceeded 
to account philofophically for fo ftrange a phjcnome- 
non. The merry -wags could fcarce reftrain their 
laughter, and foon quitted his company to enjoy the 
fuccefs of a ftratagem they had fo adroitly pra&amp;ifed 
on his ignorance and culiibility. 

Were there any colour for fuppofing he bad pa- 
tronized the fraud relative to Mar^ Tofts, with defigft 
to ruin others of his profeflion (an infinuation to ht» 
difcredit, which the foregoing pamphlet had not fur- 
riflied), it was but jufl: that he Ihould fall by his 
own malevolence and treachery. From the imputa- 
tion of a fcheme refembling tiiat contrived by the 
Duke of Montagu, his want of equal wit will fufS&lt;cicntly abfolve him. .,

Indeed, if I may beliere Ibme fpecimens of his pri- 
vaK corrcfpondcnce, be was unacquainted with tbe

few trails are permitted to be fcarce for any other 
rcafon than becaiife they are worthlefs. 

It is next remarked by our apologifl, that St. An- 
dre&apos;s &quot; confidence,&amp;c. made him fuperior to all 
&quot; clamour ; and fo that people did but talk about 
&quot; him, he did not feem to care what they talked. 
•&apos; againft him.&quot; This is no more, in other language, 
than to declare that his impudence and vanity were 
well proportioned to each other, and that a bad cha- 
racter was to him as welcome as a good one. He 
did not, it feems, join in the Poet&apos;s prayer. 

Grant me an honeft fame, or grant mc none! 
but was of opinion, as his apologift likewife admits, 
that wealth was an ample counterbalance to the lofs 
of reputation. — That he might; evade accufation (as 
I have already oblerved) in one particular inllance, 
and therefore recover damages, is no proof of his 
innocence, that his general condudt would admit of 
defence, or that much of the manifold cenfure 
palTed upon him had no foundation. 

How Lord Pf/crioroH^/j happened to become his 
patron,&amp;c. may be accounted for without any great 
degree of credit to cither party. His lordfliip (as 
lord Orrery obfcrvcs) &apos;* in his private life and con- 
&apos;■ duft differed from mod men ;&quot; and, having often 
capricious dlfputes with the court, was furc to favour 
thofe who, like St. Andre, had been difmifled from 
its fervicc. Our hero&apos;s mufical talents, indeed, if 
they were fuch as they have been rcprcfented, might 
procure him acccfs to his lordfhip and many other

by his expulfion from court, he muft have felt his 
bufinefs on the decline. Indeed, I am told that he 
ftaid long enough in town to try the experiment. 
Marriage therefore might liavc been his dernier rtjort. 

The exaggerations of this impoflor&apos;s genetofity and 
accompliniments, which are next brought forward 
by his pancgyrill with no fmall degree of pomp, are 
fuch as we may fuppofe himfelf would have furnifti- 
ed, had he undertaken, like the Chevalier TayioTj to

cumftanccs collected for the purpofe of proving him 
to have been 

Grammalktts, rhetor, geometresy pi£}or, al&apos;tptiSf 

Augur, fchanohales, medicus, viagus, 
could only have been derived from thofe very flatter- 
ing tcftimonials to his merits which he was always 
ready to exhibit on the flighteft encouragement. 
Thofe who were content to admit fo partial an efti« 
mate of his abilities,&amp;c. found it neceffary to exprefa 
their belief that he could have beaten tlereuUs at 
quoits, played a better fiddle than Apollo, out-wit- 
ted Mercury, difarmed the God of IVar, and forged 
fuch cheniic thunders, that, compared with the pro- 
duce of our hero&apos;s laboratory, the bolts oi Jove 
were no louder than a pot-gun. So far was he from 
being deficient in commendation of his own talents, 
that he thought his very furniture might claim a 
proportionable extravagance of praife. He was pof- 
fefled of fome foreign tapeftry which he was proud 
on all occafions to difplay. But the eulogiums of

Mr. 5/. Andri&apos;s apologift obferves, that &quot; he can* 
*&apos; not be reckoned to have been ignorant of any 
*&apos; thing.&quot; But the contrary may juftly be fufpedted&apos;, 
and for no inconclufive reafon. I aver, that on 
whatever fubjeft he was haranguing, the moment he 
difcovered any of the company prefent underftood it 
as well 33 himfelf, he became filent, never choofing 
to dcfcanc on art or fcience but before people whom 
he fuppofed to be utter ftrangcrs to all their princi- 
ples. For this reafon, he would have entertained Sir 
Jojhua Reynolds with remarks on the genera and cul- 
tivation of plants, and talked to Linn(SUi about the 
outline and colouring of pJtSurcs. 

That he died poor (for fuch was really the cafe), 
ihould excite no aftoniihment. His fortune, like his 
good qualities, was chiefly in fuppoficion. Much of 
his wealth he had expended on buildings, which he 
never long inhabited, and afterwards fold to difad- 
vantage. His firft eflays in arcliitefture were made 
at Cbepflozv on the Severn, an eftate purchaUd by 
Lady Betty Molyneux Immedia&apos;cty after thj deatli of 
her hufband. In ftiort, our hero was a fugitive in- 
habitant of I&apos;everal counties, and never fettled till he 
reached Seuthampton ; for in no other place did he 
meet with that proportion of flattery which was need- 
ful to his happinefs, if not to his exiflence. — About 
a mile from hence he erefted the whimfical baby- 
houfe dignified by him with the title of BcU Vue, 
a receptacle every way inconvenient for the purpofea 
of a family. Being once afkcd if this was not a very

His dilbiirfcnicnrs to the poor might he iiropor- 
tioned to the real flate of his fortune ; but yet they 
were condudtcci with excefs of oftentatlon. He may 
be faid to have given ihillings away with more parade 
than many other men would have fhown in the dif-

names of every kind may be arranged according to ^ 
the feries of the letters. — Sufpedted characters, how- 
ever, often ftrive to redeem themfelvesby afll&apos;ftation 
of liberality. Few are more generous than opulent 
wantons toward their decline of lite, who thus at- 
tempt to recover that refpcdt which they are confci- 
ous of having forfeited by the mil&apos;deeds of their 
youth. The benefaiftions of fuch people may in ,

offences, having no Ibundation in a natural propen- 
fity to relieve the indigent, or indulge the heart in 
the nobleft luxury, that of doing good.

prefervcd no fplendid chullicion of his hero&apos;s wit, no

didheconfcfs? Why, what all the world concurred 
to believe, that he had been grofsly impofed on ; or 
perhaps that, out of two evils choofing the leaft, he 
allowed himfelf to be a fool, that he might efcape 
the imputation of having proved a knave. His ab- 
folution therefore was not obtained on the moft cre- 
ditable terms. He adds, however, on this emer- 
gency, a frelh proof of his difpofition to deceivt.

&quot; No wonder our church has been thronged with 
*&apos; fpeftatois, to the great hindrance of divine wor- 
** fliip, and annoyance of the parifliioncrs, when tho(e 
*&apos; crouds of irrevcrcnd perfons, which were ever 
*&apos; pouring in, came not there to join in prayer with 
** the reft of the congregation, but to worfliip their 
&quot; Popifli faint, and hug themfelves with the conceit 
&quot; of being alone in the fecret. 

&quot; But at laft the watch-word was blown, and the 
&quot; true intent of their coming difcovercd. Then was 
*&apos; it high time to complain to your l.ordfljip, when 
&quot; difturbances became fo frequent, and the peace of 
&quot; the church was fo manifeftly broken : that you, 
&quot; like another Mofes, commanded the tinftured abo- 
&quot; mination to be taken down, and no doubt but your 
** Lordftjip will call them to account who fet it up. 

&quot; When your Lordfliip ftiall examine, who is the 
&quot; painter, and of what principle ? how long he 
&quot; had been from the Court of RonUy before he painted 
&quot; that pifture ? and whether he brought no pi 
&quot; turc, or refemblance, of the Princtfs Soblejli ov 
&quot; with hira ? you will not repent of what you ha&apos; 
*&apos; doK.

*&apos; all their queries, which fecm Co weighty and for- 
** midable to the vulgar and ignorant. 

*&apos; Why Ihould it be removed ? may be anfwered 
*• by another queftion, What buiinefs had it there ? 
&quot; But as I fcorn fuch quibbling ways of reafoning, 
*&apos; I fliall anfwer them, becaufe it is unfit for that 
*&apos; facred place. If it is the Princefs Sobie^-Vs image, 
&apos;* it is facrilegious and traitcrous, and therefore ought 
*&apos; to be removed. If it is, as they fay, a choir of 
*&apos; heavenly angels at a pra£tice of muiick, playing 
*&apos; on earthly inftruments, it is impertinent and abfurd 
*• to the laft degree, and therefore ought to be re- 
*&apos; moved from a place where the utmoft decorum 
** fljould be kept. 

&quot; What hurt does it, fay they ? To which I an* 
*&apos; fwer, it hurted or difturbed the peace of the 
** church, and was fo far hurtful, as we were hin- 
&quot; dered or annoyed in our devotions ; it made a di- 
&quot; vilion in the parilh, and was fo fat hurtful, as ic 
&quot; tended to the breach of peace and good neigh- 
** bourhood ; and therefore I think it ought to be 
&quot; removed, fince, not to anfwer them with a qucf- 
*&apos; tion, but a common faying, it did hurt enough. 

&quot; Why (hould fo much money be thtown away ? 
•^&apos; Ay, there&apos;s the grievance ; but I {hall tell them, 
•• they may thank themfelves, it was the aft and

A tUc for ftielter over head.

Wind near S. E. a mackrel gale. 
Attended by a heavy rain j 
Wc try to deep, but try in vain. 
So fing a fong, and then begin 
To fcaft on bifcuii, beef, and gin. 

Al Purflett find three men of war. 
The Darjlty galley, GUraliar, 
And Tartar pink, and of this laft 
The pilot begg&apos;d of ui a caft 
To Gra&apos;vrftnd, which he greatly wanted, 
And readily by us wat granted. 
The grateful man, to make amends, 
Told how the oflicers and friends 
Of Englatd were by Spaniards treated. 
And lliamcful inHanccB repeated. 

While he thefe infults was deploring, 
Ilngarih, like Premier, fell to fnoring, 
But waking crj&apos;d, &quot; I dream&apos;d&quot; — and then 
Fall fall afleep, and fnor&apos;d again. 

The nii&gt;rn clear&apos;d up, and after five 
At port of Gravt/eHd we arrive, 
But found it hard to get on fhore ; 
Hii boat a young fon of a whore 
Had fix&apos;d jull at our landing- place. 
And fwore ue Aiould not o&apos;er it pafi ; 
Bur, fpite of all the rafcal&apos;s tricks. 
We made a (liift to land by fix, 
And up to Mrt. BramBU&apos;i go 
[A houfe that we Qiall better know], 
There get a barber for our wigi, 
Wadi liandi and faces, firetch our legs, 
Had loall and butter, and a pot 
Of coffee (our third breakfart) got s 
Then, paying what we had to pay,

PREPACK 



IT IS not the intention of the writer of this trifling 
work, to trefpafs on any one performance on the 
fubjedt of Hogarth. He defigns it merely as an addi- 
tion, or fupplement, to the other publications. It points 
out fome minutiae, which, added to the explanatory 
remarks of Mr. Walfole, Mr, Nichols, Mr. Gi/pw, and 
Dn ^rujler, will form a full and complete explana- 
tion of the moft confiderable of Mr. Hogarih&apos;i prints. 
The excellent pamphlet of Rouquet is transfufed by 
an indifferent tranflation into Dr. Trujler^s book. 
Some few of the prints are treated more fully in the 
following little work; which is liable, however, to 
mary objedtions, from the writer not being in pof- 

a 2 feflion

WE are tbld in Jofeph Gay^s poem, as well ai 
in &quot; The Harlot&apos;s Progrefs, or the Humours 

*&apos; of Drury-Lane which is a Key to the fix 

*« Prints lately publiflied by Mr. Hogarth,&apos;&apos; and 
printed in 1732 (an obfcene and paulrry producflion), 
that the procurefs here reprefented is Mother Bentky ; 
but Mr. Walpole and Mr. Nichols fay v is Mother 
Needham; and indeed in the fixth C&apos;cinto of the 
above poem we are told, that the old bawd who is 
there wringing her hands is Mother De/iiLy, whiclt 
is a figure very different from Ncaliains, whom an 
enraged populace prevented attaining the venerable

tells us^ in a note^ that the colonel&apos;s pimp is ^^ his 
•* trufty man John Gourlay^* wbofc attitude is -ex* 
preflSve of the girl&apos;s being a very delicate piece, 
which, by the bye, fhe is not reprefented to be in

innocence, and no doubt at her departure from home,

The charafter of the infamous Cbarires may be 
feen in the note to the 20th line of Tope&apos;s Third 
Moral Eflay. And as we cannot fuppofc the direc* 
tion of the goofe to have been written in this clergy^ 
man&apos;s houfe ; we may fuppofe it comes from fome 
good old woman in Torkjhirs — For Afjf Lqfin Cojin in 
Terns Street London ** ; nor is the infcription under 
the bell Icfs curious — Parfon^s Intter Buit Bear. 
The trunk has the initials of the young woman&apos;s 
name. \Vc arc to fuppofe this poor curat&apos;^ is fent 
up to town with a letter of recommendation to a 
bifnop, on the vacancv of fome living, and that his 
terrified al&apos;pect proceeds from the dread of appearing 
before lb great a perfon ; his having rode up with 
his gown and calVoek may be from his having but 
one coat, and that lb rufty, that he is billing to hide 
it witli the belt attire he can. I fear this realbn is

far-fetched ; but, however that may be, wc cannot 
but fympathize with the diftrefs this unfortunate 
divine muft experience, when a furly waggoner en- 
forces a rude payment from his little pittance for the 
earthen ware his half-ftarved horfe has thrown down. 
The Journal of a Poor Curate, which is in the Ap- 
pendix (No. 7.), is not inferred there for the pur- 
pofe of raifing the volume^ s f rice a Jhilling^ but as pof- 
feffing the power of awakening thofe feelings which 
cannot but arife in each mind at the fight of de- 
jected poverty. 

PLATE II. 

Pompey with his tea-kettle will never pafs unno* 
ticed, as Mr. ^irCs farcafm on the immortal adtor 
(the man after Shakfpeare^s own heart) will long 
contribute to dircd: many eyes to this darting and 
aghaft Moor of Hogarth^. This joke perhaps fat 
not fo uneafy on Mr. Gar rick (evident from his reta- 
liation) as the difpleafure gf his audience on account 
of his tramontane drefs. Mr. Hill, in his&apos; edition of 
the Atlor of 1755, p. 153, fubfcribes to Mr. Garrick*s 
merit in Othello in thefe words, &quot; I can remember, 
*&apos; that in the fcenes where the greap general is moft 
&quot; himfelf, none ever filled the ftage with more dig- 
^&apos; nity ; and that when be took leave of his occu- 
&quot; pation, 

* So much this fccne her black attendant fcar&apos;d, 
That ev&apos;n his woolly locks with horror flar&apos;d.

^f Fareivell the plumed Src9f,&amp;c. 

^&apos; none ever felt the fentiment more nobly. The 
f* honour of his profeffion, and th^ gfief at quitdng 
** it, were fo perfedtly exprefled together, that it was 
f^ impoffible to fay which moft expreffed the hcrQ.** 
Another gentleman (Mr. Wilks)^ equally convcrfant 
in the ftage, has the following words on Mr. Gar^ 
rick*s improprieties in ading : &quot; If he has his fiaults, 
** they are like fpots in the fun, hid beneath a blaze 
** of majcfty 5 an effulgence of beauty that afto- 
f* nifhes, while it dims all things liabje to cenf^re^ 
•* fo that they become imperceptible.&quot; 

The mafk on the toilet belongs to the miftrefs, a$ 
it appears again in the 5th plate. Some of the or- 
naments of this room are thus defcribed in the 2i(( 
page of Gays poem, 

Pourtray&apos;d beneath a Gourd here yonah fatc^

David, HKiy be, ihac Mcll ILickabout is playing b^r 
gan-il)Ois, while back her lover from the chamber is 
conveyed ; and Jc^ud&apos;^ n;ay apply either to Pomf&gt;€y^

or it may apply to the young gallant, who has no 
reafon to expeCl a very agrcjablc fate himfelf, if he

is not very expert in dealing down ftairs. From 9 
perufal of the lives of Dr. Clarke and Mr. Wool/ton^ 
\ cannot conjedoire why their portraits in particular 
ftould be hung up, uplefs indeed frpm thejr being 
at that time the fubjefts of general conyerfatiqo, 
and their portraits of courfe ferving as prnaipen^s to 
many rppms. Dr. Clarkcj indeed, publifhed ^n 
Eflay on Repentance; and Mr. Wooljlon^ An Apology 
for the Truth of the Chriftian Religion againft t^c 
Jews and Gentiles *. 

PLATE 

* In order to explain one part of DavitPs picture, it miy 
be proper to read the following vcrfcs from the fecond book 
oi Samuel^ viz. the 3dy 5thy 6ch, ych, 14th, and i6th verfes of 
the 6th chapter. 

3. And they fet the ark of God upon a new cart, and 
brought it out of the houfe oi Ahlnadah that v/as in Glheah: 
and Uzzab and Ahio the fons oi Abinadah drave the new cart. 

5. And David and all the houfc of y/r/u/ played before the 
Lord on all manner of inftrumcnts made of lir-wood, even on 
harps, and on pfalteries^ and on timbrels, and on cornets, and 
on cymbals, 

6. And when they came to Nachon^s threfliing-floor, Uzzab 
put forth hii hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it : 
for the oxen (hook it. 

7. And the anger of the Lord was kindled againft Uzzah .• 
and God fmote him there for his error ; and there he died 
by the ark of God. 

14. And David dancc^ before the Lord with all his might ; 
and David was girded with a linen ephod. 

16. And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of 
David^ Michal SauVs daughter looked through a wind&apos;;.v, and 
faw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and 
ihe defpifcd him in her heart. 

And in order to account for that very grum, and ill-tem- 
pered look of Jonah* s^ and more fully to comprvh&lt;?nd the 

different

PLATE III. 

Very little can be added to Dr. Tru/lcr^s explaiia- 
tion of this plate. Ronquet fays, &quot; fon logement eft 
^* tians une rue confaci^e a la debauche, un des re- 
** ceptaclcs les plus abondants en tout ce qu&apos;il y a 
•• dc bas et dc beborde dans cette grande ville.&quot; 
Additional inftances of her ppverty are viiible iiv the 
broken panes of the window, the bottle fcrying for 
a candleftick, the bafon for two different kinds of 
water, and in her having no tea-kettle. That Ihc is 
peftered with mice is evident, from the jumping joy 
of the cat. The cane in the condable&apos;s hand be- 
longs, no doubt, to this barlot-hunting juftice ; and the 

different p?»rt8 of thJit pii^iirc, it may be proper to quote the 
ift, 5ih, 6th, Sine! 8rh verfes of the 4th chapter of the book 
of Jonah^ premiling, that the Lord having commanded &apos;Jonah 
to go to Ninr&apos;veh and cry agalnft it, and to forewarn the 
wicVcd inl)al)ir.»nts of irs dcllrviJlion : in conlcqr.cncc it

Other 






C 7 3 

Other ornaments of this room are, a portrait of thte 
Virgin Mary^ and a pifture of Abraham facrificiog 
Ifaac. Sir John Gonfon is certainly going IQ facrificc 
Mifs Hackabcul ; fo far this pid:ure may apply, but 
Ihe has no hovering angel to proted: her, 

PLATE IV. 

The dangling effigy of Sir John in chains is 
fmoaking a pipe, a never failing joke with Hogarth } 
for not only the giants in Guildball, but the execu- 
tioner at Tyburn, nay, even Jupiter, and an angel in 
the church, mud have their pipes and tobacco. 

The pert primnefs of the dog (who feems as 
watchful after fomething as his maftcr is), the odd 
look of the woman leaning on her mallet, and the 
infernal faces of the keeper and his wife, can fcarce 
pafs unnoticed. 

PLATE V. 

To add to the confufion of this fcene, a pot li 
boiling over, which either cannot, or is not attended 
to, by the maid and niirfe. The mafk, and a fan, 
are juft taken out of the trunk. Is this to awaken 
a rcccrlledtion of her fcrmcr happy ftate when with 
the Jew ?

The RAKE&apos;S PROGRESS. 

iP L A T E I. 

Mr. Gilpin, in his Efay on Prints^ has favoured as 
v^itb a very excellent defcriptlon of this fet of prints; 
and from the judicious obfervations fcattered 
throughout that work on the fubjedt of Ho^arth^ wc 
have great reafon to regret his not having given ut 
a more exteniive and general crlticifm on his other 
plates. &quot; Mr. Gilpin&apos;s remarks are thofe of nice pene- 
tration ; the writer of this trifle extends not his rc- 
fearches further than the dull duty of pointing out 
little rnore than the minuti^ of each print, which, 
though well known to the profeffed admirers of this 
painter, may yet be pafled over unnoticed by others. 
The baize bag may denote the admirable figure be- 
hind the youth to be the attorney, and not the 
appraifer 2 if fo, we may prefume him to be one of 
thofe 

&quot; Who mifs not. morn, or evening prayer, 
** Unlefs indeed to cheat an heir.&quot; 

And Rou^uet fays he is &quot; un procurer 

** fe payant lui meme.&quot; The piifture over the chim* 
ney- piece is no bad difplay of HogartVs vis-comica. 
The old piece of furniture, on whidh the black cloth 
is placed, may probably have been taken as a diftrefs 
for rent from his tenants. The window appears to 
be patched with fomething which I cannot make 
out. The taylor fccrfis -very glad the old fellow is

From the fhoe-fgle not being faftened or $nii|ied, 
we may prefunie the old /ather was his own coblcr ; 
and the heinous, figure pf the cat makps one cry

is as curious and valuable as fome of the other lum* 
\&gt;CT ; and his remaining crutch is another inftance of 
his favingnefs ; for, having broke one, he makes a 
walking-ftick ferve in its fiead, rather than purchafe 
another. His very fpeilacle cafes (fans glafles) are 
prcferved ; and even in the contrivance of his can- 
dlefticks, he feems willing to prcferve the glimmer- 
ing bit to its laft fpark; and his fur cap has for many 
winters warmed hitn/ans fire -j-.

In this print the cofiee-houfe is placed direftly under

gentleman into cuftody)) it is placed at a confider* 
able diflance from the church ; but thefe minutiai

fying coronet, but the bed, the chandelier, the look- 
ing-glafs, the fide-board, the chairs, the footltool, 
and the very dogs. Rouquet and Urujler mention one 
of the lawyers as viewing with admiration the beauty 
of the edifice ; but it was referved for Mr. TValpole^s 
eye to difcover the blunders in the architecture* 

The nobleman is probably faying — that though the 
mortgage certainly takes off fo much from the eftate* 
^^^ei coYifidttj fir^ my hlood^l apd the thief in the 
tandle is cmblematick of the noblcmah^s efiiate being 
fun to wade by negligence. From Mr. Nicholses 
happy explanation of one of the pictures in this 
apartment, we have to regret his not proceeding in 
the fame clear and pleafing manner with the others, 
as well as with that of Neptune on the cicling ; — 
there arc, no doubt, covert allufions in each of them.

not have thok faithful and feeling qualities for the

to fweat an efiate.

From the candles in the chandelier being almoU 

all burnt to the focket, Hogarth may infinuate, that 

the hymeneal torch or candle is very near, if not 

quite, extinguiflied ; and by the piAure over the . 

chimney-piece, of Cupid playing on the bag-pipes, 

and the pillars or columns of fome edifice tumbling 

to pieces, as well as from his bow being unftrung, 

he may hint, that, from their love being unftrung, 

the harmony of their houfe or edifice is tumbling to 

pieces : but I am diiTatisfied with this explanation, 

and wilh pauch to fee another. The heterogeneous 

mixture of ornaments round the clock, as well as 

thofe ftrangc and frightful ones on the chimney-piece, 

arc a ftrong fatire and ridicule on the rage for fuch 

diahlcries at the time when thefe prints firft came out. 

The difpofition of the pictures in placing two of the 

Apoftles, and the Virgin Mary, near one which is 

very properly concealed, ftrongly indicates his lord- 

{hip&apos;s principles^ I am at a lofs to make out what 

the Virgin Mary has in her hand ; and who is repre-* 

fcnted behind the chandelier with a dagger in his 

hand. The flcepy yawn of the fervant, with no hat 

G 2 upon 



C 44 3 

Upon bis bead (but rather a night-cap), ungariend^ 
and down-gyved to bis ancle, makes him very inat&lt;« 
tentive to the candle on one of the tea-tables, which 
has fet fire to the back of a chair, ^vhile he has been 
taking a (landing nap on another ; and I hope the 
lines which I have fubjoined as a note will not be 
deemed improperly defcriptive of a very difgufting 
objtft at entering many parlours *, and which is 
very vifible in this, 

PLATE III. 

As four differing explanations have been given of 
this print, I will hazard a fifth ; or it is rather indeed 
(in part) a coincidence with Mr. NickoL^s, as I fhould 
be extremely loath, and very cautious, in difiering 
from that gentleman. 

Wc may fuppofe his lordfliip has communicated 
the infcdlion to the girl, and that he is now faying 
to Monf. de la nilulj, ** Were thcfe the pills, 
&quot; you dirty rafcal, that were to cure the girl ? yo\i

Go when yon will, this lirilc fnarlcr 
Reigns the curd tyrant ot the pailour. 
No overtures ot peace can plcalc him ; 
Your forc&apos;d civilities but teazc him. 
TrelVnt your hand, he bites your knuckle*? ; 
Put forth your toor, he fnups yonr bucklci?.

ing her back to the congregation* One cannot but 
Tegret that want of expreflion which is unavoidable 
in many of the fmall faces : had the plates been 
larger, he might h^ve exhibited an admirable group; 
and .even thefe which are vifible differ fo much as 
to be different faces in the various impreffions. The 
fct of thefe plates which Sayer publilhed (at lealt 
this fecond plate) has many faces in it much fuperior 

to thofe in the fet which Mrs. //tfjf^r/Z&gt;has printed. 
In the fecond plate by Sayer, the two women fining 
under the young hdy are indeed admirable, as well 
as the clerk; and there are feveral other faces in 
Sayer*s impreffion well worth looking at, particularly 
a Iharp-looking gentleman in the fecond pew below • 
the two women behind his feat, a man&apos;s face in the 
ifle, wh&apos;o is the very laft but one, and a hiclancholy- 
•looking woman two rows before him ; nor can the 
inattention of a gentleman in the gallery near to the 
pillar, nor the two clergymen, be overlooked. Mifs, 
perhaps, is thinking more of a hufband than of the 
f^falms.

The MARCH to FINCHLEY. 

The explanation of this print, by Mr- Bonncl 
77)ornton, precludes every other attempt : I fliall 
therefore only add a few lines *. We are told, by 
Mr. Nichols^ that Hogarth acknowledged three por- 
traits, that of the pye*man, the fifer, and the chim^ 
ney-fweep; and Mr. Nichols further tells us, that 
the poftriait of Jacob Henriques is difcoverable, though 
he has not pointed it out ; and that Lord Albemarle 
Bei&apos;tie (the prefident of the Cockpit) is difcovcred in 
the crowd round the bruifers ; his lordihip&apos;s eyes are 
much better in this print than in the other, which 
came out nine years after this. I am iiiformed by a 
gentleman, who, at the time when this 4&gt;rint firft 
came out, had an opportunity of feeing the guards 
march each day from St. Jameses to the Tower, that 
he then often remarked the features of the drummer 
among them, as well as the young grenadier, the 
ferjeant behind, the prim fliff officer, and that the 
drunken- foldier, with his bayonet in his hand, even 
then, had always a pleafant unthinking careleffnefs,

This * very admirable plate being fully explained 
by Trujler^ and in the poem which Mr. Nichols has 
inferted* in hk Work, render any additiohs unnecef- 
fary ; and the extreme drollery of many of the fi- 
gures cannot but be inftantly noticed. The fmiling 
and contented calmnefs of the barberfurgeon, the 
expreffion of the old gentleman who is affltded with 
the gravel as he is attempting to make water, the 
effigy carried in procefiion, the inimitable figure of a 
country fellow with a bald-pate, with that of his 
companion (before whom is a bottle of burgundy)^ 
the whole group behind them (with the left-handed 
fidler), as well as the fmart waggifli familiarity and 
delighted tranfport of merriment of the cobler (with 
his glafs of champagne), and the muddled, and a)- 
mod vomiting, barber, all confefs the hand of Ho^ 
garth. 

As thi^ country owed the prefervation of its con- 
flit ution to King William t Hogarth has given us hts 
portrait ; intimating, perhaps, by the galhes in it, 
that the bribery, the corruption, and the other modes 
of carrying op this election, are efifeftual means to 
dcftroy and mutilate the conftitution. King Hlliiamf

h9Defty, in taking that caution ^with ht3 dumpy paw,&gt;ybich will prevent him lofing any of thofe guineas 
which he has juft received for. his vote ; he admires 

^ the dodtrine of meum and fuum. His ftumpy chair,

For the Strollers^ from Memoirs of a Wit, in the 
Wcftminfter Magazine for 1774.&lt;^ As foon as we arrived at the place of pur defU- 
nation, we began to take a furvey of our theatre. 
It was a very commodious barn, only the light came 
in a little too much through the tiling, which, how- 
ever, was foon remedied by covering it on the out iide 
. with fome draw. A carpenter was ordered to put up 
fome boards, which, by the affiftance of a powerful 
imagination, we foon fancied bore ibme refemblance 
to pit, box, and gallery. The fcenes were our next 
care, which were fo well contrived as to ferve tragedy 
and comedy alike. — ^The truth is, we had but one fett. 
The wardrobe was pretty much like the fcenes; and 
the cloaths that did for Sir John Fu^/g^likewife fervcd 
for Majler Slender. Our orcheftra was occupied by 
two excellent performers on the violin, who had but 
pne eye betwixt them ; and our chandeliers were a 
couple of hoops drawn up by packthread, with clay 
fockets for the candles. So much for the houfe, and 
novv for the performers. 

Mr. RaJit was the hero. He was excellent in every 
thing ; he was Lear or Alexander^ Bobadil or Fribble ; 
his powers were as unbounded as excellent, and the 
Sock was as familiar to him as the Buikin : add to 
this, his name was always the frjl and largejl in the 
^ bill. The manager hin^felf was the next in confe- 
;:qucnce as a performer, but much m«re fp in every 

? 2 thing 



thing clfc. To him followed Mr. Da^er^ who wal 
what they term a very ufeful hand, becaufe he had \ 
good /wallow i that is, he cpuld undertake any part 
at the Ihorteft notice. Hp was a very little fellow, 
but, like moft other little fellows, had exceeding high 
notions ; he often lamented his figure, declaring, if 
he had been as tall as Mr. Ranfj he knew his abilities 
were much fuperior. The females were the ma- 
nager&apos;s wife and two daughters, Mrs. Ranty and Mn. 
Dapper y whofe merits were indifputable. Mrs. Dap* 
per was about five-and-twenty, tall, and inclining to 
be fat; (he had a good face, and wa; particularly 
fond of Icve parts. In a little time Ihe and \ grew 
very intimate, and fomething more fo than it was nc- 
ceffary her hulband fhould know. We always ufcd 
to walk into the fields to rehear ft together, when the 
mo^ tender fpecches were preferred. 

The firft week of our performing we had pretty 
good luck, and fhared five (hillings apiece. &apos;1 hisj 
as it was confidered extraordinary, put us all in fpirits; 
bun the fccond began to appear very indifferent ; the 
third was worfe; and the fourth threatened famipie. 
My good fortune wa$ fuch, that I wanted for nothing . 
and as 1 took care to live well, they were all n\y 
friends, particularly Mr. Dopper and his wife, who 
dined with me every day: indeed, I could not rcfule 
the gentleman on account of the lady, whom \ began 
to take a particular likirg to. They knew 1 had 
fupplies, but they knew not from what fource ; and 
I it

It wa^ matter of qo fmall mirth to think they grew 
Jealous who Ihould have the moft of my company, 
Mr. Rant ufed to fay, ^ Mr^ Ramble, I am furprized 
you aft fo much beneath your dignity to give that 
fellow, Dapper y fo much of your company ; he is an 
illiterate under-ftrapper, only capable of murdering 
good language ; he has not an attitude that is hu- 
man, not a move fuperior to a monkey, and he chews 
a fentence as a cow chews the cud ; the wretch is 
paft all bearing : — and then his wife—&apos; ^ O for 
ihame ! Mr. Rant, I beg you will not rail againft the 
ladies/ ^ Not I^ indeed, fir ^ I was going to ob* 
ferve, the woman has fome notion ; and if the puppy 
would but let me give her a leJfQn, flie might come 
on in a year or two, and — and — and do fomething.* 
I I^ad juft ;hat minute got a fine beef-fteak brought 
in by my landlord, which will account for that fmall 
hefitation iq K^r. R,ant*s fpeech. I knew the caufe, 
and aiked him to partake, which he was not back- 
ward in doing, ^ Pon my foul, &apos;tis a fine fteak ! but 
d — it, they have not the method pf cooking in the 
country, as they have in tpwp j one fteak at Dollys 
is worth fifty any where clfc ; fo clean^j fo neat, fo 
charming, it does one good ; it creates an appetite if 
pne has none, it gpes down with fuph a go^t : then a

I forgot to obferve, that my acquaintance who re- 
commended me to the manager did not come dow 
with us, being obliged to meet his father, who was 
cxpeftcd to ftay a month in town, about bufincfs; { 
which being difpatched, he arrived at the inftant | 
Mr. Rani concluded the above curious fpcech. He * 
was accompanied by a young lady, who came down 
to try her talents for the ftage, which Ihe (boo bai 
3n opportunity of doing. 

A boarding-fchool in the town had ordered tb 
play of Jane Shore, for the entertainment of the 
fcholars. The young lady who came down was to 
perform J/icia, and Mrs. Dapper, jfane Shore ; GU^er 
was Mr. Ranfs part, and Dumont mine. The even- 
ing came, the candles were lighted, and the per- 
formers drefled. By the bye, I fhould have menti- 
oned, that&apos; we had but three fwords in the compan^ ; 
two of them were rufted in the fcabbards, and th? 
third had none. 

The tragedy began ; and if murder be a princinil 
ingredient in tragedy, this was as tragical a one .-s 
any that ever was performed, or perhaps ever mav. 
&apos;Ihc conclufion, indeed, was rather comic ; for juft as 
the unfortunate heroine of the piece had finiflied hr: 
dying fpeech, and ftrerched her form in an elegan: 
manner on the cold earth; ill luck, or the devil o: 
fome other occult cauie, put it into the head of forr.c 
unlucky rogue, to cut the packthread by which ore 
of rhe chandeliers hung lufpcndcd; and one of rrc

fetters difiereptly (buAding;. woul(} com^pofe all to« 
gether one of the mod horrid fpe^qks the eyes, of 
thinking men can behold ! Yet hp^v much more 
terrifick is this dreadful fcene rendered by the beha* 
, viour of the men juft fcitting off for execution, who 
are madly drinking, or uttering the vileft ribaldry, 
and jeering others that are lefs impenitent, while the 
Ordinary buftles among them, and, fhifting from one 
to another, diibributes fcraps of good counfel to inat- 
tentive hearers ; and near him the Hangman, impa- 
tient to be gone, fwears at their delays I. 

At laft out they fet, and with them a torrent of 
mob burfts through the gate, among which are the 
idled of holiday-makers, fuch as &apos;prentices and jour- 
neymen of the meaneft trades ; and^, as t^e day is pub- 

^Q^Z licly 



licly announced a week before in the papers, al) the 
thieves and pick- pockets of both fexes now meet 
with that feciyrity which large mobs are a fafeguard 
to, fo that this becomes a jubilee diay for all offenders 
who dare not appear on any other, and this coni&apos;uCon 
refembles a free mart, where there is an amncfty for 
all outlaws* — To add to the rudenefs of the fccnc, 
two or three fwceps generally jnount the horfcs that 
draw the convids, whofe foofy afpeds and ludicrous 
geftures not a little affift in diverting thcif minds from 
the jiwful change they are about to make ; and thus 
the whole cavalpadc, inftead of impreffing thofe ex- 
emplary fcnfations on the minds of fpecftators which 
it is alone intended for, becomes an impious fpefla- 
cl&apos;e of laughter, riot, and difordcr. 

The way from Newgate to Tyburn now is one 
continued fair for whores, rogues, and the meancft 
rabble ; and there are none fo lewd, fo vile, or lb 
indigent, of cither fcx, but may find a paramour. 
Where the crowd is the thinned, the mob arc :h? 
&apos;rudcft; and dead dogs, cars, Sec. fly about, ^nd 2:7 
.deemed excellent padime; for i!:cy have ::o cncn;iL5

It is poffible (though barely fo) that a man of ez« 
traordinary holinefs, by anticipating the joys of hca* 
ven, might embrace a violent death in fuch raptures 
as would difpofe him to the finging of Pfalms ; but 
to require this cxcrcifc, or to expedt it from every 
wretch that comes to be hanged, is wild and abfurd, 
frightful, and impertinent ! During all this time 
there is a poffibility w a paroort arriving, and, in all 
the criminals opinions^ a great prpbability \ . this . fad 
clog hangs upon their iniqds till then: bodies hang^ 
and prevents their preparing themfelves for dieath (o 
well as they otherwife would. At length the Ordinary 
^nd ch&amp;£kecutioner, having both performed their 
different duties, with little ceremony, and equal pon-^ 
cern, feem tired, and glad it is over. This tragedy 
being ended, a freih fray arifes between the mob and 
the furgeons, about the property of dead bodies; and 
the morning amufement ends with broken heads, 
bloody nofes, and now and then the lofs of ir^ore 
Jives than die by the hajter !&quot;
