 FAST FOOD 
Big mac, small mac, burger and fries
Shove &apos;em in boxes all the same size
Easy on the mustard, heavy on the sauce
Double for the fat boy, eats like a horse.
Fry them patties and send &apos;em right through
Microwave oven going to fry me too
Can&apos;t lose my job by getting in a rage
Got to get my hands on that minimum wage.

Shove it in their faces, give &apos;em what they want
Got to make it fast, it&apos;s a Fast Food Restaurant.

Shake&apos;s full of plastic, meat&apos;s full of worms
Everything&apos;s zapped so you won&apos;t get germs
Water down the ketchup, easier to pour on
Pictures on the register in case you&apos;re a moron.
Keep your uniform clean, don&apos;t talk back
Blood down your shirt going to get you the sack
Sugar, grease, fats and starches
Fine to dine at the golden arches.

Shove it in their faces, give &apos;em what they want
Got to make it fast, it&apos;s a Fast Food Restaurant.

Baby thrown up, booth number 9
Wash it down, hose it down, happens all the time
Cigarettes in the coffee, contact lens in the tea
I&apos;d rather feed pigs than humanity.

Shove it in their faces, give &apos;em what they want
Got to make it fast, it&apos;s a Fast Food Restaurant.
