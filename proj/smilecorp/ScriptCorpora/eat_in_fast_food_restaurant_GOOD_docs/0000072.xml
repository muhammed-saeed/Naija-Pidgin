There are dozens of different low vision aids to help improve the lives
 of people with albinism. Each aid has its own advantages and limitations.
 To get the most from a low vision aid, it&apos;s important to see and understand
 what that device can and cannot do. Since different aids help with different
 tasks, the person with low vision will likely choose a mix of different
 low vision aids to accomplish all of his or her goals.

Tasks, goals, and technology change over time. Whether an individual
 has used low vision aids for years or just for a short time, the individual
 should periodically reevaluate the low vision aids he or she uses. This
 bulletin provides an overview of some of the most popular low vision aids
 in each task category, including magnifiers and microscopes for seeing
 things up close, telescopes for seeing things far away, non-optical devices,
 and strategies to improve one’s vision.

Glasses

Glasses cannot fix low vision. Eyeglasses are not considered a
 low vision device unless they have a high reading“add”or
 contrast enhancement tint, but they deserve special mention here since
 glasses ensure that the person&apos;s eyes see the clearest image possible
 and can easily focus at close distances. It is important for babies and
 young children with albinism to wear glasses to correct refractive error
 if they are nearsighted, farsighted, or have astigmatism. If a child with
 albinism who needs glasses doesn&apos;t wear them, that child may tire easily
 and quickly give up doing certain tasks, and may even affect their development.

Short viewing distances

Beginning in infancy, people with albinism instinctively hold things
 closer to their eyes to see them better. Up until the age of five or six,
 this technique sufficiently compensates for low vision because books for
 young children already feature large print, or they can sit closer to
 the TV. As a result of using this desire of moving closer to what needs
 to be seen, children this age generally do not need low vision aids. Looking
 closely at objects does not hurt the individual’s eyes, and this
 strategy continues throughout life.

Near vision aids

Dome magnifiers, reading glasses, hand-held and stand magnifiers,
 and microscopes are near vision aids that help people with albinism read,
 look at pictures, diagrams, and maps, and accomplish other tasks that
 require seeing small details up close.

 Dome magnifiers are one of the easiest aids to use and arguably the most
 important for those with albinism [Figure 1]. Despite their seemingly
 modest ability to magnify print (1.7 to 2.2 times), in combination with
 a short viewing distance many reading tasks can be easily accomplished
 even in the primary grades of school. These magnifiers are also
 known as bright field magnifiers, paper weight magnifiers, and Visolett
 magnifiers.

 Reading glasses help the user focus on text or other objects while holding
 the object close to the user&apos;s eyes. Reading glasses allow the widest
 field of view for reading compared to other aids. Hand-held and stand
 magnifiers [Figure 2] enlarge close-up images, allowing the user to see
 small print and images at greater distances from the user&apos;s eyes. There
 are many different styles and sizes of magnifiers useful for people with
 albinism.

Microscopes help people see smaller details than magnifiers produce. Microscopes
 enlarge close-up objects the same way telescopes enlarge far-away objects.
 Some telescopes and bioptic telescopes, designed for distance vision,
 also allow the user to refocus the scope for up-close use.

Distance vision aids

Telescopes can help people with low vision improve distance vision. Distance
 vision includes seeing a chalkboard in a classroom, seeing a menu board
 at a fast-food restaurant, or seeing the stage at a concert or the action
 at a sporting event. The two specifications that differentiate telescopes
 from one another are the magnification power and the field of view. Magnification
 power indicates how much larger an image appears through a telescope compared
 to how large it appears to the naked eye. Typical magnification powers
 for low vision telescopes range from 2x to 8x. When a person with 20/100
 vision uses a 4x telescope, that person theoretically sees an image 4
 times bigger than normal and, therefore, sees the same details a person
 with 20/25 vision sees. In general, the greater the magnification power
 of a telescope, the more fine detail the person with low vision will see
 using the telescope. However, as magnifying power increases, the field
 of view, or the size of the area enlarged by the telescope, generally
 decreases.

 One of the most common low vision aids is the hand-held telescope, also
 called a monocular [Figure 3]. Hand-held telescopes come in a wide variety
 of sizes, magnification powers and prices. Hand held telescopes work best
 to quickly view a distant object, such as reading a sign or locating an
 object. Clip-on telescopes allow the user to slip the telescope over his
 or her glasses for hands-free use [Figure 4]. The clip-on telescope works
 well for the person who needs to use the telescope for extended time periods,
 such as for watching TV, a movie, or a live stage performance. The user
 can remove the clip-on telescope and use it as a hand-held telescope for
 quick viewing tasks. 

A bioptic is a special pair of glasses with a telescope permanently mounted
 in the glasses&apos; lens. While looking straight ahead, a bioptic user sees
 a normal, unmagnified image through the glasses. Then by dipping one&apos;s
 head slightly, the bioptic user instantly sees a magnified image through
 the telescope. This&quot;bi-optical&quot;system allows the user to rapidly
 switch between a normal view and a magnified view without ever using his
 or her hands. In some areas, some people with low vision can use bioptics
 to drive. (See NOAH&apos;s&quot; Low Vision Driving &quot;bulletin for details.)
 A person with albinism can also use bioptics in the same situations he
 or she might use a hand-held telescope, such as seeing a classroom chalkboard.
 Hands-free use can help older students take notes in class more quickly
 and easily. Some bioptic users prefer telescopes in both eyes, while many
 users with albinism choose to have only one mounted telescope for their
 dominant eye.

 One of the most common and simplest bioptic designs is from Designs for
 Vision [Figure 5a]. The Designs for Vision bioptic uses a telescope that
 extends about 3/4 to 1-1/2 inches from the front of the glasses&apos; lens
 and is 1/2 to 1 inch wide. Designs for Vision offers both fixed focus
 telescopes in a black metal housing and slightly larger focusable telescopes
 in a black plastic housing. They also make a bioptic telescope with a
 clear plastic housing to improve the bioptic’s appearance.

To make using a bioptic more discreet, Edwards Optical created the BITA
 system [Figure 5b]. This bioptic uses telescopes that are only 1/2 to
 3/4 inches long and about as wide as a pencil. The telescopes also extend
 behind the glasses lens, instead of in front of it. The BITA design is
 much less noticeable than traditional bioptic designs, but the small telescopes
 also produce a smaller field of view.

Ocutech manufactures a bioptic system that mounts the telescope across
 the glasses&apos; bridge [Figure 5c]. This approach creates a wider field of
 view at higher magnification powers compared to conventional bioptic designs,
 plus offers a different appearance. Ocutech also manufactures an auto-focus
 bioptic, which automatically changes the focus as the user looks at different
 objects. The auto-focus bioptic is bulkier and more expensive than other
 bioptics.

Electronic aids

 When traditional optical low vision aids don&apos;t help accomplish a task,
 electronic aids might help. Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) systems help
 people who need greater magnification than reading glasses, magnifiers,
 and microscopes provide [Figure 6]. CCTV systems also allow the user to
 adjust the size, brightness, and contrast of the magnified image to best
 match the user&apos;s vision. The user can even read white letters on a black
 background to decrease glare. CCTV systems have historically been far
 more expensive and far less portable than other near vision aids. Newer
 CCTV designs, however, such as the MagniCam®, are now smaller, more
 versatile, more portable, and less expensive then previous CCTV systems.
 Other electronic aids help users see far away objects.

Computers and Software

Desktop and laptop computers have advanced the ability of those with
 albinism to learn, communicate, and follow their chosen careers. Monitors
 are available in various sizes to suit an individual’s magnification
 needs. 

Magnification can be changed in common software such as Microsoft Outlook,
 Excel, and Word. This can be done in a variety of ways such as directly
 changing it on the toolbar, or by going to the toolbar clicking on the“View”option. Another
 method that is to hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard and then turn
 the small wheel in the middle of the mouse away from you or towards you
 to change the print size on many word processing and HTML screens.
 
Specialized software is also available such as Zoomer, ZoomText,
 Kurzweil, or Big Shot. These have many advanced features such as
 magnification of specific areas on a page, or a split screen option.

Contrast enhancement aids

For people with albinism, bigger isn&apos;t always better. Increasing the
 contrast of text is often more effective than increasing the size of text.
 Black felt-tipped pens and dark lined paper can make writing easier for
 some people with low vision. #1 pencils (as opposed to traditional #2
 pencils) and bright-colored chalk can also help students with albinism.

Writing guides, which are templates with open areas where one writes,
 can help people write in straight lines, or with tasks like writing checks.
 Colored filters can make it easier to see certain colors. For example,
 a yellow filter can make light blue letters appear darker and easier to
 read. Lighting plays a major role in how well a person with low vision
 sees. Experimenting with different types and brightness of light, as well
 as the location of the light, can make tasks a lot easier. Keep in mind
 that too much light and too little light can both cause problems

Finding low vision aids

An optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in low vision evaluates
 the individual&apos;s vision, and then recommends specific aids based on the
 patient&apos;s needs and goals. Low vision clinics usually have a variety of
 aids on site to see and try as well as specialists trained to help the
 user get the most out of the new aid. Since everyone&apos;s vision and
 goals are different, it&apos;s important to try out as many aids as possible
 before choosing. Often, the newest or most expensive aid is not the best
 choice. If a low vision specialist only prescribes products from one manufacturer,
 the patient may want to visit another clinic featuring different products
 before buying an aid, especially when considering expensive aids, such
 as bioptics or CCTV systems.

There are catalog companies that sell some low vision aids, such as sunglasses,
 magnifiers, and hand-held telescopes. If the individual knows exactly
 what he or she needs, buying these products through a catalog may cost
 less than buying from a low vision specialist. Other aids, however, such
 as bioptics, require a custom fitting and prescription from an eye doctor.

The American Foundation for the Blind maintains a directory of U.S. low
 vision clinics. Call 1-800-AFB-LIND or visit www.afb.org for the list.
 State Vocational Rehabilitation offices or Blind Services Divisions can
 also help locate low vision clinics, and may even help find sources to
 help pay for low vision aids. In Canada, contact the CNIB at (416) 486-2500
 or www.cnib.ca to find a low vision clinic.

Low vision aids cannot fix albinism or any visual impairment the way
 glasses or contacts can fully correct vision for normally sighted people.
 However, finding the right low vision aids can help people with low vision
 get the most out of their vision and realize their personal goals and
 dreams.
