SEATTLE -- Flakey Jake&apos;s is using menu expansion and target marketing of couples with children to reposition itself as a fast-service family restaurant chain, president and chief executive Robert Luckey has disclosed.

This is the second time in three months that an official of a &quot;gourmet&quot; burger chain has sought to distance his concept from the pack. Statements by Chili&apos;s chief executive Norman Brinker and now Luckey are fueling industry speculation that the emerging segment is already approaching saturation in some markets.

On the job for about six months after a stint as Sambo&apos;s chairman, Luckey, ex-president of Chart House (now Diversifoods), is directing the rollout of numerous new menu items, including fish and chicken sandwiches, salad bars and an expanded dessert line. New items will be in all units by year&apos;s end, Luckey said.

Flakey&apos;s menu now consists of large burgers, small burgers (aimed at children and women), a children&apos;s meal (a small burger or hotdog, fries and a soda served on a Frisbee and priced at $1.95), taco salad, stuffed baked potatoes, steak sandwiches, chili, cookies, brownies, candy and ice cream. There are 22 toppings for burgers at a serve-yourself toppings bar.

&quot;To get the family business, you have to be able to satisfy not only the husbands but the women and children,&quot; Luckey said in a recent speech to New York security analysts. &quot;A $3.95 burger is too expensive for children and too big for women.&quot;

In an effort to improve Flakey Jake&apos;s price-value, Luckey said he slashed the price of a large burger to $3.55 from $3.95 and the price of a small burger to $2.95 from $3.55. Average per-person checks are $4.92.
 
New TV spots, scheduled to premiere in January in Seattle, where there are eight units, feature customers of all ages testifying to Flakey Jake&apos;s good-tasting food, large portions, fun atmosphere and friendly service.

Luckey&apos;s decision to have Flakey Jake&apos;s stand apart from other chains specializing in large burgers is contributing to the industry&apos;s growing questions about how many such restaurants can open without saturating the market. As numerous &quot;gourmet&quot; burger chains proceed with rapid unit expansion, some units in parts of the Southwest, particularly Texas, are reportedly experiencing soft traffic.

Flakey Jake&apos;s repositioning follows by several months Chili&apos;s decision to expand its menu and position itself in the opposite direction. Brinker recently said, &quot;We are a casual, sit-down restaurant. We are not a gourmet burger restaurant.&quot; Chili&apos;s has waitress service; Flakey Jake&apos;s does not.

Meanwhile Brinker, Luckey and others in the segment are closely following developments at fast-growing San Antonio-based Fuddruckers. Founder Phillip Romano is stepping down as head of that chain in January, and operations chief Douglas Wheeler recently moved to Flakey Jake&apos;s.

Luckey said the changes at Flakey Jake&apos;s will position the 24-unit chain between casual restaurants such as Bennigan&apos;s and Chili&apos;s and traditional fast feeders such as Wendy&apos;s, Burger King and McDonald&apos;s. He said he views Fuddruckers as Flakey Jake&apos;s chief competition.

In addition to attracting more families who make up 40% of the chain&apos;s customers, new menu items will help raise check averages, increase the frequency of customer visits, reduce the chain&apos;s dependence on red meat items, which now capture 55% of sales, and raise dinner sales, which now account for about 60% of total.

&quot;We&apos;re building for the nightpart,&quot; he declared, adding that the chain is stressing price-value, continuing to turn tables every 28 to 30 minutes and de-emphasizing the sale of alcoholic beverages, which now account for only 10% of total. Most Flakey Jake&apos;s units sell only beer and wine.

The addition of an expanded line of desserts and rolls baked on the premises, along with a separate ice cream bar with its own server and cashier, is helping raise check averages by 20^ in test units, according to chief financial officer J. J. Fitzsimmons. The ice cream bars are being rolled out because &quot;we needed a way to merchandise desserts away from the main line because customers won&apos;t go back,&quot; Luckey explained.

New menu items are being favorably received in test stores, Luckey reported. A breaded chicken fillet sandwich is having a &quot;significant impact&quot; and is capturing 5% of sales, he added. New nonbeef products may further reduce the chain&apos;s sales of red meat to 43% of total and help protect Flakey Jake&apos;s from any increase in wholesale beef prices. Of the chain&apos;s 32% costs for food, beverages and paper, only 10% is for beef.

flakey Jake&apos;s reported a net loss of $716,000 through Sept. 9 on revenues of $6.6 million. The loss, which was anticipated, was mostly due to general and administrative expenses and amortization of preopening costs.

Average unit sales are running between $1.8 million and $2 million.
