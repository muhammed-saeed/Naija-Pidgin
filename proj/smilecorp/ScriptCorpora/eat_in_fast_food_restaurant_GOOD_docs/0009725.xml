 Do you tip for take-out food?? What is the etiquette on this?? You order, they cook it, put it in a bag... Then, I&apos;m looking at the credit card receipt, there&apos;s the little&quot;tip&quot;line, and I always drop a couple bucks in there.
I didn&apos;t get a refill on the drink I never had, I didn&apos;t drop my fork and need the waiter to get me a new one, I didn&apos;t take any time away from the service of the waiters other tables... What am I tipping for? The take-out containers and bag? Are the cooks getting the tip, because really, they&apos;re the only ones who really did the work. Thoughts?

 Good question. I&apos;m also interested in what others think.

I only tip if I am picking up a large order (6+) and the amount depends on how helpful the staff is. If they help carry it out to my car and are vigilant about checking to include serving utensils, asking if I need ice, etc I will add $5-10.

I try to keep it simple and not over-think it, but I wouldn&apos;t expect everyone to feel obligated to fill out the blank line at the bottom of the receipt.

If it&apos;s a small order, I almost rarely do not.
