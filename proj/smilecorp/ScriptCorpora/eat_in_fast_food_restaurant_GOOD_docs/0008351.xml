		It’s easier than you think to 
 start doing unique magic
in your presentations! (see video 
 samples below)   
 
Now, for the first time you can learn the secrets of 
 professional magicians! 

 Long-time professional magician Reveals the Tricks of the 
 Trade. 

 If you’re serious 
 about creating a great impact on your audience while 
 becoming more memorable yourself you must consider magic as 
 one of your options 

 I’m Tom Antion and 
 I’m NOT a magician. I’m a speaker who has 
 strategically used magic tricks throughout my speaking 
 career to make points, spice up my speeches and get audience 
 involvement. 
 I’ve also used magic 
 to win over people who were forced to attend my 
 presentations and to guarantee my sessions were full when I 
 was speaking at an event where there were lots of 
 presentations going on at once (you look really great when 
 your session is standing room only and everyone else has 85% 
 empty seats). 

 Later I’m going to tell you about a gag I did 
 that had standing room only at my speech at 6:00 O’clock in 
 the morning, but before I do that…. 

 Let me make this 
 clear 

 This letter is not 
 about making you into a magician or entertainer. It’s about 
 teaching you a specific skill that can massively enhance 
 your speaking and training. 

 Let me make another 
 thing clear 

 I’m not talking 
 about performing a magic act that takes up lots of time 
 during your talks. I might only do one“illusion”during a 
 90 minute presentation. 

 Let me make one more 
 thing clear 

 You don’t have to be 
 highly skilled to use magic in your presentations.
I’ve had lots of people come up to me after a speech saying 
 how much they loved my illusion . . . when I know if a 
 professional magician had been in the audience they would be 
 getting sick because of the simplicity of my trick. 

 You see, when you 
 are not billed as a professional magician and when the trick 
 comes out of nowhere to illustrate a point, you are not held 
 to the level of scrutiny that a magician has to face. . . . 
 i.e., you can get away with murder and still be a big hit. 

 Anyone can do the run of the mill tricks and that’s the 
 problem. 

 I’m not trying to 
 pretend that I’m the first person who has thought about 
 using magic in a speech. Many people have done it and 
 they’ve used the same old overused tricks to the point that 
 just about everyone has seen them or knows how they’re done. 

 Steve Hart (the 
 professional magician I teamed up with for this project) and 
 I have carefully selected the illusions that you probably 
 have never seen before or even heard of. They’re just as 
 easy to do, but not all worn out.
And since neither one of us are slackers we came up with 52 of these illusions for you to pick from. 

Each illusion can be done with no sleight 
 of hand and just a tiny bit of practice. This is what sets 
 you apart from the run of the mill speakers who won’t invest 
 in their skills and practice. 
 
   
These are not the tricks you see every 
 low-level speaker using. You wouldn’t want them anyway. There 
 is nothing worse than doing an illusion and most people in the 
 audience have seen it already.

The crazy thing is that even if you don’t 
 know what you’re doing, many of these illusions still work. Just follow Steve’s simple instructions and the tricks 
 virtually work themselves ….this leaves you time to practice 
 what you say while the trick is in progress.

 Did you know… 

...the tricky part of the trick is 
 usually completed in the first few seconds? The rest of the 
 time while the trick“appears”to be in motion you are making 
 your speech points and saying things that add to the mystique 
 of the trick. 

Steve gives you sample material to say 
 with each trick. You’ll immediately see how the trick is used 
 to make a certain kind of presentation point. In the magic 
 trade what you say while doing a magic trick is called . . .

 . . . Patter 

 The entire 
 reason to do magic tricks in a speech or workshop is to make 
 points, add interaction and make your speech and ideas 
 memorable. The magic trick helps to anchor what you 
 say in the minds of the participants.

A magician is there purely to entertain. 
 You are there to inform. Both speakers and professional 
 magicians talk while a trick is in progress. The difference is 
 as a speaker you say things that reinforce your points and 
 magicians try to say either mystical or funny lines.

Steve does a great job of giving you 
 sample“patter”so you’ll know exactly the kinds of points 
 that can be made with a particular trick. You can then easily 
 slant the patter to fit your exact points. . . . but don’t 
 think we are trying to stifle your creativity. . . Once you 
 see the tricks you will undoubtedly think up other points that 
 exactly suit your presentations.

 This DVD training set 
 for speakers, authors and trainers contains many of the 
 secrets that the pro magicians don’t want revealed…. 

Now we’re not doing anything illegal 
 here, but pro magicians are very secretive about their craft. 
 The reason it is OK for me to produce this DVD set is that you 
 are paying and you are a serious professional. Steve and I 
 aren’t wildly telling people all around the world how to do 
 the tricks in an effort to ruin them for other pros. You are 
 making an investment in your training and that’s usually OK 
 with professional magicians.…Hey you don’t want them to make 
 YOU disappear do you ? hahahaha Just to cover myself please 
 read the oath below and check the box.

 Oath 

 Check this box 
 to certify that you will not reveal these secrets to anyone 
 other than in discussions with other professional speakers, 
 trainers, authors who speak and other presenters.

 This is the most thorough and complete system for speakers to 
 learn magic…. 

So let me tell you about the tricks. . . 
 . Each DVD has the illusions listed on an easy to use menu. 
 You see the illusion performed and then you see the 
 explanation which includes some suggested Patter for you to 
 emulate.

 Almost all the 
 tricks have a&quot;Watch the video&quot;link next to them. Clicking it will show you the trick as Steve or I have 
 performed it on the video.

 DVD # 1 

 Welcome Performance Tips

 Note: You need the latest Flash 
 Player to play these videos. If you hear sound and don&apos;t see 
 the picture, visit http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/    

 
 Arrow Board -- Watch the 
 video 

 Effect: You are holding a board 
 with an arrow printed on it pointing up. When you turn the 
 board over there is another arrow pointing the same direction. 
 You continue to turn the board over and over showing the arrow 
 pointing up and suddenly like the magic the arrow points 
 itself in the opposite direction.

 Application: The arrow pictured in 
 the video is made to look like a graph chart. You can make 
 this yourself as it is explained in the video. You can use 
 this graph to address profit&amp;loss or productivity.

 

 
 Circle 2 Square -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You begin by holding a 
 round band of metal that looks like a large ring at your 
 finger-tips. Instantly it changes into a square frame of 
 metal.

 Application: It is impossible to 
 push a round peg into a square hole, unless you know the 
 secret. Another application is stating“I am not going to beat 
 around the bush with you, but rather I am going to be 
 square!”
 

 
 What’s Next? -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: A card with a spot on it 
 is turned over to show four spots on the other side but when 
 it is turned over again you see what looks like three spots 
 have appeared on the first side. Now when the card is turned 
 over again it appears to have six spots. While performing this 
 trick your audience will begin to be suspicious by the way you 
 are holding your hand. Once it is all explained how you have 
 created this illusion the spots begin to appear on their own 
 just like magic.

 Application: This card could be 
 used as a test of observation, a vision test, or presented as 
 a puzzle. After you have performed the trick you begin to 
 explain how the illusion is created and suddenly what appeared 
 as an illusion becomes real. The spots do multiply on the 
 card.
 

 
 Map Trick -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: A large map is unfolded 
 and shown in full view. It is folded back up and at the sound 
 of a magic word it is unfolded again and this time something 
 has magically appeared on the map. It is a huge black arrow 
 is pointing to a giant X marking the spot for direction.

 Application: Maps are designed to 
 give us direction. This map trick is an excellent way to 
 illustrate the importance to getting details in our direction 
 and how effective it can be. Once you know where you are going 
 you can get there faster. Define what you want where you want 
 to go and presto you are there!
 

 
 Coal 2 Diamond -- Watch the 
 video 

 Effect: Held in you hand is a 
 piece of coal. As it is tossed back and forth in your hands 
 you finally squeeze it and it becomes a diamond.

 Application: The magic of 
 transformation when we fuel out thoughts and produce something 
 of great value.
 

 
 Needle thru Balloon -- Watch the video 

 Effect: A balloon is inflated and 
 tied off. You would think a giant needle would burst the 
 balloon but when you push it through the balloon it does not 
 pop! Instead you can see the needle passing through the 
 balloon just like magic.

 Application: When we become 
 inspired and excited it is easy for others to judge us and 
 want to pull us down. They will want to burst your bubble. But 
 when the needle passes through the balloon it does not give 
 into to their sharp comments and stays pumped up and inspired.
 

 
 Silk Production (Big Money) -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You show your hands empty 
 as you pull sleeves up and then immediately out of your hands 
 a large silk handkerchief printed as a hundred-dollar bill.

 Application: People are motivated 
 by money. Whenever you want to talk making money or the 
 benefits of money you can produce this large hundred-dollar 
 bill just like magic!
 

 
 Poke Vanish -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: Any silk handkerchief or 
 one seen here that looks like a hundred dollar bill is pushed 
 into your fist. The last of it is poked into your fist with a 
 pencil. Instantly the handkerchief vanishes.

 Application: This effect can 
 easily illustrate how easy it is to lose something or how 
 money can disappear.
 

 
 Butterfly Silk -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: Four different colored 
 silk handkerchiefs are placed inside a bag along with another 
 silk with a drawing of a caterpillar on it. Instantly they all 
 transform into a large 36”silk with a beautiful butterfly 
 printed on it.

 Application: Caterpillars are hard 
 workers but hard work is not enough to stay ahead in today’s 
 world. It takes an investment of self-improvement and the 
 learning of new skills. When you do this it transforms you 
 into a more than a hard worker. You become a valuable asset to 
 the company.
 

 
 Target Silk -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: Four silk handkerchiefs of 
 different colors are placed inside an empty bag. Instantly 
 they change into a large 36”silk scarf with a target printed 
 on it.

 Application: Each silk represents 
 a step in hitting your goal or target. The first one is to 
 identify your goal, secondly your position yourself, thirdly 
 you take action, and last you follow up to get results. When 
 you do all four you will always be able to hit your target and 
 reach your goal.
 

 
 Six Card Force -- Watch the video 

 Effect: Six jumbo cards are in 
 front of the audience facing away showing only the backs. You 
 have an audience member state a number between one and six. 
 You eliminate the other five cards and reveal that the one 
 left is the predicted card.

 Application:  Results can be 
 predicted. How? Once we implement the correct action steps 
 needed, the results are almost impossible to miss. This effect 
 could also be used as a test to measure if the audience has 
 intuitively understood the lessons taught. The predicted card 
 would have printed on it your message.

 

 
 Rope thru Neck -- Watch the video 

 Effect: A long piece of rope is 
 wrapped around your neck and then instantly it appears to pull 
 through your neck.

 Application: It is important that 
 we stick our necks out and make commitments to get things 
 done. Are we willing to take the risk and make a commitment?
 

 
 One Handed Knot -- Watch the video 

 Effect: A long piece of rope is 
 openly displayed without any knots but instantly with one hand 
 you flip the rope and a knot appears in it.

 Application: Beware and be ready 
 when everything is running smooth some how somewhere a snag or 
 a knot will appear. The lesson is&quot;to be prepared.&quot;
 

 
 Stiff Rope -- No video on this one 

 Effect: A large piece of rope is 
 coiled up in your hand but when it is stretched out between 
 both hands it become rigid. So rigid it is held by one hand 
 and yet it stays straight and though it was suspended in 
 mid-air.

 Application: It is important to 
 stay flexible. Even when a given situation wants to throw you 
 off and make thing difficult, you can relax and let go knowing 
 what you are capable to doing.
 

 
 3 Card Monte -- Watch the video 

 Effect: Three cards are shown. One 
 card in the middle is a high card and when the cards are 
 turned over it is the only card with a different colored back. 
 That high card is removed from the three and placed aside. The 
 other two are shown once again as the audience is asked to 
 remember what was the high card? When it is turned over the 
 card has changed to say“Success”or“You are a Winner!”

 Application: People don’t like to 
 gamble but we gamble everyday just by getting out of bed. 
 Everything we do has some risk to it. By creating expectation 
 for the best by committing ourselves to peak performance we 
 put the odds in our favor and turn up winners every time.
 

 
 Flash Bills -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: You are holding a dollar 
 bill at the tips of your fingers. You pull out a lighter and 
 hold it under the bill, instantly in a flash the bill burns up 
 leaving nothing.

 Application:  Now you see now you 
 don’t. Just like magic these bills will burn up so fast and 
 leave no ashes you wonder where all the money went.
 NOTE: This effect requires the use 
 of fire and you MUST be 18 years old to even think about 
 using this effect. We take no responsibility if you burn 
 your hand off.
  

 
 Multiplying Bills -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You are hold in you hands 
 three one-dollar bills. You square them up and count off three 
 bills and lay them aside but when you count what is left in 
 your hand you still have three one dollars. Again you repeat 
 the above action and again you still have three one-dollar 
 bills. You do this over and over to the astonishment of the 
 audience.

 Application: You can spend money 
 and still come out ahead if you spend it wisely. By making the 
 proper investments you can protect your savings.
 

 
 Torn&amp;Restored Bills -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You hold a large jumbo 
 bill in your hand. You tear away about one fourth of the bill 
 and another fourth until all four pieces are separated and 
 stack upon one another.

Those pieces are folded. Just like magic 
 when the pieces are unfolded the bill has been completely 
 restored.

 Application: From every dollar we 
 earn someone gets a portion of that bill and rightfully so. 
 But every payday we are able to create more money. Money is 
 like energy we spend it and generate more.     
 

 Quite an impressive 
 list so far wouldn’t you say? 

 Well you ain’t seen nothing yet. 

Steve 
 and I will show you where pro magicians get their props, we’ll 
 show you all the performance tips you need to know that have 
 nothing to do with the actual trick you’re doing, and we’ll 
 show you how to turn simple little known tricks into a 
 stunning illusions that will WOW! Your audiences.

 Plus 

You’ll get all the hilarious bloopers of 
 the making of these videos. You’ll crack up when you see us 
 doing take after take just to make sure the sound, lights and 
 Steve are all lined up properly . . . and you’ll see me and 
 the crew pull a goofy joke on Steve.

 the tricks:
  

 
 Habit -- Watch the 
 video

 of paper has the word“HABIT”printed on it in bold letters. 
 You tear it all up and it becomes magically restored with a 
 new HABIT.

 Application: The best 
 way of getting rid of bad habits are replace them with good 
 ones.
 

 
Fire from the Fingertip -- No video for this trick 

 Effect: No fire or 
 electricity needed to shoot sparks from your hand.

 Application:  This 
 could be used as a gag making it look as though you have 
 jolted by a short in the microphone. Or you touch some one and 
 comment how they have a an electric personality. 
 

 
 Color Changing Handkerchiefs -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You show two handkerchiefs tied 
 together. After a bit of joking around with the handkerchiefs 
 they completely change colors as you pull it through your 
 fist.

 Application: After quickly figuring out a puzzle or a 
 problem things can quickly change creating a whole new one.
 

 
 Spring Bills -- No video for this 
 trick 
 

 Effect: Out of your hands dollar bills 
 begin to spring forth one at a time until you have table 
 filled with them.

 Application: Money will come once you create the value 
 and the means to capitalize upon your ideas.

 

 
 Super Wallet -- Watch the 
 video 

 Effect: This wallet is designed to 
 switch items magically. You can change the pieces of a torn 
 bill into a restored bill. You can change the items in an 
 envelope by switching the envelopes. Or you can just make 
 money disappear by showing it full of bill and presto they are 
 gone.

 Application: This is a utility prop 
 that can be used for multiple effects and applications.
You may wish to illustrate how you can turn small bills (1’s&amp;5’s) into big bills (like 20’s or 100’s.)

 

 
No Tear, Torn&amp;Restored Newspaper -- Watch the video 

 Effect: Square 4 x 5 inch pieces of are 
 removed from your coat jacket one at a time. After several 
 pieces are stacked on top of one another in your hands they 
 instantly unfold to revealing that the Newspaper has 
 completely restored whole.

 Application: After removing the pieces of paper from 
 you pocket you read the articles as you point all the good 
 news covered in the articles. After collecting and reading 
 several you square them up in your hands and instantly the 
 pieces fall into a restored whole Newspaper.

 

 
Dream Bag -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: A shopping paper bag is shown 
 to be empty and yet you can reach into the bag and magically 
 pull out a large box that looks like a gift. But that is not 
 all . . . this same effect is repeated two more times from the 
 same bag stacking the boxes on top of each other.

 Application: Everyone has gifts hidden within him or 
 her. We look inside of ourselves and we don’t see them. Others 
 may see them as we use our gifts but it is not until we learn 
 how to identify what our gifts are that we can see them and 
 learn to capitalize upon them.
 

 
 Nuggets of Truth -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: A book is closed shut while held in 
 your hands, but as you begin to flip through the pages you 
 produce what looks like large gold nuggets bigger than your 
 fist. Not one, two or three, but six to a dozen.

 Application: Often we read or hear a thought that is 
 just like gold. As we search the world of knowledge it is 
 important to find and hang onto those gold nuggets of truth.
 

 
Bounce/No Bounce Balls -- Watch the video 

 Effect: A small black ball is bounced 
 upon a table several times, but suddenly it hits the table with 
 a thud as though it has lost its bounce.

 Application: People who are successful and enjoy 
 working at a peak performance behave differently than others. 
 No matter what happens they are ready to bounce back and move 
 on. But those who are not success minded and enjoy working at 
 a peak level will give up and lose the ability to bounce back 
 without help.

 

 
 Budget Cuts -- Watch the 
 video 

 Effect: Two-dollar bills are squared up 
 one on top of the other, and then they are cut in middle 
 making four even pieces. Yet when they unfold they both appear 
 to be solid.

 Application: Even when you go through budget cuts you 
 can still survive if you are making money.
 

 
 Super Bowl -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: Water is poured from a bowl 
 until it is empty. But within seconds more water appears as it 
 is also dumped out. Again this is repeated several times a 
 running gag.

 Application: Water is a required source for life. 
 Without it we will die. Knowledge is like water. Once we 
 consume it in time we want more and more. Knowledge is a 
 resource
 for new life, growth, and understanding. Finding its source is 
 the secret.

 
Super Powder -- Watch the video 
 
Effect: Water is poured into a cup. Instantly is appears 
 to vanish.

 Application: We must have resources for fresh new 
 ideas. Otherwise when the resources dry up we will be in 
 trouble.


 
 Premonition -- No video for this 
 trick 


 Effect: Playing cards have words printed on them such 
 as Wisdom, Experience, skill, Positive Mental Attitude and 
 flexible. These cards are all mixed up and thrown into a paper 
 sack. You ask anyone to reach in the sack and select a card. 
 The word they pull out matches your prediction.

 Application: All the words may represent and describe a 
 good worker, but your predicted word (and the one they chose) 
 is the key word to them all.

 More tricks to come below. For now check out some of these 
 FAQs :
 
 
 Frequently Asked Questions 

 Won’t I look hokey doing magic 
 tricks?
 Well, maybe you will, but I’ve seen some of the 
 biggest name speakers on the planet appropriately pop 
 magic tricks into their presentation and the audience 
 loved it. 

 What if I can’t do the tricks? 
If you can’t do these tricks it’s doubtful that you 
 could read this letter. We have specifically chosen 
 tricks that are little-known to the general public, but 
 fairly easy to perform. Most tricks will take you 
 fifteen minutes or so to perfect.…Some a little longer 
 and some are totally self-working and won’t take any 
 time at all. Note: I still recommend you practice 
 the trick right before you use it, so it will be really 
 fresh in your mind. 

 Do I have to 
 use sleight of hand? 
The tricks in this DVD set require absolutely NO sleight 
 of hand. 

 How much do the props cost? 
Many you can make yourself. Average is $10-$20 and a few 
 cost a couple hundred. For instance the bowling 
 ball/basketball/briefcase illusion can be made with a 
 flea market bowling ball and briefcase for maybe $5 and 
 another $5 for elastic and glue at a fabric store. The 
 same trick would cost a couple hundred dollars in a 
 magic store. 

 Can’t I just 
 go to the magic shop and have them teach me? 

 We do suggest 
 you visit magic shops. It’s lots of fun and you will see 
 many other tricks that are available. Even though you 
 can go there they will probably sell you individual 
 videos that cover just one trick (these are not cheap) and it’s 
 going to be geared toward magicians…not speakers. The 
 patter we mentioned above is totally different and is 
 totally geared toward speakers. 

 
 What if I mess up the trick? 

 Steve teaches 
 you some simple“outs”or a couple of things to say if 
 something goes wrong. In addition, if you set up the 
 tricks properly, the audience doesn’t know what’s going 
 to happen anyway which gives you an automatic“out”. 

 
 Can I carry these tricks on airplanes? 
There’s a saying in the magic business about“ Carrying 
 small, but playing big” . This refers to a trick that is 
 easy to transport because it is small yet has a great 
 big effect on the audience. Almost all the tricks are 
 easily carried on airplanes. Only a couple tricks like 
 the“bowling ball”trick mentioned above should be 
 shipped ahead or checked as baggage. There are only one or 
 two tricks that would be prohibited on an airplane 
 because they involve a cigarette lighter. 

 Do I have to master all of the 
 tricks? 
Absolutely not. You can pick and choose those that are 
 just right for you. You’ll have a large supply to pick 
 from in case you run into a situation further on in your 
 career that needs a different illusion. 

 Tom, won’t 
 everyone be doing these tricks now that you are selling 
 them? 
….you flatter me. Yes, I’m very well known in the 
 speaking business, but even if I sold 1000 of these DVD 
 sets, that’s not even a fraction of a percent of the 
 industry and with 52 tricks to pick from what is the 
 chance that someone else at your event will be doing the 
 same trick…. Very slim, I assure you. 
 

 Now back to the tricks: 


 
 Color Choice -- Watch the video 


 Effect: You know which color will be selected ahead of 
 time.

 Application: Based upon your passed experiences you can 
 make predictions of future outcomes.



 
 Hypnotized Handkerchief -- Watch the video 


 Effect: A cloth dinner napkin is rolled up and held at 
 the bottom with one hand. The other hand appears to hypnotize 
 the napkin as it becomes rigid and sways toward the movement 
 of you hand.

 Application: Learning the power of influence can help 
 you direct people and you both can get what you want.


 
Waltzing Matilda -- Watch 
 the video 


 Effect: A silk handkerchief is removed from your pocket 
 and instantly it begins to fly around you as though it has a 
 mind of it’s own. As you reach out to grab the handkerchief it 
 flies away.

 Application: When things appear to be out of control 
 you can re-focus and take action and get what you want.


 
Knot Puzzle -- No video for this trick 


 Effect: This is a challenge or a puzzle you can pose to 
 an audience member on stage. The idea is to grab the ends of 
 the rope and tie a knot in it without letting go. Believe it 
 or not it can be done.

 Application: When given a challenge it is first 
 important to believe there is solution. Then you use your 
 creativity to solve the problem.


 
2 Dollar Bill -- Watch the video 


 Effect: Two one-dollar bills are placed together and 
 folded into a small packet in plain view. When they are 
 unfolded they have transformed into a $2.00 dollar bill.

 Application: Sometimes it takes your money and other 
 people’s money to create your start up capital. Notice it is 
 only a starting point. No profits have been made yet. Don’t be 
 fooled to believe that two one-dollar bills if transformed 
 into a one $2.00 is making a profit.


 Close Up Magic 

You can do these tricks for fun when you are at a table during 
 a luncheon or banquet. You don’t necessarily have to make 
 points with these tricks. Just have fun with them at your 
 table or go table to table and you’ll have an entire room of 
 friends before you even take the stage.


 
Hankie 2 Egg -- Watch 
 the video 


 Effect: Slowly a handkerchief is pushed into your fist. 
 Instantly it is transformed into an egg.

 pushed through the bill but when it is opened you cannot see a 
 hole.

 Cool Ways to Give out 
 Business Cards 

Just about everyone exchanges business cards with the people 
 they meet. When the person you met gets back to their home or 
 office those cards normally get dumped in a pile never to be 
 seen again. . . . . NOT AFTER YOU’VE GIVEN IT TO THEM USING 
 THE FOLLOWING TRICKS 

 
Business Card Coincidence -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You spread a stack of your business cards out 
 and have someone select one.
 They pull it out and write their initials on it. Again you 
 spread the stack open and allow them to slide their card back 
 anywhere. You explain that before you began you had marked one 
 card with a question mark on it’s back. One by one you look 
 for that card. When you turn it over, that is the same card 
 they put their initials on.


 
Business Card Locator -- Watch the video 

 Effect: A deck of playing cards are shuffled and shown 
 to be completely mixed up. You then write a prediction on the 
 back of your business card and lay it on the table leaving the 
 prediction face down. The playing cards are spread open and 
 your helper slides the prediction card into the deck anywhere 
 he or she wishes. The cards are squared up as you turn the 
 deck over and have them remove the prediction card and read 
 it. Believe it or not, the two cards above and below your 
 business card are the exact same cards written as your 
 prediction.


 Guess what?
 
You could go to your local magic store to buy some of these tricks . The problem is that you might be able to learn the trick, 
 but you’ll have lots of trouble figuring out how the trick 
 actually works in a real life speech setting. AND the video 
 could cost you $20 to $75 for just one trick . . . . and 
 that’s even if they have a video on the tricks that are in 
 this DVD course.

That means trying to piece this course together at a magic 
 store would cost you from $1040 to $3900 and it 
 wouldn’t even be oriented for speakers.

 clubs, cruise ships, and to corporate boards rooms. Today he 
 specializes in sales training, product promotions and 
 motivational speaking and training.

In 1999 he started an on-line training program for those who

 training, and sales. Since then he as conducted over a dozen 
 3 day&amp;1 day seminars training on the subject of“Motivational Magic.”

 Tom 
 has been a comic entertainer, professional speaker and 
 speaker coach since 1988. He’s the author of the Wake‘em Up 
 Video Professional Speaking System . Besides having done 2500 
 paid speaking engagements around the world he has taught more 
 than 90 training sessions for the prestigious National 
 Speakers Association where he is the one who teaches other 
 professional speakers how to make their audiences say WOW!

Tom was the one asked by MSNBC to make an on air appearance 
 to critique President Bushes presentation skills. This is 
 ironic because some people say George’s entire presidency is 
 an illusion hahahaha.

Tom publishes the largest professional Internet speaking 
 magazine in the world. Great Speaking has over 
 85,000 subscribers in 80 countries.
 
 
 Competition is stiff. What are 
 you doing to make yourself more exciting and memorable on 
 stage? 

One thing I can tell you for 
 sure. More and more people are discovering the field of 
 professional speaking and the competition for the available 
 jobs is fierce. Your content alone is no longer enough to win 
 you a high percentage of speaking jobs.

The people that hire 
 speakers want dynamic experts who can deliver the goods when 
 it comes to content, but the people they hire better be 
 exciting and entertaining too or the audience will soon be 
 snoozing and / or complaining.…

 No 
 meeting planner is going to rehire or refer someone who bores 
 their audience. . .

Now, be honest with yourself. Do the majority of 
 attendees say WOW! after you speak or do they politely 
 acknowledge the job you did?

 Do you realize the importance 
 of the above paragraph? 

I speak at some of the top 
 events in the world where I can sell a ton at the back of the 
 room. . . . I’m talking about enormous amounts of money on the 
 line when I speak at one of these events. . . . Normally they 
 don’t have the same speakers back every time because they 
 don’t want the audience to get sick of the same lineup of 
 speakers and not attend the event.

I recently got a call from 
 the promoter of one of these events who said,“Tom, we’ve been 
 trying to find a way NOT to have you at our next event, but we 
 just can’t do it. You’re evaluations are through the roof. 
 Will you speak for us in April?”I did the event and had my 
 biggest day ever.

 That money would have been lost had I not WOW’d the crowd. 

 What if you’re a trainer? 

You’ve got a really tough 
 job too. You are with people for a much longer period of time 
 than a keynote speaker. You have to keep their attention maybe 
 all day. A few magic tricks during the day can really make you 
 more likable and lighten up an entire day or even multiple 
 days of training.

The other challenge you may 
 have is that you are seeing the same people over and over 
 again when training different topics. This DVD course has 
 enough material that you could go months without repeating the 
 same trick.

 No Guarantee 

 Don’t be surprised by 
 this. This is standard procedure in the magic industry. 
 You absolutely can&apos;t return magic tricks, videos, props, etc. 
 because once you know the trick, you got the value. If you 
 don’t believe me, call any magic shop in the world and ask 
 them what their return policy is on magic videos, tricks and 
 so forth. Every single one of them will tell you the only 
 returns accepted are for defective tapes, DVDs or props and 
 you can only trade it on the exact same video, DVD or trick.

I will be glad to certify 
 that every single thing written in the description above is in 
 this Magic4Speakers DVD system. If you buy the system and 
 challenge me on the above statement, I&apos;ll be glad to take the 
 time to point out where the item is. If I show you something 
 that you&apos;re challenging, you agree to pay me for my time. 
 How&apos;s that? Is that fair? But guess what. I don&apos;t want to do 
 that. I want you to study and apply the techniques and get the 
 success you deserve if you work at it.

 How much would you expect to pay for such a 
 comprehensive course? 

You saw above that you could 
 spend thousands of dollars piecing together a course like 
 this. I have done it. I used to buy every magic video I could 
 get my hands on and then I’d try to figure out how to apply 
 the trick to the speaking environment. This cost me a fortune 
 in time and money.

We expect the final retail 
 price for this course will be $697.00, but as a special 
 introductory Internet test if you order by Midnight , we are 
 offering it right now for only $596.00 (a savings of over 
 $100.00) and we&apos;ll finance it for you. Just $197.00 down and

 SUPER FAST ACTION 
 BONUS # 1 

Now it’s my turn to help you out. Order by the above deadline 
 and you’ll get a collection of 11 of my favorite magic 
 tricks and I’ll be the one showing you how to do them on DVD

You’ll see 
 the…

 
 Professor’s Nightmare Trick 
 -- Watch the video 

 Effect: Three ropes 
 are proven to be of different lengths. The ends are brought up 
 into your hands and instantly they all become the same length.

 Application: When people work together as a team they 
 are often seen equally. As a team you work together equally. 
 But we know it takes individuals who are all different to make 
 a team work.


 
 Bowling Ball–Accomplishing the Impossible 
 -- Watch the video 

 Effect: You approach a table holding a business 
 briefcase and set it on the table. When it is opened you reach 
 inside and produce a real bowling ball…or basketball…or 
 ladder.

 Application: It is important that you love what you do. 
 How much do you enjoy your work? This alone will determine 
 ability of your reaching your peak performance level. Be 
 thrilled about you work and have a ball! That is when you can 
 accomplish the impossible.



 
 My version of Spring Bills -- Watch the video 

 Effect: Dollar Bills instantly appear in your hands one 
 at a time, or in a fist full.

 Application: If you want to make big money and make it 
 fast, you can do so by making it your goal. The secret is to 
 know you resources and how to make a profit and multiply it.


 
 Cut&amp;Restored Rope Trick -- Watch the video 

 Effect: A long piece of rope is proven to be real. It 
 is then cut in half with a pair of scissors. It is then tied 
 together with a knot. Magically the knot is slid off the rope 
 leaving the rope restored.

 Application: It is my belief that we all have a 
 mind/body connection. You can try to separate the two, you can 
 even fake the connection (using a knot) but that connection has 
 to be real. That is why we practice a positive mental 
 attitude.

 
 My version of the“No Tear Newspaper”Trick 
 -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: Pieces of a newspaper are collected and squared 
 up into your hands. Instantly they become a whole newspaper.

 Application: Articles of information are important. 
 They support our strategy and plans of action. It is important 
 that you continue to collect information that will assist us 
 in our work and to know where our resources are for future 
 references.


 
 Expando Trick -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: A one-dollar bill is held by your fingertips, 
 instantly it changes in a flash into a large jumbo bill. . . . 
 Talk about making big money.


 
 Rock/Airborne Trick -- Watch 
 the Airborne video 
 
 Effect: In an attempt to clear your throat you reach for a 
 glass of water and a drinking glass.
As you pour the water out of the bottle you let go of the 
 drinking glass to make a gesture and magically the glass 
 suspends itself in mid air while the water flows from the 
 bottle.


 
 Mic Stand Trick Paper Bag -- Watch 
 the video 
Mic Stand Trick No Paper Bag 

 Effect: As soon as you notice that you are missing a 
 microphone stand. You pick up a paper bag and out of it you 
 produce a five-foot microphone stand. You can also pull it 
 from your pocket.


 
 Expanding Straw Trick -- Note: This 
 is the same trick as the mic stand trick just about except a 
 giant straw appears instead of a mic stand. 

 Effect: This very similar to the microphone stand 
 production. A large huge straw is removed from a paper bag.…Don’t you hate it when you go to a fast food restaurant and 
 they forget the straw? What kind of customer service is that?



 
 Devil’s Handkerchief -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: This is a prop that you can use to make things 
 disappear. This handkerchief is folded up and held by the four 
 corners in your hand. The item is dropped into the folds and 
 instantly the corners are dropped and that item appears to 
 have vanished.

 
 Plastic Cup Gag -- Watch 
 the video (note there is a 2 second delay after this 
 video starts.) 

 Effect: This is a gag bit that always takes people by 
 surprise. The illusion is that you crack you neck or elbow 
 with a loud cracking sound.–This is the gag Tom used to have 
 a standing room only crowd for his presentation at 6:00 AM. He 
 explains exactly how he did that on this DVD.

 
 Motorized Reel Handkerchief -- Watch 
 the video 

 Effect: One more gag. When you need to wipe the sweat 
 from your brow and you can’t find a handkerchief you make one 
 magically. The handkerchief actually flies across the stage into your 
 hands.

 Why would I give you my best tricks? 

I simply don’t need them that much anymore. I only spoke 8 
 times last year because I’m speaking at really big, major 
 events for a lot of money. The chances of us being on the same 
 program doing the same trick are virtually nil. And even if I 
 saw you do the trick I was planning on doing, I would simply 
 switch to something else….when you’ve done 3000 or so 
 speeches, you have plenty of material to pull from.…Anyway, 
 I’ll be thrilled if you WOW the crowd with something you 
 learned from me.
