Funding Your Adoption
 
 OVERVIEW THE MORIAH FUND FUNDRAISING IDEAS 
 Finances are often the largest obstacle for families when considering international adoption. Although the expenses can seem overwhelming, we have seen God provide financially countless times for families who faithfully seek to provide a loving home for one of His orphaned children.

It is important to begin the adoption experience with realistic expectations of the costs involved. We have highlighted many ideas that can help make financing your adoption a reality. We invite you to speak with an Inquiry Coordinator regarding any questions you may have about funding your adoption.

The following list provides other resources to investigate that may help fund an adoption:

 Employee Benefits 
Many employers provide benefits for their employees who adopt. These may include leave when a child arrives in the home, reimbursement of adoption expenses, or assistance with adoption information and referral services. Contact your human resources department to inquire about available benefits.

For help asking your employer for this benefit, visit: http://www.davethomasfoundation.org . Also read Elizabeth Mair’s article “How to Lobby Your Employer for Adoption Benefits” .

 Tax Credits 
The federal government Adoption Tax Credit offsets qualified adoption expenses making adoption possible for some families who could otherwise not afford it. This credit can be as much as $13,170. Contact your tax advisor or www.irs.gov for complete details.

Several states have also enacted tax credits for adoptive families. Some are restricted to those adopting from the state’s public system. Contact your state adoption unit for more information.

 Adoption Subsidies 
Children with special needs may qualify for an adoption subsidy to help parents pay for ongoing treatments. Adoption subsidy agreements must be negotiated with the placing agency before the child’s adoption is finalized. More information is available from the North American Council on Adoptable Children at http://www.nacac.org/adoptionsubsidy/adoptionsubsidy.html .

 Military Subsidies 
Active-duty personnel are reimbursed for one-time adoption costs up to $2,000 per child, whether adopting an infant, a waiting child, or a child from abroad.

 Adoption Grants and Loans 
A number of organizations offer adoption grants and/or low-cost loans. Some are limited to children with special characteristics, while others are available to any prospective parents who meet the organization’s criteria.

 Brittany’s Hope facilitates adoption of special needs, older, and sibling children by providing financial grants to qualifying families; actively seeks out healthy and happy families who can offer love and support to special needs children; raises public awareness of the need for healthy homes for special needs, older, and sibling children; and raises public awareness of the unique joys of parenting a special child. For more info visit http://www.brittanyshope.org .

 A Child Waits Foundation is a not-for-profit charitable foundation that has grants and low interest loans available to families who are adopting internationally. For more information or to apply, call (866) 999-2445 or visit http://www.achildwaits.org .

 Gift of Adoption Fund is the largest organization devoted to helping parents by reducing the prohibitive costs of adoption. Founded in 1996, Gift of Adoption awards grants to provide the last funds needed to complete the adoption process. Grants of up to $7,500 are awarded monthly to qualified applicants to remove prohibitive financial barriers and make possible the adoptions of some of the most vulnerable children in the U.S. and around the world. Eight gifts on average are awarded each month to qualified applicants based on demonstrated financial need, situational hardship, and home study approval. To apply for a grant, visit http://www.giftofadoption.org .

 Global Orphan Outreach exists to make it possible for families to adopt with the aid of grants. Global Orphan Outreach procures and submits grant applications on behalf of the prospective adoptive parents. This service is available for any family adopting internationally or domestically. For more information visit www.globalorphanoutreach.com .

 HelpUsAdopt.org is a financial assistance grant program that provides qualified couples and individuals with grants of up to $15,000 toward their adoption expenses. Grants will be awarded twice a year. For information visit www.helpusadopt.org .

 Parenthood for Me provides emotional support, educational tools, and financial support to those adopting. They aim to ease some of the financial burden bestowed on people who desperately want to be parents. They offer grants for adoption as well as infertility treatments. For more information visit www.parenthoodforme.org .

 Pathways for Little Feet is a not-for-profit organization that helps families adopt children through financial assistance. The organization’s Perpetual Family Fund provides no-interest loans to families who desire to adopt but find the initial costs prohibitive. As loans are repaid, new families receive them, allowing child after child to join loving families. For additional information about how this organization helps families in need of resources, visit www.pathwaysforlittlefeet.org .

 Tinina Q. Cade Foundation assists couples with the costs of fertility treatments and domestic adoption. For more information, visit www.cadefoundation.org .

 Tomorrow Is a Gift is a private, adoption resource website created by Barbara Burke, an adoptive parent to seven children. Burke has compiled an extensive list for prospective adoptive parents researching adoption grants and affording adoption. Visit the Burkes’ website at www.adoptionfamily.org and click on “Adoption Grants” on the homepage.

 Christian Organizations 
 The Cadman Foundation helps bring together orphaned children with married Christian couples who are starting or expanding their families. The foundation provides matching grants and fundraising assistance to offset the cost of international adoptions. For more information, download a grant application from http://cadmanfoundation.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Grant+Application .

 Lifesong for Orphans helps to remove the financial barriers to adoption through matching grants and interest-free loans. Matching grants are an innovative tool that encourages the adopting couple’s church family to financially and prayerfully support the adoption. Interest-free loans help overcome the initial “cash flow crunch” of adoption expenses by utilizing the federal tax credit. The loan can be repaid in manageable monthly or annual payments. Learn more at www.lifesongfororphans.org .

 Sea of Faces provides financial assistance grants to Christian couples adopting internationally. Grants are awarded at the end of every calendar quarter pending available funds. A $10 tax-deductible donation is requested to download the application. For initial qualification criteria and more information, visit www.seaoffaces.org .

 Show Hope awards financial grants to qualifying Christian families already in the process of adopting to help reduce the financial burden associated with adoption. For more information on the grant application process, visit www.showhope.org .

Again, you encourage supporters to make purchases through the coded link and your group receives a percentage of the sales. Your fundraiser could be for a specific time frame or may be ongoing throughout the year.
