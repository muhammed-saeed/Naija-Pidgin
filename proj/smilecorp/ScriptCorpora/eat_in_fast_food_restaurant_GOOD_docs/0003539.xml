Near 5 stars. They have freakin&apos; beer! What more could you ask for? Well, some decent tasting brownies would be nice, but maybe they dumped the blueberry recipe by now. Yeah, this place is great. The small size is nice here and its not too expensive, and plays documentaries and independent films you won&apos;t see anywhere else.

I asked a young male to help me. I was only customer. He answered in a rude way.And I had to ask him show manners and answer questions. At the candy/food stand. The female at the cashier area rude. She not volunteer to wait on female patrons. Had to ask her a question. She not volunteer to talk to customers. Not say much. When she did was rude.

Not a nice employee. I not see the movie. Called up to see how long a movie would be early afternoon playing at the movie cinema. The male said not sure. And would not specify. I had to ask him to do it. He yelled at me why. I told him I have to make plans. He told me the answer and got angry at me. I not see the movie at the movie cinema.

Easily the best theater in Raleigh. One of the most romantic and nostalgic atmospheres, with a usually a great selection of movies. Ticket pricing and concessions are great! They even have wine for those able to indulge!

This is one of those theaters that has genuine character. There&apos;s no stadium seating, but at the same time, this is no clinical movie theater where you feel like you&apos;re in a soundproof room with a big screen. It is a truly pleasant place to be and reminds you of all that is films and movies.

A charming theater! Especially good for dates or those people with a passion for films and the REAL cinematic atmosphere!

The Galaxy is a great place to see movies that you&apos;re not likely to see anywhere else. I also prefer this theater to any others in the area because it&apos;s small, has good sound and is just a pleasant place. It&apos;s nice when it shows the films that also show in the big cineplexes so that you can see them in a cozier environment. Great place!

Like the Colony and the Rialto, the Galaxy features indy and foreign films; however, the Galaxy also shows Bollywood flilcs, has six theaters, instead of two (Colony), or one (Rialto). Furthermore, those two &quot;competitors&quot; serve wine and beer (maybe the Rialto serves only beer), but neither has packs of Indian chips, nor samosas (served later in the day at the Galaxy).
My one complaint is the extreme darkness of the theaters before the previews begin. On several occasions, I&apos;ve crashed into support columns in the rear of the theaters when trying to get myself seated. Maybe it&apos;s my age (early cataracts?); however, I don&apos;t find such low visibility at other theaters.

This is one of the best indie theaters I&apos;ve ever been to. I used to go there a lot when I lived in Cary.

Galaxy has a friendly staff, cleaner theatre and much better than the Rialto in Raleigh, which is down right rude and will never see me or another dollar from my pocket ever!
