Two types of silverware pouches can be created in simple steps: square and diamond. Square may be made with a napkin of any size, including a paper napkin. Diamond is a bit more complicated and best with an over-sized linen napkin. Let&apos;s start simple, with the square.

Used by restaurants for years, choose the square design to add a touch of class to your everyday table:
 
1. Open the napkin fully.

2. Fold in half lengthwise, with the fold away from you. If your napkin is square, that is fine.

3. Take the top layer and fold it to meet the first fold. This will create the pouch for the silverware.

4. Turn the napkin over top-to-bottom, so that the fold is facing you.

5. Fold the napkin from the right, one-third. Fold again from the right, the remaining third.

Your napkin will now be facing you as it would beside a plate. Insert your silverware!

Upper-scale restaurants will use this diamond design with over-sized linens for a more chic look than the traditional square:

1. Open the napkin fully, and place with one point facing you.

2. Fold the top layer of the bottom point up to three-quarter the distance between the center of the napkin and the upper point. Turn napkin over left-to-right, so that the same point faces you.

3. Fold napkin into thirds from right and left. The outer points will overlap.

4. Fold the lower point up and tuck behind the outer points.

5. Turn napkin over left-to-right and fold the shorter point down to create a diamond with the upper point. Insert silverware.

Now, the mystery of silverware pouch napkin folding (gourmet origami) is completely unraveled! With these easy steps, you can set a gorgeous table to go with your gourmet meal!
