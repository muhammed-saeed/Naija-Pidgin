Evan was absolutely amazing. He was there every step of the way including our ceremony and for most of the pictures. He did a fabulous job at feeling our group friends and picking the best songs for the occasion. There was never a dull moment! He had all of the songs ready for the guests who requested songs. No matter how old or how new the song was, he had it.

Diana captured ALL of the special moments. She never missed a beat. I loved the fact that I went home thinking&quot;Gees, I never really saw Diana that much.&quot;, but when I looked at our pictures, that were posted just three days after our event, everything was there. She never got in our way or interfered with the moment.

After the wedding, one of our friends wanted a group shot of all of us on her camera. I did not think that Diana was able to get the shot, since the wedding was over and it happened so quickly. When I looked through our pictures, it was there! SO glad she was able to capture it, even after the night was over.

I feel so lucky to have found these two, and to feel confident that my guests went home happy and fulfilled.

Thank you so much Evan and Diana, you guys were sensational!

AMAZING PHOTOS! EXCELLENT DJ! Diana arrived at the Church early and popped in to take my getting ready pictures at the perfect time. In fact, she even sat and gave us a preview of the photos at the end of the reception. When we got home from our honeymoon less than a week after the wedding, the photo cds were already in our mailbox! That was faster than the marriage certificate! Diana&apos;s husband Evan was our DJ and they both spent a good amount of time with us taking portrait shots at the reception without being intrusive at all - plus they thought of great shots that we never thought of and are very happy to have now. They had the timing down great! Diana&apos;s pictures are phenomenal! She even got amazing shots of our 9-month old niece who was wiggling around the whole night! Diana literally captured every single highlight from the entire wedding - ceremony, reception and in-between! We are very happy that we chose El Folio as our photographer and DJ!!! As far as the music, we were also so thrilled and extremely comfortable. My husband and I don&apos;t normally dance, but we danced all night. Evan even made sure to time out songs that we dedicated to specific people. He had a great variety of music and kept everyone happy the whole night!

Evan and Diana were amazing people to work with. They really accommodated all my requests and then some. They made great suggestions for photo opts, and song choices. Diana was so easy going and had a keen eye for photos, and Evan had everybody on the dance floor the entire night. So many of our guests were so impressed with both Evan and Diana. I highly suggest Evan and Diana for whatever occasion you have.

Evan was able to keep the dancing going the entire night by reading the crowd. We got so many compliments after the wedding about how wonderful the music was and how impressed everyone was by his skill as well as professionalism. I also really appreciated him collaborating with our photographer and the wedding coordinator so we could get some of the larger group pictures. He was very helpful in making sure the entire night went on without any issues, which was more than we could have asked for. I would recommend El Folio Entertainment to anyone looking for a DJ for their wedding or any other event.

I used Evan and Diana for my dj and photography and I am so happy with both. Diana did a great job getting photos of everyone while also getting plenty of me and my husband.

Evan was awesome and my guests loved the music. Also, when my terrible wedding planner was over two hours late, Evan was there helping set up. I am so grateful for that.

Just in general, they are such an adorable couple. So adorable in fact that my 13 year old niece (not knowing they were married) told me that she thought the dj and the photographer should date!

Evan&amp;Diana were amazing from Day One! Their online form is thorough and so helpful. We had requested a lot of Spanish music, even some fairly obscure songs, and Evan got the exact versions of every song we wanted!
Our wedding was delayed almost an hour because of rain and Evan&amp;Diana were 100% accommodating to the changes and the music kept the dance floor crowded all night! We got our photos in less than two weeks and they were so much better than we could have imagined. We recommend them highly-- you would be so lucky to get them!

DJ Evan and his wife Diana were absolutely great to have at our wedding. Evan was always more than willing to help me out over the phone or meeting in person to discuss any questions I had. For the day of the wedding, Diana showed up at the hotel exactly when we asked to get some really nice pictures of the girls getting ready, and she traveled to the church early to capture some great moments of the guys. Her presence during the ceremony and reception was incredible because she took hundreds of incredible photos without disturbing anyone else&apos;s pictures. Her candid shots are simply amazing; they&apos;re our favorite. DJ Evan was also an awesome Master of Ceremonies. He was very professional, friendly, and easy to work with, even during the reception when he was very busy. If we are ever in need of a DJ or photographer again, we will definitely call this fantastic couple!

Evan was professional, reliable and an extremely good DJ. He read the crowd well and played one good song after another. Requests were handled extremely well and everyone had a good time. My 85 year old grandmother even got up and danced. He played older music that everyone loves (Build me up buttercup etc)and other hits like Bon Jovi, electric slide, Black eyed peas and so much more. He didn&apos;t talk very much, which was awesome because that can be quite intrusive an ruin the whole flow. I would HIGHLY recommend Evan&apos;s DJ services to any bride.

Evan was a great DJ for our wedding! He knew just the right things to say and played upbeat songs that kept our guests on the dance floor! He is very professional and flexible! He is all about customer service and is there to make your day special!

I&apos;m a wedding photographer and met Evan at an event we were both working. I&apos;ve seen many DJ&apos;s at work and liked Evan&apos;s performance and style the best (and that is compared to all the big and small companies in VT, NY and NH). When it came to hiring a DJ for my wedding I only had one name in mind; Evan was the only DJ I wanted to hire and the only one I called, and he didn&apos;t disappoint. Evan was on time, professional and flexible with our schedule. My wife and I highly recommend El Foli Entertainment. Our wedding was a huge success, and I believe that Evan’s MCing played a big roll in it.

Evan and Diana did an excellant job at our wedding. Due to some unfortunate circumstances only 25 of my 100 guests ended up being able to make it and I was so stressed out and down about this. But Evan and Diana made it a memorable day and I was so happy with his DJ service and am treasuring our photo album and photos of the day, they are so beautiful! I would recommend them to anyone, they are reasonably priced and provide above and beyond service!

We had a great experience using El Folio entertainment for our big day. He was very concienscous of our likes and dislikes, no play list, where to set up and when, etc. We had our wedding in Vermont but were living in Minnesota, so it was long distance. This you would think would make it more difficult but it actually was one of the easiest things we did. The online planner really helped and everything turned out great. I dance all night long. Best day of my life!

We loved using the DJ and photography services provided by El Folio Entertainment for our wedding. We thought the cost was extremely reasonable, and the end product was outstanding. Thanks to the DJ&apos;s responsiveness to our music selctions, all of our guest enjoyed an evening filled with fun and dancing. As for our photographs, they were simple perfect!

My husband and I were married in December 2008. We hired El Folio Enterainment to DJ our wedding reception and we were very happy with how everything went. Evan was very good at reading the crowd and deciding what music to play. For most of the reception we had a full dance floor of people having fun (young and old). Great DJ service, I would recommend El Folio for sure!

 FAQ for El Folio Entertainment&amp;Photography 
 What music genres are in your collection? 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, Acoustic, Big Band, Classic Rock, Classical, Country, Dance, Folk, Funk, Gospel, Hip Hop, Jazz, Motown, Oldies, Orchestra, Pop, Punk Rock, R&amp;B, Rock, Soul, Strings, Swing, World Do you have liability insurance? Yes Describe your DJ style: My attitude is a simple one... the stars of the show at a wedding reception are the bride and groom. Our signature style is very unobtrusive and strictly professional. Is there a limit to the amount of music that can be requested? Although I openly take as many requests as I can, my primary objective at any wedding reception is to motivate all wedding guests to come have a good time on the dancefloor and make the experience with the music as interactive as possible. Sometimes that can mean omitting certain requests which will &apos;kill&apos; the dancefloor mood. What is your usual attire? Tuxedo attire at all weddings. If you do not have one of the songs pre-requested by the client, do you require that they provide it? Absolutely not... so long as we have ample notice of the music selections that will be needed, we&apos;re happy to provide it. We&apos;ll also accomodate special requests and renditions as per what&apos;s indicated on your online planner. With a WIFI connection, we can also legally attain any songs needed on the fly. This is a rare occurrence, but when it&apos;s needed it&apos;s there. How many other DJs do you work with? I am the sole DJ in this company which is why our availability is extremely limited and exclusive. My wife, respectivley, is the only photographer in this company. Unlike other companies we compete with, our emphasis is to be good... not big. What is the minimum amount of time you will DJ for? Six hours is the standard wedding DJ package, but my wife Diana, the photographer, includes eight hours. Is the client able to meet the DJ before booking? Absolutely - a face-to-face encounter is the most accurate way to get a feel for the person you&apos;d be working with as well as get a feel for the person. This can be vital when selecting a DJ for your wedding reception. Can the client submit a do-not-play list? Standard with every event is an online worksheet that not only encompasses all of the usual musical selection and prompts but also a do-not-play list. We know that &apos;do-not-plays&apos; can be just as important, if not, more important than the &apos;do-plays&apos;. Do you bring your own equipment? Of course, AND backup equipment. The only thing that I require is a table and a GROUNDED power source within 20 feet of my setup. What (if any) special equipment, such as disco balls or lighting, is offered with your service? Special effects lighting is not only important for setting the scene for a romantic and fun dancefloor, but also plays an important part in making people feel less self-consious in coming out to the dancefloor, as usually the other lights are down.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
We typically use a self-contained starball (or discoball) as well as shifting color lights. We do not use fog machines, bubble machines or strobe lights for reasons of safety and fire code. How much time do you usually need to set up? Do you require that the site or client provide a table for you to set up on? I usually take about an hour to set up, but I always arrive two hours before the beginning startup time. No, we don&apos;t charge for setup time, We do require a table at the site. No picnic tables please. Six or eight foot tables with proper linens are ideal. Do you have a sign or banner that you use at events? Abolutely not. Your wedding photos and memories shouldn&apos;t be immortalized by the tacky and flashy banner which only unclassly traies to upstage your existing decorations. Although we will not flash banners, we WILL offer our business cards to those who ask. Do you usually emcee the event or talk between songs? I will emcee the event effectively to get people&apos;s attention when I need to, and it&apos;s a given that I&apos;ll be lining up the wedding party for introductions. You won&apos;t hear me, however, sounding like an idiot on the mic trying to be goofy, overbearing or cheesy. Like I said, the bride and groom are the stars of the show... I&apos;m just here to highlight the evening with entertainment. How would you motivate the crowd if no one is dancing? The role of music at a wedding reception is a living, breathing thing. There are times in which music plays the background (during cocktails and dinner when people prefer to mingle) but then when the dancefloor becomes the center focus, it becomes the time when the DJ needs to be most attentive. If people aren’t dancing to the song currently on, then the pace needs to be switched up for the next song.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
For example, if the floor is empty because the music’s to fast, I like to break out a slow song… that at least gets all the couples up to slow dance together. After that point, with all the couples on the floor, both young and old, I like to then break out a faster (not fast per se but fastER) song that spans the generations to see everyone’s enjoying themselves. What is your policy on taking breaks? If you require a meal break, do you require that the client provide your meal? I typically eat at the DJ table while everyone else eats so that there&apos;s no interruptions to service. Typically ALL vendors at a wedding, from DJs to photographers and videographers should be fed... they are NOT required, however, to have the expensive meals reserved for your guests. Inquire about vendor meals with your wedding venue. Do you book yourself for more than one event in a day? Never Never Never ... I see this done so often by so many other DJ companies and it irks me. In our case, the person you communicate with throughout the process is the DJ who will be AT your wedding. When you&apos;re
booked with us, the day belongs to you and you only - these events are too important to have a company be spread too thin. What is your overtime rate? $75/hr after the included hours Do you charge for travel expenses? If yes, how much do you charge? Travel expenses within all of Vermont are included in the quoted price. Certain parts of New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire are also included. Outside of these areas may require accrue an extra charge, but that depends highly on where
you&apos;ll be. What is the required deposit to secure your services? $200 down, deducted from your quoted price. All wedding events require a deposit, but the balance is NOT due until the day of the event. What primary photographic style do you identify with? Photojournalism, Traditional / Posed What do your packages include? Custom Graphic Design, Digital Files, High Resolution Images, Proof CD of All Images, Video Montage Do you have liability insurance? Yes Additional Advice El Folio Entertainment

When searching for your wedding DJ, keep these things in mind:

- The customer is always right... don’t let anybody tell you otherwise.
Planning for a wedding is a lot of work, and it can be a process that is lots of fun, or very difficult - depending on who works with you, versus against you. Don’t forget that this is YOUR day, and that YOU’RE the one paying for the services. Don’t let any DJ service (or other vendor for that matter) disagree with you in the creative aspect of your planning.

For example, if you wanted to hear a song from the eighties that may seem obscure or out of the ordinary (but you want it all the same), don’t let the DJ reject that request or laugh in your face. A good wedding DJ is open-minded, and although he’ll offer recommendations, he’ll NEVER force something down your throat nor will he ever tell you “no”. To the same effect, feel free to put him to work for the amount of money you’re paying... give him a playlist if you want, give him a ‘do-not-play’ list if you want. Whatever DJ you choose, make sure that he/she respectfully acknowledges your needs and acts on them. Anything less should be considered a red flag.

- DJ has a comprehensive list of referrals
This is probably the most honest thing a DJ will do to earn your trust, because it relies on the testimony of former clients through e-mail or phone. Those former clients have openly volunteered to give insight to the quality of service, as well as business ethic. It&apos;s is VERY important to insist on referrals from your DJ service. El Folio Entertainment offers a long list of referrals on request.

- DJ does NOT play msuic exclusively off a laptop
There is no shame in a DJ using a laptop to retrieve and play a song that is hard to find and might not be so readily available. However, anybody that frequently uses a computer knows that they can freeze up and may require a reboot from time to time. This would create an unacceptable and annoying gap in the music service. Not to mention, MP3 files do not sound as good on a powered speaker system as the natural sound files on CD (keep in mind that MP3s are COMPRESSED audio files). Tracks on audio CD are in full quality. El Folio Entertainment keeps all genres of music readily available on CD, and uses a professional dual-CD player that plays CDs with a very powerful anti-skip, anti-stop mechanism that can read the scratchiest CDs.

- DJ is NOT on&quot;autopilot&quot;for most of the night
This happens too often, and it really bothers me. Imagine: you hooking your iPod up to the sound system and just have it randomly play with gaps between music throughout the night. That&apos;s pretty much the experience you&apos;d have with a DJ that cues up the music on his computer (or ironically even HIS iPod) to a random mix, while he just sits back and reads a magazine. Even if it&apos;s the sequence you&apos;ve asked for, or the music you&apos;ve asked for, your money pays for an attentive human being watching every component throughout the whole night, interacting with the crowd and adjusting. Anything less, and you might as well just be hooking up your iPod and setting the sequence yourself. El Folio Entertainment will never substitute a computer or iPod for a professional DJ (unless it&apos;s called for... i.e: during dinnertime or short excused restroom break).

- Confidence, not cockiness
As mentioned before, being a DJ is a job... not an ego. A good DJ is charismatic enough to speak lively to the crowd without having to sport a cartoony voice or sound goofy. A DJ has to have the capacity to pay attention to the needs of a crowd and adjust accordingly. El Folio Entertainment has prided itself on keeping up with the needs of audiences and adjusting on the spot to make sure the whole audience is engaged and entertained. It&apos;s our strict attitude that the bride and groom are the stars of the evening... not the person playing music.

- Wedding DJ vs. Club DJ
Do you know somebody who chose their DJ for their wedding because they saw him rock the house at a club? Be careful about who you choose, because a DJ who usually does mostly club work is usually not such a good wedding DJ. Clubs are meant to be upbeat and keep people dancing with the new music and club bangers; not to mention they&apos;re designed for people over 21. Weddings are meant to be sentimental and incorporate music from all generations so that everyone is happy and entertained. I&apos;ve heard horror stories about weddings who hired a DJ who works at the local nightclub and played nothing but rap music [the explicit edits if I may add]. Needless to say, neither of the families were quite impressed. In fact, the loud music made people leave and kept the dancefloor empty. El Folio Entertainment, on the other hand, incorporates music that is suitable for all generations at weddings. With a vast variety of music from generations ranging back to the forties, we make it a point to play music that will keep everyone entertained - even the kids. Weddings not only have the bouquet toss and the garter ceremony, but sometimes throwing in the YMCA or other favorites helps everyone have a better and more memorable time. El Folio Entertainment also works very closely with the bride and groom for pre-consultation, so every song that comes out of their speakers is tasteful and entertaining.

- A great amount of attention is paid to your wedding reception plans
El Folio Entertainment does a very limited number of wedding events per year. Consider it like being served a gourmet dinner in a fancy restaurant, each client as a diner, one of the few people lucky to be there. Then, put that against waiting in line at a fast food restaurant, waiting for your order to be thrown together as clumsily as the last one was. Think about the detail and service that&apos;s sacrificed between either example. We&apos;re serious when we say that the &apos;care factor&apos; is one of the most important things about being a good wedding entertainer - of course experience and professionalism is (and always will be) a must, but remember that can&apos;t be compromised with lack of human contact and communication. This can not be a&quot;conveyor-belt&quot;experience. The person on the other end of the phone is the person who will be Djing at your wedding, as it should be.

- DJ will consume NO alcohol at your event
As the organizer of your event, you have enough to worry about and coordinate aside from the DJ. Not only can an open bar can cost an arm and a leg at times, but it makes no sense for the DJ to rack up your bar bill. Also, to be a DJ is a job, and drinking on the job is not only unprofessional, but an intoxicated DJ can lead to a humiliating and unenjoyable experience.

- Overall, the price matches the experience
Find out from the referral list provided how the overall experience is, based on the experience of past clients. As another client, they can give you the most honest insight to how the DJ does business, how reasonably the price met the expectations of the client, and finally, how well the service was.

We won&apos;t tell you to choose our services. Instead, we&apos;ll educate you on what a good wedding DJ should be, so that you may be informed while choosing the right entertainment for your wedding… that&apos;s why many people come back and choose us in the end.
