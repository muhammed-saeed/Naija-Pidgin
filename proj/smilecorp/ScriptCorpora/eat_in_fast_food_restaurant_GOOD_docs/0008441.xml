Just a hot dog place
 
Upon entering you see handwritten signs of what they offer.
Appears disorganized. People taking orders don’t or won’t speak good English. Atmosphere is very lacking and unattended. Charge for drink refills.
Hot dogs, Sausages, Pizza Puffs,Beefs onion rings, fries, typical hot dog joint. Nothing to write home about.
 
Dishes I tried:
 
Hot Dog
 
 2.0 star rating           
 
Poor assembled hot dog, did not get what I ordered on it. Fries were cold.

CANT RECOMMEND
 
I have given this newer location many a chance, and every time I come up disappointed. The food is not as good, and the service is surly. I have actually had an order taker tell me how I needed to word my order so she could understand…
