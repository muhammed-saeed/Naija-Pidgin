A fantastic fusion of Icelandic and Indian cuisines, Saffran creates extremely tasty dishes that leave you wanting only for more.

I had the pleasure of ordering (and greedily consuming) the Vegetarian Safflat. The pizza-like dish was crispy and flaky at its base, and contained crisp vegetables topped with a small salad (on top) in a perfect proportion. The taste was incredible, and the sauce was fantastic.

The others in my party ordered various other dishes, and I got to sample a couple of tandoori dishes, along with another safflat. Brilliant, all of them.

The wait staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, and I got the feeling that they genuinely knew their stuff.

If you find yourself in Orlando, and want a taste of something different, this is your place.

While a healthy eatery in the vicinity of my office is certainly a welcome addition, I find that I can&apos;t get excited about Saffran.

Their menu spans a couple different influences - Greek, Indian, Italian - but feels incomplete. I&apos;ve had the Naan Burger, ordered a side of Naan and had lunchmates order sandwiches on Naan but both times I&apos;ve been there, the cashiers didn&apos;t seem to even know what Naan is, which is slightly bizarre to me.

The food is decent and filling but nothing to write home about. You definitely feel like you&apos;re eating consciously and fairly healthfully. I&apos;d like to see a pasta salad or some other side choice other than the barley risotto which is fairly tasteless. Desserts, too, are fair but nothing amazing.

The oddest part about this cafe is that apparently it&apos;s a big deal...in Iceland. Yet their food has no Icelandic influence. I was at least half-expecting some salty-licorice candies for dessert?

Went back to Saffran today.   The food was again very good!  The service this time was much improved - both in terms of taking our order at the register and the food delivery time.
I had the Tandoori Beef this time and it was delicious.   I also tried the onion soup... which was pretty much your standard french onion style soup... but they gave a large, generous portion for $2.50.    The naan bread was a little dry.  Not as good as naan I&apos;ve had at actual Indian restaurants.
I&apos;ll probably come back here.  Food is tasty... you get a decent portion... it&apos;s prepared in a healthy manner.  Price is a little high, but not ridiculous.

A magazine called Grapevine named Saffran the best restaurant in Iceland for two years in a row.  If so, If I ever make it to Iceland, it won&apos;t be for a culinary tour.

It&apos;s a casual counter-service restaurant in the Florida Mall area with some outdoor seating.  There are two wines offered:  red and white.  I ordered a glass of white; the waitress didn&apos;t know what kind it was, only that it was white.

The music featured some of Iceland&apos;s greatest musicians, like Kenny G.  I sat outside and waited for my wine -- white and too sweet.  No idea what it was.

An oddity about Saffran is that there is a small selection of Tandoori items and &quot;naanwiches.&quot;

With that said, I ordered a vegetarian &quot;safflat,&quot; which I guess is a Saffran flatbread, pizza-sized.  It turned out to be quite good.  They boast of their healthy, fresh and mostly locally-grown products, and I would say they delivered nicely.  Vegetarians take note: this is just about the only item for you on the menu.

This is the first Saffran restaurant outside Iceland.  If it&apos;s the best restaurant in Iceland, then it must be the best Icelandic/Indian restaurant in the world!

First off I want to state is that the food was good, but due to such terrible FOH staff I would never come back.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian and the sign up front said the soup of the day was vegetable soup.  When the server brought us our soup she was chewing food in her mouth and the soup was loaded with shrimp because the soup of the day was actually brazilian shrimp.  When I returned the soup the front cashier/server she asked if I had eaten the soup yet, which I had not and she asked so she could eat the soup in the back because later I had saw her come out to grab a spoon.  When the manager brought out the food, the pizza we ordered it had ham all over it so we had to return that also to be remade and the manager didn&apos;t once apologize for it.  Overall we had a terrible experience and the food is no way good enough for us to come back with bad service.

The Icelandic/Tandoori style is a bit confusing. But hey, when was the last time Iceland made a claim for ANYTHING, other than ice.  I especially like that they proudly state: VOTED BEST RESTARAUNT IN ICELAND 2010. OK. I wonder how many places were really competing for the title....

Anyways, this place is good.  Not great, but the flavors are very pleasing to my palette.  I had the kebaab naan, and its basically a simple wrap, with lettuce, kebaab meat, and two different sauces to dip it in.  One was your yogurt style, the other a spicy chilli.  Without these sauces, the dish would fallen flat on its Tandoori face.  The price was nice, about $6, BUT i was still hungry when i left. Bad sign. For around $10 the signature chicken dish looked and smelled awesome. Oh, and the flatbreads looked really good also.

I&apos;ll be back again. How can i say no to the best Restaraunt in all of Iceland?

Been wanting to try this place and I&apos;m so glad i did today! The food was very tasty and fresh! we had the PIRI PIRI chicken, Luxury nanwich,Chicken Hamburger and one of the salad and everything was delicious and it came in timely manner. The Cucumber, lemmon grass tea was delicious as well.

Loved this place, only reason it&apos;s not getting 5 stars Is because we wanted to eat outside since we have a baby and she can get pretty hyper at times so we didn&apos;t want to disturb anyone inside the restaurant, thus, we opted to eat outside but only to find pretty disgusting Dirty Tables :-/ Luckily we had baby wipes so we went ahead and cleaned up our area. Other than this incident everything was Great here. Just hope they can keep their Outside tables as clean as their bathroom!

I wil be back!

Gave Saffran another try for lunch today. Glad I did too.
The EXQUISITE SALAD was really a good and worth of the two stars  bump.

Great looking  dish served in their off kilter &quot;Alpine&quot; bowls that are actually kinda neat. Like putting your bowl on a table with 4&quot; shorter front legs so the bowl is more open to you as opposed to open to the ceiling. (Interesting eh?)

The 3 chicken &quot;filets&quot; came to the table v. warm in the bowl drizzled with this delish citrus- ginger dressing. This is good stuff now. The agave roasted pecans and sunflower seeds along with craisins  and blue cheese, really make the last 10 or more bites a come do it again dish!  I have to admit I&apos;m lost  trying to follow the &quot;agave roasted&quot; claim. Still the nuts are a good n&apos; sweet glazed addition. Really sets the  stage for the blue cheese!
Kudos to Saffran too that they don&apos;t skimp on this good stuff either. Plenty in the bowl to keep each bite adorned in the essence of EXQUISITE!

Only criticism was the greens are 96.573 % iceberg lettuce with just a few other healthier greens included to give it some more color; more so than nutritional substance.  Ah, what the hell, its a fu-fu salad for  heaven&apos;s sake! Those last 10 bites of exquisite YUMMM  make it worthy of the name.

I will confess it takes a lot  out of me to order a $9.54 salad sight unseen, so if I&apos;m ready to do it again, go with confidence, I believe you will be delighted with this one. Service was good - again and lunch crowd was  light.

One last thing. This can be sorta entertaining. Be sure to watch for it when you visit - if bored with your magazine and or dining alone.

When you place your order you will be handed what looks like an empty flower vase with your order number on it. I&apos;m amazed at how few people actually  figure out why this order number &quot;table flag&quot;  is designed this way?!

No one figguered&apos; it out for that matter which I observed while there. I almost think the Saffran help possibly doesn&apos;t realize it either!?
You should &quot;stack&quot; your drink glass that is provided at the register into it. This nesting is simply to make carrying the flag to the drink and silverware  table and then to your table easier.
(sorry I just have to vent) - would help if the cashier would just do it for ya  at the register when setting the glasses and order number thingy on the counter.

I would classify the cuisine as &quot;Indian-American Fusion.&quot;  With moderate prices and a vaguely industrial environment, it&apos;s kind of like an Indian &apos;Chipotle.&apos;  The food is very good, too!  Their safflats are almost like pizzas.  They are big enough to split with a friend or save half for lunch the next day.  For you health nuts out there, this is the place to go!  Their nutrition facts are easily accessible and they indicate common allergens in each dish right on the menu!

As someone who eats out frequently but also likes to eat healthy -- and notwithstanding my obsession with all things Iceland -- I eventually would have found this place on my own. But thankfully, an online half-off coupon soon after Saffran opened enticed me to come in quickly, and I&apos;m glad I did.

Saffran is exactly as advertised -- healthy and delicious. Only one entree on the menu is more than 600 calories (for context, a single Whopper is 670 calories, according to http://BK.com ), so I can eat here and not feel as though I blew my entire day&apos;s allotment of calories in one meal.

Even though the restaurant chain was founded in Iceland, thankfully you won&apos;t find any hákarl (fermented shark, an Icelandic delicacy) on the menu. Actually, the food at Saffran is based on tandoori, so many of the dishes include grilled chicken and vegetables.

Like many contemporary restaurants, the format is upscale-casual: Order at the counter, find a table and your meal is brought to you. There&apos;s an open kitchen, and the cooks are in plain view. The dining area is clean with modern IKEA-style furniture.

I&apos;ve eaten at Saffran several times, and I love the flatbread-pizza safflats so much, I haven&apos;t ordered anything else. My boyfriend always gets the piri-piri chicken (tandoori chicken over a bed of brown rice with a small side salad). The portions are extremely generous for the price: Entrees are about $10, the sandwiches and burgers about $6.

Now for the reason I didn&apos;t give Saffran five stars.

Saffran is located near the Fifth Circle of Hell, The Florida Mall. My level of hate for that area of town is raw and visceral. I haven&apos;t a clue why Saffran decided its first U.S. location would be in Orlando -- but not in the tourist corridor and not in an upscale area. To add insult to injury, Saffran&apos;s storefront faces away from the highway in the strip mall, so the restaurant cannot be seen from the road. It&apos;s not easily found.

In short: Extremely tasty, large portions, healthy fare, but points off for the location. I hope they consider moving when their lease is up. Still, the food is good enough to entice me back again and again, despite the heebie-jeebies I get when driving anywhere near The Florida Mall. So consider that a big endorsement.

I&apos;ve been here twice now, and have tried their flatbreads and one of their wraps.  I thought both were very flavorful.

The Saffran safflat has a great dressing on it, and the portion is large. I took some home, and it was still tasty the next day.

The service was pretty good, too. It wasn&apos;t very busy either time, and the cashier doubled as server. Everyone was very friendly, and stopped to chat at the tables that were occupied at least once or twice to check how folks were doing.

I&apos;ll definitely go back next time I&apos;m in the area.

Never knew healthy food could be so good. I always order the tandoori chicken that comes with wild rice and a yummy salad. I have never been disappointed with the food but the customer service could be a better. Relaxing atmosphere. Another little gem!

For my 200th review, I wanted to go somewhere special and what&apos;s more special than going to an Icelandic owned tandoori inspired restaurant! It was hard to get a read of Saffran from Scott Joseph&apos;s lackluster review and two wildly contrasting orange-heads on Yelp.

Saffran has a cool, open atmosphere. We ordered from the counter and picked a table for our group

The service was helpful and informative. The menu is a fun read with witty remarks and tidbits about the local ingredients. Saffran serves beer from Orlando Brewing Company which I think is a nice touch.

I decided to order the Kebab burger which was served on their &quot;Naan bread&quot;. It was actually pretty flavorful and has quite a kick of heat to it. We didn&apos;t have to wait too long for our food to arrive and we had cups of wasabi peas to keep us occupied. We all agreed that the pizzas, which are listed as a side but they&apos;re HUGE, were delicious!

I can definitely appreciate Saffran&apos;s efforts to remain local and healthy (their sodas are sweetened with Agave syrup) and I thought the food was pretty decent - a welcome improvement to the many chains in the area. The only obstacle keeping me away is it&apos;s location off Sand Lake - an out of the way area I rarely find myself in and the food isn&apos;t so stellar to inspire me to make the trek.

New restaurant located @ the corner of sand lake and OBT, hard to spot unless you wander around in the plaza..then you&apos;[ll see this place.

Inside is neat looking, cafeteria style, order at the counter, menu is pretty simple, they focus on healthy stuff. I ordered the Arabian chicken Naanwich, chicken tasted good, everything else was all right. Nice to stumble upon that place b/c of a friend, not something I&apos;d make a special trip to at this time.

Maybe I&apos;ll give it another try next time I drive by there. For now, it&apos;s average for me.

Eh.

Nothing spectacular about Saffran.

It&apos;s an interesting concept, as Cristina N stated - &quot;Icelandic owned tandoori inspired...&quot;

For me, entering the restaurant seemed like stepping into a cafeteria.  The counter where the food is prepared on one wall, and the seating just out there.  No special decor.  No special placements on the tables.  Pretty much find a place to sit.  It didn&apos;t feel very special.

You order at the counter first, and then they bring the food out to you.  I got the Luxury Naanwich - SAFFRAN chicken, Toscana ham, mozzarella, yogurt-garlic sauce, dash of chili sauce, mixed salad and Shiraz salad.  Sounds delicious.  Actually, it was pretty plain.  I was hoping for an explosion of flavor in my mouth when I first bit into it, but was left hanging when what I chewed was actually pretty bland, and cold.  Not cold like in the fridge for a while, just cold like it wasn&apos;t put together with heart.

I was pretty disappointed with my meal, but of course I finished it.  The yogurt sauce was pretty good, but didn&apos;t help the sandwich too much.  All in all, the food wasn&apos;t bad...just not as good as I was hoping.

A +1 for serving beer from our very own Orlando Brewing Co.  I didn&apos;t order one, though.  They didn&apos;t serve the one I like best - the Blackwater Porter :D

They also let you munch on wasabi peas while you wait.  But I wasn&apos;t a fan of them.

All in all, if your&apos;e in the area, try it for yourself.  Everyone has their own tastes.  But I personally wouldn&apos;t make a trip out to Saffran for any special reason.

I recently had the opportunity to try this restaurant based purely on a mistake. My girlfriend mistaken ordered a Groupon for this restaurant thinking it was another she wanted to try in that same general area. I am glad that fate made this error occur, as it gave us a chance to try a restaurant that we would never have found otherwise.

As I often do prior to a trip to any new restaurant, I perused the Yelp commentary.  The reviews left us less than enthused to go, but we felt morally obligated to use the coupon.  I think this restaurant suffers only from it&apos;s marketing as &quot;icelandic indian cuisine.&quot; I&apos;m not sure ANYONE could describe what that would taste like and therefore it scares people away. What should appeal to a larger audience though is their concept of no white sugar, no white flour, no MSG and all-natural ingredients (like agave nectar, etc). Marketing these strengths might serve them well.

To get to the food, we tried one of the flatbreads, the pirri pirri chicken (recommended by the staff) and a chicken burger for our entrees and the wild-berry mousse. EVERYTHING was fantastic. So much so, that we ordered another mousse on our way out the door. The flatbread was perfectly crispy with extremely fresh toppings. The pirri pirri came with a spicy sauce that was &quot;on the side&quot; for anyone who wanted to control the spiciness. And the chicken burger was juicy and messy, like all good burgers should be.  The restaurant was relatively unbusy the night we went (on a Monday), BUT all four groups that ate there that night clearly left happy, complimenting the staff as they left.

They also serve organic beers for those who like to pair beer with spicier food. We absolutely will go out of our way to eat here regularly.

There are times when we literally stumble into a place and it surprises the crap out of us. Here is a perfect example. On a recent Boba Tea craving mad dash to Chewy on Orange Blossom Trail, I could not help being overwhelmed by these &quot;Saffran&quot; signs. On the southwestern corner of Orange Blossom Trail and Sand Lake Road intersection and all around that plaza are signs for Saffran. What is Saffron? Ooops my bad, I meant Saffran. Not to be confused with Saffron Indian Cuisine on Restaurant Row. So after hurriedly acquiring my Boba Tea, the hunt was on....

At first glance from the outside, even though there are menu postings and signs it looked like a sit down, upscale, fancy place. The signage has cool colors and modern fonts which points to poshness. Not that the place is not posh. Well at least not fine dining. Venture in and you are transformed to clean, modern, contemporary lines and colors, warm woods, high ceilings, stained concrete floors, and gigantic sized wall art. Quick counter service? Really. Yes. Greeting you through the front door is a 3 terminal ordering counter, decked out with huge visible overhead menus and lower counter level printed menus . Sounds like a fast food joint? No! Definitely not. The look and feel is definitely not Burger King nor McDonalds. Order at the counter and someone will walk the food to your table or pack it to go.

So in my blind and giddy confusion the happy attendant walked me through the whole thing. Cool dude. He told me that the menu was Icelandic Indian Healthy Choices. Screeeeech! What? Say again....Easy gentle reader, the owners have successful restaurants in Iceland serving up inspirations from European and Mediterranean food culture, mixed with traditions from the Middle East. Here is the interesting part, Saffran offers healthy, fresh, exotic, robust, flavorful and inexpensively priced food to &quot;spice your soul and body&quot;. They choose only quality ingredients, preferably from local producers. All bread is baked using only barley, spelt and whole wheat. They use practically no sugar (only very limited in the desserts), no white flour, no frying, and no MSG. A tandoori oven provides high heat for searing all meats. Their version of the popular Indian flatbread naan is used in their sandwiches or &apos;naanwiches&apos; and burgers or &apos;un burgers&apos; as replacement for regular bread. Their signature &apos;Safflats&apos; or flatbread is made from a special crust and a wide variety of topping. When Saffran mentions locally sourced they actually take it a step further to sell only a white and red wine produced by our very own Lakeridge Winery. Orlando Brewing purveys all of their beer selection. I agree that this limits the beer and wine selection, but what a bold move on the owners part? Now that is farm to table!

On this occasion, still not so sure what to expect I settled on a Luxury Naanwich saffran chicken, Toscana ham, mozzarella, yogurt sauce, dash of chili sauce, mixed and shiraz salad. Oh my lovely, who said healthy tasted like card board? Well this was some banging card board! Outstandingly fresh meat, with bold, bright, brilliant flavors and moist, succulent texture. Greens were tender, crisp, and fresh. Since this was take out, the sauces were packed on the side. Adding a little of yogurt and tomato - chili sambal to each bite was a joy. Watch out though, the sambal has a good kick. Thankfully, I thought ahead and also got a Chocolate Mouse velvety mouse made from dark quality chocolate which was very decadent and cooled the sambal&apos;s heat. The portion size was just right to fill my stomach without feeling overstuffed. Did I fail to mention how fast this dish was prepared and delivered. Really fast.

Great healthy alternative to the Orlando Dining scene. Food, atmosphere, and service is spot on. Healthy and local food has found a place in Orlando.

I&apos;ve been here twice and I&apos;ve gotten the veggie/chickpea burger both times. I was very impressed with the spices in the burger.  If you&apos;ve had naan before at an Indian/Pakistani restaurant, you will probably be disappointed by the &quot;healthy naan&quot; here. It&apos;s basically a whole wheat pita. It&apos;s good, but not what I was expecting when I saw naan on the menu. Prices are pretty reasonable and the location is convenient if you&apos;re by Florida Mall.

This restaurant seems to be hitting all the marks for me.  I was on my lunch hour and going in and ordering at the counter allowed me to get place an order and get my drink and snack on the complimentary wasabi peas while I waited.

The chef makes your selections fresh so I don&apos;t mind waiting a couple of minutes to get fresh food.  We tried one of the safflat pizza, the kebab burger and we ordered the luxury wrap.

The pizza was huge and it was like getting a pizza and salad in one.  Ours had chicken, cream cheese, pine nuts and some lettuce.  I enjoyed all the textures and the cheese was creamy and rich.  The burger was popping with flavor and it came on a cute mini nan bun.    Everything was so filling, we could not eat the wrap so the staff offered to put it in a to go box along with the dipping sauces.  It held up well and I enjoyed it for lunch the next day.

One of the owners was there and he offered us a sample of the berry mousse.  He took the time to explain how it was made and even though I was full, we polished it off in no time.  This is definitely on my list for next time and the price is so reasonable it costs less than your standard ice cream cone.

The interior is clean and modern without seeming like your typical fast food restaurant.  Pictures of waterfalls make the atmosphere interesting and certainly reflect the owners heritage.  The staff was attentive and welcoming.

This restaurant has healthy food with Indian/Middle Eastern flavorings but is one of the most popular food chains in Iceland.  My husband is not the most adventerous of diners and he liked it as much as me.

They only have natural sugar for iced tea so if you use a dietary sweetener, bring your own.  They have some beers from local breweries and wine which looked good.

I can&apos;t wait to go back and I am so glad that we have this great option which is quick to get in and out of.  Plenty of convenient parking in this location.

My family and I love this place. Icelandic Indian? Not sure I understand the combo, but the food is fantastic. I also really like the teas, none sweetened w white sugar but all really tasty. I love the Tandoori chicken with piri piri sauce, my wife and teenage daughter split the Safflat (kind of like a flatbread W chicken and a small salad on top) and my little one gets the Super Power Chicken. Because it will give her super powers of course. ;) I am fairly gluten intolerant and Saffran&apos;s menu makes it clear what each dish contains, allergen wise. It&apos;s not a problem here to eat delicious food that&apos;s also gluten free.

It&apos;s not fast and it&apos;s not all that flavorful.  Stay away!  Better yet, go to one of the many genuine Indian restaurants that are nearby.

I ordered their signature &quot;tandoori&quot; Saffran chicken on a spear with red onions for lunch.

* It was rubbery chicken with no onions in sight on the plate. The texture had to come from steaming.  It wasn&apos;t anything like the texture tandoori cooking produces.

* The chicken was nearly flavorless --- dusting meat with paprika and salt does not count as tandoori seasoning.

* The &quot;mixed green salad&quot; was 98% iceberg lettuce with a few tiny sprigs of something darker green.  The brown bits didn&apos;t help its appeal.

* The brown rice was flavorless.  The texture reminded me a lot of minute rice.

* The spiced yogurt dipping sauce was overwhelmingly salty (and I =like= salty foods!).

All of this wonderfulness took 25 minutes to find its way to my table.  It was plopped on my table without a word of apology for the delay.

I won&apos;t be back.

History
 
 Established in 2009 

International Financier Jay Jamchi was brought to Iceland by his Icelandic wife in 2007. Jay loved to cook for friends and his special dish saffran chicken became a huge hit among his peers, so much so a chef friend of his, amazed at his abilities in the kitchen, recommended they open a restaurant together. After nearly one year of convincing, Jay finally agreed and the two partners, along with a brilliant young chef and a talented baker, set about designing a unique menu that was both true to their shared passion for food and their concern for the health and well being of their customers. The idea of healthy ingredients in secret recipes, with inspiration from the European and Mediterranean food culture mixed with traditions from the Middle East, created incredibly robust flavors... without white flour, without white sugar, without frying .... at prices no one can believe ... seems so simple... and it is ... simple genius!

The result was SAFFRAN and the rest is history.
