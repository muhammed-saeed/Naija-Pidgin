Tips for 5 O&apos;clock Club

 This is the first time I have ever written a restaurant review....the $39 for a bad steak took me over the edge! I&apos;ve lived in Wisconsin all my life and I love supper clubs. The atmosphere, the relish tray and a good old fashioned! I&apos;m on a bit of a quest to find the most amazing steaks I can in the Milwaukee area. I&apos;ve eaten at Dream Dance, Butch&apos;s, Eddie, Martini&apos;s and Carnevor. It was time for the Five O&apos; Clock. So myself and friend of mine ventured off....unfortunately we got he same results.

The atmosphere and service was great...the bar tenders were amazing! But the reason I came here was for the bone in rib-eye. To me it&apos;s an amazing cut and one of my favorites. If I am on a quest for an amazing steak it needs to be the same in all of the restaurants..right?

We had our order taken at the bar. I ordered my steak medium rare as I do with all my cuts of beef. We started off with a nice salad and some really good bread...then we waited, and it was a Saturday night and we waited some more. The anticipation of a good meal was building........

It arrived and right off bat I was looking at this steak sitting in a soup of jus...somewhat confused as I was used to steak in a very pure form...butter and salt and pepper. I thought ok...here we go, this is gonna be great. The sadness fell on me like a fat kid at a birthday party when he finds out there is no cake. It was burnt on the outside, over cooked on the inside and cut like leather. CRUSHED...was my only thought. I know they use charcoal grills but this was to much. The jus had actually taken on a burnt flavor as well and I suspect it was to hide the imperfections of my steak. So, I had a few bites and it never got any better....the waitress came to check on us and I told her it wasn&apos;t as good as I hoped for. She did try to correct it, but to wait another 20-25 minutes just wouldn&apos;t work. I had Polish beer to drink and live music to attend to.

My friend who had the porterhouse had the same results and opinion.

Would I go back.......if it&apos;s for an old fashioned yes....for steak absolutely NO! Folks take your appetites and wallets to other steak places, this is not the one.

So I ate it....$39 made me do it.

 It&apos;s about the food!. Atmosphere - supper club - old school - cool. 
A restaurant experience is about everything. Even to the small details. Knowing this would be old school supper club the atmosphere was fine. Let&apos;s get to the food.

Let me start by saying I have had more flavorful steak at Texas Roadhouse - and I can tell you the bill was 30% of what we paid at 5 O&apos;Clock.

You can tell the time and effort that goes into food by the attention to small details.

Salad - dressing was bleu cheese. Consistency watery ranch dressing with sparse crumbles of bleu cheese. I&apos;ve had much better at low end chain restaurants.

Butter - cold.

Bread barely luke warm.

French onion soup - was beef broth with a few onions and cheese melted over top.

Breadsticks - served in a water glass (really).

Steak - $39 for a rib eye ordered medium rare. It came out black and had a slight taste of burn (not char). I tapped it with my knife and fork and could already tell it was way over cooked for medium rare. The steak was&quot;eh&quot;. A good rib eye is marbled with fat and can be cut into like butter. Not here!

The only bright spot to the experience was the atmosphere and wait staff - the unfortunate part is that the reason we came was for the food. …

 Awful Management - Good Steaks. I would give it one star, but the steaks really are very good. I just can&apos;t bring myself to go back because of all of the other factors. The service is marginal. They are working hard for sure, but not very friendly. And I think it all stems from the management.

Don&apos;t support people that do business this way. There are plenty of great places to get steak in Milwaukee. This one should be avoided. …

 Classics Never Get Old. It has been quite a while since I have been able to visit this steakhouse. I am never disappointed when I come here. The consistancy is what makes the experience even better. I, nor any one I have brought to this steakhouse has ever left disappointed. I am surprised to even see one bad review on here.

The steaks are succulent, the staff is extremely helpful, and even the sweet woman Georgia who has alwways been there to greet me when I walk in adds to the memorable experience of dining at Five O&apos;Clock. I will be returning as often as I am in Milwaukee! …

 If I wanted your opinion I would give it to you!. Blessed Mother of 4...You dont get out much do you? The 5 OClock Club is not meant for a romantic experience. It is meant to replicate the days of old when old when bartenders would ask you to stay and have a cocktail and the waitresses had been around since the time of Jesus. Its meant to be a place that you can kick back relax and enjoy yourself (and yes wait for your food god forbid)

I have been to the Mo&apos;s, Sabor, Flemings and think those places rot. I havent had a great steak at any one of them and have been treated very poorly. Listen, I am a country club brat and the 5 OClock Club has some of the best steak I have ever had outside of the Argentinian Steakhouse in Cancun.

If you go in with realistic expectations that yes, the decor is old, its smaller and you wait for a good steak then you are all set. If you go in thinking you are better than everyone around you then you are certainly in the wrong place and they will treat you poorly.

Good luck finding a place that you are happy with. You sound like an evil wench! …
