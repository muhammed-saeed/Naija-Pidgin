When People Are Hungry They Eat Chicken
 February 13, 2011 by James Don · 
When the people of the world get hungry they eat chicken.  Chicken is the most eaten meat on the face of the earth and there some very good reasons for this.  Chicken is healthy and it is very tasty.

People normally won’t flock to a food simply for its health benefits but if it tastes good then a crowd will form.  Chicken delivers on great taste in a big way.  It can be cooked on the BBQ or in the deep fryer.  Its many recipes will also allow the bird to be baked, grilled, broiled, and stir fried.

There are so many recipes that are available for chicken that you can eat it every day for a few months and never have it the same way twice.

Most people will want a side dish with their meal of chicken.  A potato recipe will usually fit the bill perfectly.  And if you happen to have a taste for soup then a slow cooker potato soup will do just fine.

Chicken as a snack food has really taken off.  Today you can walk into any fast food restaurant on the planet and pick up a quick order of chicken nuggets.  Just about all restaurants have chicken fingers and wings on the menu.  Is it any wonder that we find ourselves nibbling on chicken at all times of the day and night?

When people find themselves under a doctor’s care they all normally hear the same advice that they should cut down on the consumption of red meat and replace it with chicken.  The reason for this is simple; chicken is a much healthier choice.

 When a meat contains large quantities of B vitamins and essential nutrients it can’t help but be good for you. 

Chicken is the type of meat that you can eat several times a week and feel good about it.  It tastes great and it is good for you.
