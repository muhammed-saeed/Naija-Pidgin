 Owling and planking are very similar. In owling you sort of perch like an owl by something for comedic effect. Planking is laying completely flat, like a plank of wood hence the name planking, also for comedic effect. Coning is completely different. Coning is when you go to a fast food restaurant and order ice cream in the drive-through, but when the person hands it to you instead of picking it up by the cone you pick it up the ice cream. Hope i helped.
