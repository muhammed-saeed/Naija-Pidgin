 ★★★☆☆ Not so fresh salads.... 
 Judith W. 3 Zaxby&apos;s 
 
Have purchased salads after 7:00 pm...not good. Sometimes there is too much water in the salad. I have twice purchased the Zensation Salad and have been sick all night. Could be the soggy egg rolls or the cole slaw might be sour? Don&apos;t know, it&apos;s hit or miss.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Found an Ant Grilled In my Food!!! 
 Jamie H. 1 Zaxby&apos;s 
 
I used to love Zaxby&apos;s...it is convenient and the food is good. All that changed tonight when I was eating my Kickin Chicken Sandwich and when I turned my bread over an ant was grilled onto my bread. It was disgusting!! After taking back my food and eventually getting a refund, I have contacted corporate, as I think this is unacceptable. I am also contacting the Health Department to do a visit, as after looking online, it seems as though the Suwanee location has not always gotten good inspection reports. Beware and look closely at your food!!

PROS: Loved the service, but totally turned off now!
CONS: Beware of ants!!

 ★★★★☆ Good Fast Food 
 Nicole A. | Insider Expert

My family enjoys eating at Zaxby&apos;s. It&apos;s a fast food restaurant but not your typical fast food fare. Chicken fingers and Buffalo wings are fresh and delicious, and the salads are fresh and served in real dinnerware instead of plastic. The food is cooked to order, so you will wait longer than a typical fast food restaurant. The drive-thru can also be quite a wait if they&apos;re crowded.

PROS: Fresh food, great salads
CONS: Wait can sometimes be lengthy

 ★★★☆☆ Good fast food.

It&apos;s not fancy; it&apos;s not gourmet (It&apos;s CHICKEN - fast food style). But you can do worse with fried chicken eateries. Their dipping sauce is tasty, and service is usually excellent. Try it for a break from the regular fast food fare.

 ★★★★☆ Great Salads 
Anonymous 4 Zaxby&apos;s 
 
I really enjoy Zaxby&apos;s fried chicken salads. They are always fresh and well prepared. The staff/management are always very kind when you wealk in the door. They make sure your order is fresh and hot . The only complaint I have is that the salads are quite expensive and I wished they offered some sort of punch card for free or reduced food item for those who frequent the etablishment reguarly.

PROS: great food
CONS: punch cards need
