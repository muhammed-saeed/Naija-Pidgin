What would you think about a ban on new fast food restaurants in your neighborhood?

 Fast-food restaurant line the streets in the Figueroa Corridor area of South Los Angeles. Last month the Los Angeles City Council approved a policy that keeps new fast food restaurants from opening their doors in South L.A., a lower-income portion of the city where healthy eating options are difficult to find.

The Council passed a temporary ban in 2008, which the recent decision builds upon. Established fast-food restaurants will not close but new ones will be kept from opening. However, &quot;fast-food casual&quot; restaurants without drive-through windows, such as Denny&apos;s and Subway , will not be effected.

If you think this isn&apos;t the government&apos;s business you&apos;re not alone, but here&apos;s what complicates the situation ( Quotes and statistics from The New York Times&apos; related story) :

1. There are already about 1,000 fast food restaurants in the 30 square-mile area in question, according to the City Council.

 2. Obesity rates in the area are double that of more affluent parts of the city, and residents over 65 are much more likely to be diabetic or have heart disease.

3. &quot;If people don&apos;t have better choices or don&apos;t have the time or knowledge or curiosity, they are going to take what&apos;s there,&quot; says Councilwoman Jan Perry.

4. Councilman Bernard Parks explains that they utilized land-use laws to limit fast-food restaurants the same way other communities do with bars or liquor stores.

Other communities block fast-food establishments just for aesthetic purposes. What&apos;s controversial about this case is that instead of residents lobbying the government for these restrictions, the local government appears to be fueling the fight. But the Associated Press reported that Councilwoman Perry found at community meetings that this is what community members want. &quot;Residents are tired of fast food, and many don&apos;t have cars to drive to places with other choices,&quot; she said.

Something else to consider is that residents of low-income areas, by definition, have limited resources, not only in terms of transportation, but time. Multiple jobs and extra hours spent on the bus leave little time for people to advocate on behalf of their communities.

The moratorium on new fast food restaurants is intended to be an opportunity to draw healthier restaurants into the area. The question is whether a new salad spot can lure customers who feel at home under the double arches. &quot;Research has shown that people will change eating habits when different foods are offered, but cost is a key factor in poor communities,&quot; said Kelly D. Brownell, director of Yale University&apos;s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity in a related story by the Associated Press . 

Ultimately, the 1,000 fast food businesses already in the area ensure that the ban against new fast food locations will not limit residents&apos; access. However, this new policy will send a message to fast-food corporations to stop relying so heavily on low-income communities to expand their fortunes.

 Jennifer Lening  •  Chicago, Illinois  •  4 months ago First of all, I am a student carrying a college GPA of 3.6 and majoring in Restaurant and Hospitality Management. It is not the industry itself that is making this country overweight. The people have a choice as they are Americans, as to what they want to eat. So, get over yourself and realize people have the right to make their own decisions. If they want to eat out, they can. I do not eat fast food because I look at it too much as work. Restaurant Managers actually make a great salary. Cindy  •  1 year 4 months ago We are becoming a country that is being controlled by it&apos;s government. For the people that said this is a wonderful idea go eat a carrot and leave people alone. I don&apos;t eat at fast food places because I don&apos;t like fast food and I love to cook. However, this is still a free country. At least it was the last time I checked. So many are turning this country into a Nanny State. They want to tell people what to eat, where to eat, what to drink, how to raise their children, and the list just goes on and on. I knew when they started cracking down on smokers that was only the beginning. Will they also ban ABC stores or restaurants that serve alcohol? Alcohol is also terrible for your health. Ban those also. Same with the bars! Hitting too close to home for some of you that agree with this ban? Get used to it because if this goes through, alcohol will be next on the list. If someone wants to eat a hamburger or taco from a fast food place they have that right. And please don&apos;t trot out the old tired saying about how your tax dollars will pay for their medical care. No it doesn&apos;t. That&apos;s just such a convenient thing to say when you really don&apos;t have enough brain power to come up with something original. I agree Americans are too fat. I agree our lifestyle is unhealthy. But, what you eat is your decision. Kat  •  1 year 4 months ago The Government wants to regulate everything. Freedom of choice is a thing of the past. Everything you own is taxed by a government or 3 that care nothing for your rights, only want your money. First they will pick on one group and people will say better them than me, then another group until they disaffect everyone and no-one is left to stand up and say no more. We should throw all of the Federal Gov&apos;t out and start over. Local Governments have no right to taxation without representation either. They all need to go. The American system of government is so fragmented we&apos;ll be lucky to survive the current stupidity going on and not come out a socialist government. Everyone needs to get their heads out of their rears and change it for the better.
