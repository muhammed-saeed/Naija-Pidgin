 911: There&apos;s a bandage in my soup 

 By Barbara Hijek May 9, 2012 07:27 AM 
Calls to 911 dispatchers range from soup to nuts.

This is a soup call.

A woman said she just about threw-up when she found a bandage in her chicken and rice soup at an Italian Restaurant in Palm Harbor, reports Bay News-9 in Tampa Bay.

 

David Baier, who was eating the same soup at the same table, took photos to document the incident, according to the report.

Baier told Bay News-9 that he got stewed and dialed 911 after the manager and owner came to the table and tried to blame the diners for the bandage.

Check out the 911 call and get the DUHtails at Bay News-9 in Tampa Bay.

 Batty McDonald&apos;s customer turned himself in 

 By Barbara Hijek May 8, 2012 07:53 AM 
Wanted man Lucious Smith turned himself into the Lakeland Police Department, according to a media release from the Lakeland Police Department.

 

The 45-year-oold man is accused of jumping the counter of a McDonald&apos;s restaurant and then striking the manager twice with a baseball bat on April 22nd after he got tired of waiting for his food. During the attack he allegedly stated, “all I wanted was some (expletive) food” and then left the store.

 

The manager sustained significant bruising to his McRibs as a result of the attack.

Here&apos;s FloriDUH&apos;s original post on the beatdown.

 Tomato tirade lands man in the slammer | FloriDUH&apos;s top fast food fights 

 By Barbara Hijek April 20, 2012 07:24 AM 
Here&apos;s a new one—tomato rage.

 

Vero Beach cops say Michael Linn Ogborn flew into a tomato tirade when after his Sonic food order came with tomatoes, which he claimed he did not order, reports Will Greenlee in his Off the Beat blog for TCPalm.com in Stuart.

Ogborn then allegedly crossed the line and entered the employee sector and and let loose a sonic boom, yelling at the workers.

After getting a refund Ogborn also reportedly punched the manager in the face.

Any hope for this Big Boy to grow up?

Here&apos;s some more FloriDUH fast food entertainment.
