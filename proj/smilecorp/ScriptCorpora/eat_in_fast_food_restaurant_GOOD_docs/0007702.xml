 Processed Foods 

 Just tell me what to
 take 

 The
 simple explanation 
 
 Modern diets consist of over-processed foods and lifeless foods which
 produce little enzyme activity and contain little or no fibrous
 material. We are eating devitalized foods that are not fresh, with
 fewer nutrients.  

 All the natural fiber, such as grain peels, have been removed in the
 refining stages. Because of this the diet is poor in fiber,
 digestion is slow and the waste materials stay in the body
 longer. This sets up the perfect condition for toxic materials to
 form.  Also, processed foods can contain huge amounts of
 chemicals and toxins which were added in the processing. 

  We are eating lots of chemicals like coloring agents, artificial
 flavors and preservatives that can make the food appear more attractive
 and taste fresher.   

 Even non-processed foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy
 products, whole grains and meats often contain chemical residues from
 pesticides, herbicides, hormones and other products used to make them
 grow. All of these substances reduce the amount of Vitamin E
 available for biochemical and physiological processes. 

 Why is the food processed? 

 Preservatives are used to increase the life of foods by controlling the
 growth of undesirable molds, yeast, and bacteria in food which might
 otherwise cause spoilage and subsequently illnesses.  Most food
 is processed and packed to stop it going bad. Most food contains
 microbes which are harmless little creatures in small amounts. But,
 they can multiply rapidly if environmental conditions are right. They eat the food by breaking it down, which causes it to taste and smell
 bad.  The microbes are dangerous in large quantities because
 their waste products are poisonous. Preserving either kills or slows
 the growth of these microbes. Here are some methods of preserving:
 
Drying 

 Drying is an ancient way of preserving foods. Dried food is hard
 on the outside so microbes find it hard to penetrate.  Drying
 does destroy most of the vitamins, but can lead to a higher taste
 concentration.  

 Salting, Pickling&amp;Smoking 

 These are also the traditional ways used all over the world to preserve
 food.  Meat is covered in salt then hung to dry. This is
 called curing. The salt draws a lot of the moisture out of the
 meat and also protects against microbes.  Sugar is used to
 preserve fruits.  Thus, we have jam and sweet pickles. The sugar stops the microbes left after the preserve is boiled from
 growing. Vinegar is used to pickle vegetables. The vinegar
 retards microbe growth because it is so acidic and stops exposure to
 oxygen, which the microbes need to survive.  Smoking involves
 hanging meat over wood fires and allowing the hot smoke to cure the
 meat.  This also gives it a distinctive flavor.  Most of the&quot;smoked&quot;products on the market today, however, have
 actually just had the&quot;smokey&quot;flavors added to them. 

 Modern Methods 

Various methods of food preservation, such as drying, smoking, pickling,
 curing and sugaring have been used over the years to preserve food and
 prevent wastage.  More recently, these procedures have been
 replaced by other methods of preservation such as pasteurization,
 sterilization, irradiation, freezing, canning and the use of other
 chemical preservatives.  

 Freezing: 

 Microbes multiply in warm environments. Freezing renders most of
 the microbes inactive. Refrigeration slows the growth of some
 microbes. Before food is frozen, it is plunged into boiling water to
 kill off as many microbes as possible so the food can keep longer. 

 Canning

 Canning is a common way to preserve food. First it is heated
 through to destroy any microbes. Then it is sealed in air tight cans
 usually lined with tin.   Although some foods loose their
 nutrients, heating activates some
 (especially tinned tomatoes).   

 Never leave unused foods in cans as they can become contaminated with
 metals as food/metal oxides combine.  This is not a problem
 when you put the remaining contents into an air tight, non-metal
 container.  

 You should never buy dented cans because bacteria might be able to get
 in.  And don&apos;t buy bulging cans because microbes have already
 gotten in. 

 Irradation: 

 This is a highly controversial method of preserving foods. We have an
 article on this.  Irridation 

 Pasteurization
 
This is the process of
 heating a liquid, particularly milk, in order to destroy harmful bacteria
 without changing the composition, flavor, or nutritive value of the
 liquid. French chemist Louis Pasteur devised the process in 1865. Milk is
 pasteurized by heating at a temperature of 63 C (145 F) for 30
 minutes, rapidly cooling it, and then storing it at a temperature below 10
 C (50 F). 

 Sterilization 

 The time and temperature
 required for the sterilization of foods are influenced by several factors,
 including the type of microorganisms found on the food, the size of the
 container, the acidity or pH of the food, and the method of heating. 

   

 The Problems with Modern Processed Foods

 Today, vegetables taste bland because of the lack of minerals in the
 soil. Then a lot of chemicals are added to make it taste good.  Chemicals are also added to preserve it.     

 Why are they salty? Because salt
 (sodium chloride) helps prevent spoiling by
 drawing moisture out of food so bacteria can&apos;t
 grow. Salt also kills existing bacteria that
 might cause spoiling. At one time, salting was
 one of the only methods available 

 Additionally, the food that has been processed contains a lack of
 enzymes.  Every metabolic function in our body and every
 chemical reaction that keeps us healthy is helped by enzymes.  An enzyme is a catalyst, which makes something work more
 efficiently.  The oil in your automobile engine is a
 catalyst.  Although your engine runs on gasoline, how efficient
 would it run without oil?   This is an example of a
 catalyst which helps reactions take place more efficiently. 

 Without enzymes there is no life.  Enzymes run the
 body. Every day your body burns enzymes to run our organs like the
 heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, as well as the trillions of individual
 cells that carry on life. Those enzymes need to be replaced as the
 body uses them up. 

Your body re-supplies enzymes by manufacturing them or by receiving them
 from an outside source.  They come from raw foods - vegetables,
 fruits, and even meat.  They can be converted for bodily needs. 

 When there aren&apos;t enough enzymes available on a daily basis, your body
 begins to cut back from various bodily functions.  For
 instance, hair may become dry, nails may crack and skin may become dry -
 giving the appearance of an older person.  Then more critical,
 the liver will not be able to handle the excretion of waste
 products. 

Fifty percent of all enzymes burned by the body are used in digesting our
 food. When insufficient enzymes are available for the digestion
 process the body steals them from other organs.  Evidence, the
 high number of indigestion aids sold and the fact that you get sleepy
 after a meal. The body is stealing energy (enzymes) from other
 bodily functions.  Without these enzymes, due to the lack of
 them in the food we eat, the average person only digests about 30 to 70%
 of what they eat.   

Processed foods and most all packaged foods do not contain live
 enzymes.  When any food is heated over 112 degrees Fahrenheit,
 the live enzyme activity is destroyed.   

 The bottom line is that when we put foods that are void of adequate
 nutrition and void of any enzymes into our body, we eventually run down.
The destruction of live enzymes does not permit our food to be thoroughly
 digested.   Then our immune system becomes weakened, and
 we develop degenerative diseases.  

 Pottenger&apos;s Cats: 

 Many scientific studies have been conducted on how this effects our
 health.  In the 1940, a medical doctor named Dr Pottenger
 wanted to know how processed foods affected our health.  He
 financed his own research, so he wasn&apos;t influenced by any big business
 interests to come up with certain results.  Dr. Pottenger
 studied 900 cats over a period of several generations.

Dr. Pottenger divided his cats into 5 groups.  The first two
 groups he fed raw food and they remained healthy throughout the
 experiment. The remaining three groups were fed processed
 foods.  The first generation of these cats developed
 degenerative
 health conditions (arthritis, allergies, diabetes, etc) near the end of
 their life. The second generation cats   developed
 the same health conditions during the middle of their life span. The third
 generation of cats developed the same health conditions very early in
 life. 

 The same is seen today in humans. Children are being born with
 chronic degenerative diseases or are developing them much earlier in
 life. This is a relatively new phenomena, but nevertheless the trend in humans is
 following Dr. Pottenger&apos;s experiments very closely. In addition,
 Pottenger found his third generation cats could not conceive or if they did
 they aborted. Right now, in America, 25% of young adults are sterile
 and they cannot conceive and miscarriages are on the rise. Have you
 noticed a rise in Fertility Clinics? 

 In Today&apos;s Health, a magazine published by the American Medical
 Association, an article appeared which indicated that many researchers are
 convinced that virtually all disease can be traced to missing or faulty
 enzymes.  

 S o, why is processed foods not good? 

 There are forty nutrients that cannot be made in the body. They
 are essential fatty acid, 15 vitamins, 14 minerals, and 10 amino
 acids. Collectively these forty nutrients are spoken of as the
 body&apos;s requirements. From these our bodies synthesized an estimated
 10,000 different compounds essential to the maintenance of health. All the forty nutrients work together. Therefore, the lack of any
 one might result in the underproduction of hundreds of these essential
 compounds.   

 Processed foods contain refined sugar, extra salt, and other flavor
 enhancers.    

 Processed foods contains unhealthy fats  

Unhealthy chemical additives are added to foods so that they stay fresh
 longer.   Chemicals such as MSG is added.  

 Processed foods can increase your body&apos;s level of homocysteine. (By the
 way, Omege 3 essential fatty acids has also been shown to reduce the levels of
 homocysteine.)   You can also
 find out about Power Barley which delivers the
 needed B vitamins to turn the extra homocysteine
 to cysteine a substance the body needs to make
 glutathione which is the body&apos;s master
 anti-oxidant.  

 Many processed foods are filled with strange parts and pieces. For example hot dogs contain&quot;edible offal&quot;???

Processing takes a lot of nutrients out of the nutrient rich foods. 

 Processed foods are fortified with synthetics. Most of the
 pantothenic acid, folic acid, biotin, cholin, inositol, vitamins B6 and E
 are discarded in the milling of breads and the refining of flour for
 cereals.  To make up
 for the loss of nutrients during processing, synthetic vitamins and
 minerals are added. Although helpful, these synthetics are not as healthy as their natural
 counterparts.  The amounts of vitamins returned in&quot;enriched&quot;flour are far less than the quantity that naturally
 occurs 

 Much of the goodness is cooked or processed out of our foods. We
 do not benefit from the enzymes and nutrients the foods normally contain.
 The missing nutrients which allow illnesses to develop have been discarded
 in processing and refining foods. Research shows that disease
 produced by combinations of deficiencies can be corrected when all
 nutrients are supplied. 

 What can we do? 

 Since our normal food supply sources do not contain enough vitamins
 minerals or enzymes for the body to get the complete nutritional intake
 necessary to maintain health. we must supply them with supplemental
 nutrition.   Remember that 50% of the body&apos;s enzymes are
 used for digestion.  

 W hat vitamins do you
 need:  To help with our fast food
 lifestyle eating processed foods. We need whole
 food vitamins that will supply those things that
 eating processed foods do not supply, or
 sometimes destroy.
