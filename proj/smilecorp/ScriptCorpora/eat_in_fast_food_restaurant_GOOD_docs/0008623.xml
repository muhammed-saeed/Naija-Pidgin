 how it will take those products to market, who it believes its competitors to be
 and how large it believes its market opportunities to be. Yet many managers
 give little thought to whether their segmentation of the market is leading their marketing

 efforts in the right direction. Most companies segment along lines defined by the character-
characteristics istics of their products (category or price) or customers (age, gender, marital status and
 income level). Some business-to-business companies slice their markets by industry; others
and differentiate by size of business. The problem with such segmentation schemes is that they are static.

 drove off with it. He was surprised to find that 40%
 of all milkshakes were purchased in the early morn-
 ing. These early-morning customers almost always
 were alone, they did not buy anything else and they
 consumed the milkshakes in their cars.
 The researcher then returned to interview the
 morning customers as they left the restaurant, each
 with a milkshake in hand, and essentially asked (but
 in language that they would understand), “Excuse
 me, but could you please tell me what job you were
 needing to get done for yourself when you came
 here to hire that milkshake?” Most of them, it turned
 out, bought their shakes for similar reasons: They
 faced a long, boring commute and needed some-
 thing to keep that extra hand busy and to make the
 commute more interesting. They weren’t yet hungry
 but knew that they’d be hungry by 10 a.m.; they
 wanted to consume something now that would stave
 off hunger until noon. And they faced constraints:
 They were in a hurry, they were wearing work clothes
 and they had, at most, one free hand.

 the customers might hire to do this job, it turned
 out the milkshake did the job better than any of its
 competitors. Bagels were dry; with cream cheese
 or jam, they resulted in sticky fingers and gooey
 steering wheels. Donuts didn’t carry people past
 the 10 a.m. hunger attack. Bananas didn’t last long
 enough to solve the boring-commute problem. In
 contrast, it took 20 minutes to suck a viscous
 milkshake through a thin straw, hands remained
 clean and stomachs were satisfied until lunch. It
