 Character Bio Edit 

A purple male deer with sharp ears, antlers on top and who wears face makeup and a navy blue/dark purple and white, striped shirt . He never speaks, because he is a mime, causing others to have a hard time understanding him. Apparently, most of his possessions are imaginary yet can be stolen (or even shown to be real), as evidenced in Easy For You to Sleigh , Mime to Five , Concrete Solution , Keepin&apos; it Reel , and I Heart U . Sometimes the things around him are imaginary, such as walls in Dunce Upon a Time , which he uses in the name of showmanship. He has even done some seemingly impossible things, such as making an audible honking sound while riding a unicycle in Concrete Solution and making noises while interacting with his &apos;imaginary&apos; furniture. It was once said that he&apos;s mute, but in some episodes, like in Happy Trails pt. 1 , Out of Sight, Out of Mime , Something Fishy , Keepin&apos; It Reel, and I Heart U he has made audible noises (e.g., choking noises, snoring, or blowing noises) making it evident that he can speak, he just chooses not to (although he has been known to not scream even when in severe pain as seen in Double Whammy Part 1 when his insides were set on fire). This has led to other characters&apos; deaths, such as in Who&apos;s to Flame? when his choosing not to talk to Lumpy, a fireman, over the phone eventually led to the destruction of the entire town.

He is talented with circus skills like juggling (which he can do with one hand) and creating balloon animals, though his attempts to entertain his fellow Happy Tree Friends often have fatal consequences. Mime is very fond of peanuts, going so far as to stick his hand in a blender to eat them. In Mime and Mime Again , Out of Sight, Out of Mime and Class Act he had a tail, however he appears without it in later episodes. Despite this, he has his tail, again, in the most recent Kringle episode, Chill Kringle and See You Later, Elevator ..

Mime is usually seen riding a unicycle in Party Animal , Concrete Solution , Who&apos;s to Flame? , As You Wish , A Hole Lotta Love , See What Develops , Junk in the Trunk , and Double Whammy . Sometimes, he stays seated on his unicycle throughout entire episodes.

Mime is the only character who doesn&apos;t die in the two TV episodes ( Who&apos;s to Flame? and Mime to Five ) he starred in, and he didn&apos;t have any co-stars in these episodes. He also survived in Mime and Mime Again , Easy For You to Sleigh , A Change of Heart , Easy Comb, Easy Go , Concrete Solution &apos;&apos; (Debatable)&apos; In a Jam , I Heart U , Chill Kringle , Youtube Copyright School and in the HTF Breaks Happy New Year , Take Your Seat and Tunnel Vision . He lives in a tent, on which the inside looks like a regular house with invisible or imaginary furniture as seen in Easy For You to Sleigh , and Mime to Five . He dies quick and painless deaths more than any other character except in Happy Trails pt. 1 , Home Is Where the Hurt Is , Party Animal and Double Whammy Part 1 . Like many other characters&apos; deaths, they usually involve his head, metallic objects or machinery/vehicles.

 Trivia Edit 

 Even though Mime&apos;s image was shown in the featuring page of Autopsy Turvy , he never appeared in that episode. In See What Develops , As You Wish , Concrete Solution , and A Hole Lotta Love , he stays seated on his unicycle throughout the episode. He is one of the few characters not to be seen driving an automobile. Mime, Russell and Cro-Marmot are the only characters without secret information from the &quot;Collect Them All&quot; section since he and Cro-Marmot haven&apos;t appeared until the &quot;Second Serving&quot; DVD. Kenn mentioned in the social site that Warren Graff was the person who voiced Mime in Happy Trails pt. 1 (for Mime&apos;s choking sounds). It has also been rumored that whenever Mime needs to make a sound (such as his snoring in &quot;Something Fishy) his voice is done by writer Sarah Castleblanco. If this were the case, he would be the third male character to have a female voice actor, along with Sniffles and Cub. As demostrated in one of his Olympic Smoochies, Mime is talented at performing the hammer throw. It&apos;s possible he has a crush on both Giggles and Petunia (but more of the latter) as seen in Who&apos;s to Flame? , Easy Comb, Easy Go and I Heart U . He is the first character to kill another character in the Love Bites series. He is the only character whose name has actually appeared in the title of an episode (other characters, like Nutty (&quot; Nuttin&apos; but the Tooth &quot;) and Flippy (&quot; Flippin&apos; Burgers &quot;), have segments of their names in episode titles). This is excluding smoochies. He appeared only twice in the first internet season. Mime was dressed as Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer in the episode Out of Sight, Out of Mime , indicating that he may be a reindeer. So far the only Internet Short he survived is Mime and Mime Again . He survived all the Kringles, Love Bites, Irregular Episodes and HTF Breaks he appeared in. He is one of the many characters who survived their debut episodes. Mime is one of the eight characters wearing clothes. The others are Disco Bear , Flippy , The Mole , Russell , Lammy , Pop and Lumpy. He has the 7th most kills out of all characters. Right after Lumpy , Splendid , Flippy , The Mole , Nutty , and Pop . His tail disappeared after the episode Out of Sight, Out of Mime and throughout the TV series, but it has reappeared since Chill Kringle . His survival rate is 39%. Petunia, Disco Bear, The Mole, and Toothy are his most frequent victims. In the TV series his survival rate is 35%. In the TV series: Cuddles, Giggles, Toothy, Lumpy, Petunia, Sniffles, Pop, Cub, Flaky, Nutty, The Mole, Disco Bear and Russell appear in all his starring roles. He was the last character to be introduced from the original characters. It has been rumored that Mime was going to have more kills than deaths. Mime is one of the the 5 characters who stars in an episode with a large cast and survives while everyone else dies (in Mimes case Who&apos;s to Flame? ). The other four being Splendid, Lumpy, Flippy and Giggles. Nobody has never seen Mime without his make-up, but he will have the same purple face. Even though Mime stars in Who&apos;s to Flame? , he only appears in the beginning and end. Mime has the fastest deaths out of every character, with almost always having instant deaths.
