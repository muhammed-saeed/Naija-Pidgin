Restaurant manager shot in Randolph

The manager of a Randolph fast food restaurant was shot multiple times Friday night during an attempted armed robbery, police said.

A man wearing a black ski mask and a black hooded sweatshirt demanded money at 11:10 p.m. from the manager of Burger King located at 18 North St., Police Chief Paul Porter said.

The suspect shot the manager, whose name was not released by police, three times, once in the chest and in each leg.

The manager was taken by ambulance to Brockton Hospital, where he was listed in fair condition today. The suspect fled on foot without the loot.

Police are also investigating a second robbery, which happened just before midnight at the Rapid Refill Sunoco station on Route 139.

Authorities would not comment on whether the robberies, which occurred about a mile apart, were connected.

Police allege Felix Rivera-Otero, 29, of Linton, Ind. robbed the gas station, then led police on a brief car chase.

Police arrested Rivera-Otero after he crashed his car into a police cruiser. He will be arraigned Monday in Quincy District Court on charges of armed robbery, assault and battery, failure to stop for a police officer, operating a motor vehicle so as to endanger lives, and giving a false name at the time of arrest. The Sunoco cashier was not injured, police said.

Todd, did I miss something in this story? Your reference to &quot;diversity&quot; escapes me!

I suspect we all know what Todd was refering to and I suspect we all know too well just what Todd is.

You&apos;re right BobL, people from Indiana can not be trusted.

I don&apos;t know what&apos;s become of Randolph. It used to be such a quiet town and you would of never heard of any violent acts taking place.

Not only Randolph, but this world has gone mad.

Todd is right on the money.

Unfortunately crime is already at an alarming rate in Randolph and will get worse as the economy heads into a tailspin. I saw this happen in Randolph in the 1990s- my neighbor&apos;s home was invaded while they were inside. The entire neighborhood bought security systems.

Randolph residents can be safe by not going out at night. This is not much different than Brockton now. This wave of crime may pass but the next 2-3 yrs will be tough.

every town will be subject to isolated acts of crime from time to time. a home getting broken into in the 90&apos;s and a guy from INDIANA robbing a store do not necessarily indicate a &quot;wave of crime.&quot;

The solution to the situation in Randolph is to LEGALLY carry a concealed weapon and make the decision to REFUSE to be a victim. It has been our Constitutional right since the start of this country and those who chose to embrace it send a clear and concise message to criminals. Those who chose to do nothing ARE part of the problem in this town.

i saw the guy get stopped. He almost hit my car! but trust me the cops made him pay for the chase. and how people are saying its Randolph people... the guy was from INDIANA that&apos;s not a street in RANDOLPH.
