Power &quot;ON THE SPOT&quot;
 
 
 
The 1000 watt generator that I recently purchased is just that &quot;POWER ON STHE SPOT&quot; For most light usage the generaor will come through like a
champ with time saved not having to string long cords and experiencing voltage drop as a result. For the price of 2-3 heavy electric cords
the generator will power up drills, saws, etc. am very satisfied with quality, noise level and performance in my day to day maintainence
of the properties that I own.

Decent Tailgating Generator
 
 
 
Use the generator to power a 32&quot; TV and satellite dish/box at tailgates, a full tank of fuel/oil mix will last you near 5 hours with no issues, somewhat noisy for it&apos;s size, probably good for other outdoor activities, does leave a fuel mix smell, instructions easy to read and get it started

 How did the color on site compare with the actual product? Matched up Please tell us about the quality of the product. The generator works fine and provides decent, steady power for short times How accurate was the on site description of the product? Fairly accurate

excellent for the price
 
 
 
I have had no problems with the product. I use it when camping and around the farm when I don&apos;t want to drag a extension cord around.I starts up fast usually on the first pull and runs steady. Ran a electric chain saw, on a bet, with this thing and it kept up with it. You really can&apos;t go wrong if you need a small generator to run a couple of lights or something of that nature.

 How did the color on site compare with the actual product? good Please tell us about the quality of the product. good in relationship to the price.. How accurate was the on site description of the product? accurate

Not really a review, Just a question
 
 
 
Everyone who has written a review seems to be using it for backup and various other things. Would anyone recommend this for tailgating to power a small television and floor fan?

So Far So Good
 
 
 
Got this product about a month ago. It started right out of the box. I&apos;ve used it several times now, including running the fridge and a couple fans for 8 hours after a storm knocked out power. I&apos;ve had bad experiences with previous generators, but this one seems to be a winner!
