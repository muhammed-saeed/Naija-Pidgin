Fast Trax is done up with the memorabilia of racing cars and bikes, and flat-screen TVs with images of Grand Prix events. However, the speed flattens when it comes to food. While the burgers and Shawarmas are passable, the shakes are nothing great and the combo meals just so-so. Better options include Kebab Roll, Dona Burger, California Burger, Grilled Kebab Burger, Hariyali Kebab, Chicken Burgers, Chicken Tikka Wrap and Mushroom Sandwich. Don’t think of adrenalin rush when you go to Fast Trax.
