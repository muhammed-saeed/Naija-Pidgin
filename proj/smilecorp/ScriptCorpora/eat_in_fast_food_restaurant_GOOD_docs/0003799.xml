 Reviews For Chick fil A Corporate Office

 First, I want to tell you how wonderful your food is -- chicken strips just the best, and your restaurants are always so accommodating when my granddaugher and I ask for lots of Chick-Fil-A sauce. A superb sauce. Second, and foremost, I want to say how very proud I am for your magnificent Christian values. I think it is wonderful that you are closed on Sunday for worship and a day of rest. I pray that you will always retain these values and that you will refuse to give in to the left who are always targeting, and especially these days, those of us who are Christian and try to live as Jesus would want us to. Take care and don&apos;t lose the faith for He is here to hold us up!

Love those chicken strips and those wonderful shakes!!

 Nice to see that CFA is being exposed as the fakes they are!!! Christian organization... Not! Worse company I have ever worked for!

 I am an ex employee of Mike Moore. He is the owner of 2 cfa. Both in Douglasville. I have not worked for Mike in 10 years but I have many friends that worked for him for many years. One of which as worked for him for the past 17 years. She had her pay cut a few months ago and was just told today that her last week to work will be next week and the only reason she was given was that she made to much money. She is one of many that this has happened to by the same owner in the past 6 months. He has fired all of the people that have been working for him for 15 years or more. None of them new why or that it was happening until they were told not to come back. I was always told this was a christian company but I believe that it is all lies what shame that these people gave so many years of there lives to only be treated like trash on the street. Now there are mexicans working in there place that will work for little money. I will never eat cfa again. Its called boycott cfa!!!!!!!

 I have never had a problem with Chickfila in the past but I have to say that I am very disappointed with my breakfast order this morning. I ordered a chickfila Buscuit and a sprite and I get a buscuit with egg and cheese on it...but no chicken!Really?? And then I take a drink of my &quot;sprite&quot; and turns out it is water! Guess they were still sleeping when they made my order. What a way to start off my Friday. Thanks Chickfila.

 I have no complaints only compliments. Today I visited the Chick Fil A store located @ 3580 Alta Mesa in Fort Worth, Tx. I was greeted by a friendly cashier, as well as a co-worker also came to my table to ask if I needed anything.
I could not locate my car keys after I finished my meal, and all the employees were so nice they looked everywhere for my keys including the garbage can (thinking I might have accidently placed my keys on the tray when disposing of my tray contents), needless to say Mr. Gary K. offered to try to unlock my car to verify if my keys were accidently locked in my car. Mr. Gary did get into my car and the keys were between the seat and floor board of my car. I was very relieved and happy.
I thanked him profusely, I even tried to pay him for the trouble he went thru to retrieve my keys, but he refused the payment and simply stated &quot;This is my Chick Fil A and just come back and see us&quot; and he thanked ME for visiting Chick Fil A.
He also offered to refill our drinks since we had to stand outside in the heat while he retrieved my keys. I was so impressed by Mr. Gary K and his staff. I will continue to visit Chick Fil A in the future however I will make sure I have my keys in hand before locking the doors to my car :)

Thank you!

Sincerely,

 My family and I really like the Chick-fil-A restaurants. We enjoy the food and atmosphere. I just wanted to express my concern though about the foam products Chick-fil-A uses. Though it does help insulate the cold and hot food, I am concerned that because not everyone recycles for one reason or another, and because foam is not biodegradable, these foam procuct will just sit there filling our landfills. By changing to paper products they can help make a statement that Chick-fil-A is a green company that cares about our planet. I am a mom of 4 boys and I am concerned about their future. I do recycle, but for those that don&apos;t it would be great if the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain, that is so family oriented, would take a stand on this global problem. They are one of the only chains that don&apos;t use paper. McD&apos;s does, BBK does, Wendy&apos;s does...get with the program!!!! 



 employee 5/8/12 
 Funny to see how ungrateful people are. I am a cfa employee and yes ill admit there are a lot of things wrong with our establishment, but I saw someone posted something about us asking weather they wanted a meal or just the nuggets. I constantly get people everyday that ask for and 8 nugget. When really they want the meal. Your not the only people that know how to order off our menu.
I am just a regular team member and I go out of my way to please customers. While my fellow Co workers do not. I&apos;m not saying I&apos;m the best worker but my supervisors and managers tell me I need to be a supervisor. But I wont because I think our management is nothing but a joke. Idle about other stores but our store is basically ran by kids. We are all 23 or younger!

 I LOVE CHIC-FIL-A!!!! NO COMPLAINTS FROM THIS SILVER SPRING, MD CUSTOMER!!

This is not a complaint but rather a solution. Many companies and customers complain about high fuel prices but not many have a solution when NOT being able to drive isn&apos;t an option. We can all agree that fuel runs the economy no matter the price but why should companies and families be forced to suffer? What will put money back in your pocket is a guaranteed fuel treatment at https://staggsfuelsolutions.mysyntek.com. Let&apos;s get back to what really matters is building a nest egg for our families!!

 Concerned Patron 4/11/12 
 I saw a picture posted of behind the scenes in one of your chick-fil-a stores in Valdosta GA on North Valdosta Road. The picture showed an employee dressing in your cow uniform which isn&apos;t anything bad, but it also shows things laying around that you probably would not prefer for outsiders to see. I don&apos;t think the employee dressing in the uniform was aware of their picture being taken. It&apos;s nothing offensive, but I don&apos;t think this would be considered company policy and behind the scenes should be considered private. 



 Fed Up Employee 3/30/12 
 I have worked for the Dwarf House Chick fil a on Pleasant Hill Road in Duluth, GA for some time now, and I am so ready to quit. We have the worst management ever. First, a new manager, Kevin, was hired to replace the old manager that was fired, and he is just plain rude. He barks orders at you. He never has a thing nice to say. And his wife is worst. She is the definition of evil. She got the position of team leader, and I guess that made her a GOD over night. Nikki yells at employees. She makes them cry, and then she pretends to be this sweet holy little angel in front of the Operator. The worst thing is the way the two of them talk to the employees, and better yet the fact that they will discuss their dislikes about certain employees to other team members. I think the fact that they are hiring all of their friends from O&apos;Charley&apos;s is the funniest. They bring these people in and make a big to do about how great they are, but never praise the team members that have been in place for better than four years sometimes.It&apos;s really just plain sad. The O&apos;Charley&apos;s turned Chick fil a team members are as bad as Kevin and Nikki. They don&apos;t care about yelling at you are just plain ignoring you when you ask them to help you with making shakes are cleaning. Maybe that is how things were run at O&apos;Charley&apos;s, but at Chick fil a really??? And I plain hate these little secretive meetings Nikki has to have with her favorite team members that go on for hours while we struggle on the front counter with waves of customers while she sits talking to at least two team members. It&apos;s so frustrating.
I guess these two think they are Chick fil a&apos;s saving grace. Well you guessed wrong.The thing that really bothers me about the management is if you disagree with them even politely you will be removed from the schedule for months. That&apos;s what got the last guy fired. These two are never respectful. And not a person including the Operator cares. I mean why would you when you are never there?
Chick fil a prides themselves on being a Christian company, but it is HELL to work for Chick fil a. I regret the day I started working for this company, and I am counting down the days until I can quit.
My final question is does Chick fil a feel like black people just cannot be in management. There is not one black manager at my whole store. What is that about Chick fil a?? Do you hate the blacks??? I think so. 



 Chuck Humbert 3/29/12 
 Good Day
Obviously the reply I have received is a template letter. The lack of customer sensitivity implied by the statement, &quot;I have forwarded your comments to (Insert Operator Name), the Operator at our (Insert Location Name) restaurant, so that (he/she) is aware of your feedback.&quot; makes me feel like my original letter received about 5 seconds of attention. How could you have &quot;forwarded&quot; this when you don&apos;t even know the location? Evidently I am not as &quot;important&quot; to you as your canned response would suggest.

For the record, our 2 year old grandson, when we were frequenting chickfila, did not have sufficient appetite to eat a kids meal, especially when we came in at breakfast. We would order the items that we knew he would eat. If I ordered him a water, it would be a cup with about 6 oz in it and be charged 75 cents. Chickfila has never explained to me why a cup of water would be that ridiculous charge. Is ALL your food marked up so high, or just what toddlers would order? Of course I quit ordering him a drink and just shared my own drink with him and would get free refills. This beat the Problem but didn&apos;t address the Principle involved.

We were good customers, I figure we spent about $1800.00 a year, not counting calendars, nugget trays for small church meetings, gift cards, etc. In a company with annual sales around 4 billion dollars and that must spend a small fortune in advertisements, sponsorships, projection of your brand, etc - why is gouging the parents/grandparents of toddlers so immensely important? I don&apos;t need to hear about &quot;policy&quot; - I bet many of your policies have changed. We say in our church business meetings that &quot;sacred cows make good hamburger.&quot; Our family &quot;policy&quot; remains in tact. We will not return to Chickfila as long as they feel it is important to charge a ridiculous fee foe a toddler to have a few sips of water.

I will use the link and Unsubscribe to your emails. I had been just routinely deleting them. However, now I am recovering from foot surgery and have more time. When I saw your latest email I had the time to write again. But I will unsubscribe when I close this letter.

To a huge corporate entity like yours, the issue of a cup of water must seem like much ado about nothing. But I live by principle not policy and this means a great deal to me. That is why I have taken the time to write you. I know Mr Cathy, nor his sons and daughter, nor his grandchildren now in the company business will ever read this letter, but it is EXACTLY the kind of policy I bet was NOT in place when he was starting out. I also bet they will not do a revised edition of his book, &quot;The Generosity Factor&quot; with a supplement about charging toddlers for water.

Some accountant came along and figured Chikfila should not risk losing 4 cents in a gesture of good will and decided to charge 75 cents to make sure the parent/grandparent left the restaurant feeling they had been gouged. I guess that is what happens when a company grows large, they quit thinking about PEOPLE and start thinking about CUSTOMERS and greater profits. This is really sad in the case of your company. 



 Jk 3/9/12 
 It is so frustrating to walk up to the cashier and order a coke, four piece mini. Then have the cashier ask is this a meal or would you like to make it a meal? If I wanted a meal I would have asked for it. You train your cashiers to maximize profits while insulting your customers intelligence of what they want to eat. I travel alot over the southeast and very often eat at your stores. I&apos;m beginning to really dislike eating there because of it. Point is....... we know what we want to eat. Please, stop up selling and insulting people. 



 Crystal Baker 3/6/12 
 I frequent the new Chick location on McCain in North Little Rock, AR. Today, I only bought a lemonade and i thought to myself when the girl passed my $2 dollar drink that she was nice wrapping napkins around the drink, as this has never been done before. I do not drink or eat in my brand new 40,000 &apos;12 camaro. Upon arriving back to work (4-5 min later), getting out I noticed 3/4 of my drink was now at the bottom of the console as there was a hole in the cup that the girl (I thought was being courteous) wrapped around it. I called Chick fil a and the manager I asked to speak with stated he needed me to hang on because he did not know how to handle this situation. I could hear him explaining the problem to another manager, and when he finally came back he said they would pay to have my car detailed. Never once did I receive an apology, an offer to replace my drink, and what about the real problem? The soda, if it did, would leak UNDER the console which is attached to everything in the car. Are you all really that cheap that you would allow your employee to wrap a napkin around my 2$ drink to save face for yourself, and instead risk ruining someone&apos;s brand new car that costs $40,000? I did go to the location after work (3pm), and the manager (never offered to replace my drink or asked to look at my car) merely took my name and said she would turn it over to their insurance company. That was approximately 6 hours ago, and I have not heard from them yet. Oh, and by the way, I never received a sincere apology from this manager. In fact, I received a sarcastic &quot;sorry!&quot; What is wrong with people these days?! 



 David Garrett 2/14/12 
 I would like to make a complaint about an employee at 110 black horse pike, audubon, new jersey. The employee was rude and failed to follow the companies policy of &quot;polite&quot; and &quot;family incorparated&quot;. She used the word &quot;asshole&quot; a number of times and she joked around while placing my order. worst part was, she was a team director/manager. I coudln&apos;t quite see her last name but her first name was Ashley. Please help with this situation, I am a loyal customer and this isn&apos;t right.
Thank You 



 A employee 2/15/12 
 Dear Sir or Madam:
RE: Chick-Fil-A poor management and customer service.

I am writing this to let you know about the managers that you hire to run Chick-Fil-A.
Bob Duffessy managers Brandon Duffessy and Melissa Duffessy are a joke of management they are horrible how they treat their customers and their employees.
I am keeping my identity anonymous so I get no retaliation, for reporting the truth.

For the past week I worked here I seen that they cannot even follow all of the safety heath guide lines.
When I was being trained for the job here under Bob Duffessy, he is the most arrogant pompous man that I ever met and worked for. All of their employees are somewhat nice and ok.
All of the managers are very sarcastic to their employees and mean and very vindictive.
Health Issues:

I had seen that they do not cover their hands, with gloves when handling cooked food prep. Handling making salads with their bare hand all the time. They had told me that it is ok, not to. They only care you wearing gloves for handing chicken (raw) only. This idea made me sick seeing this happen all day seeing this. I feel it is my duty to inform you want they are doing behind closed doors.
I had talked too many of the employees there that one is trying to get in management and was refused to give the proper respect and his status, because of the person not having his own place.
This is just so wrong to deny job status just because the person just because of him still living with his parents. That is just plain wrong. Chick-Fil-A Company holds a Christian value in the envuirment.That is a total lie.
And I see flies swarming around the food I told a manager about he said just ignore it. That is just plain disgusting.
Respect in the work place:

I heard very smart mouth and a lot of gutter talk and sexual language from Brandon Duffessy and he is very sarcastic when asking anything He has to say it being smart to all of the employees. there and they treat all of their new employees like dirt and to the public that has to suffer to all who come into this place walks out not knowing what they are eating not know that they do not hold any Christian values at all.
They love to overwork their employees and treat them like dirt. And not properly trained them to work and when you do make a mistake and Melissa Duffessy will chew you out even when you did not know where to put an item ,and she will panic all the time and act like he will go postal on you for the littlest mistake. And not show you in the first place calmly. And this why she will lose food on the floor because rushing too fast and make careless mistake and the customer can all hear them yelling and screaming and I had seen that they had about 2-3 customers walk off. And lose money just because of their horrible management skills.
Bob Duffessy had been very nasty to his help be very smart to them, and how he correct them. Is just plan mean and very abusive? He is very nasty and he will not say anything to his children when the make mistakes. And not a word to them, but if you are not related to him he will chew you out. and very pompous at that this is why he cannot he cannot keep a person this year in 1 month stayed 1 day and left and went throe 8 people for the same position. so I know it is not me I had worked in food business for over 1 year and I worked all over in my diffent field this is the one of the worst companies to work for. Or eat the food is super greasy and over charge the customers of the food you can eat much healthier at subway and get better prepare food and for lot less cost. As well this why I will never eat at chick-fil-a ever again because every time I eat their food I get sick all the time for the past 3 year none of my family eats in chick-Fil-A anymore . Chick-Fil-A got a bad reputation of being greedy and over charging for all of their food.
 



 VISTA GARDENS BOWIE 1/31/12 
 While being employed at this location for only 30 days, I was told I had to quit because the GM was not going to approve my change of availability form. I changed my availability due to the fact that i was starting college in another week, and I had a full schedule. I was told in direct terms &quot;resign now,or eventually get fired.&quot; That is no way to talk to someone. Employees in the kitchen do not wear gloves while preparing food. There are roaches in this establishment. Managers talk to employees any kind of way. I had one manager pull up my pants leg to see what color socks i had on and told me he would not clock me in because i refused to show him! (JOSHUA KRAFT) This establishment is not christian at all. I feel like i applied for the military and not a fast food joint. my problem is I should not have been FORCED to quit because someone was to lazy to change put in a piece of paper in a computer. 



 1/12/12 
 i will no longer spend my hard earned money at this establishment. It is a greedy company and cares little for its employees and now they are raising prices? why? people are struggling enough as it is. its now a christian based company it discriminates all kinds of ppl. down with chic fil a
 



 no name 12/7/11 
 i work at chic fil a, AKA liar-liar, in colorado, this store is such a farce....the only &quot;real&quot; person who cares about the public, the team, and the stores choices, is our GM. he is great, but the owners are only interested in themselves, and money. the owner is female, and recently was chosen the &quot;best fast food&quot; place in our city. however,she gave away free food of a whole month to get it!!! the &quot;team leaders&quot; are imature, 2 are felons, and the entire kitchen staff SPEAKS NO ENGLISH!!! where is I.C.E.???? even a team leader is illegal! and the owner? she is aware, but pretends they have green cards, even though she knows their fake.
they treat staff like dogs, talk about you to a team leader about yu in front of you and the public, and customer service to the employees?? ya , thats a joke!! chic-fil-a is a BIG LIE!!!! 



 Carl Gurtman 12/7/11 
 Dear Chick-fil-A Corporate Officers,

I&apos;m very confused. Could you please explain the difference between the plant kale and a chicken?

And, do you own other verbs besides &quot;eat&quot;? If I used the phrase &quot;shoot more chickens&quot;, would you also ask me to cease-and-desist&quot;? Or if I said &quot;shoot more deer&quot;, would you also own that?
 



 RM 12/5/11 
 You&apos;re going to sue a man because he uses the phrase &quot;Eat more kale&quot;? -Do you think you own the English language? You claim to be Christian but you&apos;re a corporate, greedy giant; and in addition you&apos;re a hypocrite and a blasphemer. What a terrible company. 

 

 12/5/11 
 I will never support Chick-fil-a in any way until I hear a genuine apology over the way my friend was treated at the holiday open house. You will have details of this horrendous incident when you receive her letter. Your employee who showed her and her family such intense disrespect needs to be fired. Shame on you. You need to remove any mention of &quot;Christianity&quot; from your company history to prevent sullying that name. 



 D Burger 12/4/11 
 I am a loyal Chick fil a customer and have always thought highly of the morals and values in the fact that Sunday is GOD&apos;S day. So when my son got a job at the Chick fil a in Greenville NC in his college town,I was so excited! Knowing he would be off on Sundays would allow him his time for church, fraternity obligations (they meet on Sunday afternoons) and hopefully a trip home once in a while (we live 2 hours away). But I was saddened at the news my son gave me yesterday stating that he was informed there is a mandatory meeting today-SUNDAY-and if he doesn&apos;t show up he will more than likely be fired?? He already has an obligation to his fraternity today and will be fined if he doesn&apos;t show, so he explained to his manager his fraternity obligation and asked his manager if he could be late and his manager told him if your going to be late you might as well not even show up and you will probably be fired??? I would just like to repeat how unhappy I am with this-what happened to Sunday being God&apos;s day, family day, etc.? I am not sure how this is going to play out, of course I told my son to honor his fraternity obligation and if they fire him so be it, but I would like to know who I can make a formal complaint to if this happens. Disappointed! 



 Randy K. Singleton 12/1/11 
 I love Chick-fil-a and think it&apos;s a shame the way Anderson Cooper portrayed your corporate policies on the Ridiculist. Just because someone stands up for the cause of Christ doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s alright to blatantly steal from them. The story ran a part 2 today and I was more infuriated than before. Thank you for the Christian stance and fine service that has always been Chick-Fil-A. This was the only way I could find to send you some encouragement and let you know that the public can see through the biased media.

Thanks,
Randy K. Singleton 



 David 11/28/11 
 Chick FIl A is suing an individual man who prints EAT MORE KALE on tshirts. They CLAIM trhey own the phrase &quot;Eat Mor ____&quot; They are throwing their corporate money around to put a single man out of cusiness and a job while he is trying to promote local agriculture. His phrase is NOT mis-spelled as Chik Fill A&apos;s is. Nor, does this man use the word chicken or cows in his phrase. SO, explain this to America Chik FIll A. You can&apos;t spell and you are suing a single business man over 2 words that have NOTHING to do with your business?

America is TIRED AND FED UP with corporate greed and bullying such as yours and we will stop eating at any of your locations until you grow up and stop such immature and greedy actions! 



 spysub 11/28/11 
 I see that i am not the only person who sees Chick fil A for what they are. no one ever checks on what really goes on in their stores. i worked there as a manager for two years. there were some nice people but the company really only cares for their bottom line. they give their franchisees to church choir directors over business people, but then refuse to monitor their godless behaviors. my owner and his fat ass lazy tyrannical wife had the nerve to try to replace me while i went and buried my mother! with a business person? no, another church ally with no restaurant experience. a few months later i tried to give a 2 weeks notice. he told me to get out now, effectively firing me on the spot. after he realized i could collect unemployment he illegally would not give me my check until i gave him a written resignation! he did the same thing to another manager a few days later. my experience was that the corporation is a Christian facade. if they really walked the walk they would have an open door on complaints about their owners. they don&apos;t. Most companies pay hr people to check on this kind of stuff. not here folks. just don&apos;t buy the hype. please don&quot;t think you are supporting Christian values by eating in their restaurants. 



 Kim Northeast Ohio 11/7/11 
 The food is 5 stars. This review however is on Ownership and management @ Chick-fil-A in North Olmsted, Ohio. The owner has his family working there wife, kids, sister-in-law is one of the managers. There is consistent fighting amongst them which spills over to the employees. There is unfair practices and favoritism. I recommend an unannounced corporate visit or better yet, a secret shopper type visit to catch them in the act. See the unChristian-like atmosphere. The in-fighting spills into the dining room and can even be heard at the drive-thru; very poor representation of what I imagine Chick-fil-A wants to be known for. 



 Suzanne Landreth 10/1/11 
 Chick-fil-A is the best! Our High School class trip to Orlando FL was delayed due to bus problems. We called ahead to the Chick-fil-A location in Tifton, GA and ordered 225 meals. 2 1/2 hours later, we were able to pick them up. Cheerful employees greeted us and the food was great! We appreciate you! 



 Erica 10/1/11 
 Wow! I am totally on board with Richard!!! How sad!! I would really love to see that service men and women and even their families for goodness sake, get some kind of honorary treatment EVERYWHERE they spend money!!! Especially a Christian based franchise!!! So Richard, thank you for your service!!! I hope the headquarters reads these and sends you a very compensated offering for your return as a customer. Dylan should understand that as the years have gone on, things have changed and God is so simple and as long as your following him and faithful to him! He doesn&apos;t care if CHickfila is open on Saturday or Sunday!! It&apos;s called business! God doesn&apos;t judge! He is too loving and caring to be so petty about such a thing! Please don&apos;t take it the wrong way though. Everyone has an opinion! We are so lucky to have the freedom to express it!!! :) 



 Team Member largo towne center 8/14/11 
 I am a team member at chick fil a largo towns center. I will remain anonymous for the sake of my job. The store that I work in is really crazy. The managers dont perform as managers, the GM cares nothing about his team and their needs; just as long as his store is runinng. The owner is such a hypocrite. He fakes as if he is a Christian, and he is so arrogant. I love my job, don&apos;t get me wrong, but I hate to have to go to work and work these ppl. Mangers don&apos;t know rules. So I say one thing and they say another which confuse customers. The General Manager breaks rules and make up his own. One day he says do something then the next day we don&apos;t do that. The assistant manGer that does the schedule, if she likes you, you will have hours, if she does not like you, you will not have hours. POINT BLANK! When a employee is terminated, the whole store talk abouts why,( including the managers) which is not everyone&apos;s business. The owner once told an employee that we receive discounts for Lunch, when we really don&apos;t! Our customers have complained about these issues on a regular basis. Here I Am an employee and I actually experience these things. It&apos;s not fair for ppl to think all is well with chick fil a because it&apos;s really not. Neither are they a Christian Business! something needs to be done! 



 Sarah 8/31/11 
 We just had a chickfilla open up here in Pennsylvania. I got up at 4 in the morning to be one of the first 100 only to find out that they already handed these bracelets to people and theres all these rules that you have to follow. I think thats rediculous. I am very poor and could of used those coupons. All I can say is this is an example of an american fast food restaurant. You can&apos;t get more american than that. They also fire people too easily at these restuarants. I&apos;m going to move to Europe where they have fish and chip shops and you don&apos;t have to meat whereever you go. 



 Yuri 9/1/11 
 I worked for chick fil a in Houston tx and it ruined my life my marriage and everything... Managers have no respect for nobody it turned out that one of the manages was having an affair with my husband and she knew I&apos;m pregnant and her being married herself I can&apos;t believe they let people like that work in chick fil a when they are really Christian and are so into the family thing I am really thinking of speaking to the operator about this because he should not have those kinda people there he is really into the family being together and stuff and I know he won&apos;t like it at all 



 briana winters 9/14/11

 Hello, I would like to have my name a secret because i feel that my name should be private. I live in Richmond Va, and i love going to Chic fil a on parham road. Lately i have seen something horrible things over there. I don&apos;t remember the manager or bosses name but he as chewed out alot of people today and he puts on an act when the customers are there. But when no one is around i have seen worse things. He cusses out the employers and threatens to fire everyone in the store. I enjoy the smiling faces but when i see a Manager or a Boss do this sort of thing. I feel that this person should step down and/or be fired. Although this is not my decision by no means....but i saw the look on one of the girls face and he was very rude to her. I have held my tongue for to long and i think its time to face some changes. I just feel hurt for the way he has treated his employers. I believe Chic Fil A is a Christian envoirment but when things happen like this it only brings evil inside the stores. I thank you for reading this.

 I am very upset I called corporate because my 2 yr. son got injured, and one of the the manager in lufkin tx did not take proper actions and disregarded the fact that my son cut his forehead, gushing blood came out and that young manager cared more about business than my son. Did chick fil a pay for urgent doc? The answer is no they offer nothing. If I would have been from another race would something have been done? I cannot believe that. All I can do is pray that people change. We count our blessings that my son is doing better and he is healing.

 I stopped to a chic fil a in stevensville Md and was very disappointed. The resturant was not very clean. The eating area , tables and floors dirty/ The bathroom was not clean and out of paper supplies. I reported this to the manager and had to tell them twice before they sent anyone in to clean it and fill the toilet tissue. The first response I got was, they sent someone in with a roll of paper towels. I live near a chick fil a in salisbury, md. and have never had this problem. I love chick fil a and admire their cleanliness and quality of food and customer service. I feel the stevensville Md franchise needs to clean up their act!

 I am sorely disappointed with Google. It would seem they have hand-picked the bad reviews, as not ONE.... NONE.... was complimentary. Well, the one in D&apos;Iberville,
MS, is wonderful. Great food, great staff, cleanliness unbeatable.
Google... would you DARE to print this comment?

 hi chick fil a I&apos;ve been going to my location in sugar land, texas and have been going to the location since it opened and been enjoying the breakfast burritos for
years but here recently in the past month the burritos have changed for some reason.
Been calling the location managers and been complaining about what has changed. One nanager a lady said will take care of the issue the other person which I talked to him twice and did not care about what I thought or my complaint he did not say yes sir or no sir or did nothing about my complaint. Today I took it back and got my money back and he did not say anything nothing. He did not even check the burrito
what&apos;s up Chick Fil A THE BURRITO SHOULD BE MADE THE SAME ALL THE TIME EVERYTIME
Hello Chick Fil A please look into this and manager to me don&apos;t care. Sorry folks
I love Chick Fil A.

 I am very upset by the new customer services chick-fil-a has in Memphis, TN. They are having their employees standing outside in the hot sun serving customers. It&apos;s too hot to have these babies outside. Temps 90+. 



 CHARMIAN 6/2/11 
 i eat at chic fil a in mcdonough georgia(hwy 20/81) at least once a week but now that i&apos;m trying to eat healthier(which means lots of salads)i find it inconvenient that the store doesn&apos;t offer fat free ranch. the only option is lite italian or vinegrette. i would appreciate it if this would be an option for the customers.thanks. 

 

 Anonymous irate team member 5/21/11 
 I am honestly thinking about marketing a boy cot to Chic Fil A in Arizona. Let me tell you why.

The company is suppose to be a equal Christian company. I am finding out more and more every day that the people I work with do not exemplify God or His Glory. I find out more and more every day, that specific people do not have a Christians work ethic. I mean seriously? We work for a Christian company. You would expect equality, love, tenderness, and all of God&apos;s Fruit of the Spirit there? Right? I actively persuade to work there, BECAUSE it was a Christian company. Because I was tired of working with non Christians, and I was tired of working in unfair work forces, that did not exemplify God or His Glory.

I work in a store where the Manager plays favoritism. If she has an issue with you for what ever reason, instead of being a Christian women, and being an adult really, she will mess with your life, and without notice, without explanation, cut your hours.

When I was pregnant, she cut my hours to 1-2 hour shift, once a week. She constantly plays games like this. When it&apos;s brought up to the store operator, he doesn&apos;t think she is doing anything wrong. However, of course he doesn&apos;t see what she is doing wrong, and of course he doesn&apos;t think she is doing anything wrong, because he hardly spends time in the store, as he is suppose to.

I&apos;m not the only irate team member, but I will speak up about this.

Just because you park in the garage, doesn&apos;t make you a car. Likewise just because you go to Church and claim to be a Christian doesn&apos;t make you one.

Honestly any level of management should be a leader for us. They should exemplify God and His Glory ALL the time. If you can&apos;t do that, you shouldn&apos;t either be in management or you shouldn&apos;t work there.

Sadly this is a common practice in many Chic Fil A&apos;s.

To make matters worse, when you ask why the cut in hours, instead of telling you the truth and working on &quot;the issues&quot; they will lie to you, so they don&apos;t have to do anything.

Further more, what &quot;manager&quot; doesn&apos;t work all shifts at least once a week, to ensure that all team members are doing the same work, the same service across the board? No wonder so many customers get mad when Day shift isn&apos;t doing what night shift is doing and vise versa.

Just saying, for a Christian company, they have poor work ethics.

 I went to the Chick-fil-A in Columbus, GA at the peachtree mall today... and to say the least, ALL the food was thrown away! The nuggets were soggy and fatty. The fries were old, cold, and looked and tasted like they had sat there for hours! The chicken sandwhich had soggy bread and again the chicken was soggy and fatty!! We have other locations in Columbus that are great! It seems like this location at the mall is going down hill... I did call the manager to complain, and he was VERY NICE, and seemed concerned. I love Chick-fil-A and I hate that I had to complain and I must say that this is the 1st complaint I have ever had in the 20 years that I have eaten at Chick-fil-A...

 We need a chic fil a in southern dade county, Miami Florida. I love this and would get it more often if it was closer... Much better than other fast food, well actually no comparison ...

 I was wondering when a free standing Chick fil A will be built in the Tri-Cities area of Petersburg, VA. There is one at Southpark Mall but it would be nice to have one on its own.

 To Chick-Fil-A company : I read in the paper about one of your restaurant in Harrisburg, Pa. catching heat for providing Lunch at a couples retreat at Christian Life Assembly Church put on by Pennsylvania Family Institute. Because of your company&apos;s belief in &quot;To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us&quot;. Please continue your conviction to your principles. For God will bless you and your company.

 I am a fan and have always been a CFA fan! This is the third bad experience in Athens and Atlanta that I have had with CFA. The food has a very bad taste. The nuggets tastes bad like the chicken was not fresh and the oil from the fryer was old. The two sandwiches my husband received were the same thing. We ended up throwing the disgusting food in the trash. We are very disappointed if CFA is changing their products...you are losing me as a 1 -2 time a week customer.

 I enjoy the cows all around the city and I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not alone. They bring fun and joy to our city commute. Thanks for some good clean fun that&apos;s free of charge.

 I went into Chick-Fil-A of Chesterfield Missouri and ordered my meal. Then I asked if they honored Military Discounts, because I serve in the Army and have for 24 years. I was informed that NO they don&apos;t. What ashame....... A $6.00+ meal and you can&apos;t give a 10% discount, IE .60 cents..... WOW!!!!! I should have gone to McDonalds where they do honor military and the serves we do for this country and YOUR freedom.....
I will say the Corp. Personnel that were there at the time of my visit, were nice about the refusal, but you lost me as a customer over all.....
Your freedom that you enjoy daily, that a lot of people TAKE for granted. (You should appreciate ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL, because your freedom is at stack)

 I was at the Chick-Fil-A store in the Citadel Mall in Colorado Springs, Colorado this morning. I was going to get two Sausage and egg breakfast burritos and they told me that they don&apos;t do eggs any more but I could get a sausage burrito.

I asked a manager When the stopped doing eggs and she Monday (I assume yesterday).
Why did you stop doing eggs? Eggs are better for you than sausage.


I really love your breakfast burritos and I am very disappointed that you no longer serve them.
I usually give one to a friend of mine and when I saw him this morning he wanted to go get them but I told him that you no longer do eggs. He was disappointed too.

Please reconsider bringing the eggs back. I for one think you might lose some customers because of this.

Thank You.

 I have a suggestion for a new slogan for Chic fil A, but I am not sure where to send it. Can you provide me with this information?
Thank you,

 I purchased from Chick-fil-A today for lunch and first they forgot to put my sandwich in my bag and I find out once I&apos;m already at work so I have to go all the way back and get it then I get to work and start eating my sandwich and salad and as I&apos;m about to take another bite out of my salad I felt a hard object that I bit into and turns out it&apos;s a really big screw. Glad I didn&apos;t swallow it or it chip my tooth cause that could have been disastrous. I am not a happy customer at all.
