Two area teenagers died early Saturday morning in a three-car crash at 159th Street and Harlem Avenue that also injured three people.
Mohammed Shiab, 17, of Tinley Park, and Ahmad Shaban, 16, of Orland Park, died after a man believed to be an off-duty Chicago police officer broadsided their vehicle about 3 a.m. in the intersection, Tinley Park police said. On Saturday afternoon, their families buried the teens.

Jason Casper, 24, of Chicago, has been charged with two counts of reckless homicide in the incident.

Casper was driving east on 159th Street when the front of his car hit a Saturn on its driver&apos;s side, k!lling the two back-seat passengers and injuring the driver and the front-seat passenger, Sgt. Steven Vaccaro said.

Authorities said Casper was speeding in his Chevrolet Monte Carlo and ran a red light when he broadsided the Saturn.

Tinley Park police would not say if alcohol or drugs was involved.

Casper was not seriously injured, police said. He was treated at and released from a local hospital. He is scheduled to appear in Cook County Circuit Court in Bridgeview on Monday morning.

The driver of the Saturn, Ramzi Dar-Hussein, 29, of Justice, was badly injured and was taken to a local hospital where he was listed in critical but st@ble condition, Tinley Park police said in a statement.

A third passenger, Rasim Taha, of Cincinnati, was listed in st@ble condition at another local hospital, the statement read.

The crash extended to a third vehicle, sending a passenger in that automobile to a local hospital with minor injuries, Vaccaro said.

Vaccaro would not comment on Casper&apos;s occupation, but a Chicago police spokeswoman confirmed there is a 24-year-old Jason Casper working as an officer. She said Saturday evening she had not been notified of his arrest.

The Tinley Park Accident Investigation Unit continued to investigate the crash.

A family friend said the four were on their way back from work at a seafood restaurant.

The two boys, whose families are of Palestinian origin, had been friends a long time and attended Sandburg High School in Orland Park.

Shaban lived in the 7500 block of Tiffany Drive in Orland Park. He had a brother who helped support him and their mother since the [rip] of their father a few years ago.

He was bright and funny, and although he didn&apos;t love school, he worked hard and wanted to be able to help support his family, said the friend, who asked that his name be kept private.

Shiab, of the 16300 block of South 84th Avenue, was a senior in high school. He liked basketball and was an&quot;all-around good guy,&quot;the friend said, adding,&quot;they both loved their families.&quot;

If alcohol or drugs were involved in their [rip]s, it would be an irony of ironies, the friend said, since the boys took their Muslim religion seriously and never drank or did drugs.

&quot;They would never pick up a beer,&quot;he said.

Many loved ones gathered around two damp graves to bury their dead Saturday afternoon.

Lines of male mourners recited the janazah funeral prayers along with Imam Jamal Said before carrying the two caskets outside the Mosque Foundation of Bridgeview.

According to Muslim tradition, the teens were taken to be buried as soon as possible. They were laid to rest in Parkholm Cemetery.

A concrete lid was placed over each sarcophagus containing a casket draped in light-colored fabric. A dump truck filled each hole with dirt, which mourners then tamped down with their feet. Some placed rocks and clumps of earth on the mounds.

Praying between the graves in the late afternoon, Said spoke of the fleeting nature of life, reminding mourners to spiritually prepare themselves for the end.

&quot;[rip] is not only for the old,&quot;he said.&quot;It can happen to anyone. This is the time to realize that Allah does not differentiate between the young and old when he sends his angels.&quot;

Clusters of men embraced each other, some crying, many comforting each other as the day&apos;s sunlight began to wane.

&quot;What can you do?&quot;one said as he walked through the cemetery.&quot;This is life&quot;

this article is after that cop went to court.
Mahmoud Shaban&apos;s pride in being an American has only grown since he moved here from the Middle East 33 years ago.
But Monday, Shaban said he lost some faith in his adopted country when bail was set&quot;too low&quot;for an off-duty Chicago police officer accused of causing a three-car crash that k!lled Shaban&apos;s nephew and his nephew&apos;s best friend.

&quot;The best things I&apos;ve seen in America, today they were missing,&quot;Shaban said.&quot;Justice was absent in that courtroom.&quot;

Jason Casper, a Lockport High School graduate, is charged with two counts of reckless homicide for the [rip]s of Ahmad Shaban, 16, of Tinley Park, and Mohammed Shuaibi, 17, of Orland Park.

Casper&apos;s bail was set Monday at $500,000 half the amount requested by prosecutors.

&quot;Our brothers&apos; lives are worth more than this,&quot;said Shuaibi&apos;s older brother, Eyad.

Nearly 50 relatives and friends of the teenage victims, both students at Sandburg High School, stood in the rain outside the Cook County Circuit Court in Bridgeview after the hearing.

Sanaa Hussien, an attorney representing Shaban&apos;s family, said the families were&quot;extremely distressed.&quot;

&quot;The emotions are high,&quot;she said.&quot;They don&apos;t want to call the race card, but this seems extremely unfair.&quot;

Maher Elkayyal, 17, was a close friend of both boys. He said he thought it would be different if the tables were turned.

&quot;If it was one of us and we k!lled two people, they would have called us k!llers and terrorists,&quot;said Elkayyal, of Orland Park.&quot;They would have made sure we stayed locked up.&quot;

Casper had been drinking before he sped through a red light about 3 a.m. Saturday, police said. The 24-year-old officer slammed into the teens&apos; vehicle in the intersection of 159th Street and Harlem Avenue, according to the Cook County state&apos;s attorney&apos;s office.

Casper&apos;s lawyer did not return messages left at his office Monday.

Additional charges are pending the results of a blood-alcohol test. A Breathalyzer test was not given at the scene, Tinley Park police Sgt. Steven Vaccaro said.

Sandburg students passed out fliers with an anti-drunken driving poem Monday. They also wore red ribbons in remembrance of Shaban and Shuaibi.

On Friday, Elkayyal and Evan Jallouqa want to speak about their friends at Sandburg&apos;s International Festival Day, an event Shaban and Shuaibi helped organize.

&quot;Most everybody knew them, but we want everyone to know they were good people and it wasn&apos;t right what happened,&quot;said Jallouqa, a Sandburg senior.

Shaban and Shuaibi, described as loyal friends who smiled a lot and loved their families, were sitting in the back seat of a Saturn on their way home from work at a fast-food restaurant.

The 29-year-old driver of their car, Ramzi Dar-Hussein, of Justice, and front-seat passenger Rasim Taha of Cincinnati remain hospitalized, family members said.

Casper was treated for minor injuries and released from a hospital.

Judge Janet Brosnahan on Monday ordered Casper to surrender his police-issued gun and his passport. She also advised him to refrain from drinking.

Chicago police are conducting a separate investigation of the incident, spokesman Pat Camden said.

Casper has been&quot;stripped of his police powers&quot;pending the outcome of his trial. He will continue to be paid for his $53,000-per-year job, which he has held since September 2002, but he will be&quot;assigned to a less-sensitive area,&quot;Camden said.

A third and final night of mourning for Shaban and Shuaibi was held Monday at the Mosque Foundation of Chicago in Bridgeview.

Since Saturday, Mahmoud Shaban said he has told many people about the last conversation he had with his nephew.

&quot;I told him life was like a mountain,&quot;said Shaban, of Homer Glen.&quot;He said, &apos;Give me the time and I will climb the mountain.&apos; Now we&apos;ll never know.&quot;

Also there was a on duty cop who was going to pull him over for doing 95 in a 35 right before he hit the guys driving the saturn he was drunk as well.
if the cop had pulled him over before the accident there would have been no problem and also if that dumbass wasnt speeding there would be no problem, why the !! cant you stop at a redlight? even a cop cant do that
