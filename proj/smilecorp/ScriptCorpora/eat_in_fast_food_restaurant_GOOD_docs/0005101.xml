Top 5 Local Food&amp;Drink Joints You Should Know About

 Jacob Katel Not on the list, but you still should, and then Sandwicherie across the street. 
​ If you&apos;ve ever walked out of a bar drunk and hungry and bought a gas station sandwich then you probably appreciate a joint with a menu.

Miami-Dade is full of them. From Kendall to the Grove, Allapattah to the river, even on the 57th badlands edging Coral Gables some of the coolest bars around are also a great place to grab a bite.

Here are our top five local food and drink joints you should know about.
 

 
 
​ 5. Duffy&apos;s Tavern - If atmosphere was cars, this place is a hand built 1958 Cadillac . A comfortable place to eat, drink, and watch sports on TV, table, floor, walls, and ceiling.

 
 
​ 4. River Lounge - Because sometimes it helps to have a yacht on the river with your drink. Located downtown in the Epic Hotel with Chef John Critchley&apos;s Area 31 cooking for the bar from upstairs.

 
 
​ 3. Scully&apos;s - Before Diners, Drive Ins and Dives put this place on the Food Network map, there was our 2002 article about it. Going strong since 1989, Scully&apos;s is destination dining for Kendall.

 
 
​ 2. Flanigan&apos;s in the Grove - Sure you&apos;ve been to the one in Hialeah , but this one looks like it&apos;s been around since 1940 and is full of original fishing memorabilia to prove it. The web doesn&apos;t have much info, does anybody out there know if this is the flagship location?

 
 
​ 1. Club Tipico Dominicano - This highly festive, family friendly, late night joint in Allapattah features some of the best dancing, food, and drinks in South Florida that money can buy.

Old Cutler Sport Bar and Grill probably won&apos;t even last long enough for a blog considering that building has been how many come&amp;gone-before-the-weekend-even-ends bars already?
 
Silver,
Thanks for great comment. will definitely be checking out those spots

Adrian,
yeah it sucks when that happens to a place you like, but for somebody who&apos;s never been there Duffy&apos;s is pretty awesome
 
Gotta agree with the Duffy&apos;s comment above. Used to love Duffy&apos;s when the patrons used to spit on the floor (which to this day, I have no idea what it consisted of...the flooring). 

Now it&apos;s fully tiled, has way too much lighting, and a children&apos;s menu. 

Shoot me, please.
 
These are the five best? Come on, really?
Duffy&apos;s has atmosphere. But their food has really gone downhill. And you have families with five year olds running around. Kids don&apos;t belong in bars.
Flaningan&apos;s? Even the one in the Grove feels so corporate nowadays.
Good food, expensive drinks, yes, it&apos;s good. But River Lounge isn&apos;t exactly a &apos;joint&apos;.
What about Fox&apos;s? Prime rib night.
What about Old Cutler Sport Bar and Grill? Their seared tuna is great as is their seafood pasta. And they have a pool table too.
What about Sports Grill? Great wings.
Now those are some joints with menus.
