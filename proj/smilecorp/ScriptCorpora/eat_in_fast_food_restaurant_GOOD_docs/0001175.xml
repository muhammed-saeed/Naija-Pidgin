Kargeen Cafe: Don&apos;t bring your fire engineering consultant!

by StinkyHamsterbuns 

Good tasting food in a very pleasant outdoor setting, cusioned benches around glass-topped coffee tables surrounded by plants and trees (fine in April, but apparently gets very hot after April and too hot to eat outside). All of my meal came with flames or hot coals under it.Lively meeting place. Bithdays are celebrated with loud singing and fireworks.The Onion soup was very good and comes in clay bowl with a little candle in a seperate pot beneath it to keep it warmThe mixed grill arrives at your table sitting on it&apos;s own barbeque - meat excellent but don&apos;t eat too slowly otherwise you&apos;ll incinerate the lot.The air can get a little thick with the aromas from incense and sheesha pipes - yet more hot stuff - but that adds to the ambience.Order a lot of food and you&apos;ll quickly run out of space on your table if you have four or five people and try not to knock over the sheesha or you&apos;ll...
 
Sheraton hotel restaurant: Chicken anf seafood.

by JAVATO 

On wendesday, the restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel of Oman offers a really good seafood dinner buffet for only 20€.

Seafood.In the other sites of the city you can eat for a few money.You can go to local retaurants or to a small shops. Spiced chicken is really good, the tea and the coffe are great, and fruit juices are very natural.Coffe is the tipical drink in Oman.Mango juice is great and very cheap.
 
Fisherman&apos;s Lodge: Qurm Fish Restaurant

by erabsoy 

Located in Qurm near the Crown Plaza hotel. It was the concierge who indicated us the adress.Food is plentiful: take starters if you&apos;re hungry only. They are a whole meal in itself!We had 2 starters : stuffed calamari, seafood plattersThen Octopus platter and a fresh filet that you pick into the fish shop itself. Lemon mint juices to go along and a mint tea.All in 18 OMR. Expensive for Oman, but so cheap for Paris (would be the double here)Good quality and freshnees, friendly waiters as always in Oman and a nice patron from Egypt.
 
Woodlands: Great South Indian Cuisine

by dansc0tt 

Those familiar with the name &apos;Woodlands&apos; might associate it to a chain of south India vegetarian places. Well this place has all the veggie options plus some great meaty ones also! According to the Oman Today&quot;Woodlands is one of the best in the city, and the only restaurant specialising in Chettinad cuisine&quot;. You&apos;ll also find the staff VERY friendly and quite willing to give you advice on your trip. Just don&apos;t mention the cricket world cup to them as I think they might be a little upset now!!

Anything from the South Indian speciliaty section of the menu, add the coconut rice and a litre of house red!!
 
Doesnt Matter: Tasty Kbabs etc

by JohnniOmani 

Oman has some amazing hole in the wall type restaurants and most travellers would rather choose something from a guide book and that is their choice but I have eaten at dozens and dozens of wee shops in Oman and 90% of them have been great and clean and quite tasty so if you stop in a small town dont be put off by the exterior of the restaurant because there may be some tasty dishes that you are missing out on!

Whole chickens for 1 rials as well as anything Indian
 
Seafood

by JohnniOmani 

The Sheraton Beach Resort near Shatti Al Qurm in Muscat has an amazing seafood buffet for about $25 US but worth every cent. It is in the most beautiful area in Muscat and the food is excellent. After you finish your meal you can stroll down the beach and it is gorgeous in the evening.

Everything including the shrimp and lobster.
 
Camel&apos;s Milk

by traveldave 

This tip is not about a restaurant, but about a food staple among the nomadic Bedu (sometimes called Bedouin) of the Arabian Peninsula. Historically, the camel has been the most important animal to the Bedu. Its meat and milk were food staples, it was used for transportation and as a beast of burden in general, and its hide was used for leather.Camel&apos;s milk is healthy. It has half the fat of cow&apos;s milk, and has less sugar, making it good for diabetics. It is high in vitamin C, and is supposedly good for vascular problems. And in many Arabic countries, women drink it to get a clear and smooth complexion.I had the opportunity to try camel&apos;s milk when I was in Oman. I bought a small container of camel&apos;s milk at a convenience store in Buraimi, figuring that I might never have the chance to try camel&apos;s milk again.Later, during our lunch break, I took a sip of the milk, and the members of my...
 
any street vendors: Street Fast Food Like No Other!

by malihas 

for some reason i enjoy street fast food more often that i should... most times it&apos;s safe and it&apos;s always very tasty and very cheap- fast food places are either arab foods or indian foods and are usually located in a shopping area- you&apos;ll see meat being skewered outside the joint in the arab places- in the indian places you&apos;ll see a display case of sweet and salty foods.

arab fast food- shawarma (pita roll with meat and humus in it); filafel (small bean patties)indian fast food- vegetable samosa (deep fried large dumping with potato,peas in it); potato vadaa (deep fried ball of spicy potato).
 
Mumtaz Mahal; Golden Oryx: Exquisite Restaurants

by malihas 

Mumtaz Mahal is still one of the best expensive Indian food restaurants. Nice view and has a bar/lounge area at the bottom.Golden Oryx- one of the finest chinese/mongolian restaurants- excellent service.

mumtaz mahal- ask the manager to make recommendations based on some of your general prefernces- do the starter, main course and dessert. golden oryx- any of their recommendations- but the fried icecream is a MUST! do the starter, main course and dessert.
 
Buffet at Crowne Plaza Hotel, Muscat

by victorwkf 

The buffet at the cafe located at the basement of the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Muscat (Qurum area) is a very good experience with delicious food and a very good ambience. It cost about 8 Omani rial per person, and there are many variety of food ranging from western, local and nice desserts as well. After the buffet, you can walk outside and have a beautiful view of the Qurum area, sea and surrounding mountains since the hotel is on top of a small hill.
