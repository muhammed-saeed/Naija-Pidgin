 July 11, 2012 Chef&apos;s Coney Connection Very Nice Place by JR ( 420 reviews ) I stopped in for lunch today and ordered three chili cheese dogs with extra onions. The dogs are among the best in the area and I&apos;m looking forward to try out some other menu items. The employee&apos;s were nice and friendly. The dining area was very clean and neat. The only bad thing is their location, it&apos;s on the side of a strip shopping center and doesn’t face the street for better visibility. July 1, 2012 Taco Bueno Flat food by Rick ( 817 reviews ) Chicken tacos were flat, boring, little flavor. The chips and queso were bad--cheese had an odd flavor--have had better out of a jar. June 30, 2012 Schlotzsky&apos;s Deli Very Satisfied by JR ( 420 reviews ) I ordered the&quot;Original Turkey&quot;sandwich along with chips and a drink. I&apos;m not big on sandwiches but I will stop by at Schlotzsky&apos;s and devour one of theirs. It was a very good meal, the employee&apos;s were nice and the dining area was clean.
