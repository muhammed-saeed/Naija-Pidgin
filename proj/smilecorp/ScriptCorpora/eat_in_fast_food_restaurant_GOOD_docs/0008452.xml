I like that you can make your burger just how you want it.  instaed of hoping they make it right.  and they have the coolest soda machine.

I just am not a fan of their wedges.  I wish they had regular fries.

It&apos;s an average burger place. nothing really stands out except their milkshakes and the variety of meat they have. but the burgers are usually cooked to long and come out dry. It&apos;s a little overpriced so id rather drive two minutes away to in-n-out.

What I&apos;ve tried:
Salmon burger (seasonal i think, but was kind of dry)
Buffalo burger (good)
1/4 beef burger (good but nothing special)

This a great hamburger restaurant for family get-togethers or small groups. I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich or the 2/3 burger, which are always fresh, and some of their awesome seasoned potato wedges. Having the self-serve bar for all your sandwich and burger fixings is great too. Simple and good food.

The highlight of Fuddruckers for me is the $7 domestic beer pitchers. They&apos;re full size pitchers and they give you chilled mugs. You can&apos;t beat that price at any other sit-down restaurant.

There&apos;s always free parking and it&apos;s located right in the heart of downtown Burbank so it&apos;s a great area to walk after eating all that food.

Normally I have a very good time at Fuddruckers in Burbank but I went there last night and was very disappointed. First of all the bathrooms were a mess and out of the two stalls one did not have toilet paper. The girl who took our order was very distracted and had to keep re asking what we wanted. Her co worker standing right at the front desk lifted up his shirt to wipe his face exposing his entire stomach. We were served cold fries, both ketchup dispensers were empty and I had to ask to get them filled, and finally they got these two new soda machines which are touch screen and very cool looking but since everyone I trying to figure out how to use them there is this huge line just to get a soda. Although I am sure it was hat a one time experience it was very upsetting. I hope the next time I go it is better otherwise I may not go there anymore.

I&apos;m not the biggest meat eater, so Fuddruckers isn&apos;t exactly my favorite place. To much meat for me. Even so, there&apos;s burgers are ok, nothing special. Also their garden burgers are pretty plain. If you love meat, this is the place for you.

An all-american classic. You wait in a line, order your food, sit at a table, and wait for your name to be called to pick up from the counter. While this place is not my favorite, my boyfriend raves about it. Cheap beer, dogzilla (huge hot dog), and pretty good burgers. It was kind of funny watching one of the male employees try to pour the beer into the glass, he tried 3 times until another girl came to his rescue. I can pour better than he can! :)

I came here excited to redeem my free 1/3 lb burger for my birthday since I remember my last burger at Fuddruckers being incredibly good. I was met by a not-so-friendly cashier who really looked like she did not want to be there.

After some deliberation, I decided on a 1/3 lb burger with grilled onions and american cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. The wait took about 10-15 minutes to get the food. The burger was good, but I don&apos;t remember having the same feeling of satisfaction after eating this burger. For some reason, it tasted much saltier than I remember. The burger was still decent, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be driving out of my way to Burbank to get another burger again. The sweet potato fries were no good. If restaurants are going to offer these, at least make them good. Needless to say, I did not finish my fries.

When it comes to a sit down Burger joint it&apos;s hard to beat fuddruckers. I used to be a regular at the one off the I-5 near portland back in my college days. I would drive 80 miles for a burger. (yes, I am fat.).

The fuddruckers in burbank is so well built. Multiple levels of dining options and with all the ambiance expected of a Mother Fuddruckers experience.

Awesome service. Always clean. Always good food. Get It!
( free parking is tough to beat )

I&apos;d been dreaming of a Fuddruckers hot dog, but rain or errands or other things kept me from my Burbank excursion for weeks.  But, ravenous after a morning shopping excursion, I was finally able to have my hot dog and eat it too.  Junior hot dog, fries and a drink for under 7 bucks.  You can&apos;t beat that.  I&apos;d like to note that the bun was especially amazing.  And parking was free.  I must get over here more often.

I only come here bec my little brother loves their chicken wings, otherwise I would usually pass when it comes to Fuddruckers.
They are like a glorified fast food restaurant. It&apos;t not really fast food, but it is at the same time.
Granted you can&apos;t compare this place to Micky D&apos;s or burger king, it&apos;s a step above it, but thats not saying much.

At least the service is friendly, and I feel a little better eating their food as opposed to regular fast food.

My childhood was built around two entities: little league domination and celebrating at Fuddruckers after the victory. Ever since you closed the Pasadena location some 10 years ago...life has never really been the same. I miss the claw machine and your freshly baked buns.

I just had to find my youth again. City of Burbank.....you saved me! The service is quick, and the food is just how I remember it. Your wedge cut seasoned fries remain loyal to its original taste.

You make life worth living!

Only come to eat here as it is located for family to meet up. The burgers pretty much suck. Cheap tasting meat and dry. Have had all of the wild games meats and they all seem to taste about the same and again dry. Employees are not memorable so typical service not terrible not good. Can feed the entire group for cheap everyone leaves full. the French fries are very good.

I always come to this place when theres a game that i want to watch in peace and this place never fails . What more could i ask for great burgers and i love there wedge fries. My son loves the kids cheese burger and i must say its pretty big for a 5 year old but he manages to eat most of it .

I usually come to this place before or after the movies since the movie theater is walking distance and since the stupid movie theater doesn&apos;t allow you to bring in food.

This place is always clean and the staff are always really nice.

I have a feeling not enough people know about this restaurant because people who know me, know that I am unsatisfied with any burgers sold at any restaurant... until now! Fuddruckers is amazing beyond words! My only complaint is their burgers are terribly addictive and I&apos;ve been eating there for the past 4 days straight, with no slowing down in sight. There&apos;s lunch... and then there&apos;s a burger for lunch at Fuddruckers!!

You have probably read this in other reviews, but to repeat them: Fuddruckers displays their raw patties! I don&apos;t know any other restaurant that is as proud of their burgers that you can take a look at them. You also get to prepare your buns however you want them at the total condiment bar.

They also have exotic patties like buffalo meat, but I haven&apos;t tried any of those yet.

I am doing my best to inform people about Fuddruckers because they are doing everything right!

Went in last night with my husband. Ordered a veggie burger with no cheese. The burger came with cheese. We took it back and asked them for a veggie burger without the cheese. When we brought it back to the table I noticed that the cheese had been SCRAPED mostly off the burger but it was still encrusted all over the edges of the burger. So lazy. Other than that it was fine. Usually have a decent experience there.

Have enjoyed this place for years.  If you like a variety  of quality burgers, this is the place.  From standard beef burgers in 1/3, 1/2, 3/4 and 1 pound sizes, to a variety of exotic meets including ostrich and buffalo, Fuddruckers serves quality, fresh burgers and provides a plethora of fresh goodies to top off your favorite.

The original ambiance that the Burbank restaurant represents is my favorite.  Games for the kids and a nice atmosphere with plenty of old posters and pictures providing a nostalgic look back.  Newer locations I have been to lack any real ambiance or other attracting features but do provide the same quality burgers and add-ons.

Fuddruckers is a great place for the family and has a burger to fit anyone&apos;s desire.  The Burbank location is the best around.

I always used to go to the one in Thousand Oaks... and when that one closed, I hadn&apos;t been to a Fuddruckers in a long time... years probably.

Okay, so it was about 5 o&apos;clock tonight... I am exhausted. I mean, I am dead tired... but I promised a friend I would go out to eat with them...and the thing is, I&apos;m the only one with a car... so sadly, that means I need to drive. So I&apos;m driving down Wells...since I cannot deal with traffic... it makes me lose my mind! So my friend decides to take over driving for me...which is great for me...and I haven&apos;t really been driven in my car...so I sit in the passenger seat and pass out. hahaha. Well, not really... but the heated seats make me want to fall asleep... but I decide to play with their ipod since again, I am never in the passenger seat. Anyway, on a side note when I&apos;m sleepy... I totally don&apos;t act like myself. I think just about everything is funny... and I am less inhibited I guess? So the whole 2 hours it takes to get there... well it took over an hour... since the traffic was MURDER in Sherman Oaks/Encino... I start belting out Bon Jovi - It&apos;s My Life, Beatles - Good Morning Good Morning, My Precious, My Bus (a &quot;supposed&quot; hard rock song)&amp;That FT Island song (which are all in Korean - um, I do not know Korean... but can sing it?!), some Justin Timberlake songs...just basically whatever they had on their ipod that I actually knew... hahaha.. I don&apos;t know what this has to do with this place... but that was my experience on coming here.

We finally get here at 7... and the parking again is a nightmare. There is so much traffic... but hey, it&apos;s downtown Burbank... so at least that was expected. Finally find a parking spot... and walk down to the place.

The inside is larger than the Thousand Oaks location... but it&apos;s much older and kind of &quot;dirtier&quot;. I mean I guess the tables are clean... but it&apos;s kind of run down..and older.
This location also carries different types of meats: Wild Boar, Elk and Buffalo. So I decided to go with the Elk burger... hahaha. No! I am totally kidding... hahaha. I won&apos;t even eat seafood... it&apos;s too weird for me! But if you&apos;re feeling like Andrew Zimmern, you should go for it...

I typically get the 3 cheese burger... so I had that. You put everything on your burger yourself... and so I usually just put a whole bunch of red onions on it and a few pickles... but they have tomatoes, lettuce, regular white onions, relish, and cucumber slices.

Also, on the other table they have sauces: mayo (::shudder::), spicy mustard, regular mustard, ketchup, honey mustard...and I am sure there are a couple others.

The strawberry shake is pretty tasty... so yum! Had some of that...

Other than that, I don&apos;t know what to say. A burger is a burger... I mean it is good... but I don&apos;t know.

I love these burgers.  I think they are some of the best in SoCal.

You order at a counter then take a vibrating coaster thing to your table and it flashes&amp;vibrates when your order is ready.

You order burgers by size (1/3 pound, 1/2 pound, 1 pound) and they have a few options for cheese&amp;sauce.  When you pick up your burger it&apos;s pretty much &quot;naked&quot; but they have a serve yourself toppings bar and you can put as much of whatever you want on there  :)

They have good fries (I usually get honey mustard to dip em in).  They also sell beer.  They have deserts but I&apos;m always too full try them.

They have a large comfortable seating area.  The decor reminds me of a Bennigan&apos;s or a Fridays except a bit more kid friendly.

There&apos;s a big parking deck (free) right next to the place.  You can usually find parking except on weekend evenings (that whole area gets busy).

Eating at Fuddruckers is like a game. It&apos;s called let&apos;s-see-who-can-hide-the-taste-of-a-pretty-­mediocre-burger-the-best-with-tons-of-condiments. I&apos;m pretty good at this game, as I start with a cheeseburger and add tons and tons of each of the cheeses, then throw on a bunch of mayonnaise, Tabasco, mustard, some onions if I&apos;m feeling particularly sassy, then a little more cheese just in case, and then some more cheese. But then you realize that you essentially paid $10 for a bowl of cheese and mayonnaise. Their fries are consistently soggy as well, but also serve as a solid starting point for the above-mentioned game.

But I DO like games, so three stars.

This placed seemed magical to me as a kid, because it was so different and had a bunch of crazy crap on the walls and played loud music and had a fascinating view of butchered animals that made me ask a million questions while we stood in line. (I later became a vegetarian. This might have played a small part in why).
As a broke ass teenager living on couch change, it was the go to place to eat something filling (small plain fries, with money scrapped together with friends, piled to the basket&apos;s edge with condiments) and maybe play an arcade game. To walk past it as an adult, it just feels sad, like eh, I think I&apos;ll pass and go for something a little more...current. Fries with cheese sauce though--still pretty tasty.

Build your own burger, you picky people. You may now set your pickles on the eastern region of your patty, just the way you like it! -rolls eyes-
Pick your meat, then build upon your patty with your choice of veggies and condiments.. I really just see this place as burger heaven for the picky population.

Generally, I like everything on my burger but I specifically come to Fuddruckers for the Ostrich burger. Unlike poultry, it can be cooked medium-rare and has a beef-like texture. Also, it&apos;s HALF the fat of chicken (o wuhh?). Not to mention, it&apos;s also as delicious as a regular charbroiled burger, so no need to feel the guilt!
--Only con: Ostrich is seasonal *shakes fist at fudd*

When in doubt and still wanting exotic meat and/or low in fat, try Fuddrucker&apos;s:
Buffalo, elk, venison, or just go to McDonalds. Their meat is also categorized under strange and exotic.

Maybe it&apos;s because I am not a huge fan of burgers but this place was nothing to write home about.

Yes, they let you build your own burgers, but besides that, there is really nothing special here.

The place had a dirty feel to it... I don&apos;t know how to explain it but it felt sub-par compared to other sit down places.

This Fuddruckers is very crowded.  And probably the crappiest fuddruckers I&apos;ve been to.
I went here to use one of the birthday certificates they email but they wouldn&apos;t let change the burger to chicken even if I paid for the difference and the people working there weren&apos;t very nice.
When I say crowded, I mean crowded.  We had to stand around waiting for a table for a bit and most of the places were pretty dirty.  The clean up crew were pretty good though, going around.
It&apos;s a decent place, but the ones in Orange county are much much nicer.

Great burgers with different kinds of meats (beef, buffalo, wild boar)
The Buffalo burger is delicious and noticeably different from the beef.
The Elk wasn&apos;t particularly better than beef really.
The place itself has a nice, fun atmosphere with pictures of celeb patrons covering the walls.
You get to put on the toppings yourself.
Cons: Asking for anything extra noticeably jacks up the bill.

Unlimited condiments!!!

Came to fuddruckers on a tuesday afternoon. Love the concept of building my own burger so i dont look like a picky customer. Burgers and shakes, yum!! Music, cool! Chili cheese fries, disappoinment. Oh well, unlimited condiments made up for it.

And do try the jalapeno cheese (those are unlimited to!)

The burgers are huge and juicy. I can build my burger just how I like it and not worry about messing up.

The brownies are good too. I always take mine home because I never have room to eat after eating a huge burger.

Ruddfuckers hehehhehehehhehehehehhehehehehheheheh.

Best burger in the world you say, Mr. Leno?  Hardly, but damn satisfying nonetheless.

Among the condoments (ehhehehehhehehhe, ok enough) are mayo and this melted cheese sauce type stuff.  I don&apos;t know what it is, but a friend would load up his burgers with that nonsense.  He has since had three heart attacks, and at 22 that&apos;s quite a feat (da bears).

You know, for a burger joint their toppings are pretty fresh.  Tomatoes and onions and lettuce and pickles and such, it&apos;s all crisp and awesome.  Myself, I go for the half pounder and add ketchup, mayo, one slice of tomato, a few leaves of lettuce, and 34 slices of onion.  I order it medium well (the only meat I&apos;ll not eat medium rare) because I fear the stomach sickies.

But wait, there&apos;s more!  They also have bottled beer.  Heine, Corona and whatnot, but no liquor (something I can overlook because, hey, burgers!)  If that&apos;s not your style, they got fountain drinks with free refills.

The fries aren&apos;t anything special, kinda soggy if I remember correctly, as well as platters of other foodstuffs, nothing mind blowing.

Do not order their fish and chips!  Fuddruckers is meant for hamburgers, big juicy, creative hamburgers.  Why I went here as a pesco-lacto-ovo-vegetarian?  We were famished and stuck in Burbank and before we hiked back to our car in whatever floor on whichever parking structure.  Their shakes were a bit too thick for my liking and their fries were seasoned.  I highly prefer just plain, straight fries, put in the fryer and then salted to my liking...no orange fancy, snancy stuff for this girl.

Definitely your bucks worth for the amount of food they give you.  Although I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m a fan of the &quot;Build it Yourself&quot; condiment island.  All my Quality Assurance and Food Safety classes frown down upon such things.

Kieran of course enjoyed and devoured his hamburger...my fish and chips...well they were the quality of frozen breaded fish you can buy at the market.  I know my fish and chips and these were definitely not fresh.

When I start eating meat again, I&apos;ll come back Fuddruckers...PROMISE.

It is what it is, and what Fuddruckers is is big, decent burgers with a serve-yourself topping/condiment bar that makes it all worth while.

The smallest burger (unless you get the kid&apos;s meal, which is 1/5-lb) is 1/3 lb, and it only goes up from there.  You order your topping-less burger at the counter (where you do have choices like bacon, cheese, grilled onions), then grab all the other toppings you want at the self-serve counter.  I loaded my bacon cheddar burger up with onions, mustard, ketchup and extra extra extra pickles.  Like a million pickles.  That&apos;s how I roll.

I think I&apos;ll try the onion rings next time, but the seasoned fries (giant potato wedges, actually) were great as well.

Great for a quick bite before or after the movies.

You want a decent burger with tons of choices of what you want on it?  Fuddruckers will give you far too many choices for the type of burger you want.  Basically, that&apos;s what they have.  Burgers.  Pick the size, pick the type (beef, garden, chicken, turkey, and even sometimes ostrich), pick the toppings, pick a side, pay and sit down.  Your pager will go off and you go pick up your burger.  Fill it up with whatever condiments you want at the condiment / toppings bar and sit back down to enjoy.

I&apos;ve never really been into this place, but I loved it when I was a kid.  When you&apos;re a kid, you love having the choice to put as many pickles on your burger as you want.  No adult is gonna tell you what to do!  But as an adult, I&apos;d rather have someone put the crap on my burger for me, otherwise, I&apos;d just barbeque a burger at home.

My favorite burger to get is the INFERNO.  They load the burger up with grilled onions and jalapenos, then douse it with hot sauce.  I take it back to my table and load it up with a good slathering of Tobasco, and it&apos;s pretty tasty.  It doesn&apos;t make me sweat, but it&apos;ll be slightly uncomfortable ... good for a work lunch.

The decor here is weird.  It&apos;s all 1950s rock and roll stuff for the most part.  It&apos;s like a flea market just vomited on all the walls and ceilings around you.  As a kid, I loved it.  Now, it just all fades into the background in a giant mush of memorabilia.

Working in Burbank, you hear all kinds of weird folklore and rumors.  This one was supposed to be a huge hangout for lecherous gay guys, who would convene in the bathrooms in the afternoon around 3pm (almost like the recurring joke from the Kids in the Hall&apos;s &apos;Brain Candy&apos;).  I&apos;ve only ever had lunch here, but I&apos;ve never seen any convention happening in the bathroom.

Great place to go if you want a quick burger in a slightly nicer setting than the corner burger hole, just don&apos;t expect too much.  And if you&apos;re here around 3pm, check out the bathroom.

What can I say, it&apos;s Fuddruckers.   Having eaten at Fuddruckers on two continents, I think I can say I&apos;m knowledgable about this chain.

And they really DO do good burgers.

The Burbank one was interesting.   Two level, far different layout than the others I&apos;ve been to.   And no parking save at a local garage

Still, the food is consistantly good, and they&apos;ve avoided the &quot;Pepsi Curse&quot; so far.    The Burbank one is where you go in the area when you want a very good HUGE burger
