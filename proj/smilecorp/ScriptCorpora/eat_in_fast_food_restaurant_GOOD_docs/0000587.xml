Is any place hiring teenagers anymore?
 Ever since I turned sixteen last year, I&apos;ve applied for every fast food restaurant in the county. I&apos;ve also applied to many stores that hire 16 year olds like K-mart, Toys R Us, and many other retail stores that hire 16 year olds. I&apos;ve followed up on all of them, and never got an interview because they say they are not hiring. Understandable, but I always hear of older people getting hired for those jobs I&apos;ve applied for. I keep re-applying and re-applying and still no luck. And what makes it harder, is that every place only takes online apps only. Doesn&apos;t that make it harder to get a job?

 when i was 16; 7 years ago.. if you wanted a crappy job, it was pretty easy to get one if you applied yourself.

now though, those jobs you are applying for are being taken by more qualified, more experienced, more educated, more desperate, and more available applicants.

you can only work part time during the school year, and only after school and weekends (possibly).. where as others who no long work in their field because of the economy, and recession already have a lot of the skills these companies are looking and more of everything i listed in the 2nd paragraph..

good luck, but its tough out their right now

 hmm, stores like J Crew, lord and taylor, some ann taylor stores, pandora, etc. take walk-in applications. it&apos;s also helpful to call your desired workplace to see whether they&apos;re hiring or not. i did that and was amazed at how many stores are hiring that didn&apos;t show up on ads. good luck!
