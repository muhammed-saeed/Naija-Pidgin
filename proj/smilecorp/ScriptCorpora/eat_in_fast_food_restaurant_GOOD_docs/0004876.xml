Strategic Brand Management of a Sandwich Bus in Hong Kong

 
 Introduction 

 Brief Description of the Brand 

 
 

 The name of the company and the brand that will be used to represent its products and its people is“Sub BUS”. The company will offer a wide array of sandwich items particularly, the popular Italian Submarine sandwich. The main products of Sub BUS are wide varieties of healthy and fresh submarine sandwiches as well as other food items such as salads, pastas, desserts and drinks. The difference between the Sub BUS brand with others is that Sub BUS products are served on a bus rather than the traditional restaurant settings. This is a radical move for the company–bringing the Sub BUS brand to the customers. Submarine sandwich is a sandwich made with an entire loaf of French or Italian bread, split lengthwise, and filled with meat and vegetables. The submarine is so called because the half-size loaf of bread resembles a toy submarine of the sort that children like to play with in the bathtub (Palmatier, 2000). 

 Strategic Brand Management 

            This paper will tackle the different issues concerning strategic brand management. In doing so, the business, it products, its target markets as well as its marketing strategies will be discussed. 

            According to Haedrich and Tomczak (1990) strategic brand management is a dynamic process comprising the following elements: 

 1. Defining the mission of the business. 

 2. Specifying the basic marketing strategy for the brand. 

 3. Planning the instrumental strategic model for the brand and determining the individual marketing instruments to be employed. 

   

 Business Concept 

 

 Fig. 1–sample of a Toyota Coaster minibus 

 Sub BUS products will be served in a converted Toyota Coaster minibus (fig.1). The minibus will served as the counter, the kitchen and back of the house of the restaurant. Up to 15 seats will be provided for customers outside the minibus. Sub BUS products are also available for take-out. Toyota Coaster is chosen because it is very popular for motor home conversion. The coaster will be converted to the counter, kitchen and back of the house of the restaurant by removing the entire passenger seating and addition of kitchen appliances and utensils and cash registers. 

 Sample Conversion of Toyota Coaster 

            Below are some sample photos of a converted Toyota Coaster. It should be noted that the photos shown below are of a Toyota Coaster converted into a motorhome. Similar conversion will be made in order to convert the minibus into a Sub BUS.

 Brand Concept 

            The brand concept is that of submarine sandwich concept that is healthy and that the customer can take anywhere. The reason for choosing minibus as a point of sales for Sub BUS products is accessibility and visibility. We also want to make an impression to the customers that we are a quick service restaurant and as the same time our foods are healthy and of top quality. 

            The target market are Italian sandwich customers in the heart of Hong Kong, particularly those who are on the go–those people that are working in offices in Hong Kong. The Italian sandwich is the most frequently ordered submarine sandwich in the industry. Sub BUS products will find its position in the industry as a fast service submarine sandwich shop with the most delicious and healthy products. In order to provide consumers with an alternative and thereby capturing more of the market, Sub BUS is introducing a new concept which is called“Grill Sub”wherein customers will be able to build their own submarine sandwich. 

            Sub BUS represent a unique concept that combines health, quality and quick service based on a variety of products and food choices. Each Sub BUS store is bright, lively and colorful, making them attractive to customers. Maximum utilization of space is also implemented. Sub BUS stores combine different restaurant concepts wherein takeout, dine-out and delivery are combined in one store. The market for a new, unique, high-quality Italian sandwich is tremendous. The potential for a well-planned entry into this market by an aggressive operator with vision and experience could not be stronger and the timing could not be better. 

   

 Justification of Brand Management Decisions 

 Mission 

            To be recognized as the number 1 submarine sandwich restaurant in Hong Kong that is known for high quality, healthy and quick-served products. 

 Location and Facilities 

            The company will be located in Tsim Sha Tsui, the central business district of Hong Kong. The location will be close to high rise buildings and offices and is also a bustling tourist destination. 

 Products 

            The products that will be offered range from submarine sandwiches, salads, desserts and drinks. The sandwiches are made with the Bus SUB’s unique recipes and unique sauces and each loaf bread is made fresh daily.

 Market Analysis 

            The company seeks to attract a wide market. Our market will consist of tourists in the central business district of Hong Kong, workers in the area, students, and office workers. A significant target market for the company is“working women”that are plenty in number around Sub BUS’location. This segment is important to the company because of their purchasing power and lifestyle. Hong Kong working women are very active, goal-oriented and assertive. They are conscious of their appearance and they health-conscious. Sub BUS products are targeted towards those individuals with active and healthy lifestyle who seek quality, fresh and healthy foods. 

 

   

 Brand and Logo Design 

            Because women make up the largest chunk of the market of Sub BUS, the brand and logo design of the company is created to make a favorable impression among women. The Sub Brand serves many functions for the company: 

 1. Identity–the brand name guides consumers when making their choice. 

 2. Practicality–the brand name summarizes information, allowing retention of information about the characteristics of the product by the association of the brand name with them. 

 3. Guarantee–provides the signature of the provider, reducing the sense of risk and uncertainty. 

 4. Personalization–the brand name allows consumers to express their individuality and originality through their purchases (Varey, 2001). 

            The Sub BUS brand is created for identity, practicality, guarantee and personalization reasons, making the company and its products closer to the market. The brand is a symbol of lifestyles and an expression of personalities. 

   

 Brand Assets, Brand Strength and Brand Value 

 Brand assets are the sources of influence of the brand. Brand strength is the result of the assets within a specific market and competitive environment. They are brand equity outcomes. Brand strength is captured by behavioral competitive indicators: market share, market leadership, loyalty rates and price premium. Brand value is the ability of brands to deliver profits (Kapferer, 2008). The company’s value proposition is that it offers high quality, healthy fast food at a reasonable price. The company’s facilities are clean and the food is of better quality than competitors’. The ambiance of Sub BUS contribute to the lifestyle of our target customers, active, healthy, fun. 

   

 Brand Identity 

            The first step of building a brand is defining what will the brand represent (or what will be the brand identity). A brand identity can be pictured in the form of a map with concentric circles, with the core defining elements of the brand in the center and secondary elements of the brand in an outer circle. Once the brand identity is identified, marketing tools can be used to build the brand (Duffy&amp;Hooper, 2003). 

   

 Kapferer’s Strategic Brand Management Model 

            Kaprefer (1992) bases brand identity on three qualities: durability, coherence, and realism. Drilling down deeper, Kapferer uses a brand identity prism to understand various brand elements. According to him“the identity prism allows us to examine the brand in detail in order to detect its strengths and weaknesses and comes up with diagnoses which could never be obtained by stumbling blindly through a mass of image research data. The external elements include the following: 

 ·          Physique describes certain features of prominent product 

 ·          Relationship is the intangible exchange between the brand and its customers 

 ·          Reflection is the customer’s image of who should use the product (cited in LePla&amp;Parker, 1999) 

 In terms of physique, the element used in Sub BUS is the bus colored in pink. In terms of relationship, the Sub BUS brand conveys‘healthy and active lifestyle”. In terms of reflection Sub BUS products spans different market segments. They can be enjoyed by all people from all walks of life. The brand is neither overly masculine nor overly feminine (despite the pink color). 

   

 Internal elements include the following: 

 ·          Personality is the brand as a person, the traits that customers see 

 ·          Culture is an overriding social principle of the brand that may also be related to its country or place of origin or its value. 

 ·          Self-image is how customers see themselves in the brand 

   

 In terms of personality, Sub BUS’personality is active and healthy. Sub BUS’culture is independence, individualism, and goal-oriented. In terms of self-image, a Sub BUS customer sees himself or herself as a goal-oriented individual with both active and healthy lifestyle. 

 The brand identity that the company wants to communicate to the consumers are“innovative, healthy, and quick service”Innovative meaning, the innovative product, location, and store design concepts of Sub BUS. The healthy image refers to the quality and healthy food selections that the company offers. Quick service refers to the service format of the restaurant as well as the innovative restaurant concept combining take-out, dine out and delivery formats. The color of the logo that was chosen was pink, attracting the primary market of Sub BUS which is working women. The word BUS is brown in color, representing soft bread and also the healthy and fresh ingredients used by the company. 

   

   

 Brand Equity 

            Brand equity can be defined as the totality of the brand’s perception, including relative quality of products and services, financial performance, customer loyalty, satisfaction, and overall esteem toward the brand (Knapp, 2000). String brands, it is argued, (1) allow firms to charge price premiums over unbranded or poorly branded products; (2) can be used to extend the company’s business into other product categories; and (3) reduce perceived risk to customers (Neely, 2002). Brand equity according to Bradley (2003) is a measure of the intrinsic utility of a brand to customers. It is the outcome of long-term investments designed to build a sustainable, differential advantage for the company relative to competitors. The key components of brand equity are brand awareness and brand image. Awareness derives from strength of the brand in the customers’memory which reflected by the customers’ability to identify the brand under different conditions. Brand image refers to the perceptions about the brand held in the customers’memory and is reflected in brand associations. 

   

 Customer-Based Brand Equity 

            Keller (1993) built a conceptual model of brand equity which is popularly known as customer-based brand equity. Keller (1993) defined customer-based brand equity as the differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the marketing of that brand. A brand is said to have positive (negative) customer-based brand equity if consumers react more (less) favorably to an element of the marketing mix for the brand, as compared to when the same marketing mix element is attributed to a fictitiously named or unnamed version of the product or service. Consumer response to marketing is defined in terms of consumer perceptions, preferences, and behavior arising from marketing mix activity (cited in Thorson&amp;Moore, 1996). 

 BrandDynamics 

            Since the company is just starting out, measuring brand equity is very important in order to guide the future strategies of the company. In measuring brand equity, one measure that can be uses is BrandDynamics. BrandDynamics was developed by Millward Brown. It is a popular equity measurement with the hierarchy effect, because of views customer attitudes and preference moving along a continuum from establishing brand presence to creating a bonded connection with customers (Goodchild&amp;Callow, 2001). 

 

             

 Each level in the pyramid represents a state in the customer-brand relationship. It also provides a distinct communication challenge, showing what needs to be accomplished to move the customer to the next level. The various stages in the model are as follows: 

 ·          Presence–a measure of brand awareness among the target group. If customers are not aware of the brand name or cannot recall its usages, the marketer should reevaluate spending levels, messages, or media placement. 

 ·          Relevance–a measure of whether customers and prospects believe the brand offers them something that is relevant to their lives. If the relevance score is low, the marketer may need to demonstrate all the uses of the products or depict users to whom the customer can relate. 

 ·          Performance–this relates to the perceived quality, durability, and functionality of the product. If customers and prospects do not believe the brand delivers on its promises, the marketer may need to validate the product’s delivery capabilities via action tests, demonstrations, trial offers, and so forth. 

 ·          Advantage–this metric determines whether the target audience perceives or understands the unique features or attributes of the brand. 

 ·          Bonding–this is the highest level of customer loyalty. At this level, the marketer wants to reinforce customers’faith in and commitment to the brand and reward their continued relationship (Schultz, 2004). 

 In terms of brand equity, particularly brand knowledge, the company as a newly-started business venture is still not as popular to the consumers as its competitors such as Subway. In terms of brand image, the company is able to clearly communicate its brand image to the customers. The image of“healthy”,“quick-service”, and“quality”are perceived by the consumers. This is because of the company’s marketing mix (product, price, place, promotion). 

 Product–Sub BUS offers a wide variety of products focusing on healthy submarine sandwiches. 

 Price–the prices of Sub BUS sandwiches are competitive and reasonable. 

 Place–Sub BUS is located in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui, the central business district of Hong Kong. Sub BUS stores are also innovative and catchy. It attracts customers because of its concept, design, and colors. 

 Promotion–Sub BUS promotes its products through word-of-mouth and fliers. In addition, the store (converted minibus) also serves as a promotional tool as it travels the streets of Hong Kong. 

   

 Recommendations 

 1. Co-Branding 

            Co-branding is a partnership technique that richly rewards business creativity. In many cases, when two attractive and compatible brand names are linked, the customer offering that results is far more appealing than either company could have created alone (Tisch&amp;Weber, 2004). Co-branding is a type of partnership relationship whereby two established brand names combine in order to bring added value, economies of scale, and customer recognition to each product. Business of all sizes, including many fast-track growth companies, are realizing the significant cost and importance of establishing brand awareness and the economies of scale that can be achieved when these expenses are shared. Campaigns and strategies to build brand recognition, brand loyalty, and brand equity have been launched by thousands of companies that recognize that a well-established brand can be the single most valuable asset on the balance sheet. This new focus on brand equity has set the stage for a wide variety of co-branding transactions. Co-branding has emerged recently as a very popular type of strategic alliance. At the heart of the relationship, two or more established brands are paired and positioned in the marketplace to bring added value, economies of scale, and synergistic customer recognition and loyalty to increase sales (Sherman, 2004).
