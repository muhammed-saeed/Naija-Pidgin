The food is average, I had a 1/4 lb hot dog. It was hot and okay, if you wish to eat outside at noon the place is fairly busy with public tables that seat up to 6 comfortably. Interesting Vero landmark...a billionaire could be sitting with a construction worker at the same table. Normal Burger and sandwich fare at average... More

This place has been a beachside cornerstone for years. The burgers here are great, but they do have other items on the menu. Like sausage and peppers or grilled chicken breast sandwich. I always get a burger. Definitely worth a visit.
