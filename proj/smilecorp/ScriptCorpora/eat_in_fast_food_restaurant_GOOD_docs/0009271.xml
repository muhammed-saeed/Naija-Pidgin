 Added on : Thursday July 12th 2012 05:00:47 PM Married in our 20&apos;s, Flip/Rent/Keep a ForeclosureTechnically, it&apos;s a short sale (needs cleaning, uncle is a home inspector) Married in our 20&apos;s, 1 infant&amp;1 toddler, In our mid 20&apos;s, we&apos;re proud to have traded a life of debt for a cash-only lifestyle in under 3 years
Paid off $13,000 in student loans/credit cards and traded our $1,500/mo car payments for a used Lexus SUVNo more car payments, student loans, credit cards!
We have prepaid phones now: saving money like there&apos;s no tomorrow$2,500/mo income but
$1,100/mo rent w/utilitiesPRICE:
$40,000 as a short sale (need advice on offer), nice neighborhood&amp;schools
$102,000-$133,000 for comparables on same and nearby streets within past 3 monthsI truly do hate paying rent, but credit scores under 600, having cash now gives us power.
So I&apos;d rather reallocate my rent money toward improving value of a home I own.Assets
$18,000 in the bank
$15,000 paid for SUV (considering giving the bank its title and using cash to get home&apos;s deed)
=
$33,000 total and parents will supplement ~$10K difference so we get deed-in-hand.It&apos;s summer, we have a big family and can do some major labor.Comparables rent for $900-$1,200Spouse is willing to do improvements for flip or even rent the place.
With no mortgage payment, there&apos;s no urgency to sell and we&apos;d gladly live there.
Ultimately, we&apos;d like a newer home, but need to rebuild our credit.We&apos;ve lived with nothing in the bank in the past.
This feels like an opportunity to make that money start working for us.$40,000 Home
$10,000 ImprovementsThe potential $130,000 selling price if we make it the nicest house on the block is enticing.
Heck, I&apos;ll take selling it for $70,000!Renting it has huge appeal. And living there with no house payment gives peace of mind.Thanks to everyone here.
Your continued advice has helped us achieve debt-freedom.This is the best forum I&apos;ve ever belonged to.Regards,
Justin $5,125 t-mobile bill on (unreported) lost/stolen phone 
 Added on : Tuesday July 10th 2012 05:00:44 PM tl;dr? Screwed up. Didn&apos;t report child&apos;s phone missing soon enough - huge bill - what do?Child, 11, has one of four phones on my T-Mobile plan, lives most of the time with mother, not in my home.
Child takes summer trip with grandparents and misplaces phone.
Phone is later believed lost on airplane, but child misplaces things all the time - plus confusion from above.
NO CALL IS MADE TO DISABLE OR REPORT PHONE MISSING
Phone is used to make $5,125 worth of calls to Liberia and Sierra Leon between 6/26 and 7/8
On 7/9 T-Mobile notices and disables the phone for me.
Wife talks to T-Mobile and they &quot;generously&quot; offer to reduce the overages to $1,400Other than &quot;pay your bills, deadbeat&quot; do I have any options? The contract is pretty clear that I&apos;m responsible for calls made if I don&apos;t report it stolen.I recognize the lesson here is stop giving electronics capable of running up 5k bills to a child, call in stolen/lost phones immediately, and disable international calling on pretty much every phone you own regardless.I suppose I already know the answer, but hope springs eternal...

 Rewriting Private Mortg 
 Added on : Thursday July 05th 2012 06:00:42 PM I&apos;m doing the research but have always gotten great advice from fw members . . .About 10 years ago, my parents had some bonds come due around the same time we were shopping for a new mortgage.
They decided that, as an investment, they would give us a private mortgage. We got lawyers and all that stuff and wrote up a nice legal document.
At the time, they were advised to give us a reasonable rate but not go nuts with something ridiculously low &apos;cause the government would look at that unfavorably.
So, we got a 6% loan, which was just fine at the time, and all&apos;s well. (One note: though they couldn&apos;t give us a special low rate, they were able to write a 40 year mortgage and that lowered our payments a great bit. If they die before the loan is repaid, we have to pay it off out of the proceeds from their estate.)They would like to offer us a lower rate, since everything&apos;s dropped so much since then, but their lawyer said that we can&apos;t just re-write the mortgage &apos;cause the government would frown on that. We&apos;re not sure why that should be an issue -- like before, they wouldn&apos;t undercut the current rates but maybe get it down to 3.75% or 4% -- and we&apos;re trying to think of alternatives. The original advisor has died, and we all happen to think this particular lawyer&apos;s not the brightest bulb, if you know what I mean, so obviously we&apos;ll talk to others as well.Anyone have any experience with this type of thing? Any particular reason we can&apos;t just modify the current agreement? They could always give us a &quot;second mortage,&quot; with which we could pay off the first one . . that seems like an unnecessary step, though.
They also said they could just &quot;gift us back&quot; the difference every few months, since that&apos;s under the amount they can give each year to our family, but I worry how that might affect some financial aid issues, if it shows up at all.Anyway, just curious is anyone has any experience or advice.As always, thanks,stu
 won $1M from lottery, how to minimize taxes 
 Added on : Tuesday July 03rd 2012 08:00:48 PM So the other day, my wife (and I!) won $1M on a Scratchers ticket. We&apos;re planning to see a CPA and possibly a (flat-rate) financial planner, but before we do so, I&apos;d like to be armed with FW&apos;s input. For now, my question is what, if anything, can we do to minimize our tax liability?
Here&apos;s the relevant info:~$650k net winnings after federal taxes (CA does not tax lotto winnings)
31-32 years old w/ no children yet (would like to retire early, if possible)
~$300k income per year, both attorneys (paid over $110k last year in state/fed income taxes)
own a home, no plans to upgrade - $410k mortgage at 3.5%
own two investment rental condos - total $225k mortgage, ~$600-750/mth cash flow positive
~$2,000 per month in student loans at 0.875% interest rates (thanks to FW and UHEAA)
two cars, owing about a total of $30k at 2.49% interest (these will probably be paid off with the winnings and no plans to upgrade)
no credit card debtWe both have been very fortunate in our lives and will probably donate/give to charities and our parents, a total of approx. $200k.
Obviously, we&apos;ll be also max out the 401k&apos;s this year. But is there anything else we obviously should be doing?Any thoughts are appreciated. I know the CPA will (should) know a lot, but you guys come up with some creative stuff. Thanks in advance.
 Summary of ideas for Flexible Spending Account (FSA) account drain 
 Added on : Tuesday July 03rd 2012 03:00:43 AM I just did a mid-year Flexible Spending Account (FSA) assessment against my $1500 that I allocated. I only have $150 that I could easily bill for in January - June 30. I thought I could submit for my insurance premiums because IRS pub 502 says it&apos;s allowed. But my company&apos;s plan fine print disallows it.So I wondered if FatWallet mavens had figured out solutions to the problem of too-much-$$ in the FSA account. Sure enough, I found a couple of topics on it. Here is my summary of excerpts across threads from several years ago. This is what I am going to probably do, after reading till my eyes went dry. I don&apos;t think these alone will get me to $1500, but it will help. Links to helpful source threads at the end.
Create deductions for: ----------- Mileage23 cents / mile in 2012 for roundtrip mileage to: - dentist
- dr
- lab tests
- optometrist
- phramacy, remember the pharmacy!
- OTC purchases from the pharmacy count!The mileage can also be very powerful - makes a stop at a Drugstore for cough drops while out for a 100 mile drive to see the parents a must do.-------------- Get scripts from my primary care physician for:

IRS pub 502: &quot;Eligible if used primarily for medical care. Will not qualify if used to maintain general health. A medical practitioner&apos;s recommendation is required stating the item is to treat a specific medical condition.&quot;(I have tested low in Vitamin D, so I know that at least should be deductible.) -------------- Vision, glasses, sunglassesZenni Optical

My ordering tips for Zenni:

They also have a 3% or something like that future off program to keep you coming back.&quot;

------------- medical equipmentthermometer

Someone also suggested a defribillator @ $1,100, which I probably would not choose to get..)---------------- Chiropractorbuy a chiropractic plan - something like a package for 12 visits.
Often you can get massages at a chiropractor, too.------------- great summary from someone: For those that are lazy, who don&apos;t keep receipts as often as they should....

I get a print out of all of my perscription co-pay from my pharmacy (YMMV)(me=CVS)in December.
I get a print out of all eligible OTC purchases that are tract using the comstomer care loyalty/savings card (from CVS website).
I take all of this and submit them at the end of the year to our plan administrator and they&apos;ve taken them in place of receipts the last two years.----------- The most fascinating possibility I noticed from reading IRS Publication 502 that I didn&apos;t see mentioned in any of the threads:http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000...Medical ConferencesYou can include in medical expenses amounts paid for admission and transportation to a medical conference if the medical conference concerns the chronic illness of yourself, your spouse, or your dependent. The costs of the medical conference must be primarily for and necessary to the medical care of you, your spouse, or your dependent. The majority of the time spent at the conference must be spent attending sessions on medical information.
------- My medical situationHere&apos;s what is legitimate. Can you think of anything else I could deduct related to these conditions that I&apos;m not thinking about?
1) Asthma
- 10 yrs ago, I needed an asthma inhaler. Now not as much unless an inside area is really dusty. But it must be prominent on my medical chart because it&apos;s the first thing my doctor always asks me about.Possible FSA implication:
- HEPA air conditioning filters with a DR script?
- a new HEPA vacuum cleaner with a DR script?
- what else...
2) Osteoarthritis
- Needed my thumb joint replaced 2 years ago (dr said I had OD&apos;d on my Blackberry). Now I use an iPHone and tap instead of press. The orthopedic surgeon took a tendon from my arm and stuffed it into thumb joint. Works perfectly now. However, &quot;osteoarthritis&quot; IS now on my medical records.Possible FSA implication:
- condroitin supplement via Dr. script
- home weightlifting equipment; dumbells?
- anything bigger in $ than that?
3) Vitamin D levels tested low last year. Possible FSA implication:
- Vit D supplement via Dr. script
4) Contact allergies
- Discovered 4 years ago I have a severe allergy to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasing agents (propylene glycol, DMDM hydantoin, Q-15, ureas). FYI for anyone out there who has been diagnosed as having psoriasis, eczema, etc...
My allergy was mis-diagnosed for a year as psoriasis and eczema. When the $100/tube (with insurance!) creams prescribed just made it worse, I said, &quot;what about an allergy test?&quot;. Turned out simply to be an allergy to formaldehyde that an allergy test conclusively showed. Like most people, I had a lot of direct contact with formaldehyde: It&apos;s in newspaper print, almost all shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions, deodorant, makeup, on the label under many different pseudonyms. I guess my body just decided &apos;enough formaldehyde for you!&apos;Within 24 hours of eliminating all direct contact with formaldehyde, the &quot;fire itch&quot; feeling I had inside of my hands and feet went away. Within a couple weeks, my hands and feet skin looked perfect. (don&apos;t remember exactly why the allergy showed up only there; the dermatologist explained that skin - palms of hands, soles of feet - is different type of skin than anywhere else on your body.)
Possible FSA implication:- Not sure. All the skin and hair care stuff I buy seems more expensive.
(ex: Glycerin does what propylene glycol does re: maintain consistency of a liquid, but manufacturers use propylene glycol because it&apos;s cheaper. It&apos;s not supposed to be in baby products though.) - When at the store, if I don&apos;t have an extra 15 minutes (exaggerating...) to read every single ingredient on the label and compare it to the list of formaldehyde synonyms on my iPhone, I just buy organic. ----Links to source threads from a couple years ago:
http://www.fullofdeals.com/forums/finance/1036982/
http://www.fullofdeals.com/forums/finance/468271/?highlight_key=y&amp;...Link to IRS Publication 502 on allowable expenses:
http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000...----Has anyone actually sat down with their doctor to get all these scripts for OTC stuff?
What was the doctor&apos;s reaction? Anything else you more creative types could think of that fits my medical situation? What&apos;s the most atypical thing you have actually been reimbursed for?
 Air India Fiasco 
 Added on : Wednesday June 27th 2012 05:01:12 PM Hi Folks..
I am kind of frustrated with a recent experience i had with Air India. Looking to Rant as well as see if i should do anything..Back in December i made a round trip reservation for my parent on a non stop Air india flight.
I specifically wanted non stop because my parents are very old and i did not want them to be bothered with changing the flights etc.
The first part (inbound) of the trip was completed successfully with no issues. The outbound was scheduled for the end of June. However on 15h june i get qan email saying all flights were cancelled and my parents were booked on a 1 stop flight on the same day. (not to mention that the start point was a different airport that was much further away from us).I called them and told then i was not happy with this but since i had no other choice i wen ahead and put in the meal preferences as well as seat preferences (the rep told me he could not give exact seat numbers, that i would get them during checkin). I was assured that i was all set for the trip.Today i just happened to call them back to find out what happens to the baggage since its a 1 stop flight and after being hung up on a few times and being put on hold at other times (hold time as long as 50+ minutes). i was finally informed that the tickets were cancelled due to a system error and there was no seats available on that flight! There was no email communication about this and if i had not called, i would have never known until check-in time! After a long venting session i was able to get them booked for a different date just before their visa expired on the same &quot;1 Stop&quot; flight. And once again i am assured that i am all set for the trip.I am really frustrated with the whole thing. I had half a mind to dispute the charge via credit card, but then backed out thinking that my parents had already used half the ticket and i did not want any further disruptions to their outbound trip. I even debated cancelling and booking a one way nonstop flight, but the prices were way to absurd.I did send them an email with all the above details and telling them i was not happy with the way we were treated.. but i don&apos;t expect a response from them.Have any of you experienced anything similar? what did you do?
 Free FirstCamera - The Camera for Kids (iPhone/iPod/iPad) 
 Added on : Wednesday June 27th 2012 05:00:31 PM FirstCamera - The Camera for KidsFirstCamera is the must-have app for kids who love to take photos. Our 5 year old daughter would always ask to borrow our phones to take pictures. We&apos;d end up with dozens of photos saved to the camera roll, mostly of cats and feet. That&apos;s when we decided to build a camera app just for her.Why kids love FirstCamera:
- Easy, big button to take pictures with a simple interface to view and play with them.
- Make your photos look silly with fun filters and cool colors.
- Color on your photos with 16 colors of paint (erasable paint!).
- Decorate your photos with stickers and speech bubbles.
- Disguise your friends with mustaches, hats and glasses.Why parents love FirstCamera:
- Photos your kids take are saved to the app, not to your camera roll and photo stream. (You can enable a &quot;save&quot; button in settings if you want to keep your kids&apos; masterpieces to your phone, but it&apos;s off by default)
- You can limit the number of photos saved to the app to keep your phone from filling up.
- There&apos;s no way for kids to accidentally email/tweet/message/print photos they take, or the photos you have in your Camera Roll.
- The delete button is off by default so kids don&apos;t lose their favorite photos by mistake. (You can enable this, and a multi select button, in settings)
- There&apos;s no location tagged on photos, ever. Your child&apos;s privacy is our highest priority.Link
 Parents want to pay off loans - but we&apos;ll pay them back - how to do it 
 Added on : Tuesday June 26th 2012 05:00:46 PM My husband and I are currently saddled with a mountain of debt from his law school degree. Each set of our parents has offered to loan us the money (100K from each of them ) to pay off the loans most of which carry with them a whopping 8.5% interest rate. His parents would charge us a much lower interest rate (3%) and give us a longer term. My parents, however, would prefer not to charge us interest and have us pay them back over a shorter term, which now of course I understand has gift, and thus tax, implications. But . . . is there any way to to do it?
 Used car dealer, bait&amp;switch 
 Added on : Tuesday June 19th 2012 12:00:41 PM My parents had a classic bait and switch pulled on them when they tried to close on selling their car. They had a signed offer and after they realized what was going on they decided to walk. As they were walking out the dealer snatched the paper out of their hands. I couldnt find anything on this dealer on yelp or BBB. I wanted to do a little research before filing a complaint and/or assault charges. Any suggestions other then ye olde Google?Yeah, I probably should let this go but please consider this: Screwing with people that mess with me or mine is a hobby. Everyone needs a hobby.ETA per request: They got a signed offer to purchase their car at X dollars. When they returned at the scheduled settlement date/time, the dealer who knew they were under a time constraint said he was only willing to do X-Y dollars because of (insert misc BS reasons here). That is when they walked out and the paper snatch occured.

 Gifting stock to non-us Citizens? 
 Added on : Saturday June 09th 2012 03:00:45 PM Hey all,I&apos;ve done some searching about the gift tax and have enjoyed the reading on the finance forum. What I could not find answered however, is how gifting to foreigners work, in particular for stock. Here&apos;s my situation:1) Parents loaned me $50K (2006) to help support me for post-graduate school. There was not a formal write-up, they just asked that when I did get a job to repay them whenever.
2) Parents gifted me ~$40K many years ago to help for a downpayment on a house. Again no formal write-up. This was a gift not a loan but I would like to repay.
3) Parents are non-citizens that do not reside in the US while my spouse and I are US citizens living here.Since I now have a job, I would like to figure out a way to pay them back. I have shares of AAPL that have appreciated and are held with Ameritrade. I would like to transfer this stock to them as repayment.1) What would be the appropriate way to transfer ownership from Ameritrade to my parents? I guess in this day and age there are no stock certs that can just be handed over?
2) From what I understand from the gift tax threads, foreign inheritances do not get taxed because the gift tax is on the gifter&apos;s end and varies from country to country. Is this the same going the other way US -&gt;overseas? If not, I would have to declare the repayment - $13K X 2 (wife + self) to the IRS? While I could never repay my parents for everything, I am not likely to exceed $1 mil or $5 mil in lifetime gifts to them.
3) What cost basis will be used? I would want to avoid selling the stock, incurring capital gains, and then paying a gift tax on top of that.Please let me know if I need to provide any additional information and thanks for your thoughts!

 Free Kindle Download Sweet Baklava List $13.99 Fun Romantic Novel 
 Added on : Thursday June 07th 2012 04:00:04 PM TextRomance novelist Mayne (Love Finds You in Treasure Island, Florida) reunites Paula Andrews, owner of a soap and candle business in Tarpon Springs, Fla., with her high school sweetheart, Nick Papadopoulos, now in the Air Force. Nick&apos;s romantic family pushes aggressively for a rematch when Nick is home on leave, plying Paula with lots of Greek food to keep her around. But Paula and Nick have some insecurities to work out, including fallout from Paula&apos;s parents&apos; divorce. Attempts to build romantic tension get repetitive, as does the Papadopoulos family&apos;s scheming (though the recipes at the end look tasty). Minor characters have similarly slack development arcs as they come to see the errors of their ways. Mayne&apos;s Christian plot elements resemble powdered sugar, sprinkled over complications to resolve them, but readers who like their Christian fiction sweet and light will enjoy this confection.

 Recourse against a bad foundation contractor 
 Added on : Thursday June 07th 2012 10:00:46 AM Does anyone know of any resources or sources of information for someone dealing with foundation work gone bad in Virginia? My parents have a minor disaster on their hands and I&apos;m trying to figure out if they have a chance of making any kind of claim against the contractor&apos;s insurance. So far my google-fu has been weak on this. neighbor suing over some cut trees 
 Added on : Thursday June 07th 2012 09:00:49 AM Posting this on behalf of my dad. I&apos;m married and long moved out of my parent&apos;s home. My dad is 86. I realize that doesn&apos;t excuse anything he did below, but PLEASE go easy on me, I realize what he did was wrong, but for those of you with older parents/grandparents you probably realize sometimes older people don&apos;t listen to wise advice and can be stubborn. He didn&apos;t stop when I strongly suggested he do so.OK.... that aside.....My parent&apos;s backyard abuts perpendicular to another property&apos;s backyard. While my parent&apos;s lot is a typical suburban 120&apos; or so, the other guy has something like 700&apos; of property depth, so his side property line runs alongside my parent&apos;s property and several other of my parent&apos;s neighbors.The stretch of his yard that abuts my parents is near the back of his property, maybe 400&apos; from his back patio. As you can imagine, he never uses his &quot;way back&quot; yard. He&apos;s older and barely gets to mow what grass is back there. In fact he tried to parcel it off and sell it to the people on my parent&apos;s street a few years ago so they&apos;d have longer lots. My parents and their neighbors listened to the offer, but it was above market, not a fair offer, and they passed on it without even countering.So in his &quot;way back&quot; yard, he doesn&apos;t do much landscaping, pruning, etc. (Of course, he doesn&apos;t have to, it&apos;s his yard to do whatever he so chooses with.) Unfortunately, it drove my dad nuts to see this wildly overgrown patch just beyond his property line. Against my advice and my mom&apos;s, he went in there and cleared out some brush, trimmed some trees, etc. Neighbor called the police and had a report done.Court summons came yesterday. Dad is being charged with:
1. Criminal Damaging - which is a misdemeanor of the second degree carrying up to 90 days jail / $750 fine, and,
2. Criminal Trespass - which is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree carrying up to 30 days jail / $250 fine.My dad is a clean guy, no record with the law, never been sued (civil or criminal) before.I myself have no court experience except for a speeding ticket a decade ago.Some questions running through my mind:
1. Should he bother getting a lawyer? I can&apos;t see the judge throwing the book at my dad. I&apos;m guessing no jail time and maybe $500 fine?? If we don&apos;t get a lawyer, I need to go help him because he&apos;s hard of hearing.2. Would any monetary damage to the neighbor be handled at this court appearance? Besides the fines which I believe go to the state (is that correct?), could a civil penalty be added that gets paid to the neighbor at this same court appearance? If not -- I assume the neighbor might be planning a civil suit in small claims as well, is that a fair statement?3. Perhaps there won&apos;t be a civil case, because what kind of value can random wild bushes or small oak trees that he didn&apos;t intentionally plant possess? His bigger trees &quot;planted&quot; these smaller trees over the decades.4. My dad has pictures of the overgrown mess before he cleaned it up. I realize that legally these pictures only prove how much he did in fact trespass and did in fact &apos;damage&apos;, but would a judge look at my dad and these photos, and at his age perhaps sympathize that my dad&apos;s intentions weren&apos;t malicious, and in reality, the &apos;damage&apos; that has been done has caused the neighbor zero harm. To some eyes the landscape work probably raised the value of his property an (inconsequentially) small amount.5. Continuing with the &quot;sympathy&quot; angle when we appear before the judge, should we mention that the neighbor might be annoyed that his offer to sell the property was rejected? He very well might be ticked at my dad and the others for ignoring his offer to sell.6. When the police report was filed and the police came to document everything, they did &quot;snoop&quot; with the neighbor in my dad&apos;s back yard. Looking at what he had stored next to his tool shed, looking through his pile of firewood and lumber. I know it&apos;s neither here nor there, but, I don&apos;t see why they needed to do this.7. Since this is a criminal case, does my neighbor do the talking, or does the city attorney handle all talking during court?8. Any use talking to the neighbor to see if they&apos;d drop the case for a settlement? Can they even drop it, at this point? The court summons reads &quot;The State of&lt;&gt;, City of&lt;&gt;VS.&lt;my dad&gt;&quot;. What about showing up early and trying to make a deal with the prosecutor, or sending him a certified letter ahead of time??Any other suggestions at all?I&apos;ll say it again - YES I and my dad know it was 100% legally wrong and that there is no justification that would permit doing what he did. The question is how to proceed.Thanks!!

 Ken Zahn Review for CFP Exam 
 Added on : Friday June 01st 2012 09:00:58 AM Please take a minute to read this entire post. I know its long, but it will help anyone considering taking the CFP exam. I took the CFP exam last year and failed. I took it again this past March and passed. As part of my preparations, I took the Zahn CFP review, which was recommended to me by a colleague. I wanted to pass along feedback about my review experience. Often times you hear or read testimonials or recommendations, which are based on opinion and not fact. I wanted to provide feedback, based on facts. I took the Zahn CFP review course and my overall opinion is that students should beware of the Zahn review. There are three main problems with the review. #1 - During the review he gives a false sense of confidence that he knows whats on the exam and it just wasnt true. There were plenty of times he would say, this will be tested and it wasnt or this wont be tested and it was tested. #2 The no free repeat policy should make anyone question why you would take a review from a company that doesnt guarantee results. #3 - The materials and database are totally inadequate to prepare for the exam. The CFP exam questions are long, with 4-5 sentences in the question stem. Zahns questions are just the opposite. Here are some examples:Lame Zahn Database Questions:
What is DNI?
What is a simple trust?
What is a marital trust?
What is a totten trust?I never saw a question on the exam that was 5 words or less. There were plenty of questions that were 4-5 sentences long, but not 4-5 words.Poorly Written Questions:
When will the spouse qualify for the unlimited marital deduction?Are you asking about a citizen spouse or non-citizen spouse? Which spouse? The deceased spouse or the living spouse? What does when mean? Are you asking about the property to qualify for UMD?
Which of the following is true?
A. It is better to pay the &quot;kiddie&quot; tax than trust tax rates if the taxable income is $2,000.
B. It is better to pay trust tax rates than the &quot;kiddie tax&quot; if the taxable income is $2,000.
C. Neither A or B is correct because it depends on the parents marginal tax bracket.
D. PuntThis is a true/false question. There are zero true/false questions on the exam. This is also an example of a lazy question. Answer choice D is punt. Thats a lazy question writer who doesnt care about their materials. The Zahn review actually charge their customers for this nonsense!Two Directly Opposite Statements Asserting both are True in the Explanation:
Answer explanation to a question regarding a simple trust: A simple trust requires that all income must be distributed. The trust is treated as a separate tax entity subject to a $300 personal exemption.
Answer explanation to another question regarding a simple trust: The trust does get a $300 personal exemption. The simple trust is not considered a separate tax entity...Well which is it? Is it a separate tax entity or not? There are plenty of other examples as well.There are a Limited Number of Practice Questions in the Database:
200 questions per subject
No mini cases
No cases at allThe exam had about 12 mini cases, 3 major cases on the November exam and 2 major cases on the March exam.Overall Assessment
The problem is if you score well on Zahns database of questions, you are simply getting a false sense of security about your depth of knowledge. Many of the questions are poorly written and few simulate CFP exam questions, which tend to have long stems, difficult answer choices and tend to be of a cognitive level above simple knowledge. For most students, practice questions with strong answer choice selections that are incorrect are important in the learning process. Zahns answer choice selections are obvious which answers are incorrect, like the punt example. Most of Zahns questions are at the knowledge level, not application, evaluation or synthesis. I cannot recommend the Zahn review given my experience with the instruction, no free repeat policy and poor materials and database.By the way, What is DNI? Do Not Invest Time or Money with Zahn!

 FREE Kindle Book - When Good Kids Do Bad Things: A Survival Guide for Parents 
 Added on : Tuesday May 29th 2012 11:00:34 AM Link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0081NA4TKProduct DescriptionIf you&apos;re looking for a book on parenting teenagers that has practical advice, written by a professional but in language that&apos;s low on jargon with a twist of humor, look no further.What many parents need, asserts Katherine Gordy Levine, is a reminder that their sullen, rebellious or moody teenager is still a good kid and that there is no one solution or style of parenting that works with all teenagers. Instead, she argues, parents need a fresh approach to communicating and negotiating with their teenagers, as they work with them, on their side, to navigate their way out of bad behaviour.Katherine Gordy Levine has worked in the fields of counselling and social services for over 30 years, and aside from raising her two sons, she and husband David also parented almost 400 teenagers as professional foster parents. This experience exposed them to dealing with the full gamut of bad teenage behaviour, from the less serious moody talk-back, pushing of buttons, and fashion dramas; to crime, substance abuse, running away and irresponsible sexual behaviour. Through dealing with these experiences, Katherine devised the Caring Response and the Caring Intervention. Rather than a one-solution-fits-all approach, these tools open the door to effective and loving communication, tailored to your own family and situation.When Good Kids Do Bad Things starts each chapter with a stereotypical scenario of a parent vs teenager discussion and goes on to provide witty and poignant examples of bad behaviour intermixed with discussing how to approach each issue. With her unique blend of wit and wisdom, When Good Kids Do Bad Things is a great read and an essential resource to dip into as concerns arise, offering advice on warning signs and when to intervene.Topics covered in the book include:
Katherine Levines Caring Response and Caring Intervention
Good kids vs Bad kids
The gotcha wars
Nose rings, tattoos and other fashion concerns
Friends that make parents lose sleep
Sexual responsibility
Lying
Criminal behaviour
Running away
Substance abuse
Depression
How and when to get professional help

 College loans - a parent&apos;s nightmare. What to do?? 
 Added on : Saturday May 26th 2012 08:51:05 PM Hello FatWallet readers.As much as I have bought over the years, I did not save enough from Fatwallet to pay for the kid&apos;s college costsMy son will be going to a state college this fall and we always thought that we would keep working and assist with costs as we go...Now, I do not need a lecture about financial planning. I wish we would have saved more, but we had the usual expenses associated with a family.His first year is pretty much set as I will use the savings bonds we have bought over the years. That along with him getting one Stafford loan and the few investments we bought for the kids, I should not have to borrow/co-sign any loans till his sophomore year.Ideally the debt should be in his name (I have 4 years to work, he has 40),but I know the PLUS loans are in the parents name. I told him he WILL be paying the loans back. I will not mortgage my future to pay off their debt.Enough of my rambling, my real questions are:1. What are your experiences with 3rd part lenders like Discover or any of the many banks that do student loans?2. I would like fixed APR&apos;s, with the economy still in the tank, I do not want the possibility of rates that could double or more if the economy recovers. 3. I am doing the research for next year when I will have to assist, but for those among you that have traveled down this road, where did you find the best rates/terms?Thanks for reading and I would appreciate any thoughts you might have.eMailmanPS, we do not qualify for any subsidized loans or any real finical aid. This is the one downdise of having a steady job (I am not complaining)
 Loan options with thin credit history 
 Added on : Saturday May 26th 2012 08:51:05 PM I&apos;m 30, married and have a 2 year old kid. I moved to the US for work in Dec 2011. I take home about 4k/month and we are a single income family. I bought a car back in Jan and took a loan for $5170 @ 15% APR. Thats what I could manage with absolutely no credit history (buy here pay here kind of financing). Unfortunately this loan doesn&apos;t even get reported to the credit bureaus. Does no good to my already non existant credit. The mistake I made was to commit to a 6 month EMI at $917/month, in the hope of killing the loan fast.Here is the problem. My monthly expenses:
Rent - 895
Car EMI - 917
Car Insurance - 165
Utilities - 150
Cable/Internet/Phone - 135
Support dependant parents back home - 400
Living expenses (Food+Baby+Gas etc.,) - 750
CC payments back home(Min Balance) - 200Total - $ 3612/month.So I figured I should be ok. But there were a few incidentals and a medical emergency that creeped up to my CCsDebts:BOA secured card (Limit 800) - balance = $275
Capital One (Limit 500) - balance = $380CC Balance back home (no longer use these) - $ 2702 @ 47% APR (no typo here - 47%)
Personal loan back home - $3600 @6% APRSavings - 0So Far I have been paying my BOA and CO CCs in full, including this month. But this is really a tough month for me. I am starting this month with a near 0 balance after the expenses and previous CC bills. I totally see more spending on the CC. For next month I&apos;m looking at $700 + CC bills, which is going to impact my expenses. I have 2 more EMIs left on the car.This is my situation. I am sorry about the lengthy post. But I am really looking forward to some advice and wanted to give you folks as much as relevant details to work with. I really don&apos;t have enough spending history to get any credit info from the free credit score sites. But creditkarma showed me a score of 621. No dings or late payments, but there is simply not enough in there.I spoke to DCU to refinance my car for 8K (the car is eligible for that amount). I figured that way I can kill all my high interest loans and the rest of my car loan in one shot and pay it off in smaller manageable EMIs in 24 months. I spoke to their CSR and she told that they don&apos;t deny loans to anyone ( but she sounded so uninterested that I&apos;m having a tough time taking her word for it), though the APR may go upto 9.5% depending on the credit score. I guess I&apos;ll be in a way better situation even at that interest rate. Here are my specific questions:1. Will I be able to get this DCU loan approved with my credit history? (I don&apos;t want to apply and get denied and take a hit on my credit)
2. Is there any other institution that will approve credit for someone with a history like mine?I was really looking forward for a fresh financial start this year and not make the mistakes I made in the past. So I am open to any other suggestions/Advice you have for me to get into better shape. Thank you if you made it through this far of my rant!
 Transfer of house title concerns 
 Added on : Tuesday May 22nd 2012 12:09:48 AM Hi all,I am completely clueless about the house/mortgage stuffs. My dad passed away few years ago. My parents owned a house in California. My mom is thinking to transfer the house title to under my name. The house is still has mortgage (50K more) (I can pay upfront $50k to complete the mortgage loan, if needed).1. What&apos;s the best/easy way to transfer the house ownership title without hiring attorney?
2. I heard I need to pay some portion of tax? How much will that be?
3. The annual property tax will raise up upon transferred? They bought the house so cheap at the time and is there anyway to &quot;maintain&quot; this property tax level annually?Thank you! Parents Magazine on sale for $3.23 at Best Deal Magazines.

 Added on : Wednesday May 16th 2012 06:10:03 PM Disclaimer: I have been a long-time member of Fatwallet, but for personal reasons I didn&apos;t want to associate this post with my regular name.Here&apos;s the deal. I have a family/financial issue that I am not sure how to deal with, and I thought it would be best to bring to you all, my most financially-saavy friends. Short story: I feel that my father is gambling my parent&apos;s retirement savings on a few very risky stocks. He is quite stubborn and is not the type to take advice from anyone. He had a string of good luck with his stock-picking in the past, which is likely why he feels that he will be able to beat the averages. He is a good father, but this has been driving me nuts. He has a background in accounting, which makes it even harder to believe that he is taking these kind of risks.Long story: In 2008 my father correctly timed the market bottom by a few months. He moved ALL of his/my mother&apos;s retirement savings from diversified mutual funds into individual stocks. The number of stocks that he is in at one time varies from 5 to 10, though usually it is heavily weighted towards two or three. His investment strategy was one of picking stocks that had been beaten down by the market.For a while, this strategy worked REALLY well. From his initial starting point, the money had quadrupled by mid-2010. I believe he came to view himself as an expert capable of strategically selecting stocks at this time. Since then, it has been on a downhill slide and today stands at a number just greater than his initial starting point.I have spoken to my dad about diversifying on a number of occasions, but my dad seems pretty convinced that he can do better than the market. If the money was only my father&apos;s I would have no problems letting him do his own thing with it. That is not the case, however, as my mother is nine years his senior. My mom is an amazing person, but her financial savvy is limited to things like getting deals on groceries, etc. I do not believe she fully understands the risks of her portfolio, and she does not want to get involved with what she views as my father&apos;s territory.My father is now retired at age 63 while my mother is still working at age 54. My parents live a middle-class lifestyle and could be perfectly happy without a ton of money. It seems like there is very limited upside happiness-wise if the stocks do well, but there could be a lot of pain and suffering if they do not. Has anyone here ever dealt with a similar situation? Is this any of my business to begin with? Thanks in advance for your help with this.ConcernedSon Kelty TC 2.0 Transit Child Carrier $81.93+FS

The CitiKitty cat toilet-training system gradually transitions feline friends from litter box use into the realm of polite bathroom society. After placing the litter-filled training seat basin beneath any toilet seat, cats start getting adjusted to sitting atop the loo. Pet parents remove each ensuing training ring over the course of three to six weeks until their pets fully assimilate to sand-free thrones, though an additional insert can be used to revisit previous stages in the event of training setbacks. The eco-friendly system saves pet owners time and money, and it relegates litter to other thankless duties such as combating beach erosion. The system can be used to train multiple cats at once, and it&apos;s safe for adult cats and kittens as young as three months. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
Five-step system teaches cats bathroom etiquette in three to six weeks
Removable rings to gradually reduce amount of litter used
Training seat can be easily removed from toilet for human use
Rids houses of litter and cats of shame
Safe for kittens three months and older
Designed for cats weighing up to 25 pounds

Traditional Home Help with Transferring Land from Parent to Child 
 Added on : Friday May 04th 2012 03:03:50 PM First let me say thank you for the help!Background. My wife&apos;s parents own 33+ acres in Kansas (I&apos;m guessing land is going around $2000/acre) that they are letting us build a house on. It&apos;s time to get the land in our name and I want the least amount of tax problems as possible.The attorney we talked to wrote the deed up as a gift from the parents to my wife. I did not know this and when I read it it threw up a red flag of TAXES, TAXES and more TAXES. The attorney says &quot;you won&apos;t be paying any taxes as it is gifted. Plus, there is no way of the IRS finding out.&quot;I then called a CPA friend that says &quot;we should have her parents gift $24000 worth of land to us now. Have it surveyed off then when they pass the rest is passed on to us. That reason is the land is valued at $2000 now and in 20 or so years it may be worth $8000 meaning if we ever sell the land was obtained at a higher price so you will pay less taxes.&quot;Another friend I called that does taxes says &quot;they can gift it to you now and there will be no repercussions on taxes. It will be on the sale of the land that you will pay the taxes.&quot; Meaning a huge tax bill if we ever sell. Which we don&apos;t plan on doing, this house we are building is going to be our forever home.Just a throw in, if you know, does Pen Fed do 0 closing costs with a construction loan. Or do they do construction loans? I&apos;ve been meaning to call them but this thread got started first. We are borrowing about 165000 to build this 200000+ house. We have 45000 for the down payment.Thanks! Free service to detect child ID theft

 Added on : Monday April 30th 2012 09:04:06 PM I&apos;ll be graduating in May with a degree in Marketing and Finance with 2 years of internship experience in the marketing/communications fields. I have a few good job prospects (three of which I just finished 2nd round interviews).I don&apos;t know the exact salaries being offered, but I know they are in the low to mid 40&apos;s (I&apos;d assume 41-46k). I am from the Chicagoland area and all these positions are located in the suburbs. I grew up and my parents are still in the western suburbs. Anyways, I&apos;m trying to figure out what to do as far as savings / living expenses. One of the positions is located about 20-25 minutes from my parents house. I already have discussed with them the possibility of living at home for a year or so. We haven&apos;t come up with a solid number, but $500/month for food/utilities/rent seemed to stick out in our discussion. This would save around $600/month if I rented by myself. The other two positions are located 50-60 minutes away, assuming traffic is flowing, if not, then 75-80 minutes each way. I wouldn&apos;t mind that commute over the summer, but in the winter, I wouldn&apos;t want to do it. I&apos;m an active person (I run and bike a lot), so spending two hours in a car a day when I could be using that extra hour to work out seems wasted. Also, with the two other jobs, I would be incurring an extra $150/month in toll and gas expenses.I&apos;ve thrown this example budget, assuming I live on my own. If I can find a roommate (which I would like to do), I would take that option, lowering my monthly expenses by around $300/month. I&apos;m not sure what I would do with the excess income. Probably save 50% of it, and then maybe use the leftover for short-term savings. I have about $18,000 in the market/bank with no debt. Am I missing anything that stands out?

 Added on : Monday April 30th 2012 09:04:06 PM I own a home. I pay for it via a home loan. I have normal homeowner&apos;s insurance.In a couple of months, I plan to buy another home, and make it my primary residence. I have gotten a quote on this from the insurance company (USAA), and it looks fine.However, I plan to rent out my old home to my parents. Their rent is higher for a smaller house, so this is a win-win for both of us. The homes are literally 20 mins from each other.I asked the insurance company how much my premium would change (thinking it would go lower), and was told that it would actually increase by 30 dollars (from 620 to 650) for a landlord policy.Is there a different accepted method of doing this? Could I keep the second home as a second home, and somehow reduce the cost of insuring it? I am not asking to do anything illegal or unethical, but it seems strange that for less coverage on my rented home, that it would be more expensive.Any ideas? Thanks! Family member related question 
 Added on : Sunday April 29th 2012 12:02:59 AM This is a finance related question. I&apos;m 28 years old and I&apos;ve had my mom follow me over the years and live with me (post-college) because we don&apos;t own a home and she&apos;s not qualified to get a decent job. My parents are divorced FYI and unfortunately there are no other outside family members she can stay at (nor does she want to as it is probably uncomfortable)To recap, after college I got a 2 bedroom apartment in the city where I landed the job and she stayed with me for 2 years. After this she moved back to our home country and she stayed there for a bit. I moved to another city for a new job. She wanted to return to the US so I got another apartment with no roommates so that she will have a place to stay. She&apos;s not qualified to get a job outside of being a waitress, cashier, etc. During her stay here, she got a job at a grocery store but it was in a bad neighborhood and something bad happened. She got another job as a waitress but there was some tension with the manager so she quit. I&apos;m 28 years old now and I don&apos;t think I can do this much longer. I&apos;d much prefer to get roommates to save money or live with others to experience that more and also for each of us to lead our own lives. I love my mom to death but I feel like she&apos;s waiting for me to buy a house or something which is not going to happen for a while. I suppose my salary has gone up a bit since I graduated 4 years ago but my job is not stable at the moment and I might be unemployed this year. FREE Sample of Parents Choice Advantage Infant Formula

 Added on : Saturday April 28th 2012 03:02:17 AM This may opposite from the usual &quot;should I lease/buy a new car now because I don&apos;t trust my old car anymore...&quot; thread...My wife and I do well career wise (net income currently at $167,500), although we do still have a significant debt level (all in, without mortgages, about $67,000) at the age of 40. Just a little preface, I love working on cars, and have worked on them since I was 9 years old, although I don&apos;t do it for a living. I owned a shop for a few years in the 90&apos;s, but gave it up once we became homeowners.I bought a car last year (out of boredom) that needed an engine for $750, a 2000 Pontiac Bonneville SSEi, with 140,000 miles. It had its transmission rebuilt at 131,000 miles. After much work, the car is running great, with my total investment currently at $2,000. It may take another $1000 to address issues such as Air Conditioning and rust on an area in the rear of the car. I&apos;ve been driving it back and forth to work, a 50 mile round trip, without issue for the past two weeks.My other daily driver is a 2004 Toyota Camry with 49,000 miles. I got this car from Florida while on vacation last year, for an incredible price of $6900, back when it had 40,000 miles on it. Incredible ownership history, it was purchased by an old couple from Canada as a condo car that they used during their winters. They took great care of it.I could get around $9,000 out of the Camry, and $3,400 or so out of the Bonneville. My gut feeling is to go for the higher dollar amount, but everybody else thinks I should keep the &quot;reliable&quot; Toyota.Worst case, if I need a car temporarily, my parents have a spare in their garage that I could use.My wife has a 2010 Town&amp;Country with 16,000 miles, so we do have a reliable family vehicle under warranty.Thoughts?

 Added on : Tuesday April 24th 2012 06:07:36 PM Guys, I&apos;ve been an avid fatwalleter and sticking in true fashion would like your opinion on this.
So I have been saving for several years, and currently living with my parents. I am now looking for an opportunity to own real estate for investment purposes, and just came across the idea of a multifamily rental property.My original idea was to purchase a 1/2 bedroom apartment [100k-150k] and rent that out for a positive cash flow. But what would you guys suggest about purchasing a mulitfamily rental? I am fairly hardware oriented and can repair basic plumbing [toilets, faucets, lay tiles, paint] I was looking at properties within 20-30minutes of where I currently live and the specific one I am looking at is a 6 unit property at approx $850k , and is rented out at below market rates.Even with the current rentals the income if rent is paid is approximately $5k per month. Any help would be appreciated
My statistics are below:rent $0
expenses $1k per month gas, insurance, food, entertainment
income $7k per month

 Added on : Monday April 23rd 2012 03:24:13 AM Long story short, you can get tomtom VIA 1505T for $81.99 with current online PM discount and trade-in offer.Regular price in BB is $179.99. Lowest on google shopping is around $100 (Amazon has the base model for $81, this has lifetime traffic). BB has a trade-in offer going on from 4/8/12 - 5/5/12. Bring in your old working or non-working GPS and get $50 toward 3 particular tomtom GPS units. I brought in an old Garmin my parents gave me and at first was denied the $50 off the on-line price match ($131.99). The manager said the $50 is off the regular price and I&apos;d have to pay $129.99. I told her this is not mentioned anywhere and to show me where they can&apos;t price match AND give the $50 off. She couldn&apos;t, only telling me that since the computer won&apos;t let her, it&apos;s against BB policy (Btw, I smelled BS immediately). After checking the website when I got home(Link), I called back to tell them the online ad says &quot;Plus, get your GPS trade-in value, AND ADDITIONAL SALE PRICE SAVINGS&quot;. Went back to the store and got the GPS for 81.99 + TAX.Best Buy Coupons Need help managing my cash 
 Added on : Monday April 23rd 2012 03:09:05 AM Hey everyone. First of all, let me say hi. I see my dad uses this site often, so I thought I&apos;d ask for some financial advice. I am&lt;18 years old. I am fortunate enough to know several programming languages and know how to apply them in the IT setting. I was about two weeks ago able to get a job working for a moderately sized company. My income is about 36k before taxes. The contract was finalized on Friday. My parents went over it with me and signed off. I will be working about 50 hours a month. Currently, I have an AMEX Blue card, and a Perksteet Financial bank account. My college fund is at Wells Fargo and is about 6 grand. I need some help with trying to save as much cash as I can. I will only be working for this corporation for two or three years. I am still in high school. Can anyone please advise me with the best way to save this money and gain as much in interest as possible? What do you advise I do to not blow most of the cash buying crap I don&apos;t need?Thanks,
Askingaroo Parents willing to pay off student loan questions ? 
 Added on : Friday April 20th 2012 03:07:39 PM Hi,My parents have offered to pay off my loans.I understand they(mother/father) can both gift myself/wife $52K [($13*2)*2 ] .
I also understand that I cannot setup a 529 and payoff the loan through that for tax benefits.Therefore, my question is what is the best way to go about this.
I have $60K in loans and am in Illinois.Can I have my parents co-sign for the loan and get some tax-interest benefit? vs. If I take the gift and payoff, do I get the tax-benefit?Further, I plan to pay my parents back, say $6K per year for the next 10. Would it be better to formalize that as an explicit loan? I understand then I would lose any tax interest benefit as it would be a personal loan, and my parents would have to pay tax on any interest they would charge... but are there any other angles there I am missing?Finally, most likely, the money I payback my parents, they will just leave for me as inheritance... should I restructure that somehow, say just put it into an IRA. They would be fine with any account I pay into, even if it is just my own retirement account. So if you were forced to save $60K in some kind of payment plan scenario, how would you do it to max benefits ?Any and all comments are appreciated.Thanks Taxes on borrowed money 
 Added on : Thursday April 19th 2012 12:09:07 PM Hi all, I&apos;m a long time lurker with a question. I&apos;m considering taking a loan from my parents to assist with buying my first house. My parents would be using a home equity line for the loan and I would pay them back loan amount + interest. What are the tax implications of doing that? Would I need to pay taxes on the loaned amount? Investment advice needed !!!! 
 Added on : Tuesday April 17th 2012 09:08:01 AM My daughter is going to turn 2 this May, and her grandparents gave a generous gift of 25K and we would like to make a smart investment that would help her in the future.

 Added on : Thursday April 12th 2012 12:02:56 AM On this, I&apos;m completely out of my element. Any advice is appreciated. This is in Maryland too.I recently listed my home for sale, and was rather surprised at how much activity there was, and that I was under contract in 2 days. That&apos;s the positive part of the story.Unfortunately, I learned a lesson about selling to first time homebuyers where their parents are paying for their first home, and said parents are home builders, and homebuyer&apos;s agent is a family friend. It&apos;s been a nightmare since - they&apos;ve turned every stage in the sales process into an arduous negotiation. I can&apos;t break the contract, and even if I could, I signed it and should have to live by it.Most recently, the agent threatened me that if my home is not in &apos;move in&apos; condition as per the purchase contract on the final walk through before closing, I could expect lawyers to get involved, and they would pursue me to the end of the earth. That would be a fair statement, except my home is updated top to bottom and all the systems are new, and the fact similar comps in worse condition sold for less than I did (mainly b/c of the stress of trying to sell a home with 2 toddlers we were willing to sell for less than market prices because they allowed us to rent back). Even the buyer&apos;s ace home inspector, who is an employee of the father, could only find 2 very minor repairs in the inspection.So I&apos;m a few weeks from closing, and the buyer&apos;s agent has been making steady but passive threats to my agent. Nothing in writing, and while my agent is at wit&apos;s end too, she&apos;s never encountered this either.My goal is not to avoid closing - the home will sell. My questions are as follows:First, what should I do to protect myself on the final walkthrough? The buyer&apos;s agent and buyers&apos; parents have made clear they will decide what working order is, and they will be bringing inspectors to the final walkthrough. Is this all some sort of bluff? I mean, if the air conditioning works, can they legally demand $$ and not close because they want the home to be cooled faster than the A/C actually cools (based on inputs from their inspectors)?It doesn&apos;t make sense to have my own inspectors, that&apos;s going to cost a fortune, and in that case I may as well bite my tongue and just give them whatever $ they want so we can close. Should I have a lawyer present?My second and more important question is whether I have a case to try and get the buyer&apos;s agent&apos;s license revoked. All along the way, she&apos;s been deceptive and lied, in both written communications and in contractual ones. As an example, after the home inspection, the buyers had 3 days to come to any agreement on repairs. Failing to sign anything means they accept the home in as-is condition. At about 10 PM on the 3rd night, the buyer&apos;s agent emailed my agent to say the sellers (me) better grant an extension on the inspection deadline, because the sellers (me) lied about the working order of the house (false statement) and also, the buyers were out of town for the weekend and wouldn&apos;t have their response to the home inspection until Monday morning.The following morning, the buyer&apos;s agent forwarded a whole thread of her communicating with the buyers throughout the weekend along with their response to the home inspection pre-dated to say &apos;Friday&apos; despite in the thread, the buyers and agent talking about times to meet on Monday morning to sign the inspection response.That&apos;s just 1 example.I&apos;d be glad to provide more details, but the bottom line is unethical agent making my life hell, threatening me with lawsuit and action if I don&apos;t do whatever she or the father of the homebuyer want. I&apos;d like to see to it she never works in the business again. TIME OUT New York KIDS -- Two Year Sub $10 (Living Social Deal)

I have 2 choices. Leave money in Outside US or bring it to US. Main reason, I do not wish to bring money to US is not have all of my money in one place.

 Added on : Sunday April 01st 2012 03:06:47 AM dad=70, mom=60dad collects social security and a pension.
mom is working as a teacher&apos;s aid and will be eligible for pension (as well as early social security) at 62.they have no debt and noone relys on them financially. (they did a good job w/us kids.)
they paid off the mortage a few years ago. the house is worth ~$500k now.
they live pretty comfortably and take LOTS of cruises every year.my dad had a health scare this year but he&apos;s ok now.that got me asking about estate planning but parents are sticking their heads in the sand. they dont want to think about the other dying.my fear is them being scammed. they&apos;re immigrants and trusting and somewhat gullible.
ie: dad got talked into geting his timing belt changed on his car that only had 37k miles. (warrenty is over at 36k.)
&quot;and while the engine is open, might as well change the water pump too.&quot; $700 total
there was nothing wrong w/the car.
my dad speaks pretty good english, mom not so much.How do i get them to do some sort of estate planning?
What type of person should they talk to for advice? estate planner? lawyer? cpa?
Where to start looking for one? and what credentials to look for? (They live in NYC if this matters.)and when one parent dies, what to look out for to prevent the other from being scammed when s/he is most vulnerable? How to assist aging parents? (tax-benefits, gift tax, HSA, etc..) 
 Added on : Sunday April 01st 2012 03:06:47 AM I know FWF has threads for gift-tax, HSA, etc., but I just want to learn which benefits I can take while assisting my aging parents.Background:
My parents are over 55, but under 65.. Father still works, mom is a house mom. No insurance. Father has a small business.
We are not on any government welfare program (don&apos;t qualify), and we are a typical middle-class family in California.
I do NOT live with my parents, we are in different states. We are not a broken family, and I love my parents .
Family financial situation got pretty ugly during the market downturn in the past 5 years.
I pay for some of their bills. And give them about $5k ~$10k a year in cash.Question:
Is there anyway I can reduce the cost to me or the parents? I don&apos;t mind giving them the cash, but I hate to be overlooking tax-advantages (for them or me) if it exists. I want to prepare myself for 2012 (I know it&apos;s already April).What I was thinking for now:
HSA.. I found out that you need a health insurance to open a HSA. I am thinking about buying some cheap low-cost catastrophic insurance for them, so I can open a HSA account for them. Father just has a $20k dental implant done. I figure I could open insurance -&gt;HSA -&gt;put in $7150 for 2011, $7250 for 2012. And use the HSA to get reimbursed for ~$14k and deduct the rest on his 2012 tax return.What else can I do? My mom is a stay-home mom. I was thinking MAYBE there&apos;s a way to have my father file taxes as single and having my mom as my dependent. I make more $ than my father, and maybe I could add my mom under my company insurance?Also, I bought them their cars. I know it&apos;s probably too late, but for the future, can I file for tax-free/deductible gift? For example, if a car is $30k. I gave them $30k, the car is under my father&apos;s name. If I file $30k as gift, does my father have to file $30k as his income? I need to watch Shawshank Redemption again to see what Andy says, I guess.EDIT: spelling and grammar Wedding Planning - the FWF way! 
 Added on : Saturday March 31st 2012 06:08:19 PM Kudos to jd2010 for the idea. This is spawned from my thread here.This thread is meant to be become a compilation of ideas/strategies for a meaningful, enjoyable wedding experience without the [expected?] extravagant spending.My fiance and I are getting married the first week of May. We don&apos;t really have any debt except her student loans, but they&apos;re quite large, so we live and spend with that in mind. We both wanted a small, private, personal wedding experience without breaking the bank. We budgeted $5000 to be split between the Wedding ceremony/reception and our honeymoon. Initially we meant to split it straight down the middle, but after initial planning we realized our we wouldn&apos;t need the entire $2500 for the wedding (and probably not even the entire $2000). Our wedding day is a Sunday, if that makes any difference. Neither of us are planning on having a bachelor/bachelorette/engagement party.Some of things we did:Invitations: For our invitations we purchased a bundle of blank cardboard beer coasters and had two stamps made, one for each side. The front side is the invitation to our reception, the back side is just a couple of beer mugs clinking together with a quaint little phrase on the back &quot;Hoppiness is happiness....to a well fermented life together!&quot;. We also included a small card with instructions on how to RSVP (we setup a gmail address just for that), a note that we weren&apos;t registered anywhere, and that if our guests wanted to bequeath us with a gift we&apos;d prefer it in the form of gift cards. We already merged households so we really didn&apos;t need anything, and we figure we can use gift cards for things like groceries. We used plain #10 envelopes printed off our home printer, and used card stock we already had on hand, also printed at home.
Cost: $75 including postageCeremony space: We wanted an outdoor wedding ceremony. We went to several places to get quotes including local Wildlife Park (would have been very cool, but cost out entire $2K budget for the afternoon), botanical gardens (again would cost our entire budget), hotel banquet halls (entire budget), etc etc. We finally decided on a public park in our city&apos;s downtown district. It is a nice little park with a water feature, gazeebo, and nice gardens. We will between 15 and 20 people at the ceremony and are bringing some folding chairs for guests to sit on. We expect it will last about 30 minutes.
Cost: $0Reception space: Pretty much ran into the same issues as with the ceremony space. Everyone was charging what we considered outlandish prices. We wanted our reception to be very casual, nothing fancy, just a time/place where the rest of our friends and family could come, say hi and wish us well, have a drink and some food, and be on their way if they wanted. We settled on a pub located above the local Brewery/Restaurant. We get the space from 10:00am to 10:00pm, enough food for 100 guests, and one beer for everyone (anyone is at their own expense).
Cost: $600 including food and drinksOfficiation/License: My future brother-in-law is going to officiate the wedding for us. The state we live in does not require any sort of credentials to officiate a ceremony. It is considered valid as long as the couple make a mutual declaration that they take each other as husband and wife.
Cost: $50Decorations: In keeping with our frugal/easy theme we&apos;ve been washing and saving glass food jars which we will place on the tables in the pub with sand and tea lights inside. We&apos;re also going to put some simple, white paper tablecloths over the tables.
Cost: $20DJ/Music: We&apos;re bringing our iPod to the pub and hooking it up to the sound system.
Cost: $0Photography: We already have a really nice DSLR camera, so our original plan was to have one of our more photographically inclined friends take some pictures using our own camera. Now, however, fiance&apos;s parents want to pay for a professional photographer as a gift to us.
Cost: $0 either way.Cake: A former co-worker of my fiance&apos;s does cakes/baking on the side. Last year for a family member&apos;s birthday we asked if she could try making a sea salt caramel cake. She&apos;d never made such a cake but decided to give it a try and it turned out amazing. We&apos;ve been giving her organic eggs from my parent&apos;s farm for the last couple of months as part of the payment for the cake. It is going to be a three tiered cake with simple decorations.
Cost: $50Bride&apos;s attire: Fiance had dress made by a tailor on Etsy.com. It is a simple halter top dress, but the cool thing is that it is reversible so she can wear it as a normal dress after the wedding. She also purchased a Bolero from Etsy to accesorize as well as a paper parasol.
Cost: $250Groom&apos;s attire: White Converse, dark wash jeans, and a nice dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up
Cost: $100Rings: We wanted something simple, but unique. We settled on a couple of custom made Damascus steel rings from a seller on Etsy.com. Even simple titanium/cobalt/ceramic rings locally were priced outrageously. The only downside to the Damascus is that the rings can&apos;t be resized.
Cost: $350 including engravingFlowers: Bride&apos;s bouquet is going to be made of hydrangea. Very pretty, in season, and cheap!
Cost: $20TOTAL COST: $1515
I still feel like I&apos;m forgetting something. We have a month to go so I&apos;m sure some unexpected costs are going to raise their heads here and there, but that is the gist of it.We were engaged for one year and started planning things at the end of last Summer just to give us enough time in advance to make sure we would be able to get the spaces we wanted. It is a lot cheaper to have your wedding Monday - Thursday than Friday - Saturday. Many of the spaces we initially looked at were considerably cheaper during the first part of the week. Of course it is also difficult to have a wedding then due to people&apos;s work schedules. Part of the reason we&apos;re getting our reception space so cheap is that the place is that the pub upstairs is normally closed on Sundays.There are a lot of very talented artisan&apos;s on Etsy.com that can produce very high quality, made-to-order items at very cheap prices.We both agreed that this day was supposed to be for us, not our guests, so extravagant spending, or planning based on the wants/needs of anyone but ourselves was wasteful and impractical. I&apos;ve been to many weddings in my life, and I can&apos;t remember one where the event made any sort of memorable impression on me. Our experience has been that most people just want to give the couple their well wishes, eat some food, see family/friends they may not have seen in a while, and then get home to change out of their uncomfortable clothes. We also didn&apos;t want so much going on that we couldn&apos;t enjoy/remember our own wedding! Easter Egg Grab w/Prizes Free Admission kids 2-10 at most BOSCOVS Stores Sat 3/31 (ck for hours, etc)

 Added on : Sunday March 25th 2012 09:03:30 AM My parents went to a free tax preparer to help do their taxes this year. Their tax situation had become less complicated from 2010 to 2011 as they entered semi-retirement. I looked it over and it seemed ok, but some things bugged me. 1. The tax preparer used 1040A instead of 1040. There were amounts under line 7, 8 and 14a. They had 4 W-2s (4 employers). The tax preparer only attached 2 of the W-2s, but the amount on 7 did total wages from all 4 W-2s. I noticed that the W-2s not attached did not have Federal income withheld. So is the tax preparer cutting corners here? Does the IRS find it acceptable to do this? If I had prepared it on my own I would have attached all 4.2. In 2010 there was a capital loss (from short term trading) of over 10K of which only 3K could be recognized. So there&apos;s more that could be recognized this year, but, even without that loss, AGI was low enough that Standard deduction + exemptions reduced taxable income to zero. If this loss is not reported in 2011 can it still be used in the future? If we wanted to report it, we would HAVE to use a 1040 instead of 1040A? No trading was done in 2011.3. In 2010 they sold their business (sole proprietor) for a loss. The form 4797 was used. With that loss the 2010 AGI was -20K. What can we do with that this year if anything? Within the 2010 tax return I found a page that says NOL Carryback Election. Under IRC Section 172(b)(3), the taxpayer elects to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to the regular tax and AMT net operating losses incurred during the current tax year. The 2010 tax return was prepared by an accountant. But as I read this now it sounds like we were screwed. What options, if any, do we have with this? Does this loss affect how the 3K capital loss should have been handled?Thanks Six Flags Magic Mountain park ticket w/ Buffet Access - $54.99 (April 1 only) ..would have been $61.99 + food 
 Added on : Saturday March 17th 2012 12:26:22 PM My daughter&apos;s friend is inviting their group to go to Six Flags this April 1 as it looks like there is a special ticket being offered that gets you:
- full park and attractions access
- buffet meal
- a concert show being offered by a groupThe parents of the friend are going for the special event/ concert and the kid is tagging along.
Although my daughter is not interested in the concert (as is her group of friends), the $54.99 sounds like a good deal considering their &quot;bottomless&quot; lunch is already included in the ticket price. Better than the $61.99 regular park price + food purchases.Details and ticket info here: Six Flags Magic Mountain April 1 ticketI didn&apos;t see this elsewhere but thought it is a good deal for the spring break coming up.

 Added on : Friday March 16th 2012 06:04:53 PM Hello Everyone:I have a question on whether to include my daughter&apos;s (1 year old) interest income (~$200) with our tax return or filing her own tax return. She obviously has no earned income Per this IRS Link, since her interest income is less than $950, she does not have to file her own return. Does that mean the amount should be included in our return (parents) (Turbo Tax does not have such a option)? If not, how does this get reported/documented?The 1099-INT has only her name and SSN. I am a joint account holder on the account due to her age (i.e. both our names appear on the account statement)Thanks for your help!!!

 Added on : Monday March 12th 2012 06:04:07 AM My parents would like to give me chunk of money (around $40,000) to put towards my student loan debt. I would like to get this money as quickly as possible, but at the same time don&apos;t want myself (or my parents) to lose any of the money to taxes. I know the 2012 gift tax limit is $13,000. Any idea if it would be legal for my parents to give my sister and I $13,000 each at some point this year, then have my sister turn around and give me a $13,000 gift? The rest of the money would have to wait until January 2013, but at least I could get all the money towards my loans within about 9 months, rather than over 3+ years.In the alternative, anyone have a better idea for getting this money applied to my student loans even faster and with less hassle (i.e., could my parents just write a $40,000 check to the bank without us having to pay tax)?I appreciate the help.

Should I stop opening credit cards? (21 year old w/ 8 cards) 
 Added on : Wednesday February 29th 2012 03:21:42 AM I currently have 8 cards showing on my credit report plus 3 canceled ones. Here&apos;s the breakdown of my cards:Cards only in my name (6)
1. US Bank - $500 limit - 5 years old
2. Discover Miles - $5000 limit - 2 years old -- ($200 mile bonus)
3. Chase Freedom- $4000 limit - 6 months old -- ($250 bonus)
4. BofA - $1000 limit - 3 months old -- ($250 bonus, 12-month 0% APR)
5. Citi Diamond Preferred - $4000 limit - 2 months old -- ($200 bonus, 18-month 0% APR)

2 Citibank cards - both had $4000 limit - cancelled 1 year ago
1 BofA card - had $800 limit - cancelled 5 months ago (old Schwabb card)I also recently took out ~$8,000 in subsidized student loans, interest free/no payments until graduation, which I will then pay in full. Should I keep taking advantage of additional credit card offers or will it effect me negatively in the future? I always pay the minimum payment for 0% APR cards or the full balance for other cards. There are some more Chase card offers that I&apos;m considering applying for. I just wanted to see what you guys thought of my current situation before I did so. Thanks!The only things I am worried about:
1. Employers requiring credit check - My score on CreditKarma is currently 720.
2. House/car loan - don&apos;t plan on getting one for at least 5 years.
3. Not being able to open new cards! Where to invest 30-50k that is safe? 
 Added on : Tuesday February 28th 2012 09:18:30 AM My wife has about 30-50k she would like to get some gains out of. BUT it has to be almost zero risk. This is money to pay for her parents funeral and she is risk adverse.Right now I can get her into Pen Fed credit union, I work for a DHS group, and was thinking doing the 4year CD at 2%, maybe 5k in the 1year just in case. Divide it into several 5k CDs that way if she needs to break early she only loses the last 6monts of interest. Not sure what other options are for safe gains that could beat 2% right now?Thanks Travelling abroad for more than a year, what would you do(in terms of finance)? 
 Added on : Tuesday February 28th 2012 09:18:30 AM My girlfriend gave me the idea during new year&apos;s eve while we were telling each other about our new years resolutions. She came out with a piece of paper that listed around 30 resolutions most of which were crazy such as meeting Oprah . My resolution(being a lazy bum in general) was only to complete an olympic triathlon. She laughed at me and asked me what are some of my goals in life. I mentioned I&apos;ve always wanted to spend a year traveling aboard ever since college but never could find the time between grad school and work. She then asked what&apos;s stopping me now? That question struck me dumfounded... Try as I might, I couldn&apos;t think of a single reason to prevent me from doing this. A week later(after my parents stated that I was insane), I informed management of the plan.So I&apos;m leaving this summer. For reference, I&apos;m a 32 year old single male without any dependents or financial obligations(such as school loans or mortgages). I&apos;m not looking to work during the trip. Here are the following things I will be doing/have done already.-Leave for the trip when the apartment lease expires
-Switch mailing address to my brother
-All of the banking and credit card statements are already paperless
-Already have schwab account for free atm withdrawals and also CapitalOne credit card for 0% etf. I have tried obtaining a chip and pin credit card but no one in the US seems to issue it.
-Transferring 401k to an IRA
-Donating the vast majority of furniture. They&apos;re not worth selling considering they were either goodwill items or the cheapest ikea item I could find. The most expensive furniture is the futon and frame which was about $200 brand new 5 years ago
-Donating vast majority of clothing
-Giving most electronics to my family. I have quite a bit thanks to an unhealthy gadget obsession
-Rent a small storage facility and keep some mementos. Don&apos;t want to take up the family&apos;s space with junk.
-Obtain travel medical insurance
-Sell the motorcycle
-Need to decide what to do with the ford fiesta I bought a year ago. Should I sell at 25% loss or ship it to my brother for keeping? If keeping it, I would still need to pay for insurance and registration.I&apos;m planning to come back to the US so running up tons of debt and ditching is out of the question. What would you guys do in addition to this? I&apos;m young and own my house free and clear. I live next to a peeping Tom. I need to rent out my house. 
 Added on : Tuesday February 28th 2012 03:19:14 AM My grandma passed away last away last summer.Right before Christmas, I, the granddaughter, moved in after my parents gave me the house. Since then, the house has been joyous and party-like.A few cars routinely park here; two in the garage, and two in the street. When we&apos;re having a party, there are a few cars parked on the street that my nextdoor neighbor offered to have visitors park on his grass on his side of the property line.He says that every time my lawn service comes by, the mower blows a crapload of cigarette butts into his yard.He chooses not to open his windows on at least two of three days because, according to him, the prevailing winds blow a sickening stream of tobacco and weed smoke across the property line into his home. He claims that there is somebody here lighting something up every 15 minutes from sunrise until about 2 AM.Our parties are kinda loud but not disruptive. We party no more than two nights a week.Despite clear and well-lit house numbers, my sober friends occasionally accidentally stumble up to his door looking for the party. The idiot neighbor next door comes over to bother me, but it&apos;s never about anything normal. He sometimes ask for condoms or Playstation controllers, but sometimes like a cup of sugar or a wrench.I&apos;ve reached the tipping point. My friend was banging a chick, once, in the jacuzzi and my peeping Tom neighbor claims that he was just enjoying a nice night on his deck, when I look over, he was drooling. My friend gave the idiot a thumbs up out of embarrassment but he chose to watch some more.I&apos;ve asked them nicely on several occasions to be respectful. I&apos;m always told they&apos;ll &quot;try to keep the peeping down&quot; when it comes to the jacuzzi. When I point out the parking, he says I&apos;m on his side of the property. The complaints about the cigarette litter are even worse. He insists it could be anybody&apos;s cigarettes, which is laughable. The first time he talked to me about the litter, he was smoking at the time, and tossed his butt into the bushes, completely oblivious to all traces of reality.There is no HOA, but this is a nice neighborhood. Zillow estimates the house&apos;s value at just under $400k, but I&apos;m sure their AVM doesn&apos;t take into account the current infestation.I&apos;ve made two peeping complaints to the police, both of which have done nothing. I don&apos;t expect code enforcement to be any better.Do I have the legal right to something to prevent this peeping Tom from bothering us? or must I take other steps first before having the offending person booked?I&apos;m really out of options here. The cops don&apos;t care about misdemeanor peeping, and even if I called them, the response time is so bad that the giggling peepers would already be inside and into their second bag of Doritos before any blue showed up on scene to give them a stern talking to and a minor fine.This is a huge hole in my pocket, as I am planning to put this property on the market as a rental in another three months. No family is going to want to live next to this peeping Tom.I am not old enough to shake my fist and order them darn peepers to quit looking into my lawn.I&apos;m considering adding another camera to my home surveillance system, and pointing it at window. Maybe if I can get a bong or some nookie on tape I can use their guilt/paranoia against him.Is it worth simply bribing him to shut up and keep the peeping down when the house goes on the rental market? I shouldn&apos;t have to, but if nothing else works I might have no choice.Do I bring a Geritol and Depends over, pretend to party, and hope to see something more than walkers and canes which the police will care about?What tactics are effective in dealing with these menaces to a future rental?Is a nuisance this bad something which must be disclosed to prospective renters? Free Kindle Book Brainwashed - The System Set out to Persuade You - List Price $29 
 Added on : Sunday February 26th 2012 06:49:07 AM http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-system-set-persuade-ebook/dp/B...Years ago, when you were about four
years old, the system set out to persuade
you of something that isnt true.
Not just persuade, but drill, practice, reinforce and, yes, brainwash.
The mission: to teach you that youre average; That compliant work is the best way to a reliable
living; That creating average stuff for average people, again and again, is a safe and easy way
to get what you want.
Step out of line and the system would nudge (or push) you back to the center. Show signs
of real creativity, originality or even genius, and well-meaning parents, teachers and authority
figures would eagerly line up to get you back in line.
Our culture needed compliant workers, people who would contribute without complaint,
and we set out to create as many of them as we could.
And so generations of students turned into generations of cogsfactory workers in search
of a sinecure. We were brainwashed into fitting in, and then discovered that the economy wanted
people who stood out instead.
When exactly were we brainwashed into believing that the best way to earn a living is to have a job?
I think each one of us needs to start with that.
Over time, the benefit of working for the man and following a manual as a compliant cog is going
to go down, while, paradoxically, the difficulty in getting a decent job will go up.
We just lived through a few generations of huge companies that got bigger, giant bureaucracies
that got bigger and white-collar jobs that got farther and farther away from actually making
something that a customer might buy.
And then, pretty suddenly, that faded. Unemployment goes up, downsizing happens, layers of fat
disappear and the idea that you could get a good job, indoors, paid well, doing not much except
watching the dog that bites the pilot if he messes with the autopilot... well, those jobs are gone.
Is that it? Are you done? Is this the end of the road, the best its going to get, the beginning
of the end?
Same job, but more work, less pay.
Same industry, but less growth, no challenges.
Same path, fewer options.
Its entirely possible that youve trudged as far as you can go on this road, and that the slog is
just going to be more of the same. Possible.
But I dont believe it.
Why?
Because theres more leverage, more degrees of freedom and more opportunity today than ever
beforeif youre up for the choice.
The new industrial revolution (the one were living through, the one thats changing everything) has
opened doors for anyone (or certainly anyone with enough resources and education to be able to
read this document). If youve got the time, the intellect and the access to get your hands on an idea
that spread as this manifesto did, then you have the ability to reinvent yourself, regardless of what
you do, who you do it with, or what the people around you expect.
The pillars we grew up with (things like General Motors, TV, the postal service, retirement, top
down media and commodities) are disappearing and are being replaced with entirely new
ways of interacting, making a living and making a difference. Not just for organizations, but
for individualspeople like you. http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-system-set-persuade-ebook/dp/B... I#039;m living next door to Animal House - Need to rent out this property 
 Added on : Saturday February 25th 2012 06:22:05 PM This is one for the resident landlords and informed property owners. As far as applicable law is concerned, I live in the state of Florida.My neighbor passed away last summer.Right before Christmas, his college freshman granddaughter moved in after her parents gave her the house. Since then, the house has degenerated into a wretched hive of scum and villainy.Four cars routinely park there; two in the garage, and two in the street. When they&apos;re having a party, there are so many cars parked on the street that it becomes a safety hazard. Sometimes the visitors park on the grass, sometimes on my side of the property line.Every time their lawn service comes by, the mower blows a crapload of cigarette butts into my yard.I can&apos;t open my windows on at least two of three days now, for the prevailing winds blow a sickening stream of tobacco and weed smoke across the property line into my home. There is somebody there lighting something up every 15 minutes from sunrise until about 2 AM.The parties are freaking loud and extremely disruptive. This isn&apos;t one of those generic &quot;I can tell they&apos;re playing some kind of music complaints.&quot; I can feel my glass vibrate and occasionally I can make out the lyrics.They party at least two nights a week.Despite clear and well-lit house numbers, drunken/stoned idiots occasionally stumble up to my door looking for the party. The idiot residents next door come over to bother me, but it&apos;s never about anything normal. They&apos;ve asked for everything from condoms to Playstation controllers, but never once anything normal like a cup of sugar or a wrench.I&apos;ve reached the tipping point. I was just enjoying a nice night on my deck, when I look over at the animal house, only to see one of the residents banging a chick in the jacuzzi. Rather than show a normal human emotion, such as embarrassment, the idiot gives me the thumbs up and keeps hammering away.I&apos;ve asked them nicely on several occasions to be respectful. I&apos;m always told they&apos;ll &quot;try to keep it down&quot; when it comes to the noise. When I point out the parking, they blame others, then tell me they&apos;ll talk to their guests (who never listen). The excuses for the cigarette litter are even worse.

----------------------------------- 
Update (Feb. 25):Last night was hectic.After calling the tow truck, I called the other neighbors who are sick of the hijinks at Delta House and we all coordinated calls to the police per the instructions I received earlier. I then made a call to my buddy&apos;s buddy on the force.The tow truck arrived and hooked the offending vehicle. As I was chatting with the tow truck operator, a screaming psycho chick stumbled out of Delta House and came over to my driveway, screaming to both the tow truck operator and myself to unhook her vehicle. Not surprisingly, she reeked of booze and smoke.Upon coming closer, her belligerent attitude calmed down a bit when she saw I was openly carrying on my property and wearing a vest. She asked if I was a cop.After pleading with me to unhook the vehicle, she went back to Delta House, and came back a minute or so later with the owner. It turns out the parking offender is the 17 year old sister of the head ho in charge next door. Classy.Maybe 10 or 15 minutes after the offending vehicle was hauled away, the police arrived on the scene in two patrol cars.The cops went up to the neighbor&apos;s door and some idiot invited them inside.About half an hour later, the police emerged with two men in cuffs, one of whom is a resident next door. I spoke with one of the cops, and it turns out they found weed, mushrooms, ecstasy, and scales, so the offender had to take a ride for that. Another guy had a bench warrant. The rest of them were ticketed for underage drinking. The HHIC was also ticketed for the noise.Results: coordinated complaints work. Establish a history of problems with a particular property, then coordinate simultaneous complaints from the neighborhood when a party gets especially out of hand.I doubt these neighbors will be much trouble going forward, at least for a while.It&apos;s a bummer that somebody had to have their life destroyed on felony drug charges, but that isn&apos;t my fault. If they would have respected the neighborhood&apos;s quiet at night, kept their trash off my property, and exercised a little more courtesy with regard to their cigarette addiction, then none of this would have had to happen.The windows in my office are open and have been open most of the day. Not one single smoker has emerged from the house to foul up my air. Victory is sweet. Tax Expert help regarding 1040X (Tax Amendment) 
 Added on : Friday February 24th 2012 12:13:52 AM Hi, I tried to call IRS, but all I got is please hold and endless transfer. So while waiting for another IRS person to speak with, I figure to see if there is any tax expert that can answer my concern. All of this are for 2011 Tax return
My parents just recently filed their 1040 using &quot;Married File Jointly&quot; status, even only one of them have income. By doing this, it prevents me from claim one of my parents (the one without income) as a dependent and Head of Household. (btw, I am qualifying for all the requirements)
So I helped them to amend their tax return as &quot;Married File Separately&quot; status. By doing this, my Mom would ending up owing some tax to the Federal, the amount which I am happy to pick up the tab. Now the problem is, 1040X amendment takes 8-12 weeks according to the IRS website, and the only way to file it is thru mail (no e-file option for 1040X). While waiting for my parent&apos;s amendment goes through, I still can&apos;t file my federal tax correctly (using TaxAct claiming 1 dependent. Does that mean I could wait up to 12 weeks before the system recognize there is a change in my parent&apos;s filing status, and till then I can file my tax correctly? I don&apos;t want to go over deadline for this. Should I just mail my federal return in paper?Any advice? Thank you very much. And I will keep you guys updated once I talk to the IRS person. First Time Buying a House and Credit Questions 
 Added on : Monday February 20th 2012 09:16:49 PM Hey everyone, so have been looking at houses recently and found one we really like. It&apos;s a new construction around 280,000 in upstate new york, been on the market for about 2 months. We then met with our financial guy from the realty place and setup the preapproval process.My wife and I had our credit scores checked and all three of mine came back over 800 but hers came back at 639. Wasn&apos;t sure why cause when we got our apartment hers I remember was over 700 two years ago. I pulled her experian credit report and she has been linked to her parents two credit cards for a long time (which I think was helping her score for a while but I&apos;ve noticed now that her parents have been paying for her other sisters college and things and the two cards she&apos;s linked to have both been at or over 50% for numerous months over the last 2 years, and basically now there we can see that those two cards are carrying balances of about $23,000 month to month which I think is really hurting my wife.) So my question is since these are her oldest two cards are her best options:1. Seeing when her parents plan to have these paid down and stay linked to the two cards.
2. Cancel her accounts on those two cards (they are her two oldest accounts)
3. Cancel those two accounts and link her to my 3 credit cards (no balances on them, and about $20,000 credit line total for the 3)The guy said my credit and income were good enough to be pre-approved on my own for a rate of 4% even with 1/4% point fee. That seemed pretty good to me and we will be putting down about 10% since we also need to pay the property taxes etc etc. (we have about $35,000 to $40 saved) and PMI until we reach 20% paid off.Does that seem like a good rate and fee?one last question for anyone with experience. If we make an offer on this house that&apos;s listed at 283,900 is 260,000 a fair first offer or is that too low/too high.Thanks everyone for all the help. Free Kindle Book Get a F**king Job

 Added on : Wednesday February 15th 2012 09:18:09 PM This is one for the resident landlords and informed property owners. As far as applicable law is concerned, I live in the state of Florida.My neighbor passed away last summer.Right before Christmas, his college freshman granddaughter moved in after her parents gave her the house. Since then, the house has degenerated into a wretched hive of scum and villainy.Four cars routinely park there; two in the garage, and two in the street. When they&apos;re having a party, there are so many cars parked on the street that it becomes a safety hazard. Sometimes the visitors park on the grass, sometimes on my side of the property line.Every time their lawn service comes by, the mower blows a crapload of cigarette butts into my yard.I can&apos;t open my windows on at least two of three days now, for the prevailing winds blow a sickening stream of tobacco and weed smoke across the property line into my home. There is somebody there lighting something up every 15 minutes from sunrise until about 2 AM.The parties are freaking loud and extremely disruptive. This isn&apos;t one of those generic &quot;I can tell they&apos;re playing some kind of music complaints.&quot; I can feel my glass vibrate and occasionally I can make out the lyrics.They party at least two nights a week.Despite clear and well-lit house numbers, drunken/stoned idiots occasionally stumble up to my door looking for the party. The idiot residents next door come over to bother me, but it&apos;s never about anything normal. They&apos;ve asked for everything from condoms to Playstation controllers, but never once anything normal like a cup of sugar or a wrench.I&apos;ve reached the tipping point. I was just enjoying a nice night on my deck, when I look over at the animal house, only to see one of the residents banging a chick in the jacuzzi. Rather than show a normal human emotion, such as embarrassment, the idiot gives me the thumbs up and keeps hammering away.I&apos;ve asked them nicely on several occasions to be respectful. I&apos;m always told they&apos;ll &quot;try to keep it down&quot; when it comes to the noise. When I point out the parking, they blame others, then tell me they&apos;ll talk to their guests (who never listen). The excuses for the cigarette litter are even worse. The owner insists it could be anybody&apos;s cigarettes, which is laughable. The first time I talked to her about the litter, she was smoking at the time, and tossed her butt into the bushes, completely oblivious to all traces of reality.There is no HOA, but this is a nice neighborhood.

Improving Credit File 
 Added on : Wednesday February 15th 2012 03:14:41 PM Hi,I have been a long time reader of FatWallet, especially for the finance section, but have made very minimal posts. I am actually a 21 year old medical student and was recently working on my financial situation and thought I would take some input from the community to see if I am doing the right things now or if I can improve on some of my ideas. I am trying to get in the best financial shape before I graduate medical school so I can get loan interest loans for cars or refinancing my student loans. Here is a summary of my current credit situation and what I have done so far. 1st credit card is an account that I am an authorized user on, the credit card shows up on my credit report as if it were mine. Account has been open for 12 years with a credit limit of 10,500, the account is through discover2nd credit card is an account that I opened and has been open for 3 years, Citi Forward card, credit limit of 4,000, never asked for a credit line increase3rd credit card is an account that I opened and has been open for 2.5 years, Chase Freedom card, credit limit of 3,000, never asked for a credit line increase4th credit card is an account that I opened about 1 week ago, American Express Blue Cash card, credit limit of 3,000My parents have mostly financed my education up until now but I am not sure if I would take out student loans in the future. I currently have 20,000 in all subsidized student loans. The interest loans vary from 3.5-6.8 depending on when the loans were taken out but at this time they are all subsidized so that is not an issue. My credit card balances add up to about 1,200 but the balances are all paid off in full each month. A normal month would have a balance of around 600.My CreditKarma score shows as 735 and when I recently got my American Express card they told me my FICO score was pulled at 757 (but it may have gone down slightly because my credit report was pulled)I have had one other credit card that was a Macy&apos;s store card which I actually closed, should have just left it open, but it was only open for 6 months before closing. I have no other debt at this time but also have no income (besides the potential money I could take out in student loans). I have never financed a car loan or any other loan but was not sure if it would be a good idea to open some type of line of credit at my bank or anything of that sort to help improve my credit file. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. COMCAST INTERNET $9.95 (MUST HAVE AT LEAST 1 CHILD ENROLLED IN FREE LUNCH PROGRAM)

 Added on : Monday January 30th 2012 09:02:53 PM Hello FWers. My wife&apos;s uncle recently passed away after suffering a broken hip, arm, and separated shoulder stemming from a fall in my MIL&apos;s house. He was very frail at the time of the accident which is why it took such a toll on him. He was handicapped and lived in the house with my wife&apos;s parents. He died about a week after the fall and the death was ruled an accident due to the fall. I&apos;m sure there is some differences with each policy, but I am hoping that policies are generic enough that you guys might be able to give me some help. My question is simply can my MIL file a claim with the insurance company for accidental death? The agent is coming out Friday to talk to them and his preliminary statement is that they can&apos;t file a claim because they would, in essence, be suing themselves. I will call her tomorrow and get more information on her policy if required. I am woefully ignorant in this area of personal finance so I thank you all for your insight!

 Added on : Thursday January 26th 2012 03:14:05 PM I&apos;m a college student and will be losing eligibility on my parents&apos; dental plan soon. For the time being, I won&apos;t have a job that offers dental benefits. So I need to decide what the best/most frugal options are for dental care.When does it make sense to get dental insurance? I&apos;ve had my wisdom teeth pulled, orthodontic work done in the past, and had some fillings (kicking my soda habit), but there&apos;s a chance I might need 1 or 2 more in the future. Is it a possibility to have a (high-deductible) policy for &quot;catastrophic&quot; events, not just routine dental care and minor work?If I don&apos;t have dental insurance, what are my best options for regular cleanings/checkups, and other procedures if necessary? Here&apos;s possibilities I&apos;ve thought of:
- Dental schools: i&apos;ve heard these are a good option to get dental work done inexpensively. There&apos;s 2 of them in my metro area. Any opinions on this? Actual price (vs dentist), hurdles to getting service (income restrictions, waitlist, etc), or quality of work?
- Negotiating with dentist: how possible is it to negotiate a good deal from a &quot;conventional&quot; dentist if I&apos;m not paying with insurance? Can I get a substantial discount on the &quot;sticker price&quot;, maybe a little like uninsured folks do at the ER? I know it&apos;s not going to be 90% off or anything...i.e. they&apos;re not obligated to treat you as the ER is and often prices aren&apos;t so absurdly inflated (no $20 tylenol).
- Mexican dentist (for major work): this is only really a possibility if I&apos;ll need major work done, which is unlikely. As I understand, medical/dental professionals in other countries do pretty good work at a much lower price. You&apos;d probably have to be talking $4000+ worth of work to make it worth the travel cost, time, and risk.
- Offers at Groupon (or similar): some dentists run offers for cleaning/x-ray/etc at a good price from time to time. But i&apos;d be concerned about going to such a dentist. They do expect some return from selling their services at a loss on Groupon, and i&apos;d think they would be more likely to push unnecessary procedures.Any thoughts? Thanks all! REQUEST: Best way to travel around the world 
 Added on : Wednesday January 25th 2012 03:00:02 PM Have any of you guys done an Around the World trip?I am thinking of getting a new job or going back to school in September and was considering taking 1-2 months off to travel around the world. I have begun reading blogs and looking into airfare and see an easy option is to buy a single &apos;around the world&apos; ticket. This allows you to create a bunch of 1-way tickets around the world. The costs range from 4-10K. The other option is just use my miles and mix/match airliners for the best &apos;1 way&apos; deal.Here is a short lists of things i need to research, can anyone give me input on what i&apos;m not considering&amp;ways to save money?Facts
~ 1-2 Months off
~ US Citizen living in northeast
~ Keep total costs&lt;$10,000
~ Mid twenties male- no health concerns, traveling alone for majority of it
~ No set destination besides London&amp;Australia(I have friends/free housing here). I hope to visit at least 5-10 other countries along the way.Issues/Research items
~ Visas (is there an easy way to do this, or do i have to apply each individually at the embassy)
~ Healthcare (I will be unemployed&amp;too old to go onto parents coverage) I believe i am eligible for Cobra when i quit. Is travelers insurance a better bet?
~ Costs - I still haven&apos;t decided if one &apos;around the world&apos; ticket is better or mix/matching and using miles (I have 100K BA miles)Other
~ Have good credit- will get a card that doesn&apos;t charge FX fees
~ 100K BA miles, 150K Hilton, 50K Miles various other airlines
~ Willing to do hostels
~ Only fluently speak englishThanks for your help I&apos;m sure if/when i go i will update my thoughts/lessons learned during my time. Taking out loans for college, good idea? Also getting value. 
 Added on : Sunday January 22nd 2012 06:17:23 PM Let me preface this by saying I think undergraduate college is a huge bubble in this country, and I think students and parents are getting scammed for huge sums of money. Here is my personal story and why I am posting right now. I am going to be very specific about schools and costs.
My relative has a full ride to University of Connecticut, certainly a good school, but obviously not IVY. She is clearly very smart, full rides are rare. My feeling is that anyone who graduates from a school like UConn, and distinguishes themselves with good grades and impressive activates, can compete with anyone for any job coming from a very good private school. Now here is the rub.My relative decided to go to Boston University, a good private but very expensive school. In my mind, networking opportunities aside, I dont see BU as that different of a school than UConn. The difference is cost, however, is roughly $130,000. To make matters worse she is studying to become a teacher.
I think her parents gave her very bad advice, and I am sure this same scenario is being played out all over the country. She is not getting value for her $130,000. Moreover, this debt will saddle her for a good part of her entire life. She is paying for the experience of Boston, and she is too young to realize how high a price she is paying. At $60,000 a year, I think a fair estimate of what she can expect to average over a 10 year teaching span, that debt and interest can easily represent 40% of her entire take home pay. College costs are crazy, and way too many people are going to college. I think the old liberal arts degree is going to be a thing of the past. I went to the University of Michigan, obviously a great school, but again not IVY. If I wanted to send my kids there from out of state it would cost me over $200,000! They can literally go FCK themselves! God help you if you are middle to upper middle class and want to send your kids to school, be prepared for them to want all your lives savings.
On a side note, since Obama has taken office the amount of school debt, a debt that can never be discharged and will follow you to the grave, had doubled! We are saddling our kids with debt at their most vulnerable point in life. Be prepared to live with your grown up kids well into their 30s if not longer. Trying to understand the difference between ordinary income and investment tax rates 
 Added on : Wednesday January 18th 2012 09:12:19 PM I tried to post a question that&apos;s close to this one in another forum. Unfortunately people that are replying to it I don&apos;t think have the same knowledge as those that read this forum. So I&apos;m going to try to ask the question here.If a person works all his life, or his parents WORK all their life and leave their kid some money, isn&apos;t that &quot;ordinary income&quot; that will be taxed at the &quot;income&quot; tax rate during the &quot;working&quot; years?From there the person would have two choices. Spend their money, or save and invest it.Now if they decided to save and invest it, they would pay &quot;capital gains&quot; tax on it, right? And that rate is around 15%.So if this person who invested became a multi-millionaire and most of his/her annual income now came from his/her investments, then they would be paying 15%.So why does everyone get so upset about this? They feel that the multi-millionaire shouldn&apos;t pay only 15% capital gains tax and that it isn&apos;t fair.Why is that?????Also for the person that spends their paycheck they only pay state sales tax on what they purchase (6% in my state). Yet the guy that invests pays 15% on gains. So the &quot;investor&quot; is still paying more than the spender.Am I thinking of this right, or am I missing something?Thanks everyone!

 Added on : Friday January 13th 2012 06:22:21 PM ZarBee&apos;s Cough Syrup was developed by Dr. Zak Zarbock in 2008. As a practicing pediatrician, Dr. Z noticed parents were confused about which cough medicines to give to their children. Dr. Z only used proven, all-natural ingredients when formulating ZarBee&apos;s and it has paid off. Parents want a simple ingredient list wit...h ingredients they know work. More pharmacies and pediatricians are now recommending ZarBee&apos;s to their patients and retailers are adding ZarBee&apos;s to their cough and cold aisles. Dr. Z&apos;s vision of offering parents the safer, more effective cough syrup is becoming a reality as parents and professionals are discovering the difference between ZarBee&apos;s and the other cough syrups out there.

 Added on : Thursday January 12th 2012 06:19:06 PM I will make this short and sweet (I tried). My wife was on disability and became employed. Requested that they stop paying her. Paid her for over a year. She put in savings account. They finally stopped paying her and requested all the money back. They paid her until the end of 2010. She paid them back in 2011. She paid taxes on both full time wages and social security in 2011. She just received IRS reporting form showing the repayment during 2011. Is she eligible for repayment of over paid taxes from last 2010 year or an adjustment for 2011 tax year. She used her parents accountant last year and he had nothing definite to say about the situation, but had a fancy projector and all bound up nicely documents. Last tax year we were unmarried and this we are married. I do my own taxes but need to figure out her special situation.If there is a better sub forum or an entire forum that is better for this type question I will gladly ask there also. Thank you. Parents don&apos;t have to pay dead son&apos;s debts 
 Added on : Sunday January 08th 2012 12:10:34 AM Dear Real Estate Adviser,
My friends&apos; son committed suicide, leaving a huge financial mess. He owned his own home, which will go to them once it clears probate (he was single, no children). My friends have their own home and cannot afford to maintain a second. They will have to sell it, but the son&apos;s house is seriously underwater. What options do they have?
-- Tessa
Dear Tessa,
My condolences to your friends and their family for their loss
Unless your friends served as co-signers, they are likely not responsible for their deceased son&apos;s mortgage. Unlike some other countries, there is no &quot;feudal bondage&quot; here that obligates people to honor financial arrangements made by adult members of the immediate family. One exception is the obligation of spouses to their husband&apos;s or wife&apos;s mortgage debt in some community property states.Expanded answer is here. How can anyone actually get a good career through college? 
 Added on : Saturday January 07th 2012 12:07:32 PM I am very confused how anyone be even reasonably confident of getting a good career through college? It just seems like such a huge gamble with the odds against you.I know so many people that are worse off going to college, than if they didn&apos;t. Because after getting out, they only end up in jobs making like $15-$18 an hour, and have $40k+ in debt with accruing interest. I don&apos;t really know any people personally who have got their degree and went on doing something they like, and making $60K-$120K a year, like the popular belief is supposed to be.I look through the course brocures at community colleges, and 90% of the so called courses they will teach, are in fields that do not likely pay well, like baker, child care, mechanic, etc. Sure, maybe major universities are better, but unless you are lucky as a child and your parents run a good college fund, the average person can&apos;t just put everything in life aside to go to a university mid point in their life.Also, many fields that seem to require degrees have such widely ranging payranges, that how are you supposed to have a clue what to expect? I&apos;ve &quot;heard of&quot; I.T. guys, network programmers, etc making 6 figure incomes, but ones I&apos;ve met make dirt. There are a lot of fields like that where you don&apos;t know if the pay will be $10 an hour or $40, since its so widely ranging.Most colleges to me seem more concerned about taking your money, since they are a business, than actually getting you into a good career.I&apos;ve worked quite a few jobs without college, and generally would make more than anyone I knew with a 2-4 year degree. Generally jobs could range from $20-$35 an hour. Currently at about $35, however I don&apos;t really like the career, and its also being hit hard by the economy, not getting full hours. I&apos;d be willing to take night classes, get a degree, etc if I was reasonably assured that I would be successful in getting a career that pays at least $30-$40 an hour, but it just seems to me like the odds of that are slim, and the more likely outcome would be racking up massive student loans, finding out that whatever claimed lucrative field I studied, only has low paying jobs available.How does anyone win this gamble? Need 6-wk car rental in Harlingen, TX 
 Added on : Friday January 06th 2012 12:00:02 AM I&apos;m trying to help my parents save on a long-term car rental in Harlingen, TX, Jan 10-Feb 21. Best rate I can find is National at $27/day for smallest economy car. I have tried to add various coupon codes I&apos;ve found here and other sites, but National rejects them all saying codes are not valid for that rental length of time. Any suggestions to beat this rate of $27/day = 1142 for 6 weeks? Buy Orlando theme park tix online, or in hotel? 
 Added on : Wednesday January 04th 2012 09:00:07 AM We are going to be in Orlando for 9 days starting on Feb. 11. We are considering going to a number of theme parks while there:Universal (just the two of us, before our kids arrive with my parents)
Disney
Sea World
Legoland (we already have tickets for this, buy 1 adult, get 1 kid free deal) I&apos;m guessing that the buy 1 get 1 free deal we got for Legoland is unlikely to be available for Disney or Sea World online in the next month. In fact, I barely see any discounts on Disney for 1 day, so I&apos;m guessing we will probably pay full price no matter what. I have seen Sea World tickets online discounted to as low as about $74. I&apos;ve seen Universal 2 park 1 day tickets for about $110. I was originally going to buy all the theme park tickets ahead of time, but a friend told me I would be better off waiting and buying tickets from the hotel&apos;s ticket counter in person. Have you folks found this to be the case? I guess the downside of buying ahead of time could be that we get burned out on theme parks, and end up going because we feel like we HAVE to, since we&apos;ve already paid for the tickets. I&apos;m wondering if maybe we should wait until the hotel so we can simply buy tickets when/if we feel like going. If anyone has bought Orlando theme park tickets from hotel theme park ticket counters, I&apos;d love to hear about your experiences. Thanks! Sandwich a RT fare in the middle of another RT fare. Is this allowed? 
 Added on : Monday January 02nd 2012 09:00:07 PM Hi,
I&apos;m thinking of accompanying my daughter to Houston to drop her off to her grandparents. She will be there for about 2 weeks. Can I buy a RT in the middle to save money (and time)?Example:
DC to HOU (1st RT) Saturday
HOU to DC (2nd RT) Sunday2weeks later- Pick her up
DC to HOU (2nd RT)Saturday
HOU to DC (1st RT)SundayIs this allowed? Should I go with different airlines? Does TSA or Homeland security frown onthis? Anyone done this? Thanks. Car Taxes and Leasing 
 Added on : Friday December 30th 2011 06:17:08 PM Hey All,Long time lurker here. I am currently living in NYC without a car. I&apos;ve kept my texas drivers license throughout my time here. I&apos;ll be moving to Baltimore in June for a 1 year job. After that I don&apos;t know where I&apos;ll end up. I will be needing a car once I move out of the city. I was looking at the infiniti g25. I saw on Edmunds that if you register a car in texas, there is no sales tax on the lease. http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.ef9da24/6622#MSG66...So since I still have my parents address in texas and my tx drivers license. If I could take advantage of this deal now to avoid paying costly sales tax in MD (6% on the final sale cost of the car, like $2200). Could I do this? Is it legal? I don&apos;t see the point in switching to a MD drivers license if I know I&apos;m there only temporarily. Haven&apos;t been able to get a straight answer by searching. Thanks. Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread - 2011 Edition 
 Added on : Thursday December 29th 2011 12:10:59 PM Greetings and Happy Holidays to All! It&apos;s time to get the 2011 Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread rolling. I started doing these threads annually on the FW Finance board in 2006. When I originally started this thread five years ago, I thought it could serve as a great resource for people to learn about the ups and downs of various careers, including information such as salaries and benefits. I have always found these threads particularly informative and interesting.Last year&apos;s thread seemed to have a lot of good information, even though it only stayed active for a couple of months. Hopefully this year&apos;s thread can remain active for longer. Now gang, here&apos;s a reminder of the rules, which 99.9% of you have been great at following over the past four years:If you participate, please try to keep this a positive, informative thread, and let&apos;s not get into any arguments about how one&apos;s career/education/compensation makes him/her superior/inferior to other people. Contribute as much or as little information as you&apos;re comfortable sharing, but please be honest so that this may serve as a truly informative thread for people mulling their career options.So, now that the ground rules have been set, how did your job go this year? Did things go well or not so well? How well were you compensated for 2011? Did the poor economy have a serious effect on your career? Maybe each person can give a brief description of themselves, their job, their education levels, and their salaries, present and maybe even projected salaries for the future. As always, since I&apos;m starting the thread, I have to bite first:
Gender: MaleAge: 39Location: Northern NJOccupation: Urban Educator (My fancy title for a teacher in a city of low socioeconomic standing)Education: M.A., plus 33 additional credits2011 Compensation: $90,000 (Base Pay + a little extra money taking on extra duties.) Base salary for the 2011-2012 school year is about $88,000 right now, but should be more, since we do not have a current contract right now. (More on that in a minute.) My compensation this year is pretty much the same as it was last year, although last year&apos;s figure was inflated a bit due to a pretty large amount of retro pay due to me.Future Salary Projection: When our contract is settled (very soon hopefully), my base pay should be in the 100K range. This is the top of the teachers&apos; guide in our district, so future raises are going to be smaller after this, maybe 2K to 3K per year more for the foreseeable future. Benefits: Full medical, although teachers in NJ now have to pay a percentage of their salaries for their medical benefits. (It&apos;s currently 1.5% of base salary, but it&apos;s going up even more in the new year.) We get modest dental, generous sick and personal time, a decent pension plan (at least if the state doesn&apos;t default on the benefits), tremendous job security once you achieve tenure (but virtually none before that, and even with tenure, you can still have the daylights menaced out of you. Also keep in mind that not all states offer tenure, in which case you can pretty much be fired at will no matter how much time you have in a particular district.) In almost all districts in NJ, you can accumulate sick time from year to year. What&apos;s the job like?Very difficult and getting more difficult by the year. Tremendously long hours, almost no down time during the school day (I don&apos;t take lunch very often),lots of work at home, deplorable working conditions, with some classrooms reaching temperatures of 90+ degrees and others below freezing. Prepare to adopt some small scurrying pets who have made your classroom their home in older buildings in urban districts. You will also most likely need to spend a decent amount of money on supplies for students because your school won&apos;t provide them, even though they insist on your using them. Very little respect and support from most supervisors, parents, and students. I do it for the good kids and because I love teaching. Massive budget cuts have made the job even more difficult. Many teachers (myself included) are now finding themselves doing two jobs for the price of one due to massive retirements and staffing cuts.Would you recommend the career to others?Every year, it&apos;s become harder and harder for me to recommend teaching as a career. Public employees all over the U.S. have taken a real bashing over the past couple of years, and teachers seem to be Public Enemy #1 of the group. This is not an easy job. If you&apos;re doing it correctly, it&apos;s at least a 50-60 hour a week job, and it&apos;s 50-60 hours of grueling work. Teachers in urban districts in particular have taken a real beating. They are expected to be miracle workers, solving all of our society&apos;s ills. On top of that, there seems to be a growing chorus of people calling for teacher salaries and benefits to be cut to the bone. And, unfortunately for new teachers, your benefits are going to vanish before the benefits for the veteran teachers will. Once the teacher bashing subsides, I may be able to recommend teaching again as a profession. But for right now, it might be better to see what else is out there. Need a car for one year 
 Added on : Tuesday December 27th 2011 09:13:06 AM My parents are going to be in the US for a little over a year and are trying to figure out the most cost effective way to get a car during that period. They&apos;re currently living overseas, will be returning to the United States for approximately a year and then moving overseas again. They have a car that they&apos;re happy with but they can&apos;t get it shipped to and from the US for the brief period that they&apos;re going to be here. They&apos;re the sorts of people who drive fairly economical cars (think Hondas, not BMWs) but please no suggestions for 10-year old Crown Vics. With current high used car prices the option that seems to make the most sense would be to buy a car that holds its value well and then sell it when they move a year later. Something like a Honda Fit won&apos;t take too much of a depreciation hit unless the used car market suddenly implodes. I thought about recommending a lease but as far as I know leases are usually for three years. Is it possible to get a one year lease for a new or lightly used car?

 Added on : Friday December 23rd 2011 03:12:23 AM What are the transferring out and closing fees for Citibank and Bank of America traditional account?My parents have a little over 30k in their traditional accounts. Those banks don&apos;t provide many investment options other than money market and CD. I am trying to help them to transfer their traditional ira to Vanguard because of the low fee funds. I googled and found out that it would cost $75 for transfer and $75 for closing ira account (citi and Merrill Edge). Anyone confirm this information? Thanks in advance! FW Disasters: crossing the red line 
 Added on : Friday December 23rd 2011 03:12:23 AM There are a lots of stories of great things happening on fatwallet but sometimes you wonder where is the red line; how bad can it go? There are rumors about these things on FW and some stories spread over different threads.
The idea of this thread is to centralize this. Example of Good post that I would like* to see in this category: &quot;I automated creation of bank test-deposits and create 2k accounts and 2mil test-deposits making 1.2mil$ but then had to flee the country...now I see my children and parents only ones a year...life in Australia is nice though.&quot;
*Clarification: not that I would like this to happen to you, but these are the posts that might be helpful to many.Another good Example: &quot;FW made me realize I can buy online saving both money and time, so I order almost everything...the delivery guy started to hate me...then I started to buy things to resale and was getting 20 packages daily...perhaps he reported me to some agency...now they spy/monitor on me...had to move to new apartment&quot;Example of Bad post: &quot;I got onto fatwallet tonight and saw that I missed a deal that could have saved/make me about 10k$.&quot;Disclaimer: as you guessed all of the above I made up. In case story is so bad that you do not want to have trail, just get a different ID... WARM: Nintendo 3DS $169.99 w $35 Gift Card TRU 
 Added on : Wednesday December 21st 2011 12:23:56 PM Toys R UsNot hot like all the other 3DS deals from BF or the Target mistake, but for those parents like myself that only just recently realized that your munchkin needs a 3DS like their life depends on it, toys r us has a deal today where you buy a 3DS and get a $35 in store giftcard that expires 1/28/12. Now, if you are particularly adventurious, Target.com sells the 3DS for $149.95. YMMV but you might be able to get a price match AND gift card. My TRU Manager is a jerk and wouldnt let me double dip after 15 minutes of dicusssion. lulz. Anyhow, that would make the deal sweeter. Last minute efforts for college 
 Added on : Tuesday December 20th 2011 03:21:13 PM My son is a highschool senior and we will be completing the fafsa in January. Trying to tidy up things and I&apos;m looking for advice. If we have a UGMA in his name is it better to close it out and transfer the funds to our (parents) acct. I have receipts to show that we have spent the money on him. The balance is $5600. Also, we have an education savings acct but I was told that would be reported under our (parents) assets - so I was going to leave that alone. I understand that parents are allowed to have up to the oldest parents age in assets (in our case 47 so we could have up to $47000 in assets($) that would not be counted - please correct me if I&apos;m wrong). Is it beneficial for us to pay our property tax off by Dec 31st. (We usually pay it in Jan and July but should we be looking for that extra write off for this year?) I appreciate any and all comments. PAN AM Season 1 FREE on iTunes

 Added on : Friday December 16th 2011 09:11:14 AM I&apos;ve literally just had my eyes opened by reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad. This post isn&apos;t a book review, but I think I may bring up an original point or two.As I&apos;ve stated before, I&apos;m 21. Only 21. I&apos;ve been out of public school for three years but have pretty much had my living provided for me by the government. In that time I&apos;ve slowly begun learning tidbits of information, mainly from FWF, about financial literacy and how the knowledge of it can improve your life greatly or lack of knowledge can seriously hinder you. I may be undervaluing public education and perhaps I&apos;m biased on this issue, but I really feel like I was cheated.The things I learned, K-12, about money:1. How to balance a checkbook.2. How to write a check.3. Basic accounting, i.e. assets vs. liabilities&amp;income vs. expense spreadsheets.4. Credit cards are bad.
The things I didn&apos;t learn , K-12, about money:1. How to use credit cards for positive cash-flow.2. What credit was. How it is used. How it is determined. When it&apos;s used. 3. What mortgages were.4. The difference between a HELOC and a HEL. How and when to utilize each.5. Anything about home-buying in general, actually.6. Purchasing your first car, what not to do.7. For as much emphasis as there is on secondary education, I learned not a single thing about student loan debt.8. Taxes. WTH? If I&apos;m going to be contributing X% of my income and purchases to them for the rest of my life, shouldn&apos;t I know a few things about them?The list goes on and on..
I really do understand that much intelligence is passed down from parents to children, and there may be some validity to keeping it that way, but I cant see it. I compare it to the way our society treats sex education. The parents hope that the school system will formally educate the child on the subject and the school hopes the parents teach their children on the subject. Nobody really wants to bring it up. I believe that many of you FWFers would pass on some of that savviness to your children in hopes of better and brighter futures. Maybe my own parents just knew so little they didn&apos;t want to be embarrassed by trying to explain why they were in debt. I really don&apos;t think I&apos;m alone in this. I think the majority of the middle-class was brought up this way.So I really am wondering what would happen to the future of Americans if a broad, but thorough class was offered across the board at public schools? What could happen to various and vast investment markets? Sure, plenty of bad decisions would still be made, but would there be a drastic change in the levels of private, commercial, and government debt?...Maybe I should have just made a blog..

 Added on : Monday December 12th 2011 12:19:37 AM My grandfather was diagnosed with dementia last week and my extended family is pushing to get my grandparents to move into a nursing home. My grandfather is still very active and is more than 80% mentally. My grandmother has her own health issues, but she is mobile and mentally with it as much as she has ever been. My grandmother doesn&apos;t want to be far away from my great-grandmother (her mother, to clear up potential ambiguity) who lives directly across the street. They currently live in mobile homes.I am considering buying a modest 3bd/2ba ranch-style home near me and having them all move in there. My great-grandmother&apos;s other two children&apos;s spouses don&apos;t want her to move in with them even though they are financially capable, but they also live a few hundred miles away. Of my aunts and uncles, only one is potentially in a financial situation to assist, but he could just as easily scam his own family... so I don&apos;t trust him; my mother is probably the least with it of all of them... So, I figure that they can move into a much nicer home than what they have and spend less on utilities since they will only have bills for one residence and being more energy efficient they may be less even still. As far as paying for the place, I would like to setup an arrangement where they pay the lesser of their current combined lot rents or the P&amp;I;on the mortgage as rent to me, then I just cover the rest.I currently have a 14% debt-to-income ratio which includes my mortgage and new auto loan (may recall my recent thread about the auto dealer). I am hoping that over the next six months to one year, I will be able to save up some cash for a 20% down payment on a $60k-ish bank-owned property (so, $12k).One of my first thoughts, even though they will not be living in my primary residence, are there any scenarios where I could have them as dependent adults for tax purposes? This could go a long way to making this affordable and maybe even allow me to just cover the mortgage and free up more cash for them; I intend to be able to just pay the mortgage anyhow, in the event that financial situations limited their ability... essentially looking at this like a &quot;gift.&quot;So, here are some of my near-term actions:1) Refinance: I currently do not have a rate near today&apos;s historic lows... I can probably save $200-300/month by refinancing and dropping my rate 2-2.5%. This will lower my monthly expenses and let me save some more towards a down payment.2) Second job: I have been searching for a second job for a while and have some part-time work lined up with a few local small CPA firms that need some IT-related assistance. I figure a minimum of $1k/month additional income and write off as much as legally possible.3) Raise: I am in a position that I will likely get not only a superb review, but a promotion that will yield me an 8% automatic raise over my regular raise. Help to better qualify for an additional loan, afford the situation, and save cash for down payment.4) FWF opportunities: take advantage of opportunities to get cash for opening checking/savings accounts, etc. Will help expedite down payment plan.So, I guess, what considerations should I watch out for in regards to taxes and financing this deal? This is going to be one of those family situations where it is going to either be crossing the line or be close to it... so I am definitely preparing to be the one footing the bill if it comes down to it.

 Added on : Wednesday December 07th 2011 12:11:06 AM Hello,
I&apos;m sorry for another mortgage thread but any help would be greatly appreciated. My family has a mortgage problem I was wondering if some body could help me and my parents with. Currently the mortgage payments and interest on are home are too high. The home we live in is currently worth around 180,000. We owe 154,000 on the first mortgage with a 8.75% loan for 30 years. We are in year 16 of this loan. The monthly payment is at $1,405 My family also has a second mortgage on the home that is a 10 year loan for $40,000 at %12.75. The monthly payment is at $566. We are have 6 more years until the second loan is payed off. I know we are paying way too much in interest rates and monthly payments. We need to either refinance the home or just sell the home and start clean with a new home and mortgage. My parents have excellent credit and solid income. The home is located in Northern California. They don&apos;t have too much money to pay down the principle (around $10,000). I have been doing tons of research on mortgages and refinancing but I&apos;m not very educated the subject and neither are my parents. Could someone please guide me on what would be the best way to lower our interest and monthly payments of both loans.Any help would be greatly appreciated 1st Loan - $154,000 - Monthly Payment $1405 - %8.75 - 30 yrs on year 16
2nd Loan - 39,600 - Monthly Payment $566 - 12.75 - 10 yrs on year 4
Total Loan Amount $193,600 Total Monthly Payment $1971Current Home value - 180,000Are there any government refinance programs out there that would help in this situation?Would it be possible to refinance both loans by combining them together and just paying one loan payment?If a complete refinance on both loans is not an option should we consider refinancing the 2nd mortgage by itself to a lower interest rate?Also my father is a veteran and was wondering if the VHA loan could be applied to a refinance so that the LTV could come down?Should we just try and sell the current home and get a new home and mortgage?What banks would be best for this type of refinance?Sorry for such a long post. Thanks What to do to protect from (soon to be) ex paying off car loan 
 Added on : Monday December 05th 2011 06:23:15 PM A friend is going through a divorce. They were married about 6 months before filing for divorce. The guy was a loser but someone suckered her in. He moved in with her, he had been living with his parents even though he makes about $70k, maybe a little more. He had terrible credit and no credit cards so she put him on hers and he used it for everything. That was with her permission, the &quot;agreement&quot; was that she would pay all household expenses and they would use his account with all his salary as their savings account. Of course, he never put her name on the account and always made excuses for that. Anyways, water under the bridge. In the end, she paid for everything, he was cheating on her from the very beginning, shacked up with someone else and using work as an excuse to be gone 4 or 5 nights a week. He also talked her into letting him get a new truck Chevy 3500 pickup which she also put a lot of additional money into for &quot;upgrades&quot;. The truck was in her name alone, both the title and loan. When the s&amp;@t hit the fan and they separated, she wanted to take the truck and sell it but I guess there are laws that prevent that, originally intended to prevent a husband from taking the transportation away from a non-working wife, but they somehow protect him even though he has a good paying job. So they had a separation agreement that says that he has to make the truck payments to keep using it, and the disposition of the truck was to be settled later. The first payment for the truck under the agreement came up 2 weeks ago and he didn&apos;t pay it, so she paid it to protect her credit. Her worthless lawyer is supposed to be filing something to let her take possession of the truck, but 2 weeks later he hasn&apos;t done squat and never gets back to her. He had wanted to get a loan in his name to take over the truck, the problem is that the truck is worth more than the loan value and she wanted to sell it to recoup some cash - she didn&apos;t want to give him the truck for the loan value. He was welcome to pay her fair market value but he wasn&apos;t interested in that. Today she got a notification from the bank that the loan has been paid off. Well, she holds the title (this is Wisconsin, so the owner not the bank holds the title) and presumably owns the truck outright since he was generous enough to pay it off. Except it isn&apos;t so cut and dry because:1) Her bank had been instructed not to give payoff information to anyone besides her but apparently did anyways.
2) She is worried that he may have gotten a duplicate title and forged her signature but doesn&apos;t know how to find out if that happened.
3) She is worried that the judge will say that since the truck is paid off she should just give it to him - the path of least resistance.She can&apos;t get in touch with her lawyer, as per usual, so she isn&apos;t sure what to do. She is trying to find out from her bank who paid off the loan (the new bank), and is trying to find out from the DMV if another title was issued. Is there anything else that she should be doing to protect herself from this creep? I&apos;ve suggested that she is the owner of the truck and should just repossess it and sell it in one swoop and deal with the consequences during the divorce proceedings, but I&apos;m not sure what those consequences are and her lawyer hasn&apos;t responded when she asked. It doesn&apos;t seem like it would be a criminal offense, but maybe I&apos;m wrong. I&apos;m kind of hoping that he forged her signature on something and ends up in jail, he is enough of a dumbass that he would. Any ideas? And sorry, I don&apos;t have any pics. life insurance for parents 
 Added on : Saturday December 03rd 2011 03:07:33 PM first off yes i know i am a horrible son, now the detailsmy elderly parents provided me with everything i needed to be a successful person in life, but in the process and their own poor judgement, and health problems, they are in very poor financial shape.so having helped me with so much and the fact they are my parents i feel it is my duty to help them as much as possible. i do as much as i can in as many ways as possible including managing their money and kicking in money when needed.this has put some strain on me financially, i am still able to meet all the monthly bills and no debt other than the mortgage, but no where near where i planned to be financially getting close to the 4th decade of my life. very little saving and very little retirement, less than 30 grandnow the part that makes me the horrible soni was thinking i could take life insurance policies out on them that would help me when the inevitable happens. (there will be no inheritance due to their financial situation)while we are a fairly matter of fact family, i do not want them to know. i don&apos;t want them to think i am just thinking of them as a cash cow and also don&apos;t want them to know they are putting a financial strain on me(this being the far bigger reason).i do not have power of attorney for them unless they are incapacitated which they are not.my question being simply can i get policies with out them knowingfeel free to say what you want about me, it is nothing i haven&apos;t already said to myself.thanks in advance Reg saving for kid&apos;s college and their life insurance

 Added on : Wednesday November 23rd 2011 03:08:38 PM Time to reup my insurance. Living in an area prone to smash and grabs, I always carry a comprehensive deductible, which at ~100 a year is worth the piece of mind if a tree limb falls on my car, I hit a deer while visiting my parents, or a crackhead smashes the driver side window to get in my car for the coins in my cupholder, then smashes the passenger window to get out (entirely probable scenario). But I&apos;ve generally carried collision as well since I used to do a lot of hectic beltway driving where I had plenty of near misses. However, my once 18,000 car is now only worth about 7, and my collision is now about $225 a year (1000 deductible). What is you magic number in terms of &quot;investment&quot; and potential payout? My state has a pretty decent no-fault provision which covered me when I got clipped by a hit and run tractor trailer a few years ago and I&apos;m otherwise a very good driver (rarely speed, and my commute is mostly on city/suburban side streets now). Is 3.6% ($220 for a potential 6K return) worth the risk... All of this is assuming of course I would be able to afford another automobile if I lost my current ride.

 Added on : Saturday November 19th 2011 09:14:18 PM Hi y&apos;all,I originally brought this question to creditboards as is usually recommended, but I don&apos;t seem to be getting too many responses so far. :/So here&apos;s the situation. I was helping my gf check her credit for the first time ever the other day, and...we came across a few surprises. She expected to see no credit history at all, since she said shesnever had a CC or anything like that butapparently, she has a few delinquentaccounts that she didn&apos;t know about:1) $13k CC like 5 years past due with Chase. which was thensold to...1a) Some CA. Balancehas grown to $19.5k2) $7k Student loans that were apparently never paid. Theseare about 3 years past dueWe can only assume that her parents took out the CC for her5 years ago, ran it up, and then stopped paying since she says she has no idea wtf is going on with that. And Im assuming that her parents just took out the student loan in her name several years ago and then forgot to pay them or something.All the past due/delinquent notices have been going to herparents place for the last several years (O.o) and they just never told herabout it apparently.Sohere we are. Shes extremely upset about the wholesituation, and has asked for help in how to get out of this mess. Assuming thatA) All this debt is valid andB) She can get her parents to cough up the approximately$30k that she seems to oweIm thinking of advising her to do the following, and was hoping I could get some advice from you guys.1) Dispute and ask for validation (in writing, notonline) with the CAs. A simple I dispute this debt. Please validate. Type of letter I assume will suffice?2) Assuming that they validate all the debt, thensend them letters offering pay for delete.Am I missing anything here? Am I going about this all wrong? Should I just be advising her to ignore the Chase CC debt, as it&apos;s so close to the 7 year statute of limitations (Is this even a real statute of limitations?)? This is my first foray into this type of problem, and Im not sure if this is the best way to go about it. I appreciate yalls advice. Thanks a bunch!P.S. I immediately thought of this commercial when I thought about the situation I was in. Hopefully, this puts y&apos;all in a good mood, so you&apos;re willing to help. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdKdUJ6bCA Dog or Bunny Cuddlee Pet Pillow Sleeping Bag Combo for $23.94 shipped at MidnightBox.com

Flame retardant College 529 plan and not going to college 
 Added on : Friday November 11th 2011 12:11:27 PM My parents have a 529 plan with $22k left in it for my 20 year old brother. He failed out of two semesters of university and one semester of community college. He has decided not to pursue college anymore, he doesn&apos;t go to classes. I&apos;m going to try to encourage him to find a job with FedEx or UPS.I&apos;m 27 and have one semester of school left that will cost $1k. Can my parents send my school a check for $22k from the 529 plan and then I can use the leftover money ($21k) to put into his checking account and possibly start maxing out a ROTH for him?edit: the account might be less than what was contributed so maybe we can liquidate it without incurring a penalty? Deducting Embryos on Tax Return in Mississippi 
 Added on : Tuesday November 08th 2011 06:10:46 PM If passed, I would love to see the IRS opinion on this: Letters to the Economist:Patter of tiny personhoods:Economist said: After the procedure we will insist on taking custody of any extra embryos that result from IVFit is our right as parents after all. Once safely in our home we plan to keep them in a freezer in our basement and list them as child dependents for tax purposes, thus giving us a tax deduction. To protect the lives of our children in case of a power outage we will buy a backup generator. Anything less would be bad parenting.

 Added on : Saturday November 05th 2011 03:10:31 AM Beyond Delicious: The Ghost Whisperer&apos;s Cookbook: More than 100 Recipes from the Dearly Departed I learned of this cookbook from Mr. Food today. On one side is the recipe and the other is the story behind it. Mary Ann Winkowski spoke of a spirit that couldn&apos;t move on until she could give her housekeeper an old family recipe. It sounds great for the cook/bookworm.The cheapest place I found was at Buy.com for $9.68, but Barnes&amp;Noble it&apos;s a few cents more at $9.99.Here is an excerpt from the Denver Post:&quot;Sometimes a spirit is hanging around specifically to pass on a recipe, but other times, it comes as an afterthought, when Winkowski explains who the spirit is and a homeowner will ask for a recipe.This was the case when a woman named Leslie was trying to sell her grandparents&apos; pharmacy, which she had inherited from them. It was an old-fashioned store with a soda fountain. She called Winkowski, convinced it wasn&apos;t selling because it was haunted.When Winkowski arrived, she met a spirit named Queenie, whom Leslie remembered as the woman who had worked for her grandparents, making the pies, cakes and sandwiches sold at the counter.When Leslie realized who it was, she asked whether Queenie would share the recipe for her Malted Butterscotch Bars, and she was happy to pass it on.&quot;The article has this recipe and another, too!FW CashBack Barnes&amp;Noble 4%.

 Added on : Wednesday October 19th 2011 03:07:35 PM http://www.magazines.com/pickadeal?afd_number=14985 Got first full time job - how do I set up my financial future? 
 Added on : Sunday October 16th 2011 03:00:06 PM A few months ago I started at my first ever full-time job, so this is the first time in my life I&apos;ve ever had any money left over to save.
The bad news is that it took me two years after graduation to find this full time job (which pays a bit less than $40k), and because of it, I lost 2 years of income. I&apos;m starting life very late in the post-college game and have a negative net worth to the tune of about -$20k (my savings minus outstanding student loan debt).Because I&apos;m playing catch up, I live with my parents, which allows me to shave my total living expenses down to a mere $300 a month. So I have about $2k left after taxes that I can do whatever I like with.Currently, my total $2.4k/month after-tax paycheck is divided up like this:
* 5% to a company-matched 401k
* 20% into emergency fund in a high-yield online savings account (though &quot;high yield&quot; is only 1% these days)
* 45% into student loan payments (I want to have this gone in 3 years)
* 13% into day-to-day living expenses (food, clothes, etc)
* 17% of my income left over for ???? .... this is where I&apos;d like you guys to help suggest where to put it!Any suggestions? I turn 25 in a few weeks and feel really behind on my finances compared to my peers and want to get back in the game. If you know of any bits of investment/savings/life advice that make you go &quot;I wish I&apos;d known THAT when I was 25!&quot;, please share them! I think my income is too low, so I also need a game plan for boosting that. I made the mistake of majoring business instead of a science, so I am hoping that enrolling in an MBA program (goal: top 20 school) in 3 years will save me and get me on a real career path. That said, any MBA-related advice would also be appreciated. I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s realistic to expect that an MBA will launch me from my barely-$40k-nobody job to one that pays around double. I plan to have my undergraduate debt FINALLY paid off right as it&apos;s time to enter the MBA program, so this time I want to make sure my investment in school debt is going to pay off BEFORE I go diving in.Thanks in advance! I see a lot of amazing advice on this forum so I hope some of that wisdom will rub off on me. :] Free 8 x 10 studio portrait at Target (requires free sitting)

 Added on : Wednesday October 12th 2011 09:04:13 PM Beginning in November 2011, Burtons Grill, is unveiling {B} Choosy, a new childrens menu and concept designed to offer children unlimited options for a healthy, balanced and quality meal, all at an amazing value. No matter what a child orders, every {B} Choosy meal is $5.00 for children 12 and under.Modeled after the United States Department of Agricultures (USDA) new MyPlate program, an initiative reminding consumers to make healthier food decisions, the {B} Choosy kids menu allows children to choose from a list of ingredients and preparation methods which will be portioned and served according to the newest guidelines for nutrition.Our new childrens menu speaks to our entire philosophy at Burtons Grill, said Kevin Harron, CEO of Burtons Grill. We pride ourselves on offering flexible, healthy and quality dining options to our guests, and our children should be no different. When parents go out to dinner they should be able to relax knowing that their child will have a healthy, enjoyable meal at a great value, and our new {B} Choosy menu does just that.Depicted by a familiar, color-coded place setting, the new menu will give children various options in each of the five food groups (fruits, vegetables, protein, dairy and grains), giving them the flexibility of ordering any combination of any of the five groups- essentially offering limitless options for even the pickiest eater.Kids will still be able to enjoy the classics, such as chicken fingers and hamburgers, but theyll also be able to expand their palate with options such as haddock, steak and salmon. All caregivers can rest easy because no matter what a child is in the mood for, theyll be able to personalize their plate by choosing up to four additional sides including everything from mixed fruit, baked potato, French fries, carrot sticks, seasonal vegetables, ice cream and frozen yogurt. http://www.burtonsgrill.com/index.html REQUEST: European cruise advice 
 Added on : Tuesday October 11th 2011 12:00:02 PM Hello everyone, great info on here.My parents are turning 60 this year and I would like to buy them a european cruise as a gift. They kind of want to leave from Barcelona but are open to other departure ports as well. I am looking for 9-11 day cruises. Any advice? What cruise companies are good for Europe? Where should I start looking?Thanks!RJ Best / Lowest cost debit or bad credit secured credit cards? 
 Added on : Monday October 10th 2011 03:00:20 PM Trying to help a friend who has a college age child with massed up credit. Parents would like to place little bit of money periodically in account so kid has in emergency a credit or debit card. I suggested Wells Fargo: they opened checking and savings accounts for kid, and then they applied for secured card for kid, and after one year Wells Fargo considers some credit with secured. So far the results: Wells F declined even the secured card and wiped pout both the checking and savings account with crazy high fees. Friend thinks I am a dummy. Any suggestions for either of these type of cards where the fees and costs are not way too high? Financial Advice for Leaving Corporate Job for a Start-up 
 Added on : Sunday October 09th 2011 06:00:35 PM Ill be leaving my job next month to start a start-up with a couple of friends. I feel we have a viable idea and the right team. Ill be moving from Seattle to San Francisco to be with the other founders. I want to tap the FWF collective knowledge pool to help evaluate my plan for the next month to ensure Im in the most financially stable position when I make the move.Heres some baseline information:

Age: 23
Current Annual Income: $105,000
Net Worth: $175,000: $40,000 cash, $60,000 non-retirement liquid assets and $75,000 retirement liquid assets spread across Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA
Debt: $0

Here are the monthly personal expenses Im projecting:

Rent: $825 (already found a place)
Utilities: $100
Cell: $0 (family plan)
Transportation: $50 (public transit)
Food/Entertainment: $500

The business expenses are a little fuzzy since Im not too familiar with it but should be fairly low. Since 1) we wont be hiring for a while and 2) our only capital expenditures will be computers and server space.Erring on the side of caution, Im rounding up the total combined personal and business expenses up to $2,000/month. The worst case scenario is that I dont pull in any income for the next couple of years at which point I&apos;ll re-enter the corporate world.Here are the things Im doing to take advantage of my current financial situation:

Tax Loss Harvesting
I posted about this a little while ago. This will allow me to offset some capital gains at my current higher tax bracket.
Capital Gains
Ill hold off on selling any assets with capital gains until next year when Ill be in a lower tax bracket. I still need to figure how to optimally maximize my tax benefits w.r.t. tax loss harvesting.
Health Insurance
Since Im&lt;26, I can still be a dependent under my parents health insurance thanks to the healthcare reform law. My current insurance is still better ($0 co-pays) so Im getting all of my health exams done while Im still employed.
Credit Cards
Im applying for as many rewards and CashBack credit cards as possible under my current income.
Rollover Roth 401(k) to Roth IRA

What else can I do to take advantage of my financial situation? Thanks! HP Compaq HP 6910p Laptop-Intel Core2Duo 2GHz CPU- New Copy of Windows 7 Pro-Refurbished Sears $249.99

 Added on : Monday October 03rd 2011 09:00:19 PM As a former D1 athlete and the parent of current and prospective college athletes; the desire to participate in college was never about the money. I no more expect to recoup the money I spend on coaching, training equipment and travel expenses for my children than I expect to recover the money I spent on music lessons. I only mentioned this article because some families may neglect to fully prepare for their children&apos;s college expenses because they expect their children to receive a full scholarship. Unfortunately, the actual amount of scholarship money is much less than some parents expect. About 2 percent of high school athletes nationally receive evan a partial athletic scholarship. &quot;The biggest misconception about athletic scholarships remains their actual worth.As mandated by the NCAA, football, men&apos;s and women&apos;s basketball, women&apos;s volleyball and women&apos;s tennis are the only sports categorized as &quot;head count sports,&quot; meaning coaches can&apos;t award any partial scholarships.Division I-A football gets 85 &quot;full rides&quot; and men&apos;s basketball gets 13; women&apos;s basketball receives 15; women&apos;s volleyball gets 12; and women&apos;s tennis gets 8.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s not the same for other sports.Virginia won its fifth national championship in men&apos;s lacrosse this year. In 19 seasons as head coach for the Cavaliers, Dom Starsia has awarded a full scholarship fewer than five times.And in Olympic sports, the concept of a full ride is more myth than a huge snowman roaming the regions of Tibet. They are referred to as &quot;equivalency sports,&quot; where coaches award pieces of financial aid.Think of a Division I lacrosse team spreading its allotment of 12.6 scholarships among more than 30 players. Or coaches in soccer, softball and baseball using their roster numbers to do the same with assigned scholarship dollars.&quot;

 Added on : Wednesday September 28th 2011 09:00:14 PM I am a college student and I currently have two cards, the Citi Dividend MC (opened 2/11) and the BankAmericard Visa (opened 8/11).
I chose the Citi card for the 5% CB in the rotating categories and the BankAmericard because of the 3% CB on gas and 2% in supermarkets.
For the Citi card, I am also getting an extra 0.5% CB for everything for 6 months just for asking.
I am looking into the Blue Cash by AMEX for the 3% in supermarkets ( I do a lot of grocery shopping for my parents) and 2% in Dept. Stores to help to maximize my CB and build my credit history but I don&apos;t know if 3 cards is too many (or the hard pulls on my credit report will look really bad) or if the benefits are worth it.
My current CreditKarma score is 712
Feedback would be great.

Now with this decent pricing I decided to try them again.This is the link they sent me for a special 40% off.I hope there is nothing unique in the link. I also found this code, G5JXTRY to take additional 20% off. This is the good news. The bad news is that the stuck me a $5 shipping charge and $1.55 state tax bringing my total to around $26. I still think that it is a decent price for a decent software.Those of you that have elderly parents that have not very comfortable with computers this is a great software to get them started. Get them started by plugging in a few family members and show them the tree and the family story book this software generate. They will be impressed with the wonders of computer.

 Added on : Tuesday September 20th 2011 03:00:23 PM My young daughter was seriously cut at a corporate daycare facility recently, and required over a dozen stitches on her cheek/nose. The accident happened during supervised play time; she tripped over another classmate and went face-first into the corner of a small table with very sharp edges. Emotionally and physically (apart from aesthetics) she is fine. I imagine when she gets older she will want to address the scarring which will no doubt be very evident. As her parents we&apos;re sick to our stomachs over the entire situation.The daycare has not addressed the incident. The table still sits ominously in the large play room and besides the occasional &quot;so glad she&apos;s ok&quot; remark, nothing has been said regarding the incident.I discussed the issue with a friend with a legal background and he&apos;s strongly encouraging me to attempt legal action. Interested in the FW perspective - do you let it go? Accidents happen, etc? Do you approach the daycare facility and attempt an amicable solution without getting lawyers involved? Of course, their lawyers would likely be very involved... We&apos;re not litigious people by nature so I&apos;m hesitant to &apos;lawyer up&apos; and essentially attack a place that takes care of our children, but looking at my child&apos;s face and knowing it could have been avoided had some basic care been taken does cause my jaw to clench at times...At the end of the day, my child is healthy and happy and that&apos;s obviously what&apos;s most important. Any perspective is greatly appreciated! Free Sample Parents Choice Premium Infant Formula

 Added on : Monday September 19th 2011 12:00:15 PM I will give my story and some questions. Please comment/suggest etc:27 years of age
~45k income (grad student and will be for 1-2 more years; 25k stipend+8-20k summer+4-7k tutoring; this year 25k+15k+5k)
50k assets: 20k are well managed by parents but those money I plan to leave for their retirement (we are immigrants...) and actually want to put more $ for this.
another 20 were in reward checking 4%, 10k used for keeping my banks happy and reserve purposes.
Budget: 1.2k/month (rent+life)+3k/year (upgrade, travel, etc)
0 DebtsSoon to be married. This is +0 income but some support from her parents; say +1k/month but might be dropping rapidly.
I expect budget is going to become:
2k/month + 5k/yearA few questions:
1) The reward checking went to 3% so I am planning to give those money into my parents ROTH 401k for my father to manage. Are the better options to invest money that I already paid taxes on? My mother works (45k). Does this mean they can put upto 10k into ROTH (5k per person)?2) My Credit rating: Equifax 754, Experian 742, TransUnion 774 and I am thinking of making App-O-Rama: Citi 75k AAdvantage 2 cards; Hyatt (honey week purpose); Citi-Dividend; AMEX Blue; AMEX Gold or Platinum (I had 50k offer a while but waited for 75k or 100k; will try to call and get). If I convince my parents those applications will be times 3 (they have at least same or better credit ratings). This is my first App-O-Rama so a bit worried; will try to open and fill all aps at same time (different browsers if same company) and submit all within 1 hour.3) Another option or addition to 401k is Merill Edge regular account and start medium range trading 5-10 indecies 2-4 transaction/company/month but 25k should not give enough incentive so I was wondering if life-long debts are a good thing. I have some 6% offers; I wonder if one can find lower? (I did not serve)4) Any suggestions on marriage? So far plan is: Sona diamond ring (~1k), small wedding (~1k probably will be covered by guests) and then Hawaii for 1 week (1k for food+entertainment, $0 otherwise if all goes as planned with ccs). Any financial negatives of marriage? As far as I understand in this case there are only positives for now. Sending Money to UK 
 Added on : Monday September 19th 2011 12:00:15 PM A few years ago I opened a Bank of America account which I used to send money to my parents in the UK. BOA lets you withdraw money from ATMs in the UK for free. So, I sent them the ATM card and then my brother or I would deposit money in the account (using the teller) in the States and they would withdraw the money in the UK. However, BOA changed their accounts and they no longer have a free checking account. Now to avoid a monthly charge without a balance over $2000.00 I had to switch to their ebanking account, but it does not allow you to use a teller. You can use an ATM or do stuff online. If you use a teller it&apos;s $12.00 a month. They also have the essentials account, but that&apos;s $6.00 a month. Since I cannot go to the teller to deposit money like I used to I need to find another way to send money cheaper than the $20 plus that most banks charge. we don&apos;t send money that often, maybe 4 times a year.Thanks.

 Added on : Monday September 12th 2011 03:00:14 PM Hello all, i have a question regarding Traditional IRA&apos;s which i know nothing about. My wife was left some money from a relative a long time ago. The money was in form of a traditional IRA that is in her parents name. Her parents are over 60 years old and withdrew the money last week. The initial amount put in the IRA was $20K and what it was worth today is $18k, so it went down $2k in value. I guess my question is what would the tax liability be? Her parents are retired and in the lowest bracket. Do you know if we can write-off that $2k loss against the tax liability? So if its 15% of that 20, which is $3k, we could write-off 2k of that and would only owe $1k in taxes? These are rough estimates and they plan to get an accountant to help with the taxes, but we are trying to figure out how much we should withold of that for tax purposes. Thanks everyone! Teen-Proofing: A Revolutionary Approach to Fostering Responsible Decision Making in Your Teenager Kindle Book

Parents can protect toddlers--with their maximum mobility and minimum logic--by pasting plastic on electrical outlets and putting poisons out of reach. But protecting teenagers is not so simple, says family psychologist and author of Raising a Nonviolent Child John Rosemond. &quot;Short of solitary confinement, you can&apos;t guarantee that a teen won&apos;t use drugs, shoplift, drink or crash the car. In the final analysis, teens must protect themselves.&quot; Rosemond&apos;s Teen-Proofing provides parents with tough-love strategies for managing teens so they make self-protective, rather than self-destructive, decisions. Many parents will recognize the error of their ways in Rosemond&apos;s portraits of parents as &quot;micro-managers&quot; who try to control their children and &quot;wimps&quot; who let their children control them. He offers a compelling alternative by urging parents to be &quot;mentors, who realize they can control the parent-child relationship, but not the child.&quot; The author explores critical parent-teen issues including curfews, cash, cars, and cohorts--detailing an approach that gives teenagers a &quot;long rope&quot; to make their own mistakes and also offers &quot;creative consequences&quot; to encourage responsible decision making. The author offers smart and seasoned advice--from coping with middle school &quot;tweenagers&quot; to understanding why teens are vulnerable and how the culture diminishes a parent&apos;s influence. Yet he undermines his clarity with snide asides about mental health professionals and one too many smug and self-congratulatory examples of his own parenting of a son and daughter. These distractions are unnecessary; the book&apos;s unconventional and provocative suggestions will speak volumes to parents of teens. --Barbara Mackoff Quiznos Sub: Buy Black Angus Steak Sub and get $10 GC thro&apos; mail - Valid from Sep 11 8AM to Oct 1

 Added on : Tuesday September 06th 2011 12:00:05 AM My parents currently have a mortgage through beneficial, which seems to be owned by hsbc now. They have an interest rate of 9.14%, so they want to refinance. I&apos;ve gone through a few sites but I&apos;ve never herdof any of the options that pop up. I&apos;ve seen quicken, which I&apos;ve seen bad reviews about, as well as ovation, which I can hardly find anything on besides their bbb page.I tried usaa, but it mentions a down payment of $44,000 and huge closing fees. Shouldn&apos;t there be no down payments since this is a reginance. I&apos;m not sure of the best way to go to find a good refinance deal. Lending tree didn&apos;t turn up much and the only real bank that shows up is hsbc, but when I googled people were saying they had a hard time working to get a lower rate with them. Is the best bet to try and get a refinance with hsbc? It seems that they might have qualified for a va loan but got ruled out because of our house technically bring a 3 family house.

 Added on : Thursday September 01st 2011 06:00:06 PM I don&apos;t know if it true, but I heard that an international student who&apos;s parents have a minimum of $500,000 invest in any kind of business in USA, they will become a permanent resident and have there own Green card and social number. Is this true, anyone? Need advice, parents stuck getting argentina visa travel in 14 days 
 Added on : Wednesday August 31st 2011 03:00:05 PM My parents from India are on a 6 months visit to the USA. We thought getting a 7 day south american tour to Brazil/Argentina would be easy. Tickets (flight+hotel) booked via vacation2go website and they went to NYC consultant showing that as proof and go the tourist visa for Brazil. Next step Argentina giving headache consultant says since they are not domiciled residence of USA they should apply from the Consulate in India. AND they also insisting on statements showing proof of residence in India (bank/property records)I always thought valid passport was more than sufficient. AND to top it off also insisting of official travel iternary not the eticket printout confirmations which we received from vacation2gomy parents have traveled extensively worldwide and showed showed passports from India with multiple entry and exit visa from at least a dozen countries. What can be considered as official documentation of iternary? everything has being sent via emails/paid via credit cards. If they still insist on it and not budge do I have an recourse on the tickets already paid? would using a travel agent make any sense at this moment, if they have leverage to get it without any issues? can I cancel the trip and claim money back from vacation2go? Auto insurance and liability for child of separated parents 
 Added on : Tuesday August 30th 2011 03:00:07 PM I&apos;ve tried googling this, but can&apos;t find quite the same situation. I have NOT contacted my insurance company yet, though I assume I am going to have to.My wife&apos;s son resides with his father in Vermont. My wife and I reside in NJ. He has just turned 18 and will soon be getting his license. He is still in high school.A few questions:What liability (if any) are my wife and I exposed to if he crashes an auto in Vermont?
If he and/or his father carry no insurance (which is required in Vermont), what liability do we face?
Will my/my wife&apos;s insurance company cover him? Can he be listed as a driver on our policy even though he doesn&apos;t live with us?There is no divorce decree or custody arrangement. His parents were never married. He lives full time with his father, though has previously resided with us. Can I buy home insurance for a house I don&apos;t own? 
 Added on : Sunday August 28th 2011 12:00:05 PM My parents don&apos;t want to pay for home owners insurance (they&apos;ve paid off their house). I was wondering if I could, or if it makes any sense to initiate a policy on their house. (Do I get the liability benefits and all too?) EasyWalker Classic Jogging Stroller in four color choices on EBAY - $200 shipped (or less YMMV) Originally $500++ 
 Added on : Saturday August 27th 2011 09:01:08 PM This seller has a brand new stroller for $200 or best offer with free shipping to US.
Linky to Ebay listingThe seller accepted my offer for $180. The selection of colors is limited - I got a tan one and I love it.
Here is my review-I love it that is why I am posting.PROS:
+PRICE! You can satisfy your stroller envy (something very common in any urban area, IMHO) at a fraction of a price of a Bugaboo, Stokke, etc. This was originally a $500++ stroller.
+Comes with all the accessories: a basinette (+ mattress, sheet, rain and bug covers for it), a foot muff/sleeping bag, a rain cover for the stroller mode, a sun canopy, an adapter to use with a graco infant car seat, a swivel wheel (if you don&apos;t like the fixed wheel in the front), a storage basket and a diaper bag (included a lightweight changing pad).
+Beautiful (apparently used to be exhibited in museums)
+Rather compact and light for a jogger
+Rides like a dream. Everywhere. (On snow, too!)
+Good for tall people (I am 6 ft.)
+Top quality, easy to assemble and great design
+Not as common as all the other strollers like Quinny or BobCONS:
-no pump for the tires included
-no snack tray for the kid or a drink holder for the parents included
-a tad complicated to fold and does not lock when folded
-only takes kids up to 33lb (not a big problem for me as my kids are slender)
-this is an &quot;old&quot; model - although it doesn&apos;t show it. IMHO, the ensuing models have some improved features, but they are heavier and much more expensive. EasyWalker Classic Jogging Stroller on EBAY - $200 shipped (or less YMMV) Originally $500++

 Added on : Thursday August 25th 2011 12:00:31 PM First, sorry for creating a new username (my current one can easily be searched to find facebook/identifying information). So here&apos;s the story.I&apos;m a stickler for keeping my finances in check, thanks to FW. But my girlfriend (likely future wife) is not as savvy. So, her parents signed her up for variable death benefit insurance right after college. Fast forward seven years to today. She reveals that she has a $2K payment coming up, and I have no clue what these insurance packages are. So we ended up doing a lot of research and calls with insurance company. Here&apos;s how I am interpreting the the way it worksTerms: $2K/yr premium for $500K coverage. The cost of insurance increases 10% per year and management fee is 5.5% per year Here are the numbers so far up until today:-----------------------------Annual---Mgmt-----Total------------Net
---------Premium----------Fee------Fee-------Cost------------Value

2004-----$2,000-----------$317-----$110-----$427-------------$1,573
2005-----$2,000-----------$349-----$110-----$459-------------$1,541
2006-----$2,000-----------$384-----$110-----$494-------------$1,506
2007-----$2,000-----------$422-----$110-----$532-------------$1,468
2008-----$2,000-----------$465-----$110-----$575-------------$1,425
2009-----$2,000-----------$511-----$110-----$621-------------$1,379
2010-----$2,000-----------$562-----$110-----$672-------------$1,328

Total---$14,000---------$3,010-----$770---$3,780------------$10,220Total paid in: $14,000
Total costs/fees: $3,780
Net value: $10,220 (put into insurance company&apos;s mutual funds)Current value : $8,200 (company&apos;s mutual funds have lost money)Surrendering Option
Net value: $10,220
Surrender cost: $1,720
Surrender value: $8,500
So the agent is saying that I suffer a surrender cost of $1,720, resulting in $8,500 returned to us. There are no tax consequences because the portfolio is underwater. When I check the portfolio, it&apos;s only worth $8,200. What do I get if we cancel? Am I correct in assuming I&apos;ll just get the surrender value?I don&apos;t think it makes sense to keep this insurance plan because (1) she now works and has insurance coverage from her employer, (2) the fee/costs, in my view, are ridicously high, (3) we don&apos;t plan to have kids yet, (4) no major debt obligations like mortgage payments. If this keeps going, she&apos;s going to have to pony up $14,000 more and lose $6,636 to fees over the next 8 years. And the remaining amount would probably decline or underpeform in value because mutual funds are a terrible investment (we can argue about this point, but time and again research shows that index funds beat mutual funds after fees). The only alternative investment is maybe a 4% fixed income fund, which won&apos;t cover the fees since they increase 10% per year indefinitely.When I talked to the agent, he said that there&apos;s actually no expiration to the policy. It continues until 95 years and fees increase 10%/year indefinitely. I didn&apos;t understand when my gf told it was a 15-year plan. But the agent said that 15 years is when surrender cost disappears. I&apos;m so confused at how this works, so please be patient with my dumbness.What are your opinions? Is it worth to take the surrender cost and stop the plan? Am I missing anything such as additional cancellation penalties? Personally, I&apos;m astounded at how life insurance companies can get away with charging a 5.5% management fee and increasing insurance costs 10% per annum. Plus, they&apos;re losing the remaining money through dumb mutual fund managers. Am I wrong thinking that this is a terrible rip-off? If you still recommend having insurance is there a better insurance alternative?Yes, I will post pic when I get this resolved. Thank you for your advice. Free Grandparents Day Greeting Card

 Added on : Sunday August 21st 2011 03:00:04 AM I currently have a $290,000 appraised home that I owe $170k @ 5.375 (30yr, $1400/mo). I also have a 4.99% home equity load for $47k from Penfed. Due to some major medical issues I also have about $40k in credit card debt (zero percent for the next year or so). Our credit rating has been over 780 (was maxed out 8 years ago when we bought our home). What I&apos;d like to do is refi the home load to the lowest I can to free up some cash to pay off my credit cards. To me the 5/5 ARM from Penfed looks good as my monthly payments would be very low for the first 5 years. My question is can I get cash out of the refi to pay the credit cards. I&apos;m assuming the LTV needs to be at 80% so the home equity loan would affect this right?The other option available is that my parents loan me some cash to help with this. If they paid off my $47k home equity loan could I get a higher cash out refi (then pay them back with the cash)?lots of questions...thx! Free Subway Fitness Kit for Teachers&amp;homeschool parents

Borrowing cash from family to purchase home and then taking out Heloc or Refi Loan to pay them back ASAP 
 Added on : Friday August 19th 2011 03:00:08 AM I&apos;ve heard about this from a friend. There are some below market short sales where its very difficult to get approved financing through a lender because of the condition of the home or HOA restriction. In these circumstances, banks are asking for cash only offers. My friend says that some people will borrow the cash from their relative to purchase the home and then take out a HELOC to repay their relatives immediately. Are there any problems with this type of financing? I&apos;m looking at a place where the asking price is well under market value but must be an all cash transaction. I have about 40% of the cash but will need to borrow the rest from my wife and my parents. Sounds like a creative way of getting the home but are there any problems with this method?Please chime in with your knowledge. Anybody know of or try this before?thanks!

Need help selecting Life Insurance! 
 Added on : Thursday August 18th 2011 03:00:07 PM I&apos;m a 27 year old non-smoking male who just found out that the life insurance his parents bought for him as a baby has lapsed (25 year term). I need to get some on my own but I&apos;m getting so confused by all the different types and what to look for in a company.I read a few threads on here already about whole vs. term and I&apos;m still very confused (just so y&apos;all don&apos;t think I am asking this blindly; I tried to do my research).I am looking for something with a low monthly premium. The amount doesn&apos;t need to be much, 100k minimum with 250k maximum. I would like to have something that goes on for the rest of my life, but if that&apos;s going to be too expensive (more than $20 a month for now. It can increase in price in 5 to 10 years) then I don&apos;t want it. I would like something that covers accidental death, dismemberment or handicap coverage, or death due to illness/natural causes.I&apos;m also confused as to what to look for in a company. Some places say look at the rate of payout, some say look at their BBB rating and others have said to look at how they will &quot;invest&quot; it. Sorry I&apos;m so confused here, if anyone has any suggestions; be them a specific company to look at or a specific product to look at, that would be awesome.

 Added on : Monday August 15th 2011 06:00:08 PM Looking for any ideas here. ThanksI live next to 8 acres that was abandoned by its owner over a year ago. Bank of America filed a forclosure with the county court last October. Since then they have done nothing to move this to conclusion.I would like to buy the property, tear down the trashed old house, that was open to the weather all winter, cut the weeds that are now over my head, and build a house for my aging parents. The current owner had planned to remodel the house. He gutted the inside and then took off. The property is now worth less than half of what is owed.I spoke with the attorney handling the forclusere and he is ready to proceed but is waiting on BOA to give him the go ahead.I&apos;ve called BOA several times and all they will say is they are backed up and will get to all forclosures eventually. They suggested a short sale but that would require the owner to request it. I do have a number for him and called him. He said he would think about it but has done nothing to make it happen. That was months ago. He moved 600 miles away and at this point I dont think he cares what happens.The property continues to be an eyesore and brings down the value of all the neighboring properties.Any ideas on how I can get BOA to move forward and get the forclosure moving? The owner isnt going to fight it, their is a potential buyer waiting, all I need is some clerk at BOA to move the paperwork to the top of his pile.Thanks Debt collector spread calling parents and discussing debt 
 Added on : Saturday August 13th 2011 03:00:06 PM So last October I apparently got a red light ticket on a company rental car which never got paid in a Los Angeles state park. I never received a notice (likely it never filtered down from my company) and apparently never got paid via the company AMEX which was used to rent the car.So, fast forward to this month. The camera collections co has been calling my mother because my father and I had the same name (him Jr., me the III). First they called rudely stating that her &quot;husband&quot; owed this debt and she stated it was not her husband and he has not been in Los Angeles in 10 years and told them they had the wrong person. Well, they kept calling her and telling her her sons credit would be screwed up unless she disclosed my contact information, etc so she finally gave them my number. I have no problem paying and actually had my credit card in my hand but the guy was SO rude and threatening that I hung up and called back. I stated I didn&apos;t appreciate him disseminating my personal/work debts with my family members and he stated it was &quot;well within our right to discuss debt information to get your contact information and we were not aware we were speaking to the wrong family member.&quot; I said &quot;Well, you were the second time.&quot; I said, I think you owe me an apology for cursing and threatening me on the phone with &quot;wrecking my credit&quot; and he said, &quot;Yes, I&apos;m sorry I did that.&quot; I then told him I was recording the call (which I was) and that launched a barrage of &quot;We&apos;ll sue you for illegally recording a call&quot; to the point that he was cut off by a supervisor who was monitoring the call.In any event, do I have any recourse against this three ring circus. I&apos;d like to state, I have no problem taking care of the debt (my co. would reimburse me so its not even my money at this point), but treating a 70 year old woman the way they did just kinda rubs me the wrong way. I might not believe it if I had not experienced it myself. I understand what they are trying to do and that they deal with collections all day , but when I got a phone call out of the blue and I ask what it is in reference to and the response I get is &quot;YOU SHOULD KNOW DEADBEAT!&quot;, it kinda puts me on the defensive. $12.00/$15.00 Mail In Rebate on Mobil 1 Oil Products

Pulled from s/d thanks CVFD1607 op My turn for a &quot;Help out of Debt&quot; thread.. But it&apos;s not for me! 
 Added on : Monday August 08th 2011 09:00:07 PM So, FWF. I&apos;m 21, in the military, and have as I call.. &quot;excess income.&quot; I&apos;ve been able to save about $8k in the last 3 years after paying down my 2009 car to only $4,500, and will have maxed my 2011 ROTH contributions by November.So..I did it. I asked the questions that nobody ever wants to ask or more likely even fewer want to answer. I knew from a young age my parents were always drowning in debt. They&apos;ve done some great work in the past few years in regards to quitting credit cards completely and paying all of them off. Now they seem to be in this revolving pool of interest that never ends. I&apos;m determined to lend them the hook to pull them out, as slow of a process as it may be. So! Having said all of that, you (collectively) can vaguely understand what this post is in regards to and (hopefully) respect it as such.I asked the &apos;rents for all of their stats and surprisingly they were open enough to give me some /basic/ information.----------------------------------Payoff Amt-----------------------------------------------------------
_______Debt_______as of 8/8/11___Company/Bank___Int/APY___Time Rem.___Minimum Pymt_
Mortgage/Home Loan-|-$91,768.44-|-----Quantum*-----|--10.85%---|----25 yrs--------|-----$1150.00----|
Past due-mtg------------|--$7038.92---|-----Quantum*-----|--10.85%---|------n/a---------|-------$150---------|
Pers. loan----------------|--$6482.19---|--Citi F1nancial---|---22.56%--|---48 mths------|-----$204.11-------|
Student loan-------------|--$6500-------|--Unk Creditor-----|---10%------|---unknown-----|----unknown------|[*Mom says Quantum is a company under Wells Fargo. Not sure about the accuracy of this]Ok. So. Those are the oh-so-fun stats that I have to work with. Data points:1.) They are fairly underwater on their home. I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s valued at maybe $85,000 (nice home, just a small rural town).. but they&apos;ve owned it for approx 9 years now and have been behind on payments several times. That leads to..2.) Their credit is terrible. 500-600 FICO.3.) The &quot;Past due-mtg&quot; is how late they are on their mortgage payments.. I included it seperately in the chart because:---A. The bank claims that they will be able to lower the interest and consider for a better re-fi once the late balance is paid.---B. The bank wont let them pay anything towards the principle until the outstanding debt is paid.. Really though they&apos;re the same debt, just divided.4.) Pers. Loan started at $2,500 at 12% 4(ish) years ago. Since they only pay the minimum I think she said it came to $74=principle and $129=interst. *Shudder* I guess they&apos;ve added onto it at times when they&apos;ve been desperate. It&apos;s just grown into this big hairy, evil monster.5.) The student loan began 25 years ago. It&apos;s original balance? Almost $8,000. Needless to say it&apos;s been neglected, time and time again.**Folks I understand my parents haven&apos;t been smart with their money, but you should have seen them 6-7 years ago. They&apos;ve done well to get rid of the 19% CC&apos;s. But in doing so the monstrous home loan and personal loan have just been growing.I&apos;ll update this line when I find out how much they&apos;re able to contribute per month towards debt. I asked her in the spreadsheet I sent but she missed that answer. I think it&apos;ll fall around ~$2,000 but I cant be positive until I get her response. Again, will update when able.Now, for what I&apos;m willing/desiring to do. I&apos;ve got $8,000 in liquid savings I can contribute which I&apos;d be happy to do. I&apos;m off to Afghaniland for 6 months relatively soon so money for me is not an issue. I&apos;ll come back with way more than the $8,000 I&apos;m willing to contribute, and if it were to stay under my name it&apos;d most likely sit in a RCA at 4% anyway. Either I earn 4% interst or my parents stop paying %20+. No brainer here.. I&apos;m also interested in a fun BT opportunity I received in the mail from Discover. 0% BT/0 fees for 12 months. I don&apos;t have a card through them yet but if I can receive even a small BT from them that can sit in a 0% account for even a year, it&apos;d prevent a mountain of interest being paid for them. Another way I&apos;ve considered how I can absorb some of their debt (again, voluntarily) is to re-fi my car. It&apos;s value is ~$13,000 (damn depreciation!!) and I only owe $4,500 at %4.24 APR. My CU is open to me re-fi&apos;ing for up to.. 80% of the vehicle&apos;s value, I think. Giving me potentially ~$5k to use towards their debt. I&apos;m also interested in them(my payrents), somehow, being able to take advantage of my credit score (730-750).. Even if it means I inherit some debt and a reasonable hit on my score.I&apos;ve used the website www.powerpay.org to help myself aggressively pay down loans and interest in the past and have plugged their numbers into the provided calculator. I see the results and understand the strategy required, as gruesome as it may be.This post&apos;s primary focus is to help ME out with ideas I may haven&apos;t considered, talk me down from some bad ideas that I&apos;ve listed above, give me advice on how to approach some of this, and maybe even a motivational momento or two. TIA FWF. I know you wont let me down. -Brad Parents- Cheap Breathalizer - $4.99 free shipping and free headphones

 Added on : Sunday August 07th 2011 06:00:08 PM My parents and I all have our names on a property that for examples sake is worth 150k. It&apos;s currently an investment property and my parents who are nearing retirement age operate it. They basically put me on the title 25+ years ago when still a child. I was thinking that it might be a good idea to buy them out for the following reasons:a. release them from the stress of managing a rental property
b. allow them to &quot;cash in&quot; at 100k. They want me to inherit it(feels gross writing about this), but I like the idea of just saying, hey, here&apos;s a big wad of cash, your retirement dates just moved up a smidge.Anyone have any insight on this? Are there tax implications I&apos;m missing, other reasons why this might be a bad idea. I think the title change would be 2k or so, but not sure if there are other things to consider. I&apos;ve been prone to asking questions here after I make a bad decision, I&apos;m hoping to avoid that this time around and make a fully informed decision. Precious Metals IRA 
 Added on : Thursday August 04th 2011 06:00:12 PM I had my parents IRA account at citibank and for the last year out of over $40k they made only $200 on so called &quot;High Yield Account&quot; which is ~ 1/2%.
I figured that if they would invest this money into Precious Metals IRA account with silver coins by now they would have over $80k (08/2010 price was $18 per TO). I can consider other silver coins and silver bullion as well as gold coins and gold bullion or gold Krugerrands.So seeing that want to help my parents to open a PM IRA account for them (and maybe for myself as well)
and asking if you have any suggestions which company to pick:
1) which one has the lowest application fee (I see it varies from $25 - $100)
2) storage options and fees
3) maintenance fees ( as low as $100 annual fees , $35 per month or percentage of the account )
4) termination fees ($100-$250)
5) anything else I am missing Travel agent asking for 2 much information booking travel for parents

 Added on : Tuesday August 02nd 2011 03:00:15 PM I&apos;m thinking about moving some of my investment funds somewhere outside the US as a hedge against &quot;worst possible&quot; scenarios. My grandparents were forced to leave germany in the 30&apos;s and essentially lost everything.Since I&apos;m investing in EM anyway (and already have the currency exchange risk) does it make sense to open a trading account in a foreign country so that I&apos;m not tied to the US financial system? This is not an attempt to &quot;hide&quot; money from the IRS, just a final safety net.Any suggestions about the best (safest, cheapest, easiest) ways to do this?

 Added on : Saturday July 30th 2011 12:00:51 PM School of Ants
Thanks for your interest in participating in the School of Ants!
The School of Ants project is a citizen-scientist driven study of the ants that live in urban areas, particularly around homes and schools. Collection kits are available to anyone interested in participating. Teachers, students, parents, kids, junior-scientists, senior citizens and enthusiasts of all stripes are involved in collecting ants in schoolyards and backyards using a standardized protocol so that we can make detailed maps of the wildlife that lives just outside our doorsteps. The maps that we create with these data are telling us quite a lot about native and introduced ants in cities, not just here in North Carolina, but across the United States and, as this project grows, about the ants of the world!
We are working with scientists, educators, kids, adults and enthusiasts of all stripes to collect ants in schoolyards, around workplaces and in everyone&apos;s backyard. This is a brief description of how the project works if you have other questions that are not answered here, send us an email at theschoolofants@gmail.com. FIRST and most importantly, if you would like a sampling kit (or several), you can sign up here using our on-line form. We will send you the sampling kit in the mail, and when you have collected your sample you then send the kit back to us.EACH KIT consists of 9 plastic vials, a data entry form and an instruction sheet. The basic idea is to place 4 of the open vials (pre-packed with cookie bait) in green space (lawns, gardens, woods), and another 4 on paved space (asphalt, concrete, cobblestone) for one hour on a warm day and see what ants discover the baits in this time frame. The additional orange-capped vial is for anything else you may be itching to have identified by our expert team! (ALLERGY WARNING!: the vials come with cookie bait inside. Cookies contain pecans, wheat, egg and whey) COLLECTING the samples takes approximately one hour, and is designed to be short enough to fit in a class session.

 Added on : Wednesday July 20th 2011 09:00:09 PM Hi all,My parents are approaching retirement age, and asked me a little help in planning their money.I&apos;m going to ask a few specific and generic questions, so feel free to simply point me to good resources if it makes sense.Here&apos;s the basic situation:
- Parents are ~ 60 years old
- Mom is going to retire in about 5 years as a teacher with a pension (will be around $35k/yr)
- Total semi-liquid investments are around $900k ( IRA, CD&apos;s, mutual funds, savings, etc ).
- Current home mortgage is completely paid off. Worth maybe $200-$250k range. Home is in a market that is not very liquid.
- No debt
- Live a very modest lifestyle, but I&apos;d like to see them have some fun with their money as they&apos;ve always been very, very frugal in life.They have questions around the following:They are interested in possibly purchasing more real estate (lake house type deal). Total cost would probably be in the $350k range. My questions are:
1. Overall, how possible is this based on their current situation? They obviously have money for a down payment, but how easily can they obtain a loan for the other 80% based on pension + retirement investment income alone?
2. What kind of mortgage rates do people use who purchase homes at this age? 15 yr fixed? 30yr fixed?
3. How does real estate compare for inheritance taxes compared to other investment vehicles? Either a new home or investments will eventually be handed down to us of course (4 children)
I&apos;ve run some rough numbers through FireCalc based on 30 years, and have these 2 basic scenarios. Please point out anything I might be missing:Option 1: Buy a home valued at $350k. Assume minimal to no rental income from it.Portfolio = $900k
Home down payment (20%) = $70,000
Other real estate transactions/furnishing/etc = $50kAnnual income based on $780k remaining portfolio:
$30k per year for 30 years (FireCalc shows 96% success if they withdraw)
$35k pensions from mom
$10k conservative estimate from some side business
-----
$75k total or ~ $6k/month. Less after taxes.Rough Monthly Expenses:
- $1672 (30yr mortgage/6% - assuming rates will go up)
- $2362 (15yr mortgage/6%)
- property tax on both homes
- typical expenses (food, gas, utilities)
- healthcare ??? I know very little about this at retirement.
- some money for travel - figure $6k total per year maybe?Option 2: Purchase no home, just retire as they are.
Let&apos;s work with the numbers above first.How do these numbers look to people? Brother MFC-7360N Laser Multifunction Printer for $103 after coupon @ Staples

 Added on : Sunday July 17th 2011 12:01:47 PM Apologies this is one of my first ever posts and I tried to ensure it wasnt a repeat.While at my local Target store, the entire stock of Kung Zhu pets (individual pets) were all marked down clearance to $2.50 and a wide array of the Kung Zhu playsets and accessories as well were also significantly reduced. My kids have moved on from these, but they would be great for stocking stuffers this Xmas or a great little gift for any birthday parties over the summer.I hope this helps some other value hunting parents out there! These were located on the typical clearance end caps in the toy department and also still stocked on the standard aisle where the Zhu Zhu pets were normally located as well. Paying Nanny taxes for grandparents 
 Added on : Sunday July 17th 2011 12:00:06 AM I have a unique tax situation. My mother-in-law lives with us and helps us take care of two kids less than 5 years old.
However, because of this she is not able to look for work. Right now we are only paying for her daily expenses plus providing room and board.
My wife is pushing me to pay her a salary and FICA taxes so that she can earn the last 12 credits to be eligible for Medicare.
Now, I read IRS publication 926 which says I can only pay for her social security and medicare taxes if &quot;you are married to and living with a person whose physical or mental condition prevents him or her from caring for your child for at least 4 continuous weeks in a calendar quarter.&quot;
Does the fact both me and my wife work qualify under this exception?
I work full time and my wife works 3 days a week.
I have no problem with paying her a salary plus taxes instead of expenses. However the fact she has the same address as ours is a concern.
I don&apos;t want to do anything illegal or get into any trouble with IRS or SSA...
While I would prefer her to have a part-time job instead, it&apos;s quite hard for her to both work and help us with two kids..It seems to me that I&apos;m not the only one who has this situation.

http://www.fullofdeals.com/forums/free-stuff/1079050/ Organizing my life post graduation. (Update, LONG post warning) 
 Added on : Tuesday July 05th 2011 06:00:05 PM Hi, everyone!I made a post here two years ago around gathering some advice on organising my financial outlook and randomly came across it in a Google search. While I know it&apos;s probably been long forgotten, I thought it would be a good idea to provide an update on how I&apos;m doing for others that might be in similar predicaments. (Summary: just graduated college, bachelor&apos;s in computer engineering, offered a well-paying job with awesome benefits.)Here is the link to that post: click meAnd here are updates to the major points people responded to:Firstly, I already have an apartment of my own, but as it&apos;s covered mostly by my parents, I&apos;m thinking of moving out to somewhere a bit nicer. Considering my situation, would it be better to rent out for a while as I eliminate my credit card debt, or should I start thinking about going for a mortgage and owning property for a longer term?

I decided to do the common sense thing and stay where I am. It would be pretty dumb to leave; I live alone in a great area, the floor is owned by my parents and the &quot;rent&quot; I pay goes completely back into my loans. It&apos;s a win-win-win.

The balance on one of my credit cards has been completely alleviated and the other one has been mostly paid off. Additionally, my loan principals are coming down nicely; they are still high as all hell, but I&apos;m making decent progress by paying significantly more than minimum on my biggest loans, paying &quot;a bit&quot; over minimum on smaller loans and paying minimum on government loans (they are very low in comparison to the others).

I will not consider moving anywhere until at least one of my biggest loans is completely paid off. When that happens, I&apos;ll have enough free cash flow to afford somewhere decent. This won&apos;t be for a good while unless something amazing happens in the interim, so I&apos;m not holding my breath. (On a good note, I did get a very nice raise recently which helps in this regard.) I will be considering a house since renting in most places in NYC is a terrible value in comparison.

Secondly, I want to start thinking about finally building my nest egg so that I can be somewhat well off later on in life. The only problem is that I have no idea where to really begin, nor did I ever get good direction for doing this. I was thinking real estate, but it seems way too risky for me as a grad to dabble with, especially with my credit scenario.

So I&apos;m definitely not thinking of doing real estate!

My savings strategy is pretty simple at the moment. 10% of my paycheck goes into a long term savings account that is not used for absolutely anything else except dire emergencies. (&quot;Dire emergencies&quot; are really easy to mess with, so I set hard limits on what this constitutes.) I also save a smaller amount of money per week for high-priced items I want in the future, like vacations or upgrades for my bike. The goal with this account is, obviously, to save enough for the things I want! With that in mind, I&apos;m more lenient about withdrawing money from this account on rainy days, though I reimburse what I take out in full in the next pay cycle.

I was scared about doing this in the past because I was afraid I would have no money left for me to use, but I&apos;m happy about the way things are progressing. I have a while to go before I reach my goals, but I&apos;m happy I&apos;m finally getting there.


(I was told to do this when I first started making decent money as a sophomore in college, but I ignored that advice. Don&apos;t do the same!)

Where should I start doing research on how to really start making my money work for me?I&apos;m not anywhere near close to a position where I can start investing my money in &quot;riskier&quot; strategies (stock market, etc.), so I&apos;m sticking to the basics above and growing the 401K offered by my job. Hope that helps someone! I could be doing better, but I&apos;m pretty happy about the direction I&apos;m taking with my money now. I finally feel like I have control! Holiday rental apartment in Rome , paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Venice ?

 Added on : Tuesday July 05th 2011 03:00:04 AM I saw the thread on Home Owner&apos;s Insurance and it reminded me I wanted to post up a thread and ask about having a home inventory and using that with an insurance claim.My parents had their home broken into about a month ago. The burglars took 2 large plasma tv&apos;s, about 30k worth of jewelry, an ipad, two laptops, and all their fishing gear (don&apos;t ask me why!).They made a claim on their home owners insurance, without having any home inventory (or any other proof of ownership of any of the items), after filing the police report and ultimately the insurance said at best they could give them a percentage amount (not a lot) for the electronics items only if they could provide an owners manual. The insurance company asked them for and wanted purchase receipts for everything. After they calculated what they would get after their deductible (1k), they decided it wasn&apos;t worth it to make the claim.This got me thinking about what might happen to me in that situation and how I could prepare.I&apos;m just wondering if anyone has actually had to make a claim after a burglary and did you have some type of home inventory and if so, did the insurance co accept it? I can&apos;t believe people are keeping purchase receipts for years on end. I know they say you should take pictures of items, make a video walking through your house, etc. Just wondering if that actually works or if the insurance co will try and weasel out of paying anything even with pictures/video/home inventory/etc. Lil&apos; Rider SubZero Drifter Battery Powered Car w/ Remote $125.98 Shipped @ Tanga

 Added on : Wednesday June 29th 2011 12:00:10 PM My parents are US citizens and reside in the US. They are retirees. They own real estate property in Asia (my mom inherited the land from her father several years ago). A buyer wants to purchase their property for about $400,000 USD. If the proceeds from the sale are wired to the US, would the money be considered taxable income in the US? Is there a difference in terms of tax liability if the buyer wires the money directly to my parents&apos; US bank account or if my parents wire the money from their own Asian bank account to their US bank account?

Thank You. Need advice on how to manage my loans! v. student loans 
 Added on : Tuesday June 28th 2011 03:00:05 PM Hi all, I joined up to ask for some advice on my current financial situation after I saw how much good advice people are throwing around on this forum.Background....
I&apos;m 23 years old and have been working a full-time job for almost nine months since I graduated last May. I earn exactly 50k/year (2 paychecks of roughly 1.3k(net) a month). I have really good job security but do not see a promotion/pay raise coming on the horizon within the next six months/one year.My current debt situation....
Phone bill - Parents family plan(gave father $500 in Oct of 2010 to cover my phone line from Oct2010-Oct-2011).
Car Insurance - $140 a month
Car Payment - $340 a month. 1.9% for another 4.5 years. Over the 5/yr loan I will pay ~$950 in interest (fine by me).These are my problem areas...
Student Loan #1 - Federal Student Loan, $230 a month until 2020 - Fixed 6.8% interest. I always put in $230 + another payment of $100 = $330/mo. **The interest I pay on this is tax deductible.** (This loan is 18k total)Studnet Loan #2 - HESAA NJCLASS, I deferred for a year upon graduating, starts next month at $370/mo - 7.92% interest. Plan to put in extra $100/mo = $470/mo. This loan is the BIG pain in my ass. The HESAA-NJCLASS website is a maze of dead-ends and does everything in its power to not help you find an answer. **I am almost 100% sure the interest paid on this loan is also tax deductible** My problem with this loan is that they only give you three methods of payment.. (This loan is 43k total)1. Check by mail.
2. Discover/Mastercard with a 2% BS &quot;convenience fee.&quot;
3. Direct debit.1. I am not comfortable sending Checks In The Mail.
2. Only have AMEX&amp;VISA (go figure). Plus I refuse to pay that BS fee.
3. I am much more comfortable sending a customized payment amount every month with whatever amount I want it to be, because on a month to month basis I might/might not be able to throw on extra cash to the payment. With a direct debit it will always be the same amount every month, I would not have control over adding/subtracting to the payment.It is ridiculous to force an individual to choose between these three asinine payment options.... sigh.... gets me so mad. Anyway..Total = $140(car ins.) + $340(car payment) + $330(loan #1 +100) + $470(loan #2 +100) = $1280 (1/2 of net pay per month, FML)This leaves me with only 1.3k a month to do what I would like with.With that $1.3k I plan to put $500-$800/mo (depending on monthly expenses) away into my ING savings account until it hits $15k(has $13k now)once money goes in there it does NOT come out for ANY reason.... I plan on building that up to $15k so I have a nice &quot;cash reserve/emergency fund,&quot; then I plan to start putting money into an investment account after I reach the $15k goal in ING and start investing in mutual funds, which I will also NOT TOUCH. (I will not touch the ING/investment account until I purchase a home by year end 2012 - hopefully). Does that sound like a &quot;smart&quot; plan to you guys? Would you advise on anything else?And now the purpose of this whole topic!!
Would it be a good idea to REFINANCE my two student loans at a bank in order to get a lower interest rate&amp;payment options I am more comfortable with?
My main concerns are...
1)Losing the tax deductions I get on the interest. If i refinance the loans do I still get the tax deductions on interest paid with my refinanced loan?
2)I feel it would be a smart move financially to refinance because once I eventually do buy a home could I combine the mortgage with the refinanced loan? Or would I be able to combine my loans as they are right now with a mortgage whenever I do eventually buy a home?Please throw some advice my way - anything would be much appreciated! If you need me to clarify anything in my post (which I&apos;m sure you will) just let me know. THANKS! Can you pay off somebody else&apos;s 2nd mortgage? 
 Added on : Sunday June 26th 2011 12:00:05 AM I m in California and I wanted to help out my parents with paying off most of their 2nd mortgage around $80K. Went to my bank got a cashiers check made out to my parents bank with their account number. Then I went with my dad to their bank and made a payment for his 2nd mortgage. Cashier accepted the check without any problems even though my name was on the check (I have same last name as my dad), Today I login to their account and the whole payment was reversed. Any ideas why would they do that? Or what would be the best way for me to pay off their 2nd mortgage? Thank you for any info. I will be able to call the bank on Monday.

 Added on : Saturday June 18th 2011 09:00:05 PM Short story, I stored two of my bikes never ridden (I bought last summer 2010 brand new) in the basement of my apartment in NYC. 5 days ago I found out they were missing, and talked to the janitor who is employed by the landlord and he said he asked everyone in the building if it was their bikes, and since no one claimed them he had the garbage people take them when they came to take other items from the basement. He obviously never asked us. The two bikes were locked and put at the side and were not in anyone&apos;s way. Last summer the same janitor moved our grill to the basement with out our knowledge and after we tracked him down he informed us of this and told us we can keep it down there and use it whenever we want. So since then we assumed we can put our stuff down there. Just to be sure this time we informed the lady who collects our monthly rental check (she lives above us)and also works for the buildings owners that we stored our bikes down in the basement, and she also said that was not a problem. The bikes I bought at target on clearance and I still have receipts for it, and also I have my receipts for the lock, and also for the dog leash attachment I bought (it which was attached to the bike). My question is do I just sue the janitor, or do I sue the landlord? I spoke to the landlord and they said that I did not have written permission from them so its not their responsibility and I understand that. This janitor guy is an idiot and Im sure he took the bikes or sold them to someone. The bike was a Schwinn s-60 and a Mens Schwinn Cimarron. To replace these bikes it would cost more than what I paid for them and really I just want them replaced. So the question is whoever I need to sue can I request the current value of what it would be at the store, or can I only sue for what I paid for them. I just want to know my options. I am really pissed and learned my lesson to get everything in writing, and starting this month I am also asking for monthly rental receipts just in case I run into a problem. I can only replace the bikes if I can find a crazy clearance deal but those are hard here in NYC ( I got the bikes in St. Louis, MO and then 2 weeks later found out I was moving to NYC for rotations) so that is why the bikes were at my parents house till just recently hence them still being brand new. Thanks for everyone&apos;s help in advance. Can I preemptively sue? (Kitchen remodel disaster) 
 Added on : Friday June 17th 2011 03:00:07 PM I&apos;m not sure if this is the right forum, but any advice would be appreciated. I could write an essay on this disaster, but I&apos;ll try to summarize below:My parents hired a company to remodel their kitchen, which included demolishing the old cabinets and countertop and replacing with custom cabinets and caesarstone countertops. The contract was signed in November 2010 but actual work started in January 2011. Due to various delays, none of which was my parents fault, our kitchen was not useable until March 2011. Since March 2011 the kitchen is useable but the contract has not been fulfilled. There are still random milestones that need to be completed before we can make our final payment of about $4,400. The company has since gone bankrupt and they have about 10 new reviews on BBB which similar disaster stories. I want to finish this project without them, because I simply dont trust these guys coming in my house anymore (they have lied numerous times about who are the company employees and who are subcontractors). About 20 different people related this company now have my address and I&apos;ve heard they have not been paid for their work either. I don&apos;t want to sue for monetary damages, but I want to avoid having them call me 2 months from now when they emerge from bankruptcy demanding their final balance or wishing to complete the pending work. I dont think I should be held hostage until these guys are ready to come through on their end of the deal. I also dont want subcontractors putting liens on my house because they havent been paid by the company yet. Is it possible to sue just to receive a judgment that the Company is at fault and I no longer need to work with them? I just want to complete the kitchen and not have to hear from these guys again, but I can totally imagine them coming after me in a few months asking for their money. I guess this wasn&apos;t much of a summary, but any help would be appreciated before I go for a free consultation with a lawyer, if necessary. I was hoping to accomplish everything through small claims. Magazine Subscriptions $5 each or less, Wired, Inc. Glamour, ESPN, Parents, Rolling Stone, Mens Health,

 A few questions about credit cards 
 Added on : Wednesday June 15th 2011 12:00:07 PM I am just starting out trying to better myself in the financial world.Credit cards, now-a-days, it seems aren&apos;t the easiest to come by, at least for myself, I keep getting credit history not long enough, declination.I do have a couple credit cards, some store ones, and one from the bank where I work.Now, I have a few questions about the major (AMEX, discover, citi, etc.) credit cards.
1.) I live with my parents. It asks for household income. I work at a bank and I make around 25,000 a year. My dad is a doctor, and my mom is a nurse, so the total household income actually turns out to be closer to 400,000-500,000 a year, but if I throw out those numbers won&apos;t that be fishy?2. a.) I&apos;m curious about CLI, how often you should do it. I have a best buy credit card with an 1,100 limit. I am going to be needing to buy a few things from there (Dishwasher, washer, dryer, tv) when I move out (Should be in the next 6 months). I&apos;ve had the card for a year, and have always made early payments, and made them way above the minimum payment. (I&apos;ve only paid like $3.00 in interest so far) And I have taken the card close to the limit a couple of times, but always pay it off very promptly. Would it be prudent to ask for an increase now, and if it isn&apos;t respectable (a couple of hundred dollars without a hard pull) ask for another in a month or two time, or will that throw up a red flag?
2.b) Should I do it through the online credit limit increase, or better luck calling?3.) Is there any credit card recommendation. I do have a car in my name (15,000) that i am paying over the payment on time every month, and my Equifax CS is 697, my trans. is 685 and my Ex is a 692.My oldest credit card is about 2 years old
I have
Sears mastercard
Best Buy credit card
United bank mastercard
JCP
Rogers (For the girlfriend)
Macys
PaypalI&apos;m thinking of getting rid of the Macy&apos;s card, JCP Card, and the Sears card, because I don&apos;t really like them or use them, but I&apos;d rather have a replacement from like Citi or Discover that would be my main credit card.Thank you guys for the help.Loneknight07 Go The F**k to Sleep - FREE amazon.com - audio version

 Added on : Monday June 06th 2011 03:00:27 PM http://instoresnow.walmart.com/enhancedrendercontent_ektid96421.... Would you pay a 13% Premium for a house in a particular school zone? 
 Added on : Monday June 06th 2011 03:00:08 PM My wife and I are getting ready to build within a year and are torn on location. We currently have no kids, but plan to have them within a couple years. At this point, schools are not one of the leading decisions for our housing purchase, but we are thinking about re-sell. We do plan on building with the intent of being here 10+ years.Looking at a particular builder and he builds in a few areas across town, but the areas he builds in that are zoned for the city schools (highly regarded in the area) are commanding a ~13% premium. The other school zones are not as highly regarded according to the Greatschools.net website and just talking to local parents. I don&apos;t think there is anything wrong with these schools such as violence, drugs, etc, just the fact they they consistently do not perform as well on test scores. All the neighborhoods have great amenities and we would be happy with the locations of any of them. In the grand scheme of things, would you guys pay the $40,000 premium to be in a prime school zone? It seems like most builders and comps carry this premium as well, so it is not builder or seller specific. We learned when moving to this area, that the first thing a lot of people look for are houses zoned for this particular city. I just have a hard time shelling out $40,000 extra, but I also want to consider re-sell, as well as my own kid&apos;s education when that time rolls around. Of course, a lot can happen between now and then...FWIW, base cost of house is $310,000....same one in city school zoning is $350,000. Also, this consideration doesn&apos;t take into account any property tax numbers yet. This particular &quot;prime city school zone&quot; actually encompasses 2 different counties, so those taxes will undoubtedly vary, based on which side of the county line you are on. Right now I am just focused on the home pricing premium.EDIT: For those interested, the prime city schools are Madison City and the other non-prime schools are Huntsville City in Alabama.Also, the Huntsville City schools are currently $20-million in debt and looking to close ~7 schools next year. None of the schools in the areas we are looking at outside of the Madison city are scheduled to be closed, but obviously that deficit and those closings would be felt system-wide. This one fact alone is pushing towards paying the premium...just trying to get other&apos;s thoughts from a financial standpoint. Thanks!

For my parents in NJ, total w/tax was around $802, figure the Xbox nets $140, and the laptop costs $662 new in box (no refurb or recert).Sent my mom&amp;dad to Best Buy to get it (they&apos;re in their 70&apos;s), and they brought my niece with her high school ID. Sales rep said &quot;No, gotta be a college student&quot;. They talked to the manager, and he said as long as they could provide a .edu email address, he would authorize it.Mom called me and I gave her my alumni .edu email (I am not a student). But they accepted it and gave her the laptop with the free Xbox. So if you don&apos;t have a college ID and email address, it is YMMV. Also, my alumni email address is valid, but they didn&apos;t send anything to check, so I guess you could probably just make up any email with an edu suffix.

 Added on : Tuesday May 24th 2011 09:00:45 PM Hi all,I did a bit of research on the forums here before posting, but I apologize in advance if any questions asked sound redundant.A bit of background: I&apos;m a single 25 y/o college grad working full time as a computer tech (for a pretty high profile company). Been with the company about a year and a half, and got a promotion at the end of October last year. My current salary is ~47k year (not counting OT), living and working in the NYC market. I have no credit card debt, but meager savings (about 10k between my portfolio&amp;401k). Since cost of living here is so high I find it hard to put any money away (that&apos;s not being deducted from my paycheck, at least).My parents never went to college, but wanted the best for me. Unfortunately, neither them nor I knew very much about paying for college. So, I went to a state university and, four years later, graduated with a degree in journalism and about 60k of debt. Now, four years after leaving college, my parents are divorcing and their lawyers are apparently making my college debt a key issue.It&apos;s important to know that for a long while after graduation, we were making payments using a few cashed bonds my great grandmother had left behind for me. When that ran out, I started paying $250 a month, and my dad has been chipping away at the Parent PLUS loan each month as well. I guess the fundamental problem is that my name is on my Stafford Loans, and my dad&apos;s name is on the Parent PLUS loan. They want the debt out of my father&apos;s name, but according to everything I&apos;ve read, the Parent PLUS loan is in his name forever and always.Here are the details.EdFinancial - $11,514.97

Consolidation - UNSUB /
SALLIE MAE TRUST - LSC/FLRepayment02/07/2007$46,149.276.125%
Aside from a general repayment strategy, I am looking for advice on how to get all of this debt not only into my name, but into a manageable monthly payment. The lawyers suggested I take a loan out from a private lender (a credit union or something to that effect), and pay off both loans in their entirety, thereby consolidating (in a more roundabout way) to a single debt.I like to think I&apos;m pretty savvy when it comes to personal finance, but loans/consolidation are areas outside of my current grasp. I&apos;m making a concerted effort to learn about it real quick though. Any and all advice is welcome.Thanks,

 Added on : Tuesday May 24th 2011 12:00:55 AM My fiancee parents had her set aside money for savings, while she was living with them, while she was going back to school. She saved $10k during this time which they kept in savings/cds/whatever. The wrote her a partial check for $5k for her to invest in her own fashion. I was thinking ETFs, any better options out there? Liquidity is not important. Would have invest in LendingClub but after seeing their financials they seem to be a failing company.

 Added on : Monday May 23rd 2011 06:00:39 PM I recently applied for my first credit card to Citi (Citi Forward Card for College Students). I am looking to establish credit as I have no credit history yet. I am 22 years old, a full-time student, and have never incurred any credit as I have paid in full with cash on my car and have my phone bill taken care of by my parents while I am schooling. I received a letter back from Citi after a few days with an SSA-89 form inside (Social Security Administration Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Release Social Security Number Verification form). It noted that they will do another hard pull whenever they receive it. I made about $18,000 last year and got a raise at the beginning of this year, where I will now make $30,000 for the year. I am applying for the card solely to build credit. I will only use it once a month and pay in full to keep it active, but with&lt;5% credit utilization.I am worried now if this letter means I am going to be denied as that was what I read here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110302100123AAKT6Y...I have tried to do free credit reports in the past bu they never go through. After talking to Experian (or was it Equifax?) 6 months ago or so they said that I couldn&apos;t view it because I have no credit history. I am worried now that I may get denied, especially if there are 2 hard pulls on there. This may make it much harder for me to get a different card from someone else, correct? My goal was to get approved for one card, so that my credit profile would get filled in. Then get added as an authorized user on my parents&apos; cards as they have perfect credit history and pay everything off monthly. I have read that this still works, despite FICO 08, but perhaps I am wrong? From there I wanted to get a small short term loan just to pay it off and get a different type of positive credit on there. Then wait several months and app for a second card to also use once and pay in full.My question is, should I send back my SSA-89 form and take another hard pull or is it likely that I am going to get denied and should try for an &apos;easier card&apos; (suggestions?) or just get a secured card? I have the form all filled out with a copy of my SS card as well as an additional short letter which said that I received a pay raise and will be receiving $30,000 this year rather than $18,000 like I reported last year (as I put $30k as my income on my app) and was including a copy of my recent paystub to verify this.I figured it would be smart for me to ask the financial minds here about what they think would be best for me to do as I trust your advice.Sidenote: On the credit card app it said to put your personal income if you were under 21 and your household income if you were over 21. I am 22, but recently moved back in with my parents for a bit. They make $270,000 a year and I figured that &apos;household income&apos; for persons over 21 was actually referring to your income with spouse&apos;s income (I am single). I went ahead and put $30k instead of the $300k actual &apos;household income&apos; as I figured that is what they really needed and the lack of congruence between my $30k income should they asked for me to verify it and the $300k household income noted may raise a red flag. Hopefully this was correct? It is what my parents suggested. $180k+ in Student Loan Debt, I&apos;m Drowning! 
 Added on : Saturday May 21st 2011 12:01:10 PM Hey guys and gals, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard this one a million times on here before...First of all, this is my first post, I joined solely with the idea of getting help on this topic (and I already got free batteries!). I&apos;m a 26 year old dude, and a registered nurse in the ICU at one of Chicago&apos;s top hospitals. In order to get here, however, I attended an accelerated nursing program at a private university. In order to get into the accelerated program (18 months for a BSN instead of 4 years), I needed to use the other Bachelor&apos;s degree I had obtained from the same private university. That one&apos;s in Graphic Design. I won&apos;t bore you with the details, but I had a change of heart, that why such different fields. Along this 6 year journey, I acquired about $180,000 in student loan debt. The way this happened was the stars aligned and I slipped into every loophole on the planet. 1) When I started school I had very little guidance from my folks and the people at school. FAFSA told me my parents made too much money and their &quot;expected family contribution&quot; was a good chunk of my tuition...sad to say, there&apos;s no box to check for &quot;extremely selfish parents&quot;. I got nothing from them. I was forced to go the Private (read: Signature Loan from Sallie Mae) route. Of course I could have not gone to such an expensive school, but that&apos;s what a more mature me sees, not a younger, dumber me. In addition, I was unable to work during the accelerated program per requirements, and I was required to live off-campus since I was married, which meant I needed to include rent into my loans. Almost all of my loans are private, as said before. So, the interest (which started to get higher and higher as my debt level increased), ended up tacking like $30,000 onto my loans when I finished my first degree. Now, before anyone says anything, I was pretty frugal. My rent was $925/mo. I had no car payments, my wife was working, we didn&apos;t have &quot;toys&quot;, etc. I just got stuck in a bad situation. Here is my current monthly situation:
Student Loans $1500 (minimum)
Rent $925
Insurance $180
Gas $300
AT&amp;T;$45
ComEd $70
T-Mobile $177
Misc. $150
Spending $60
Prescription/Dr. $60
Food/Diapers $400The Misc. is for car repairs, wedding gifts, etc. The spending is $30 for me, and $30 for my wife...per month. We do have two young daughters, but my wife makes all their food, so they don&apos;t cost much at all. I have NO credit card debt, NO car loans, NO bad habits or vices...I sold my Jeep, my dream vehicle, and bought a used Honda Civic to cut down on gas. Please help me. I am already on a special interest-only style payment plan with Sallie Mae for like 3 more years, and I&apos;m not sure I can afford it when it comes back up. I am working full time, and the night shift to get the extra differential. I also have a second job working 2 additional 12 hour shifts (5 total) per week. I&apos;m making like $44/hr at the second job, too, so the pay is good. We had our second daughter in February, and it didn&apos;t make much financial sense to send both our daughters to daycare when it would cost around 50-60% of my wife&apos;s salary. So, she has just started staying home. Guys, I&apos;m doing it right. I went to school, I got a degree (in a field that is 100% devoted to helping people), and I have NOTHING. I can&apos;t even buy a car or a house because these student loans are destroying me. $1500/month? Are you kidding me? Add that to the $925 I pay in rent and I should be able to be living the good life! I fully understand it&apos;s my debt, and I have earned it, but what can I do? Is there no law against charging someone 25% of their salary for loans?Please folks, give me your advice! No one will consolidate this amount of loans, especially private. My parents have since blown through all of their money (although my four younger brothers and sisters have all learned from my mistakes, which is good). I&apos;m just lost, and it&apos;s really starting to effect my attitude (that, and working 5-6 days a week), and that&apos;s effecting my relationship with my wife and kids...and I hate that. Thanks in advance. DanePS - my wife has recently gotten really into couponing as a way to save more money.

 Added on : Wednesday May 18th 2011 03:00:55 AM I&apos;m going back to school and am in a weird financial situation. I&apos;m trying to reduce my assets, in order to qualify for need-based financial aid.The big plan is to start paying a lot of bigger expenses out of my assets for my parents, such as car repairs and home repairs they&apos;ve been putting off the past few years. Any money left over after that, I would gift the rest to my parents. The gift would certainly fall under the IRS gift limits. (I really don&apos;t have that much money!)The only thing problematic is that I have a stock that if I sold today, I&apos;d have to take a ~2000 loss. I&apos;d rather not do that, but at the same time, don&apos;t want to hold onto it anymore because I&apos;m afraid that having that asset will keep me from qualifying for financial aid next year. Is there a downside to straight gifting a depreciated stock to my parents? I know that people usually sell the depreciated stock and then give the proceeds of the sale to take the tax benefit themselves, but I&apos;m only going to make a few thousand this year, so I don&apos;t need any investment losses to offset my income, since I don&apos;t expect to pay any income tax anyways.

LINK Joint Mortgage - how credit works 
 Added on : Sunday May 15th 2011 03:00:25 PM Hello FWers,My parents own a house (both title and mortgage is under both parents name) (House #1)
My wife and I own a house (title is joint in my wife and my name, but mortgage is only under my name) (House #2)
With the current state of the real estate market, my dad and I were planning to buy an investment condo (House #3).
I might need to buy another house with wife (start a family) in 2 years and put House#2 on rent (House #4).
Currently my parents are in a much higher tax bracket but that might change next year. (my wife will start working this year)For simplicity lets assume the mortgage+tax+maintenance on all 4 houses is $2000 each per month
Also lets assume house#2 and house#3 can be rented out for $2000 each per month.Question1: When mortgage companies check eligibility for mortgage, do they consider joint ownerships? When I&apos;m looking for a mortgage for house#4, will my eligibility for mortgage be reduced by $4000 (full payments for house2 and house3) or $3000 (full payment for house2 and partial payment for house#3)Question2: Also how do they account for rent? If the incoming rent equals outgoing mortgage+maintenance+tax, does that mean I can borrow against my entire wage salary for house#4?Question3: For House #3, would it be better to have the mortgage held jointly under my dad and my name or should only one of us (him) hold the mortgage. Any pros/cons for jointly held v/s one person holding the mortgage.I&apos;m thinking ahead so that I can maximize the available credit for my family. I don&apos;t want to hurt 2 credit history&apos;s if it makes sense to only hold mortgages in one person&apos;s name. Getting laid off with some savings...How to make it last?? 
 Added on : Friday May 13th 2011 06:02:12 PM My brother may be facing layoff from corporate America in about a month. Looking at people who have been getting layoff in recent years, he is concerned about the prospective of not being able to find a job for an extended period of time. He has a bit over $100,000 in 401k&amp;IRA accounts, $135,000 cash in savings account and another $20,000 or so as a severance package that may be coming his way. Unemployment benefits for NY State is currently $1,620 per month (10% taxable) which he may quality for 46 weeks if the lay off date is before 6/20 (26 weeks thereafter). He has no other investment and only other income is the $1,200/mo. net his wife brings home working part-time.
He has a house that was purchase about three years ago with a $350,000 mortgage (30 year fixed at 4.625%). With real estate tax escrow, monthly mortgage is around $3,900. He does not have car loan nor credit card balances ($55~60,000 limit between 4 cards) and he has a $120,000 HELOC at 2.75% APR. Even living frugally, he requires bare minimum of $6,000 to survive just because that is the way living cost is in Northern NJ (Metropolitan NYC). He does have considerable equity in his house but selling it and moving to a less expensive area is currently not an option for him for the same reason he turned down the relocation offer from his employer (specific medical attention required for one of this two young children). Downsizing the house will prove to be a difficult choice for now as he is taking care of both of our elderly parents and even on market, it will take a long time to sell the house and he is just not comtemplating on selling the house at 20% or higher loss just yet.Any ideas what he can do with his savings to generate maximum income (or minimize expenses) to minimize per monthly loss?? He may be forced to take a less paying position but I am sure he wont even consider it at least for a year if he is still unemployed at that time. He is just burnt out after many years of 60+ hours work week, hard traveling with very little vacation time and would like to take a couple of months off before fully committing himself into job search. However, he is very concerned about his financials and would like to avoid using up all his savings let alone tapping into the HELOC.I suggested maybe looking into purchasing a rental property but even if he used all his savings to purchase a $150,000 1 bedroom condo, he may only be earning $1,000/mo. max after taxes which would be a return of 8% per year and still leave him short of $2,342 on monthly basis and no savings which means he will need to tap into his HELOC right away ($1,458 unemployment + $1,200 wife earn + $ 1,000 rental income = $3,658 so $6,000 needed/mo - $3,658 income = $2,342 short). Another option would be for him to invest that money into a small business (proven franchise type of operation) which he may not be objected to doing with his wife&apos;s help. Knowing him, taking a risk in a risky short them stock investment would not be an viable option. Any suggestions?? Thank you in advance for your input my dear FW friends!

 Added on : Friday May 13th 2011 12:00:52 AM It&apos;s in Maui, Hawaii, and in September. Less than 1 years notice.I have a dilemma and feel I need to give some background on everyone involved.WHO:
My sister is a 30 year old R.N. (registered nurse) living w/ her fiance in a 6th floor of a 7-story
apartment or condo building in Seattle (it&apos;s a block away from the west coast w/ I&apos;m sure, a nice view of the Pacific Oean). I&apos;m sure she makes easily over $100k a year (probably closer to $150k) working graveyard shifts, 12-hour days, and OT. Her fiance is a IT programmer who used to work for Am@zon.com and now works for a startup company. I&apos;m positive he also grosses over $100k a year.Myself, I am a technician working for a county DOT (Dept of Transportation) grossing $54k a year. I basically net $1000 every 2 weeks and $500 of that goes to the mortgage. I max out on the HSA contributions at $236.53 every two weeks and put in $100 towards the 457b as well. I also have $100 of my paycheck directly routed into savings. Our department has had layoffs last July (2010) and will have some more again this July (2011). Because of my seniority (I have almost 10 years in), I will make it past this last round of layoffs. Supposedly, our dept will be break even after July so no more layoffs are necessary. My class has 8 people in it, and 3 will be laid off in July. I&apos;m projecting that if layoffs continue, I will be laid off 2 years from now. I have a wife (36 YO) I brought over from the Phi!ippines on a fiance visa. This August will be 3 years of marriage and we will be filing paperwork (and fees) to USCIS (Immigration) have her naturalized then. We have a beautiful 9-month old baby daughter (Charlie). We have a brother who works in another dept and makes almost $100k a year. His wife works in a medical
office netting $2k a month. They&apos;ve been married about 2 years and have no kids. They both have brand new cars (A
BMW and a mini Cooper) and a new home payment.Our parents. Mom is a housewife. Dad retired from the US Navy (22 years) as an E-6 and gets a pension.
They both now sell at the fleamarket so they can keep paying for their 6-bedroom house.WHAT&amp;WHEN:
My sister and her fiance have decided to have their wedding on September 3rd in Maui (Wailea-Makena) at a
small plantation house on the coast. Her side of the guest list is about 20 people total (pretty much just
immediate family, 2 cousins, and her best friend). As far as I know, all the rest of them are going except us.
Almost everyone else invited makes almost twice what I make. Our parents cursed at the idea of Hawaii. One of my
siblings will pay for them to be there but it hasn&apos;t been decided yet. I keep getting email hints from my siblings
that I should bunk in w/ my parents (probably meaning I should pay for them or go dutch w/ them) so they can &quot;help&quot;
take care of Charlie.WHY NOT:
This has been a very expensive year for us. Last month, my wife&amp;Charlie got back from their 33-day
vacation in the Phi!ippines. While they were away, I had floor tiling work done to the house (total cost almost
$3000). We did everything except the bedrooms and the garage. I used to own cats that would pee&amp;poop on the rugs
so now we all can breathe much easier w/o any lingering odors. In August, we&apos;re going to file the paperwork to have
my wife naturalized (probably about $700), and once that happens, we&apos;re going to file further paperwork (and fees)
to have her daughter (Leia) who is currently living in the Phi!ippines brought over to the US. We also want to buy
a used van w/ AC and power door locks. We have 2 cars (both over 20 YO). Our main family car is a 1990 Ford Escort
4-door sedan. Every time we use it, I have to manually unlock all 4 doors so that the baby can be put w/ her car
seat in the back as well as the wife sitting in the back seat. Also, w/ no AC, the baby&apos;s back gets all sweaty in
the summer heat. It is a pain to put a car seat in such a tiny car and the wife feels cramped in it. She says she
doesn&apos;t want to have any more kids yet until we get a van. She&apos;s 36 years old and we want to have 2 more before she
turns 40.A search of tickets for flight&amp;hotels for all 3 of us shows up at about $1800. Plus, we&apos;d have to get a
car rental, and I don&apos;t see a lot of fast food places in that part of Maui from Google Earth.My wife mentioned last night that perhaps I should just go on my own. It would still be expensive to eat
out there. The hotels or condos cost more than the plane ticket.SISTER&apos;s RESPONSE:
I emailed my sister the other morning saying that we probably weren&apos;t going to be there and I wrote about
the expenses I have incurred this year and will probably pay in the future. My wife read the CC and said it seems like
I am choosing a van over my sister (is how it could be interpreted). Sister emailed back yesterday morning:&quot;There are a bunch of things I could bring up but the fact is, I don&apos;t want to mix priorities because you obviously
know what is most important for you and your family so we understand if you aren&apos;t able to attend. Maui is such a
beautiful vacation spot, it would have been nice that all the family could be there - probably won&apos;t ever be another
opportunity for that. To me, this was the last thing I was asking from you - I mean it&apos;s your sisters wedding day!
Support from my immediate family was expected. I&apos;ll take this as a sign -&quot;CONCLUSION:
Am I in the wrong here for wanting to support my immediate family first? We would like to expand our family
and only have a small window to do it. I think she&apos;s being a bridezi!la. I don&apos;t want to fall into the bad habit
of constantly dipping into my savings. Eventually it will not be there anymore. It&apos;s not easy anymore to replenish
my savings ever since I got married and had a kid. It seems like every time I &apos;borrow&apos; from it, it never gets
repayed, or it does but at a rate slower than the borrowing. It&apos;s not my fault she chose a distant vacation spot to
get married in w/o considering other people&apos;s finances. My wife says where she comes from, people who make
invitations (even for wedding) usually pay for the guests to go.
I&apos;m sure other people have probably had similar experiences or situations where this has happened. I&apos;d like
to hear your story. I&apos;d also like to hear other people&apos;s opinions as far as what you would do if you were me.
Would you go and pay just to keep the peace even though it will set you back even further? I don&apos;t like ultimatums.
My sister&apos;s email just makes me want to give her a clear sign of not going. I told my wife last night even if my
sister offered to pay half I probably still wouldn&apos;t go. Newly Engaged - Looking for advice. 
 Added on : Thursday May 12th 2011 12:01:00 AM Hello fellow FWF gurus. I&apos;m looking for a little financial advice here. My girlfriend and I just got engaged. We&apos;re planning on a wedding probably next Fall, so a little more than a year from now. Here is our financial situation:Me - Carrying approximately $11K on 0% APR credit cards, most of which is accruing interest in a high yield account. Terms expire March next year. No car payment. No mortgage. Making $35K-$40K a year after taxes (depending on overtime). Saving ~40% of that in Savings/Roth/401K. BBA in Business Management but working a normal hourly job right now. I&apos;m 30 years old.Her - ~$86K in student loans. $200/month car payment interest free to parents with a remaining balance of ~$8K. No mortgage. She is living in a home owned by her grandparents which they completely pay for at the moment in order for her to pay toward her student loans. I just moved in with her and will be giving the grandparents $500/month rent while we are engaged. She nets ~28K after taxes. Masters in Interior Architecture. She is 26 years old.Student loans break down as follows:Loan..........Balance..........InterestSignature/Unsub..$13895.85........4.25%Stafford/Unsub...$571.63..........2.47%Stafford/Sub.....$1556.78.........2.47%Signature/Unsub..$22250.23........5.25%Stafford/Sub.....$2700.18.........2.47%Signature/Unsub..$14569.48........4.75%Stafford/Sub.....$4106.76.........2.47%Signature/Unsub..$4759.89.........4.75%Stafford/Sub.....$6784.86.........6.8%Stafford/Unsub...$9099.44.........6.8%Stafford/Sub.....$5534.86.........6.8%Total monthly payment is $935/month, but she pays at least $1100/month. She can allocate any extra payment over the minimum toward the principle of any loans.We will need to get our own place once married. I am not going to live off grandma/grandpa (completely against my nature), nevermind they will most likely not let us anyhow. So we would like to purchase a house; either grandma/grandpa&apos;s house or something else.My question is:What is the best course of action here? Should we continue paying on student loans as she has and also save up a down payment for a house, or should we try to eliminate as much of the student loans as possible first? Should we ask extra payments be allocated to the highest balance/interest loan first? Should we try to attempt to consolidate her loans?Any other advice is surely appreciated. Please let me know if you require more info.Thanks!Edit: Updated some information since speaking with my fiance. Help a 20 y/o student plan his finances 
 Added on : Tuesday May 10th 2011 03:00:53 AM Hi there,I&apos;m a new member here and have been reading a ton of topics in this forum, and figured I&apos;d make a post to see if some experienced people can help me plan my money situation a little better. A little background, I&apos;m a full time college student with a part-time job only making around $1000 a month right now. I&apos;ve got a car paid off in full, but I am still living with my parents for the time being. I have had a credit card through my bank (wells fargo) for about 2 years now and have never been late on the payments, and they just upped my limit from $1000 - $1500. I also have a stock account set up through Scottrade which my dad put a little bit of stock into for my 18th birthday worth about $1800 now. There are a couple of things that I could use some help on in the financing area. Basically the only thing i do right now to money manage is have two bank accounts set up, one at my local credit union which part of my paycheck goes each month for strictly monthly bills (car insurance and such), and another at wells fargo that is &quot;spending&quot; money. Well basically I want to start putting that spending money to some good use as well as start establishing some more credit. I&apos;ve been pondering getting a second credit card for a while now to help me build more credit but can&apos;t decide on a company. I was thinking of applying for a American Express Blue Cash Everyday card because I like how AMEX has extended warranty and other benefits on things. I also was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction of putting my spending money to good use. Maybe setting up a IRA for retirement? Or somehow investing it into other things? I&apos;m just kinda a &quot;noob&quot; when it comes to the finance world, but I don&apos;t want to be a college student that just blows his money on stupid un-needed things.If anyone would like to give me opinions on what to start doing when it comes to retirement/investment/credit cards I would really appreciate the help. Sorry if this is a &quot;noob&quot; post, but hey I&apos;m sure we were all noobs at one point or another.Thanks Again,-Taylor Ergobaby - $89.25 shipped w/ mommy15 - HURRY! ends tonight

Moving Away, Same Ole House Issue - Sale or Rent? 
 Added on : Wednesday May 04th 2011 11:41:39 AM I currently am living in the south and am moving to the west. I bought a home where I live currently 4 years ago for 218K. The home was built in the early 80s, on 3 acres, 2400 square feet, brick, with a shop...3/3/2. The kitchen had been updated prior to us buying, since buying we have spent near 10K on the home including master bath redo, all ceramic floors and new carpet in the bedrooms (everything very neutral, granite counters, SS appliances). I do not know that this area was really &apos;hit&apos; by the housing crisis; its more of just a REALLY depressed economy. I also bought my home &apos;south of the big town&apos; and everyone is selling from this area and moving to &apos;north of the big town&apos;.I have a 15yr note at 6% interest and owe approx $158K on the home. Two months ago we bought a home in the new area we are moving to for 455K with a 15 year note @ 4.25% interest and owe approx 360K.We have NO interest in ever coming back to the city we live in currently and certainly would rather not keep our home here. I have had it for sale for about 4 months at 200K and have literally had one call and zero lookers. There are three homes for sale in my immediate area; best I can tell I have them beat. One is a 1400 square foot on one acre with siding for 160K, one is an odd looking 1800 sq foot blue house on 2 acres for 190K, and the other is a nice looking 2600 sq foot with a pool on 2 acres, although inside pictures shows it was built in the 70s and never changed, they are askign 230K. These homes have been for sale for 6-12+ months.At what point am I better to drop the price and ditch the home versus trying to rent it out? I am not a fan of renting, but I do have a friend and his family that we know in the area. They own several small business and are just &apos;tightwads&apos; to say the least. They love our house but do not wish to purchase anything as they live behind their parents in an apartment for 300 per month.My options I feel like are: 1.)We officially have to move away from here in July, continue to have the home listed until it sales but at what price do I drop it to? 2.)Rent to my friend, although I feel like I could only maybe squeeze 500ish out of them... the home would at least be occupied and grass mowed. After they live in it a year or so, if I do sale it, it is my understanding that I could then take a tax loss? 3.)Try to rent some other random people but I really fear being a landlord 1000 miles away; plus getting a renter will be as difficult as a sale I think. Any other suggestions?Financially, we are in no strains. We can more than easily make both payments and could pay both homes off. We have a very stable combined income of&gt;350K.Thanks for any suggestions; this is the first big life choice I have experience where I am coming out far in the red and the feeling of doing so SUCKS! 51% CashBack from eBates on Magazines.com + $5 Off on Select Magazines - 5/3 Only!

 Added on : Friday April 29th 2011 11:40:32 PM I&apos;ve thought of an invention that I believe will be extremely successful. I&apos;ve described my idea to my girlfriend of 10 years and my parents. All three believe it&apos;s extremely clever and would sell very well. I&apos;ve done ample research using Google and Google Patents and have yet to find something like it.My problem is capital to get it patented and put into production. I don&apos;t make much money nor do my parents (who I&apos;d ask for help) so I don&apos;t know how to go about this. I love watching the show Shark Tank and I know if I explained the invention to the infomercial guy he would do a backflip (I hope he would!). What I&apos;m wondering is if there&apos;s a way to involve a lawyer to write up my invention and take it to an investor, who would then sign the paperwork that he, once told about this invention, couldn&apos;t run off and patent it himself/herself? If something like this is doable how do I go about finding an investor? This invention would likely sell for around $30 and be in a specific retail chain across the nation.

 Added on : Sunday April 24th 2011 01:40:21 AM God I hope I can pull this off...First off these are not my debts, they&apos;re debts on commercial real estate, owned by my parents, from the 2004-2006 era. Some of them have been modified/refi&apos;d recently to lower the interest rates. All were at or above 8% APR originally.Unfortunately we were foreclosed on one property and lost quite a bit of down payment monies and principal paid there.
We have settled quite a few debts already and are settling some now.Attached is a chart with the remaining debts.I have already reduced business expenses by reducing our phone/cable/electric/internet/gas bills as much as I can ~4k-5k/month.
I have also paid off a lease at 10.5% interest with a balance of 13k and am going to use that $650 payment toward the debt.
The plan is to settle loan #1 for about 25k-27k now and apply that payment to the next loan.
Even though I have always believed in paying the highest rate debt first, with debts of this size I think snowball method is the only feasible option.Loan# ------ Remaining Balance ---- Rate --------Payment
1 ------------- $32,694.19 --------------- 8.00% ------- $606.64
2 ------------- $165,618.25 ------------- 6.00% -------- $1,922.05
3 ------------- $200,000.00 ------------- 9.00% -------- $1,500.00
4 ------------- $426,178.70 ------------- 7.50% -------- $3,625.17
5 ------------- $785,545.51 ------------- 6.50% -------- $5,021.30
6 ------------- $779,114.83------------- 7.00% -------- $5,654.23
Total---------- $1,610,036.65 --AVG- 7.33% -------- $18,329.39 - Total monthly P+I pmt.
We do have substantial income but it&apos;s seasonal. The summer/autumn months are death for our business/location and we are barely able to keep up then.Luckily since I manage the finances now instead of the parents, I have put every last penny we earn away and use AARP to boost our savings by putting about 25k+ worth of expenses on the card.Our assets have reduced in value by about 75% since we purchased them. I have a bunch of 0% APR checks ranging from 20k-25k, and every few months have been getting some no/low fee BT monies. We have 1 free and clear property where I am trying to get a line of credit on so that when the 0% period expires I can pay off the cards, rinse and repeat.I plan on paying off the high rate debts at 0% and making maximum payments to pay off these debts ASAP.I was encouraged to go back to school, acquire more debt, and get a graduate degree. I think I am rather going to get a contract job, with few benefits, and apply all cash, minus savings, to help paying off this debt.ANY ADVICE WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED! Even if it is critical. I posted this because reading previous stories has inspired me to write here and stick to it. Thank you Fatwallet. Paying down my CC debt; looking for advice 
 Added on : Friday April 22nd 2011 10:40:45 PM Hello FW, I&apos;ve been a lurker on and off for some time. I&apos;m not nearly as financially savvy as many of you, but I do read and try to understand what I can to try and get a grasp on how to make the most of my money. Like many others, however, hard times have come upon me (for different reasons, though), so I&apos;m here, asking for some advice as to how to handle this situation.C/N: I have ~$7k in high interest CC debt (30%). What can I do to pay this down more quickly?Details:I&apos;m a 22 year old college student. A degree is still a few years away. My parents have been paying my tuition up to this point, but my younger brother will be enrolling next semester, so I&apos;ll be finding my own way to finance my education, as I don&apos;t feel that it&apos;s fair to them that they need to keep paying while I drag my feet.This debt came to be through a combination of poor spending habits and a slew of personal problems (which I can detail if is needed). I&apos;ve curbed the poor spending by creating a monthly budget and sticking to it. The personal problems are still there, but that&apos;s a different discussion.I have a crap job; I manage a fast-food &apos;restaurant&apos;. $12/hr, as many or as few hours as I like, but I&apos;ve been working ~35/week during school. I grossed about $21k last year. I&apos;ll work what I can during the summer if I don&apos;t take any classes. I&apos;m constantly searching for new employment, particularly in a field related to my degree, but nothing has come through yet. I won&apos;t cry &apos;bad economy&apos;, because there are definitely some employers that weren&apos;t interested in me for their openings. My resume isn&apos;t exactly stellar. Most jobs that I&apos;d qualify for would pay less than my current one, which is why I&apos;ve stayed put.Credit karma says my credit score is a 720. It also says I have $10k in savings, which I don&apos;t. Maybe this is an account my parents have with my name on it; I don&apos;t really know. I have two cards; a Bank of America platinum plus something-or-other ($1k limit, open since 06) and a Citi ThankYou card ($7k limit, open since 07). Like I said, interest is at around 30%, so that&apos;s around $200/month I&apos;m losing just paying interest. My only real expenses are rent ($500/mo for now) and utilities (maybe $200/mo in the summer, up to $500/mo in the winter).I have a car; it&apos;s not worth much, and I&apos;d like to avoid selling it if I can (I&apos;m a gearhead, so cars are worth wasting money on, in some respects). I&apos;ve been contemplating going car-less when it warms up enough to walk, until the fall when it becomes too cold to walk anymore. This will save me some money on registration, insurance, and fuel. It&apos;s only worth about $4k as it sits, and if I sold it I wouldn&apos;t be able to replace it with something similar for anything close to that, which (in my head) is why I&apos;m hesitant to sell it. Again, if we need to go in to more detail here, I&apos;m glad to.I see my options as this:1) Find a CC (or several) with BT offers (anything will be better than what I&apos;m paying now) and pay them down as aggressively as possible. This probably wont cover the full balance, I imagine. Close the accounts when finished?2) See if the credit union will give me a personal loan to reduce the interest rate. I previously had a loan at 10%, so that would help out some.3) Ask Citi if they have any programs for assisting in reducing my interest?4) ???Any and all help, advice, flames, or bashes are appreciated. Thanks for your time. Bank sends out every customer&apos;s last 4 SSN in the mail 
 Added on : Wednesday April 20th 2011 12:40:16 PM So my bank decided to upgrade it&apos;s online access. They had to send out new passwords for the upgrade. I received my letter yesterday and was not pleased that my new password was the last 4 of my ssn. First it is a weak password that anyone could write a program attempting each of the 10,000 combinations. Second this used to be a local credit union, converted to a small Mutual Bank, so a majority of customers have lived or live in a small geograpic area. Anyone born in this area should have the same 3 digits as the prefix of their SSN. So, in theory, someone could pull this from the mailbox and with a little research or social engineering have 7 of the 9 digits. With the research out there that shows a computer can accurately guess most of someone&apos;s SSN I would think that they should be able to have all 9 digits as the last four are the most random. I work for a bank so I know it is possible to get approved for credit without having all 9 digits correct. I called my bank, and expressed my concern. The first rep told me they would never send out part of my SSN so it must have been chance. Called my parents who have been with the CU since before I was born, last 4 of the SSN for them as well. Called the bank and asked only for an apology letter to every customer. They thought I was unreasonable but would forward it to a supervisor and told me I would receive a call. No call yet. Suggestions? Or am I just pissing in the wind? Create FREE Chuck E.&amp;Friends Egg Holders 
 Added on : Tuesday April 19th 2011 05:40:57 PM Chuck E. Cheeses is introducing fun-filled ways to help parents and children hop into the spirit of Easter. Whether its dipping eggs in dye, painting on fun designs or gluing on whiskers and ears to make their own Chuck E. egg, kids everywhere will be thrilled to make Chuck E. a part of their Easter celebrations. After the egg decorating is complete, parents can use printable Chuck E.&amp;Friends Egg Holders and help their kids create an eggs-traordinary display for family and guests to enjoy during the spring holiday. Creating the egg holders is quick, easy and, like all Chuck E. Cheeses activities, is something the whole family can enjoy together.How to Create Chuck E.&amp;Friends Egg HoldersStep 1 Using any Internet browser, go to http://www.chuckecheese.com/promotions/pdf/easter_egg_holder.pdf and print out as many egg holders as necessary on white card stock. Kids can use arts and crafts utensils such as crayons, glitter, stamps or rhinestones to personalize their Chuck E. egg holder. When decorations are complete, parents can help kids cut them out along the dotted lines, including the dotted notches for enclosing, with fine-point scissors.Step 2 After the egg holder is completely cut out, take the two notched tabs and fit them together, closing the loop. If the notches fit together just right, there should be a smooth finish with no ends showing.Step 3 When the kids decorated eggs are completely dried, or if using plastic eggs, place the eggs in the holder for an egg-cellent display of their fun and creative design as a table centerpiece or placeholder.This collection of egg decorating ideas can be enjoyed by children as well as those young-at-heart and is sure to crack the whole family up. Chuck E. Cheeses encourages families to share their own creative Chuck E. Easter egg projects by emailing pictures to memories@cecentertainment.com where they may turn up on Chuck E.s Facebook at www.facebook.com/officialchuckecheese. Personal Loan or alternatives 
 Added on : Monday April 18th 2011 08:40:20 PM Fellow fatwalleters,I&apos;m in need of your advice on the options that I have.My wife&apos;s parents are in a situation crunch. They live overseas and they have a home equity loan at an overseas bank against their business property. This property is also located overseas. The amount of the loan is around 80k and they can barely made payment on the interest of that loan. From what I understand, the loan interest is about 12%. We want to help and are exploring our options.Currently, I have a mortgage against me for our house. My wife&apos;s name is not on it. I myself can support our family (pay our mortgage, cost of living, etc). Therefore, she&apos;s somewhat debt-free with clear line of credit. She&apos;s working full-time at a reputable global company and may be able to qualify for a loan herself to help her parents out.A couple of alternatives in my head: (in no order of importance)
1. Get a personal loan against my wife. We&apos;re not sure what rate she qualifies for. If we do take this route, what banks would you suggest to try? We looked at local credit unions and Wells Fargo so far just to get an idea of what&apos;s out there.
2. Get the title of the property to be transferred under my wife&apos;s name and get another loan against it? Is this even possible to pull off? Can a bank give out a home equity loan against an overseas property?
3. Contribute a certain amount of money to help pay their home equity loan. If the rate that she qualifies for is more than 12%, then it doesn&apos;t seem to make sense to originate another loan.
4. Any other ideas? 80k seems a little far to do App-o-Rama BTs play. And it seems like a risky move to me.Please advice. Appreciate it so much. 39% off Happy Baby Snack Set

Tax in KS, KY, ND, NY, WA. Investments and am I living frugal? 
 Added on : Thursday April 14th 2011 04:40:37 PM Hello,My husband and I together have about $150K in savings. We max out our 401ks and Roth IRAs. Currently this money is in a regular savings account. We wanted to buy real estate in India and decided to keep the money in savings account for a while. However, now the deal on the real estate did not work and hence want to invest the money. Please provide your suggestions on where/how/how much to invest the money
Here are few things to consider:
1. We plan to go for higher studies (MBA - from a top university) in 2 years. That means we will have to quit our job and live on our savings or loans. Most of the folks support the idea of taking education loans. Any advice on this one.
2. My husband is 35 years and Iam 33 years old. We have insurance from work. Do you think we should invest some money to get some type of insurance policies?
3. We have about $46k invested in MFs and about $40K in stocks. This is apart from the investments we have in Roth and $401k accounts. We had started $50K in MFs in June 2007. After the market tanked we lost some money but we are now at $46k. I fear I will lose monet if I invest in MFs again. I know my fear is illogical but its hard earned money and I want to invest carefully moving forward.
4. Another question : For this age group, do you think my husband and I are doing well?
- We have a loan of 130 K on our house. $150 K in savings, $46K in MFs, $40k in stocks, $60K in Roth(together),$200K(401ks). I ask this question because I feel a bit insecure at times. I have a humble background. My parents worked hard to raise us. I understand the value of money and live a frugal life. I do sales/coupons for clothes/accessories/electronics/furniture, eat out twice/thrice in a month and prefer to cook at home and focus on fresh vegetables/meats/fruits/whole grains. We do travel but usually club vacations with business travel.
I know Iam asking a lot of questions. But I know there a lot of smart people here who can help wit their advice.others, please be respectful.

How to Pay No Taxes
Eleven shelters, dodges, and rollsall perfectly legalused by America&apos;s wealthiest peopleBy Jesse Drucker
businessweek.comFor the well-off, this could be the best tax day since the early 1930s: Top tax rates on ordinary income, dividends, estates, and gifts will remain at or near historically low levels for at least the next two years. That&apos;s thanks in part to legislation passed in December 2010 by the 111th Congress and signed by President Barack Obama.&quot;This is clearly far and away the most generous tax situation that&apos;s existed,&quot; says Gregory D. Singer, a national managing director of the wealth management group at AllianceBernstein (AB) in New York. &quot;It&apos;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&quot;For the 400 U.S. taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross income, the effective federal income tax ratewhat they actually payfell from almost 30 percent in 1995 to just under 17 percent in 2007, according to the IRS. And for the approximately 1.4 million people who make up the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the effective federal income tax rate dropped from 29 percent to 23 percent in 2008. It may seem too fantastic to be true, but the top 400 end up paying a lower rate than the next 1,399,600 or so.That&apos;s not just good luck. It&apos;s often the result of hard work, as suggested by some of the strategies in the following pages. Much of the top 400&apos;s income is from dividends and capital gains, generated by everything from appreciated real estateyes, there is some leftto stocks and the sale of family businesses. As Warren Buffett likes to point out, since most of his income is from dividends, his tax rate is less than that of the people who clean his office.The true effective rate for multimillionaires is actually far lower than that indicated by official government statistics. That&apos;s because those figures fail to include the additional income that&apos;s generated by many sophisticated tax-avoidance strategies. Several of those techniques involve some variation of complicated borrowings that never get repaid, netting the beneficiaries hundreds of millions in tax-free cash. From 2003 to 2008, for example, Los Angeles Dodgers owner and real estate developer Frank H. McCourt Jr. paid no federal or state regular income taxes, as stated in court records dug up by the Los Angeles Times. Developers such as McCourt, according to a declaration in his divorce proceeding, &quot;typically fund their lifestyle through lines of credit and loan proceeds secured by their assets while paying little or no personal income taxes.&quot; A spokesman for McCourt said he availed himself of a tax code provision at the time that permitted purchasers of sports franchises to defer income taxes.For those who can afford a shrewd accountant or attorney, our era is rife with opportunity to avoid, or at least defer, tax bills, according to tax specialists and public records. It&apos;s limited only by the boundaries of taste, creativity, and the ability to understand some very complex shelters.1- The &apos;No Sale&apos; Sale
Cashing in on stocks without triggering capital-gains taxesAn executive has $200 million of company shares. He wants cash but doesn&apos;t want to trigger $30 million or so in capital-gains taxes.1. The executive borrows about $200 million from an investment bank, with the shares as collateral. Now he has cash.2. To freeze the value of the collateral shares, he buys and sells &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls.&quot; These are options granting him the right to buy and sell them later at a fixed price, insuring against a crash.3. He eventually can return the cash, or he can keep it. If he keeps it, he has to hand over the shares. The tax bill comes years after the initial borrowing. His money has been working for him all the while.SELLER BEWARE
The IRS challenged versions of these deals used by billionaire Philip Anschutz and Clear Channel Communications co-founder Red McCombs. A U.S. Tax Court judge last year ruled Anschutz owed $94 million in taxes on transactions entered into in 2000 and 2001. He is appealing the decision. McCombs settled his case last month. Despite the court cases, such strategies &quot;are alive and well,&quot; says Robert Willens, who runs an independent firm that advises investors on tax issues.2- The Skyscraper Shuffle
Partnerships that let property owners liquidate without liabilityTwo people are 50-50 owners, through a partnership, of an office tower worth $100 million. One of the owners, let&apos;s call him McDuck, wants to cash out, which would mean a $50 million gain and $7.5 million in capital-gains taxes.1. McDuck needs to turn his ownership of the property into a loan. So the partnership borrows $50 million and puts it into a new subsidiary partnership, which contributes the cash to yet another new partnership.2. The newest partnership lends that $50 million to a finance company for three years in exchange for a three-year note. (The finance company takes the money and invests it or lends it out at a higher rate.)3. The original partnership distributes its interest in the lower-tier subsidiary to McDuck. Now, McDuck owns a loan note worth $50 million instead of the property, effectively liquidating his 50 percent interest.4. Three years later the note is repaid. McDuck now owns 100 percent of a partnership sitting on a $50 million pile of cashthe amount McDuck would have received from selling his stake in the real estatewithout triggering any capital-gains tax.5. While this cash remains in the partnership, it can be invested or borrowed against. When McDuck dies, it can be passed along to heirs and liquidated or sold tax-free. The deferred tax liability disappears upon McDuck&apos;s death under a provision that eliminates such taxable gains for heirs.SELLER BEWARE
Wealthy Boston real estate developer Arthur M. Winn used a version of this transaction. In 2008 a U.S. Tax Court judge ruled that one aspect of the deal was perfectly legal. Other aspects of the transaction are being settled with the government.3- The Estate Tax Eliminator
How to leave future stock earnings to the kids and escape the estate taxA wealthy parent with millions invested in the stock market wants to leave future earnings to his kids and avoid the estate tax on those earnings.1. The parent sets up a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust, or GRAT, listing the kids as beneficiaries.2. The parent contributes, say, $100 million to the GRAT. Under the terms of the GRAT, the amount contributed to the trust, plus interest, must be fully returned to the parent over a predetermined period.3. Whatever return the money earns in excess of the interest ratethe IRS currently requires 3 percentremains in the trust and gets passed on to the heirs free of estate and gift taxes forever.Executives Who Do It
GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt
Nike CEO Philip Knight
Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman4- The Trust Freeze
&quot;Freezing&quot; the value of an estate so taxes don&apos;t eat up its future appreciationA wealthy couple wants to leave a collection of income-producing assets, such as investment partnerships that own shares, valued at as much as $150 million, to their children. So they &quot;freeze&quot; the value of the estate at that moment, maybe 20 years before their death, pushing any future appreciation out of the estate and avoiding what could be a $50 million federal estate tax bill.1. The best approach is an &quot;intentionally defective grantor trust.&quot; The couple makes a gift of $10 millionthe maximum amount exempt from the gift tax for the next two yearsto the trust, which lists the children as beneficiaries.2. The trust uses that cash as a down payment to buy the partnership from the parents through a note issued to the parents, but the partnership contains a restriction on the trust&apos;s use of the assets, thus impairing the partnership&apos;s value by, say, 33 percent. That enables the trust to buy the $150 million partnership for just $100 million.3. The income produced by the investment partnership helps pay off the note. The tax bill on that income is borne by the parents, essentially allowing gifts exempt from the gift tax.4. When the note is paid off, the trust owns that $150 million worth of assets minus the $90 million note and interestplus any appreciation in the meantime. The trust has swept up a $150 million income-producing concern without triggering the federal estate tax.5- The Option Option
Stock options allow executives to calibrate the taxes on their compensation in a big wayAn executive is negotiating his employment contract for the coming five years. The company might offer millions in shares. But who wants to pay taxes on millions in shares?Better to take options. The executive owns the right to buy the shares at a time of his choosing; he&apos;s been compensated, but he hasn&apos;t paid any taxes. Gains from nonqualified stock options, the most common form, aren&apos;t taxed until the holder exercises them. That means the executive controls when and if the tax bill comes. It isn&apos;t just icing, either. Often, it&apos;s the cake. Lawrence J. Ellison, CEO of Oracle (ORCL), earned $250,001 in salary in 2010 and was awarded $61,946,500 in options.Executives Who Do It

Using, but not unloading, underwater stock shares to adjust your tax billAn investor has capital-gains income from a sold-off stock position. Separately, the investor has other shares that are down an equal amount; if he sold them he&apos;d realize a loss to offset the gains and pay no taxes. But no one likes to sell low. So he wants to use that loss without actually selling the shares. IRS rules prohibit investors from taking a loss against a gain and then buying the shares back within 30 days.1. At least 31 days before the planned sale, the investor buys an equal value of additional shares of the underwater stock.2. The investor buys a &quot;put&quot; option on the new shares at their current price, and sells a &quot;call&quot; option. Now he&apos;s protected from the downside on that second purchase.3. At least 31 days later, the investor sells the first block of underwater shares. He now has his tax loss, without having taken any additional downside risk from the purchase of the second block of shares.7- The Friendly Partner
With this deal, an investor can sell property without actually sellingor incurring taxesAn investor owns a piece of income-producing real estate worth $100 million. It&apos;s fully depreciated, so the tax basis is zero. That means a potential (and unacceptable) $15 million capital-gains tax.1. Instead of an outright sale, the owner forms a partnership with a buyer.2. The owner contributes the real estate to the partnership. The buyer contributes cash or other property.3. The partnership borrows $95 million from a bank using the property as collateral. (The seller must retain some interest in the partnership, hence the extra $5 million.)4. The partnership distributes the $95 million in cash to the seller.Note: The $95 million is viewed as a loan secured by the property contributed by the seller instead of proceeds from a sale. For tax purposes, the seller is not technically a seller, and so any potential tax bill is deferred.8- The Big Payback
So-called permanent life insurance policies are loaded with tax-avoiding benefitsA billionaire wants to invest but doesn&apos;t need the returns any time soon and wants to avoid the tax on the profits.A world of tax-beating products is available through the insurance industry. Many types of so-called permanent life insuranceincluding whole life, universal life, and variable universal life insurancecombine a death benefit with an investment vehicle. The returns and the death benefit are free of income tax. If the policy is owned by a certain type of trust, the estate tax can be avoided as well. &quot;It is a Crucial piece of any high-net-worth tax planning in my experience,&quot; says Michael D. Weinberg, president of an insurance firm that specializes in planning for high-net-worth individuals.9- IRA Monte Carlo
Tax advisers recommend converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAssoonHigh-income taxpayers can now convert traditional IRAs, which allow contributions to be deducted from taxes but incur taxes on distributions, into Roth IRAs, where the contributions are taxed but the distributions are tax-free. The conversion triggers a one-time tax bill based on the value of the newly converted Roth IRA. As one might expect, tax experts are recommending that high-net-worth individuals convert their traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs before 2013, when ordinary income rates are likely to go up.1. Let&apos;s say an investor has one traditional IRA with a value of $4 million.2. The traditional IRA is split up into four traditional IRAs, each worth $1 million.3. The investor converts all four to Roth IRAs at the beginning of the year.4. The IRS effectively allows taxpayers to undo the conversion for up to 21 months. So in 21 months the investor looks at the performance of the IRAs. Say two of them go up from $1 million to $2 million and two drop from $1 million to zero. Because the IRAs were split into four, the investor can change her mind on the two that went down and revert those back to traditional IRAs. Thus, she owes taxes on only the two contributions that went up in value, and nothing on the two that went down, cutting her tax bill in half. This lops 21 months of risk off the bet that paying taxes now will be paid off with tax-free appreciation later.10- The Venti
Putting a chunk of pay in a deferred compensation plan can mean decades of tax-free growthExecutives want generous pay but don&apos;t want immediate tax bills from salaries or cash bonuses.Instead, they elect to set aside a portion of their pay into a deferred compensation plan. Such plans allow the compensation, plus earnings, to grow tax-deferred, potentially for decades. Starbucks (SBUX) Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz had about $88 million in his plan as of the end of 2010, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. Verizon&apos;s (VZ) CEO, Ivan G. Seidenberg, had $62 million. Richard B. Handler, CEO of Jefferies Group, had $225 million. It&apos;s their money, they just haven&apos;t paid taxes on it yet.Executives Who Do It

 What is considered appropriate for college graduation gifts? 
 Added on : Tuesday April 05th 2011 07:41:08 PM I&apos;m about to graduate in a few weeks so this has been on my mind lately. What do you consider appropriate college graduation gifts for your son or daughter? I have asked my parents for practical gifts (work clothes, vacuum, kitchen items, etc.), nothing extravagant or expensive by any means. My friends are all receiving/received very substantial gifts: house, new Porsche SUV, several are getting home down payments, new(er) cars, furniture, long vacations, cash, etc. The majority are receiving/received a car/cash/vacation combination. So this makes me wonder... what is appropriate for white collar professional parents to give their child for college graduation? Reducing Capital Gains? 
 Added on : Tuesday April 05th 2011 10:40:40 AM I got lucky on a stock buy and my $40k is now nearly $100k. I don&apos;t have an immediate need for the money but want to take the money off the table. I&apos;ve had the stock for 1.5 years so it&apos;s a long term capital gain rate, 15%. (Thankfully with the extension of the Bush tax cuts, long term capital gains rates were extended to 2012.) In 2012 long term capital gain rates may increase to 20%.If I sold this stock I would only pay 15% on the gains and would not increase my income taxes in any other way?Strategy to reduce capital gains tax:
1. Hold investment longer than a year. -Done
2. Sell all this year to take advantage of extended capital gains tax cut.
3. Evaluate my other holdings for loss investments to sell.
4. ??Just wondering if there are any creative ways to move this money from the stock.
I haven&apos;t funded my 2010 or 2011 Roth IRAs yet.
I&apos;m interested in buying investment property.

 Added on : Tuesday April 05th 2011 09:43:35 AM My So-Called Life: The Complete Series (w/Book) (1994) - $34.49 @ Amazon
One of the most acclaimed series on TV during its brief run from 1994-1995, My So-Called Life pioneered the modern teen drama and made a star out of 15-year-old Claire Danes. Ostensibly centering around the trials and tribulations of high schooler Angela Chase, My So-Called Life actually expanded to include everyone in its protagonist&apos;s orbit, from school friends to extended family, and gave its stellar ensemble cast ripe material to work with during its too-short life. Produced by thirtysomething creators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, MSCL evoked that yuppie-friendly show with its emphasis on finding extraordinary drama within ordinary situations, but was far more heartfelt and heart-wrenching, echoing the dizzying highs and lows of adolescence. As such, it developed a cult following among young viewers who identified strongly with Angela&apos;s high school traumas and followed her every move with rapt attention. (After cancellation, the show enjoyed a popular reprise on MTV.)Avoiding the sensational, My So-Called Life tackled every teen hot-button issue imaginable (and pioneered the then-controversial topic of teen homosexuality), but with a clear-eyed perspective, never dissolving into soap opera-even when Angela mooned over heartthrob Jordan Catalano (dreamy Jared Leto). Even as it mined adolescent angst, though, My So-Called Life never lost sight of its adults, with Bess Armstrong and Tom Irwin both phenomenal as Angela&apos;s parents, whose marriage was one of the most complex seen on TV since... well, thirtysomething. Through it all, Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Danes was a neurotic, touching, and funny center, whether obsessing over a zit or negotiating the rocky terrain of first love. Her funny, sobering, and empathetic portrait of teendom reminded us that in some ways, life was just an extended version of high school. --Mark EnglehartProduct DescriptionNamed Entertainment Weekly&apos;s best DVD of 2007, this poignant series launched the career of actress Claire Danes and served as a role model for many of the teen oriented shows on television today. Although the original series aired for less than six months (enjoying a subsequent lengthy rerun on MTV) in the mid-&apos;90s, it has gone on to acquire legendary cache. Smart, bold and real, this series raised the bar for television shows about coming-of-age and life s transitions. Whether you ve memorized every line, or it s your very first time, My So-Called Life remains as fresh and honest today as when it premiered.

My So-Called Life: The Complete Series (w/Book) (1994) - $34.49 @ Amazon Purchasing a house with CASH, IRS audit? And question about interest income/TAXATION... 
 Added on : Monday April 04th 2011 03:40:07 PM First off, I am a longtime lurker. I do like all the AOR and finance threads.I have 2 questions. 1. I am in the market for a house. I am 30 with 87k in cash. However, 2/3 is tied up in a business (which will parlay into question 2).
I have 40k that has been seasoning in a local bank for over a month. It is my goal to purchase a 3/2 house here in the midwest for 50-70k CASH. It still allows me to have more than enough for an emergency fund so that is not a worry. However, I will need to borrow probably ~20k from a friend to help make the purchase. I wish to avoid a mortgage altogether. Does the IRS track all cash home purchases and if so, what are my worries? Here are some ugly details: I have a less-than-desirable dead end job that pays ~15k a year. I have lived at home for the last 8 years rent free (except a few small rent donations to my parents.) i have been able to save ~10k a year because of this. Is this a cause for concern as to where I got the money?2. In regards to question/concern 1, I have also been able to invest 2/3 of my nest egg into an online retail business which pays 11% interest. This year I received interest from the past 2 years in a lump sum in the amount of 10k. I currently need advice on how to report this income for 2011 (due in 2 weeks.) I never filled out any 1099&apos;s or 1065B&apos;s with this company, it was just an agreed 11% compounded annually interest. Do I report this as &quot;other&quot; income and get taxed at my tax bracket or can I report this as a capital gains which would save me a decent chunk on taxes (20-25% tax rate versus 10% as I understand it.) Sorry for the long winded and generally confusing-yet-riddled-with-lots-of-questions topic but i thank those in advance who wish to help advise.

 Added on : Thursday March 31st 2011 03:40:48 PM This is going to sound unbelievable but here are the facts:
- sister-in-law (wife&apos;s sister) is a single mother receiving child support
- she bought a co-op in nyc with inheritance from parents. Fixed rate, 30-year mortgage at a decent rate
- she is dysfunctional with regards to money
- says she applied for loan modification program to get lower payments. Unclear whether she was accepted
- her payment went up $300 because the bank wanted to escrow utilities, etc. It&apos;s a co-op and those things are included in her maintenance fee. She called the bank 20 times to talk with them, to make a long story short, the service was terrible, poor english, no one kept a case record.
- She sent in her old payment, bank rejected payment. This went on for six months.
- She decided to spend the money for six months mortgage on big screen tv for son, vacation etc.
- additionally, she took 3 weeks off without pay because she was &quot;too stressed about the mortgage&quot;
- Starts getting foreclosure letters from the bank, makes no progress
- Calls up my wife and her brother, asks for help. We split the cost of a foreclosure lawyer (sister-in-law pays nothing)
- She receives note that her co-op will be auctioned on apr 15th.
- we estimate she has about $200k of equity in the place, her payment is $1800, her salary is about $50k
- the co-op can not be sold during a normal sale while she lives there because it&apos;s a dirty messQuestions:
- The foreclosure lawyer now wants more money to file an appeal. Is that normal?
- What is the best course? We&apos;ve come up with the following options:
= let her co-op be auctioned. We don&apos;t think she&apos;ll receive a fair price.
= buy her co-op at auction and work our some arrangement with her
= pay the bank the money owed to make her current. The lawyer says the bank may not accept this. true? If we do this, I want a lien on the co-op because that&apos;s the only way she&apos;s paying us back. also, she&apos;ll probably be back in this situation in a year or two.other ideas?tia, Free Sesame Street Happy, Healthy, Ready for School: Math Is Everywhere Kit

 Added on : Sunday March 27th 2011 09:40:10 PM So I did find this thread http://www.fullofdeals.com/forums/finance/178146/?start=80 on topic, but it was mostly just venting about family members, not really tips or guidance for dealing with such family members.The backstory: My mother recently died and I&apos;m probating the estate (I&apos;m actually working on a thread I intend to post with some help for people probating an estate to plan for, once I&apos;m done with everything). My parents didn&apos;t make a lot of money and were extremely close to the vest about their finances. As I&apos;m working through documents, I&apos;m discovering that after receiving a pretty large inheritance about 3 years ago, my parents were basically using that money to live and giving almost their entire salary to my sister (and her husband and their daughter) to live. However you look at it, my parents were making about X dollars and were also giving about X dollars to my sister&apos;s family. Without turning it into a vent-fest, apparently my mom was in the process of also giving about .5X to them as a &quot;loan&quot; for a business investment.There is nothing really that I can do to stop this money at this point, but what I&apos;d really like to do is be able to point my sister and her husband towards a more reasonable lifestyle. There&apos;s nothing particularly unusual about their financial situation (I Don&apos;t think) -- so I don&apos;t want to go into many details -- but how do you explain to people that what they are doing is so wasteful in a society that I perceive to have placed this huge value on &quot;you can&apos;t tell people how to spend their money&quot; even when it&apos;s money that you are giving to them.The most bright line thing that I can point to is the fact that after my mother&apos;s death, my 60-something year old father would have had enough money to retire without these drains on their finances, but now he will be working into his seventies. But how do you teach somebody something that basically appears to be something that either you have or you don&apos;t (in terms of frugality?). It&apos;s basically that SNL skit of &quot;don&apos;t spend more money than you have&quot; but, man, have any of you ever successfully taught a family member or friend this lesson? 6.5% Student Loan vs. 4.0% Personal Loan 
 Added on : Sunday March 27th 2011 07:40:41 PM Hi! I am a graduating medical student carrying $114,892 in federal student loans at 6.8% interest. My parents recently offered to pay off my loans and offer me a personal loan at a rate of 4.0%. The idea sounded great. I save interest and they gain a safe investment, so I decided to run the numbers...My repayment plan is a 10 year term loan with fixed monthly payments. My residency will be 4 years long, after which I&apos;m hoping to make at least $150k. After making this salary for 1.5 years, I&apos;m hoping to repay the loans in full in January 2017. Here are my calculations:My current loan, at 6.8% interest, will have a remaining balance of $57,428.23 in Jan 2017. After paying off this balance, I will have paid a total of $35,088.89 in interest over the lifetime of the loan.The personal loan, at 4.0% interest, would have a remaining balance of $53,461.03 in Jan 2017. After paying off the balance, I will have paid a total of $20,024.93 in interest (a savings of $15,063.96). HOWEVER, I lose my annual student loan interest tax deduction which caps at $2,500 per year at married incomes&lt;$120k. I will be eligible for this deduction in the years 2011-2015, then possibly in 2016 depending on my income. The total potential tax deduction lost will therefore be $12,500 to $15,000. This essentially counteracts the savings in interest, with a possible overall gain of $2,500 if I don&apos;t qualify for the deduction in 2016.With the personal loan, I gain flexibility in case I need to change my payment amount or schedule and the money I end up paying stays in the family. However, I lose the possible credit-building opportunity of loan payments. My credit score is already around 790, so I&apos;m not too concerned about this.Do my calculations seem to make sense? Is there anything I am failing to consider? Would you take this opportunity?

 Added on : Saturday March 19th 2011 07:40:12 AM I&apos;ve looked around the web for info on this and come up short. I have a problem that I have the same first name, surname, and middle initial as my father (though a different middle name, which means I don&apos;t use a Jr. suffix), along with the same physical address. I have pristine personal credit history at 25 years old, but my parents filed bankruptcy and have all kinds of problems on their credit histories.No matter what I do, my father&apos;s accounts and court cases keep coming up on my credit report, and even after the bureaus tell me they&apos;ve removed them after hours or phone calls and correspondence, I still have problems signing up for credit cards and websites offering credit scores, with them either rejecting me for supposed bad credit or telling me I have fraud/security alerts on my account, inaccurate information, and the bureaus won&apos;t give them my files. Whenever I get security questions on forms to verify my identity, it&apos;s always about stuff that happened before I was born because they think I&apos;m my father. I feel like this is going to go on forever no matter what I do, so I&apos;m looking into changing my surname as a possible solution.My question is could this actually exacerbate the problem? My previous name will always stay on my files as an AKA as I understand it, and could this make it even more likely my father&apos;s info shows up/stays on my report in the future? I honestly have no idea what to do. This is an endless source of frustration. I know the problem is somewhat unique, but maybe someone with understanding of how the bureaus do business can conceptualize how they&apos;d handle this. I just want to end the stress of dealing with this nonsense. 3 Years - Parents Magazine - $3.33 per year

Saw this on SD, so I thought I&apos;d bring it over. Thanks Nylene comparing your situation to what others have 
 Added on : Sunday March 13th 2011 05:40:03 AM Sometimes I look at my financial situation and feel pretty behind. I left graduate school owing a good amount and I&apos;m living very frugally trying to pay this down. I tried so hard to achieve higher but for what?
I look at others and quite a few that I went to school with have started successful retail businesses. They have also bought homes while I&apos;m still in debt. They will probably have it paid off by the time I am finally out of debt when I haven&apos;t even started on mortgage yet. I am penny pinching right now feeling behind living on less than 6 bucks per day on food. My salary only goes up just barely beating inflation each yr if I&apos;m lucky. One of my lifelong dream growing up was to open up a restaurant on the side but I have become so risk adverse, traumatized of any debt, and will probably be stuck in the corporate cog wheel forever. It&apos;s a depressing thought because I&apos;m still not sure what I want to do and don&apos;t know what I am good at. I think what really bothers me is that I am not able to do things for my parents like I want to because they have nothing.
I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get a lot of red for this but it&apos;s 4 AM and my mind is wandering. Any advice would be great. American Baby free magazine subscription!

 Added on : Monday March 07th 2011 11:40:41 PM Hi Fatwallet,My wife and I are in our early 20&apos;s, both recently graduated. My job led us to the next state over from where our families are, but at some point we know we want to move back to our home state. My parents have a rental house a few minutes from their house that my dad and I rebuilt as a project a couple years ago (we bought it from an insurance company after a fire). The house is exactly what my wife and I want for when we have a family--big kitchen, nice neighborhood, an office, space for kids to play, etc. and it is something we both put a lot of work into during rebuilding. My parents are currently renting it out with a positive cash flow of a few hundred a month, and have offered to sell it to us for what they have into it (120k - half of the appraised value). Ideally, we&apos;d continue to rent it out for 5 years or so, then move back and start a family in that house. If we end up not moving back home, we&apos;d just keep renting it out and use the rent as extra income once the mortgage is paid off. My plan is to use the positive cash flow to build up some savings for repairs/vacancies.I&apos;m mainly posting to ask if I&apos;m crazy for doing this with relatively little savings and high student loans, but if we decide this is a good idea, I&apos;d also like some ideas for how to actually go about making the purchase and what tax effects we should consider (we&apos;ll also talk to our family tax attorney if we buy it).Relevant info:
Me: salary 60k/year
Wife: Self employed, income varies by month, but I&apos;ll conservatively estimate 25k/year
80k student loans
no other debt
own 2 cars (12~15 years old)
20k liquid
5k retirement
currently rentingThanks everyone! Need financial advice on keeping vs selling a car: 
 Added on : Monday March 07th 2011 10:40:07 PM 2009 Accord Coupe EX-L V6 with works + 8 year extended warranty ($2K value when bought): Car bare: $26,750
+ tax, doc fees, ext warranty = $30,000~Current mileage: 24,000
Current financing left: $15,000 ($403/mo x 60 months @ 5.99%)KBB assessment for trade-in: $19,400
KBB assessment for private selling: $23,500Scenario: GF now lives in Manhattan with absolutely no need for her car. Her parents&apos; home is in NJ close by where the car is sitting doing nothing.We&apos;ll be staying in NY with no need for car for at least two years. Is it worth keeping her car? I think the answer is outright no to keeping it. But I would like further clarification from you guys.1. Keep or Sell?
2. How accurate is KBB? Is KBB still industry relevant?
3. If selling, she has to pay off the car totally first right? (Which she can easily).Let&apos;s start with these three for now. Thank you. Anyone get a Ban Deodorant coupon today? 
 Added on : Sunday March 06th 2011 05:40:02 PM Our ShopRite ad always has notes like &quot;Look for $0.75 coupon in most Sunday papers&quot; next to items that will have a coupon. I&apos;ve been noticing that my paper (Newark NJ Star Ledger) does not seem to have these coupons lately. The ShopRite ad this week says there should be a $0.75 coupon for Ban deodorant yet I don&apos;t have one in my paper. We had a Smart Source coupon pack today but no Ban coupon. I called up the paper and they said that is the only coupon set they sent out today. Did anyone get a Ban coupon in their local paper? If so, did the coupon pack have a name?Thanks.Update: I just talked to my parents in Florida and they got the Ban coupon in their Smart Source so I guess SS sends different coupons to different places as per my experience and the posts below. Also fixed typo in title notice of default received and looking to do a short sale on house 
 Added on : Saturday March 05th 2011 02:40:08 AM Hello. I apologize in advance for the fragmented nature of this post as I have no understanding about real estate. Anyway...I was informed recently that I may need to file for Chapter 13 by my mother for a house that I own, but that they live in. My parents have found a lawyer who has been helping them get a loan modification approved before a foreclosure occurs. A trust sale was set for 3/8/11, but apparently, that date has been pushed until April. My parents&apos; attorney will most likely be trying to postpone the trust sale until the loan modification is approved. The attorney also mentioned the possibility of a short sale, and I&apos;m more interested in going that route. My one concern is that in a short sale, I may face the possibility of dealing with a larger debt than I can take on. Although I own the home, it&apos;s entirely nominal, since my parents had approached me about taking over the house in 1999, when I was 17/18. I don&apos;t quite know why they approached me or why I agreed, but that&apos;s just what happened. Since then, they&apos;ve been presumably on top of paying the mortgage on time until this past year, when I found that they&apos;ve been delinquent for at least five payments. So I know my credit is ruined and that&apos;s something completely foreign to me, since I live in a basement for $180/month and get by through selling everything I own on craigslist and picking up some odd-jobs here and there. I&apos;m concerned that filing for Chapter 13 will, however, hurt my prospects at future employment.For the short sale, I&apos;ve asked my parents to draw up a document stating their responsibility for whatever loss is incurred through the short sale, but I don&apos;t know how good that document would be. And right now, I have doubts about whether they will do this.So while foreclosure/trust sale is about a month away, until presumably the next postponement, I&apos;m wondering whether the short sale seems like the best option for me. I&apos;m of the opinion that getting a loan modification request approved will only delay an inevitable foreclosure. Thanks! Parents Choice Formula - 3 Free Samples

Off the Deep End... 
 Added on : Wednesday March 02nd 2011 11:40:05 AM I have been a long time FW member/lurker. I&apos;m sure I have relative anonymity but I created this new handle, just for this topic because I wanted to even provide myself some more... I preface this topic by saying I&apos;m sure I will get red. I&apos;m sure not a lot of people will be able to relate. But I&apos;m hoping there are a few in the community that might be able to identify with me and offer their sage wisdom.I&apos;m 30 y/o. Old enough to realize I&apos;ve been extremely fortunate and lucky and in essence my problem is purely from luxury. I come from parents who migrated in the 70s and mobilized through home ownership into upper middle class (or what use to be the middle class). As it relates to finance, they instilled in me an importance in education (which they paid for when I went to a top instate, public, University), living within my means (paying off my credit card in full every month, carrying no debt), and just general thriftiness. Luck factors in as when I left school a few units short of graduating, I couldn&apos;t find a real job. Part of the problem was I wasn&apos;t really motivated either. After going to a &quot;top&quot; university, I was relegated to working the holiday shift on a UPS truck making $6.50/hr. By chance, someone I knew helped me out with a 3day contract job in the Silicon Valley doing sales related work. I have parlayed that into the last 7 years of my life. I have gotten to live in NYC by choice, have a basic 6 figure job (which is middle class here) but get to work from home, and amassed a decent savings after two lucrative years where I made what I normally would make in a few years in one. One of the best life experiences has been the realization that even when I had those years of making such great sums, life didn&apos;t really change. I wasn&apos;t that much more happy. Problems or worries didn&apos;t go away. Anyways, part of me wants to just quit the corporate life and go traveling and/or live in another country for a few years. But the socially programmed part of me thinks I would be crazy to walk away from the &apos;cushy&apos; life I&apos;ve carved out for myself as far as working from home everyday, not getting trapped in the politics of work, and having a general handle of my job where I don&apos;t lose sleep over it at all. But I also know I&apos;ve stagnated too as I&apos;m not really learning anything new. I have been promoted once out of necessity and that presented a few new challenges, more bs stress than anything. Part of me also wonders why I lack any sort of career ambition. I&apos;ve thought about going back to school for an MBA... the fears of growing older and being easily replaced... but part of me looks at that $200k cost and another $200k opportunity cost overlay where most people go so they can exponentially increase their earnings and I think to myself, if I really wanted to make more money, I should just work harder. I am already in a performance based career. And then it circles back to, wtf does it even matter, money is nice but it isn&apos;t everything? I&apos;m not looking to work myself into the ground to join the 1% of the 1%. I&apos;ve thought about getting a new job... for the new challenge. But I highly doubt that $xxk more will really provide any more marginal benefit to my life versus the increased stress of starting over and needing to prove yourself.I don&apos;t have a house. I don&apos;t have any debt. I have high six figures in savings/assets. I do partake in H&amp;B;and anything else my modest whims might desire. All my true expenditures are on &quot;experiences&quot; not possessions. My only true real identifiable passion is traveling, but I know I can&apos;t runaway from this issue from extensive travel. Your problems follow you around. I don&apos;t really get the point of it all.This has been a meandering post. I appreciate your time... and sorry if I&apos;ve wasted it.

On Coming From A Broken Home (Pt. 2) 2:15 Univeral Life Policy purchased 20 years ago by my parents --keep or surrender? 
 Added on : Wednesday February 16th 2011 11:40:23 PM My parents (who never met an insurance product they didn&apos;t like) purchased a flexible premium life insurance policy from MetLife on me 20 years ago, when I was in my 20&apos;s. Apparently I am both the insured and the owner/beneficiary of this policy. It has a level death benefit with a face value of $50,000, and a surrender value of $6,000. They&apos;ve been paying a $250/year premium for this ever since, but recently they told me about the policy and passed to me the decision about what to do with the policy in the future. Apparently I can (1) surrender it and get $6K immediately, (2) keep it, but stop paying premiums, and the coverage will remain in effect until between 2035 and 2046, depending on assumptions, or (3) keep it and keep paying $250/yr, and coverage will continue until sometime between 2045 and 2057, depending on assumptions.The stated interest rate on new premiums is 4% (also the min. guaranteed rate), but there&apos;s a $2/month expense charge and $4.12 per month insurance charge, so the actual return was closer to 2.5% last year.I am the main breadwinner and have two kids under 10. I have about $300K in life insurance provided by my employer, plus a survivors annuity that would be paid to my family if I died. My job is very secure, we have a healthy net worth, we save a nice % of our income so that amount is growing, and we should inherit a not insubstantial sum of money from our parents someday (all are in their mid-80&apos;s currently). We live fairly frugally and we felt financially secure even before we found out about this insurance policy. I have always been confused by this type of universal life insurance, though. I know it&apos;s generally a bad deal, but what about an already-established policy such as this? The face value of this is very low relative to our net worth, but could it help in some way with estate planning? Depending on what estate tax law is when we die, our estate could very well be subject to estate tax.My inclination is to surrender this policy and invest the $6K, but is there some advantage to keeping this policy that that I&apos;m not aware of?

 Added on : Monday February 14th 2011 04:40:07 PM Hi,I wanted to see if any experts on art investments lurk on FW.
Your stories about art investment success would be welcome, but any advice on my current question is very welcome.Currently I&apos;m trying to pick between purchasing an Artist Print or a Limited Edition print.
The Artist print is of course the more expensive one available (besides canvas).
AP should yield the highest return if the work gains popularity. Are there other things to consider?Parents in Law have seen ~1000% return on 2 limited edition prints they bought 15 years ago from this same artist.
That begs the question if only early works from artists are worth buying, or if works that are still available to purchase from publishers are still a worth while investment.
To make things more interesting the artist is rumored to be nearing the end of his life..Worse case scenario my house looks nicer for the next few decades. Free Valentines Cards = Five Free Tokens at Chuck E. Cheeses (with Food Purchase) Exp. 3/2/11

 Added on : Thursday February 03rd 2011 09:40:08 AM I posted in Deal Disc., but I need some answers b/c now this friend called my parents about this.

I have looked at previous posts in Deal Discussions&amp;Finance about ESCOs. They are all archived and all but one discuss electricity. In my own experience, I saved nothing w/an ESCO for my electricity bill. I would like to know about gas suppliers. I will mention Ambit Energy only b/c a friend mentioned it (commission). I have been looking at the stats (even electricity just comparison):Their complait rates are low.
http://www.dps.state.ny.us/ocs_stats.htmlTheir electricity rates (cents per kWh) are more expensive than Con Ed. In fact, Con Ed is the second cheapest of non-green suppliers.
http://www.powerscorecard.org/index.cfmThey do not adhere to NY ESCO Statement of Principles for Marketing

 Added on : Monday January 31st 2011 11:40:06 AM A couple of years ago, I asked my husband to poll his coworkers to determine how much they spend on tax preparation services. He didn&apos;t do it. I wanted to find out how much my tax preparation services are worth. I have prepared our tax returns for all 23 years of our marriage, first using paper, pencil, and a calculator, and later with TurboTax. Over the years, we have progressed from the very simple 1040EZ to the &quot;long-form&quot; 1040. We&apos;ve purchased and sold three homes, converted traditional IRAs to Roths, reported capital gains and losses on mutual fund investments, itemized deductions including medical expenses, claimed education tax credits as our kids started college, taken the sales tax deduction since we live in Texas (including sales tax on a new car purchase), and taken the energy efficiency tax credit. Not all in the same year! My point is, there&apos;s a lot of record-keeping and research that goes into accurately filing our tax return, even with the help of TurboTax (which gave me fits last year, by the way.) This year I will also prepare my parents&apos; return. My dad&apos;s comment was that it is probably cheaper for him to buy me a plane ticket home than to take his taxes to H&amp;R;Block. He and my mom have used TurboTax for the past 10 years as well, but declining health and memory issues convinced him that they need outside help this year. I am sure most readers of this forum do their own taxes, like me, but if you pay for this service can you offer some input? As a full-time homemaker, I like to be able to gauge the value of my work. Cell Phone Postcard 
 Added on : Monday January 31st 2011 02:40:10 AM http://www.cellphonepostcards.comThis website allows you to send a postcard to somebody from a cell phone camera or a regular digital camera. The first postcard is free and you don&apos;t even have to put in a credit card. The process is really simple. Just make an account, upload a photo, add whatever text you&apos;d like and then put in the recipients address. They&apos;ll send out the postcard for you in a few days. This is really a nice way to send your parents a picture of you or kids or something like that. It would even be great for people stationed overseas. Learning the value of hard work 
 Added on : Saturday January 29th 2011 08:40:04 AM I graduated from Yale last Spring with a degree in East Asian Studies.
All my life, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I even took a Constitutional Law course taught by Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar and really enjoyed it.But I had the fortune of taking more law courses while an undergrad, and realized that casebooks and statutes are tediously boring.So I didn&apos;t go to law school.I thought I would be a paralegal doing discovery for a major tech company, but the company itself warned me that the job would be mind-numbingly boring.
I thought I would be a management consultant for a top consulting firm, but I bombed the interview (and realized that maybe consulting wasn&apos;t for me).So I&apos;ve been mostly sitting at home reading business books (Millionaire Next Door, etc.), scared that I would pick the &quot;wrong&quot; career. I spent a lot of time knowing myself better and figuring out my flaws.I read this article:
What are you going to do with that?[L=http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/12465... said: http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/124651/]From[/L] the time you started high school and maybe even junior high, your whole goal was to get into the best college you could, and so now you naturally think about your life in terms of &quot;getting into&quot; whatever&apos;s next. &quot;Getting into&quot; is validation; &quot;getting into&quot; is victory. Stanford, then Johns Hopkins medical school, then a residency at the University of San Francisco, and so forth. Or Michigan Law School, or Goldman Sachs, or McKinsey, or whatever. You take it one step at a time, and the next step always seems to be inevitable.I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t get a job right after school. All my life, I did things because it was what I was &quot;supposed&quot; to do.
I realize that schools like Yale prepare you for certain types of careers -- law, finance, etc. -- none of which I want to do.Whatever I do, it will involve hard work, doing something I want to do (as opposed to &quot;going with the flow&quot; and doing what an Ivy League grad is &quot;supposed&quot; to do).So now, I&apos;m going to fulfill my dream of enlisting in the Marine Corps as a reservist (mechanical infantry). I hope to learn the value of hard work and getting along with people who are different than me. I know I&apos;ve been spoiled, and I should fix it before trying to start a career. In fact, my parents never wanted me to get a job in high school because they wanted me to focus on studying.All my life, I thought of things in terms of &quot;I got an &apos;A&apos; because the test was easy,&quot; or &quot;I got an &apos;A&apos; because I&apos;m smart.&quot;
But never &quot;I got an &apos;A&apos; because I worked hard for it.&quot;My question: How did you learn the value of hard work? Magazine Deals - 65 Below $5 @ MagazineDealsNow.com

MINT, yodlee, separate credit or bank account for paying for the expenses? Family in Financial Crisis Need Advice on How to Resolve 
 Added on : Wednesday January 26th 2011 11:40:06 PM My parents are 1st generation immigrants and we have a hard time with our language, cultural, and generational barriers. My dad is self employed, but for the past few years the business has not been doing well and my mom just lost her job which was the only steady income they had. My dad is not fully transparent with their current financial information. For whatever reason we do not know the extent of their debt, expenses or anything financially related. Due to previous medical situations my parents have no savings left.
They have maxed out numerous credit cards, a mortgage, and possibly other loans we are not aware of.
They have been rejected for home equity loans and new credit cards which would indicate poor credit.Their only saving grace is that they are sitting on two properties (one home and one business). The business is fully paid for and the home has maybe 200k left on the mortgage (back from 1997). We have estimated the house to be worth approximately 900K before the housing market collapsed and the business property to be worth approximately 500k before the economy tanked. It&apos;s hard for me to estimate how much debt they actually have, but they have been &quot;getting by&quot; with roughly $2500 a month but they still ask for money every now and then. Now with my mom&apos;s job loss they are in a bind and asking for several thousand dollars that we don&apos;t feel comfortable just handing over without knowing that they&apos;ll be able to make responsible decisions.My dad does not have a solid background in finance but has been managing the finances his whole life. It is hard for him to relinquish control or believe anyone else can make a better decision than himself. He wants to scrape by with our help until he is eligible for social security (another 5 years). I whole heartedly believe he is making poor choices, and even with social security they cannot survive with their basic costs of living.What are the correct steps we need to take to properly evaluate their situation and make a smart choice on how to manage their debt/assets?TL;DR My parents have an unknown amount of debt that is most likely in the six figures, they have no income but have two properties. What are the next steps for help in the right direction? $5 Mamapedia Credit = Free Parents Magazine

Text Need advice on living a better FWF life. 
 Added on : Wednesday January 26th 2011 04:40:05 PM Dear FatWallet Finance, Make me better, please. To preface, some background. If youd like to skip the backstory then find heading The Bad. The Good: I am a 31-year-old, happy, successful, small business owner with a PhD and publications in an employable field (which I do not currently use). I have a stable, happy 3.5 year relationship which will likely soon be a marriage (ruined?). Income/Assets: My primary current source of income is stock market investment and my small business (an LLC) of which I own 80%. I purchased it as a turn-around a few years ago and have been very successful. It is now my primary source of income, has 8 employees, and has led to me leaving academics. It generated FCF in excess of $350k last year of which around $160k supports operations. Last year was the first year of the completed turn-around, and I took home roughly $150k before taxes from the business. Much of this has yet to be paid from business accounts to my personal accounts as I await word from my CPA. It is unlikely that the business will return to its poor prior state as that position was due to mismanagement by the previous ownership. Additional investment income from stocks was between $20-30k. I currently have around $250k in liquid assets (not including last years to-be-paid just discussed) distributed between checking accounts, low interest savings accounts, stocks, and, primarily, cash accounts at the brokerage I use (as I recently took profits). I have a paid-up $100k life insurance policy about which I know very little (paid by grandparents). Accommodations: I own my home with my SO (purchased April 2009) via a low-interest mortgage from my mother ($130k) and $60k of cash improvements via me. Home would likely appraise for ~$210k and as far as anyone knows we are the free and clear owners. SO and I jointly split the mortgage and are both on the homes title. Low taxes, high efficiency appliances/HVAC, low cost of living, mid-sized city. Other notes of interest: My SO and I both live relatively frugal lifestyles and will spend the majority of our discretionary incomes going forward on travel, wedding, and entertainment. Plan to work on having children in 2 years when SO finishes its PhD (which it loves and will pursue to full employment). Our joint monthly expenditures are probably around $800 to $1000 before mortgage. We do not have a budget but are sensible. For transportation, I usually share its car or drive one of the business vehicles. In the summer, I drive my fun car which I purchased in 2007 for $50k cash. It is extremely rare and will likely depreciate very little over time (so far, none) as it is highly desirable. Ultimately, I try to live my life the FWF way and make 90% of my purchases only after consulting Hot Deals. The Bad: I feel my financial life has a number of flaws. As I place a great deal of trust in the users of FWF, I thought I would spell out the bad and see what you can suggest to me before I attempt to make corrections to my erroneous ways.1. I have essentially no credit (and, essentially, no debt). I was raised with the belief that debt is the enemy and you dont spend what you dont have. It has worked very well for me so far as I probably would have made poor decisions with credit at a young age, but clearly there is a better way (the FWF way). I would like to build a strong credit profile which I can leverage for my personal and business gain as quickly as possible. In checking my free credit report, I found two old negatives in collections (one from a medical bill in 2006 and one from ATT in 2004). Not sure what to do about these (to dispute or pay?). Otherwise, two months ago I opened my first secured credit card with a $500 limit. I am currently at 55% utilization (lol). I have attempted to apply for basic credit cards (store cards) a couple times in the past few years and have been rejected both times. This credit crisis is what I would like to fix most of all.Potential solution: Dispute negative entries with the hope that a CN47-style dispute will wipe them from my report without charge. Otherwise, pay them off. After paying them, do an AOR. 2. I have no health insurance. My SO does and this will be solved once we are married but I am not sure what to do until then. I am healthy but do participate in high risk sports that could conceivably kill/maim me in short order. That is my biggest health concern. I would like health insurance but all the options Ive looked into through my business seem very expensive. Is there a better way?Potential solution: Bite the bullet and purchase catastrophic injury coverage that specifically does not outlaw coverage for injuries during the activities I most commonly participate in which could maim me. 3. I do no tax planning and do not have any tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Now that my income is very high for a single person, I feel like tax planning should become a part of my life. I trust my CPA who works on my business taxes but it is awfully expensive by the hour to just sit there and talk about tax planning given all the possible permutations. Is there a better way to start building a plan?Potential solution: Thinking about taxes makes me want to curl up and die, so I suppose I should just leave it up to my CPA and pay my fair share.Ultimately, Id like to be a hard working contributor to FWF as well as someone who takes advantage of the smarts around here. However, I feel like Ive got to get my house in order which is why Im turning to the people I trust most, first. Id like to keep the nature of my business and as many personal details as possible confidential because I tell all of my friends, acquaintances, and customers how awesome FatWallet is and some of them are certainly users now. That said, Ill try to answer any questions to the best of my ability to help get the best advice. Obviously, this is not my normal FW account. And no, I wont post pics of it. Child care tax credit AND FSA if you have 2 kids but one has $0 in eligible expenses? 
 Added on : Wednesday January 26th 2011 03:40:04 PM Please forgive this fairly basic question, but none of the publications that I&apos;ve read (including TurboTax&apos;s explanation) on this topic address my question. I understand that you can&apos;t run the same exact expenses through your FSA and then use them to receive the child care tax credit. What I do not understand is whether you have to have two different categories of child care expenses in order to take advantage of both.In other words, if you have two children and only one of them is in pre-school while the other one is at home with free child care (grandparents, so we are still otherwise eligible for FSA and the child care tax credit). If you spend, let&apos;s say, $11K in one year on pre-school, you can obviously run $5K of that through your FSA. Can you then use the excess (limited to $1K and subject to the applicable income phase-outs) to receive the child care tax credit?From what I understand, if I was spending, let&apos;s say, $5.5K/year per child on child care expenses, there wouldn&apos;t be a problem with my scenario. Since all the eligibile expenses are associated with just one child though and all the expenses are from the same source (pre-school) does it somehow prevent me from using the child care tax credit in addition to the FSA? Child care tax credit AND FSA?

How to best deal with farm land purchase as it relates to capital gains and estate taxes 
 Added on : Sunday January 23rd 2011 11:40:08 PM First off, my parents do intend to talk to a lawyer, I was just hoping for some additional ideas.Neighbor in late 70&apos;s wants to sell my parents his farmland that he has owned for decades.
He is well enough off that he does not need the money currently, but he does not want to sell it because of capital gains taxes.
My parents fear that if he does not sign off on the sale before his death, his heirs (distant cousins) will find a way to void the contract, or easily drag out the process for years and make it much more expensive.What options does the FWF crowd know of to get around a situation like this?Thanks in advance to everyone For Expecting Parents: Free Subscription to American Baby

 Added on : Wednesday January 19th 2011 04:40:09 PM Sorry for the novel...How I ended up the way I am, I have no idea... I grew up with parents (that even thought they did not spend beyond their means) ended up spending most everything they made. If they had not sold their business when they retired, they would have had no savings other than the house. Often eating out well and expensive cars every 2-3 years. My siblings adopted these habits to the extreme outspending my parents.I am frugal, but (at least in my opinion) not to any extreme. I like eating out every so often, only buy new cars (but they are not luxury and I drive them forever), and buy stuff I like (after finding a coupon or deal for them of course).I&apos;ve been constantly nagged about being too frugal from my parents: keeping my clothes too long, not getting a nicer car, and when we eat out they want to eat at a nice restaurant. In fact, when I got married, I accommodated them by having 2 receptions (one small one for my friends/family and a traditional one for my parents 400 &quot;closest&quot; friends) since it was a once in a lifetime thing.My most recent problem is with my son&apos;s 1st birthday (this is our second child). I wanted to have it at our house instead having a banquet like we did for our first child. That first banquet cost me a few thousand, but because my culture gives cash for gifts, we made about 50%-75% back which I put in my son&apos;s bank account. My parents offered to pay for the 2nd son banquet, but I don&apos;t want them to since they don&apos;t necessarily have much money themselves (in my 30s I probably am worth more than they are. They are retired and if they run out of money, I&apos;m going to have to give them money. In addition, I don&apos;t want to have a banquet because I would like to make it a social event where people can socialize and kids can play and I&apos;m not just treating tables of 10 to dinner. As a compromise I said I would have it catered, but they are still mad about it and are saying they will not attend my son&apos;s birthday. They will have their own birthday party that will be a banquet.So the question is: how would some of you deal with parents that want to make you spend or how you would deal with this situation specifically?Some details that may help:
I am 1st generation asian (others with a similar background might be able to relate). I would value feedback from those folks the most though any other serious suggestions would be helpful.
My parents provide childcare for me and I pay them about 10% below what I would end up paying if I had hired someone else.
I am just about to start a business this year that will cost me about the last 10 years of my savings. This has made me a bit more cognizant of money. Not to mention I have a 2 children worth of expenses.
To be fair and to give a bit of their perspective of things, my parents say our relatives are very generous and I am ripping them off of a dinner, however, my perspective is that they know that it is a catered house party and they can adjust their gifts accordingly if they&apos;d like. Also, they say they will have to do too much work for a house party, but I am getting it catered and having it buffet style.

Broken down using straightforward, simple language, this guide offers parents who are easily intimidated by math instructive and handy concepts to use when helping their students with homework or studying for a big test.
Parents banish math phobia once and for all by facing math head-on in Math for Moms and Dads. Frequently, the issue isnt how to, its actually what do they want me to do? Learning the language of math in context is the first step in the right direction for helping yourself in todays math morass so parents can help their child find his or her way out of any math quagmire.
Using a similar methodology applied in SAT Score-Raising Math Dictionary, Kaplan now focuses on the parent in this no-nonsense guide to the lexicon of math.

 Added on : Friday January 14th 2011 11:40:07 AM A few years back, I co-signed for my parents on a loan from Lowe&apos;s that they used to renovate their kitchen.They had previously gone through bankruptcy (about 4 years before) after losing their business and asked that I co-sign in order to get a better rate and a higher limit. I happily obliged them, looking to help wherever possible. My credit at the time was phenomenal and I took great pride in my score. I was using every technique available to develop my credit history and raise my score.Unfortunately, financial trouble struck again when my mother&apos;s contract as a teacher was not renewed. They allowed the account to go unpaid. At the time it was only a month. But I later learned that it was much more significant. The account had a 30 day past due balance nearly every month, with some months reaching 60 and 90 days. The account has been in their control ever since it was initiated. I have never made a single payment, phone call or administrative contact. All payments are made by the parents via electronic deposit or check.
I&apos;d like some help from FW to determine what could be done to remedy my situation. Is there a way I can get this removed from my credit report? Can anything be done? I am 23 years old, a recent graduate and will be looking to purchase a home relatively soon. I would like to do as much as possible to reduce the impact of this mark on my credit, or have it removed if possible.Sorry for the long post, but I sincerely appreciate your time and help.

 Added on : Sunday January 09th 2011 09:40:01 PM I&apos;m looking to go on a cruise sometime during spring. It doesn&apos;t have to be spring, but my partner prefers one then. Does anyone have some suggestion for some good, affordable cruise? I&apos;d like to have a good experience for 2, but realistically we have to also decide by price. We&apos;re both students/grad students who work and have no financial support from parents.Cruise deal sites like Cruise Critic and Cruise Complete do help, but I don&apos;t know where to start or what really are good deals. I&apos;ve no experience with cruises at all and all the &quot;real&quot; charges in the end, I&apos;d like some solid advice and some suggestions from people with experience on finding deals and going on cruises. I&apos;m trying to find the best bang for the buck, so we can actually have some fun for once, be able to afford it, and then get back to reality with some great memories. Guess the # of nights should be around 3, but hoping there&apos;s a great deal for 7 nights (which might be fair from NY).We both live in NYC, so flight cost does matter if there&apos;s a good deal on west coast, but we have to shell out another 1k to fly there. The cruise will need to depart in NY. The destination doesn&apos;t too much, as long as it&apos;s a good vacation spot. I&apos;ve never really been anywhere, but looking for something more of the Bahamas than a cruise to a port in Maine.Budget is around $500 per person. Hopefully less, but I expect it&apos;ll be more with all the costs and fees, and there&apos;s food to worry about. Oh, eating is a favorite activity. My partner likes the atmosphere/scenery more and just want us to spend some rare time together.The most recent search I made is on this site and thread: I took the link out because I&apos;m unsure if linking is allowed, but I&apos;m posting this to cover rules 5.g. for requests.A lot of people seem to say it&apos;s not that great of a deal or seem unsure if it is. Heard FW is great for travel ideas, so I came here. Hope someone can help some poor students out. Thanks! Auto accident....insurance/estimate questions. 
 Added on : Sunday January 09th 2011 01:40:04 PM Hi everyone,My husband and I were in a minor car accident on Christmas Day (he was driving), due to snow. It was my husband&apos;s first accident. Our car got a lot more damage than the other one... the driver&apos;s side headlight is gone, as well as some minor damage to the hood. I&apos;m not yet sure whose &quot;fault&quot; it will be. My husband was issued a ticket at the scene for failing to reduce speed to avoid a collision (we were only going 10-15 mph) and the State Trooper told him that it was standard in all accidents. We&apos;re not sure whether or not the other driver got one. We have a court date next month and we&apos;re hoping it&apos;ll be dismissed.Our insurance company tells us that we&apos;ll have to pay a $500 deductible for repairs. We don&apos;t mind living with the damage (aside from the headlight), except that there&apos;s a lien-holder involved. We&apos;re going through an extremely tough time, so there&apos;s no way we can afford the deductible ourselves... unfortunately, my parents are the ones will have to shell it out, although they can&apos;t really afford it either.Our Claims Adjuster told us to get one estimate and have it faxed to her. From there, we can do the Direction to Pay with the shop, or just have a check made out to us and the lien-holder. The original plan was to have the dealer do an estimate and then have someone my uncle knows fix it for less, which = us being able to keep the extra and also not have to pay the deductible. However, at this point, we&apos;re unsure whether or not it&apos;s possible to have the car repaired at a shop other than where you got the estimate, and we&apos;re leaning toward biting the bullet. We had an estimate done at over $3,000, but haven&apos;t faxed it yet.I&apos;ve done some research and I&apos;m wondering whether or not we&apos;d be throwing away $500 unnecessarily. Some people online are saying that it&apos;s no big deal and that they&apos;ve done it plenty of times. Others are saying that it&apos;s insurance fraud and that there&apos;s a chance of being sued. As far as I can tell, all the lien-holder needs in order to endorse the check is proof that the car has been repaired, which won&apos;t be a problem. It was also mentioned that sometimes they also need a copy of the estimate. Will the insurance company know which shop actually got the repair check, and would it cause a red flag to go up? The insurance rep. at our local office said that typically you do use the same shop you got your estimate from and that they want to make sure there is no &quot;leftover&quot;, but I also know that it&apos;s her job to say that.What are you thoughts on this?

 Legal questions about buying a house with parents 
 Added on : Friday January 07th 2011 11:40:05 PM I&apos;m currently living in the Los Angeles area. When I moved here 3.5 years ago to start a PhD, condo prices were astronomical. Since then, they&apos;ve come down by almost 50%. I&apos;m thus considering buying a 2br condo with my parents.General idea:My girlfriend and I would live in the condo
The condo would be co-owned by myself and my parents. Both my parents&apos; and my credit are excellent and their income is sufficiently high that we should have no problems getting the best mortgage rate.
My parents would cover the down payment (20%)
My gf and I would split the mortgage, insurance, condo fees, and taxes. She would not receive an ownership interest. I would based on how much of the principal I pay off. I trust my gf to contribute her share of the payments.
I will graduate 2 years after buying the condo and likely move elsewhere (but probably not too far away). The apartment would then be rented out. Assuming my gf and I don&apos;t break up, we&apos;ll be here often as most of her family is in the area.
Pricing wise, a 200k condo would cost ~1000/month with insurance/taxes + condo fees + maintenance. Renting a similar apartment right now costs $1500-2000.Why? It&apos;s a win-win-win situation (at first glance)My parents have spare cash and have paid off their own house (in NY). They&apos;d take the mortgage interest and property tax deductions (my income is much, much smaller than theirs) as well as having an investment.
I&apos;d pay less than renting but own the property, as well as getting the investment
My gf would have a better apt at a lower rate and easy access to ensure everything is fixed as necessary.
I have lots of questions to answer regarding buying a condo and whether it&apos;s worth it, but I want to figure out the legal ones first. Here are the primary ones:For two years I&apos;ll be living in the apartment. The condo would then be rented out. What kind of agreement should there be between myself and my parents giving the best legal protections and tax benefits? How will the switch from me living in the apartment to it being rented out affect the mortgage and insurance?
Are there any legal complications with my gf living with me regarding ownership interest? Should I set her up with an official lease, or do it less officially? While there&apos;s a good chance we&apos;ll eventually get married, that won&apos;t happen in the next few years. Will her payments have to be treated as rent payments thus requiring filing tax forms for rental income?This will eventually require a lawyer, but I&apos;m only in the initial stages of figuring this out and would very much appreciate any feedback. If there are any other major concerns you can see, please let me know.Thanks. REQUEST: Need Hotel in Washington, DC for Cherry Blossom Festival 
 Added on : Friday January 07th 2011 09:40:02 AM Hi there!
I&apos;m hoping you all can help me with this. I&apos;m taking my family of 6 (2 adults, and 4 children ages 8, 7, 6, and 4) and 2 grandparents to Washington, DC for the Cherry Blossom festival. We&apos;ll be staying April 7-10. We live in Northeast Pennsylvania so we&apos;ll be driving down and won&apos;t need airfare. I&apos;d also like to keep the trip to about $500...hopefully including gas. We&apos;ll be sticking to the free museums and attractions while we&apos;re there...if anyone has suggestions for those I&apos;d love to hear them (aside from the air&amp;space mueseum and the smithsonian, which we&apos;ll definately check out). We&apos;ll have breakfast from home in our room every morning and I plan to carry a backpack with snacks/drinks, buy a late lunch and have some snacks in the hotel for the evening. So we&apos;ll be eating out only one meal a day. I&apos;ll do some more looking on restaurant.com to try to save some bucks that way. Is there a better way to save on meals down there? We don&apos;t need anything gourmet but we won&apos;t be eating at McDonald&apos;s either. What&apos;s the best way to go about everything? Should we stay inside the city and walk a mile to get to everything or stay outside the city and ride the train in? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 Added on : Tuesday January 04th 2011 02:40:05 PM First things first, I did do some searching and didn&apos;t find any topics on this matter. If I missed something please let me know but I wasn&apos;t lazy.I got my first credit card about 5 or 6 years ago, it was a Shell card and it was a joint card off my parents account. 2 years after getting the card I went to my local CU and got a credit card there. When they pulled my score they said it was terrible because I had $20,000 available to me on my parent&apos;s shell card and at the time I was making only $150/week. Because of this I got a low $500 limit with terrible APY (but I pay off every month so NBD). I went home and on the advice of the CU, talked to my parents and am no longer joint on the account (I still have the open credit card but it shows as closed on reports and doesn&apos;t affect my score anymore). So about 3 years have passed and I have 1 more credit card (chase freedom rewards) and I&apos;m thinking about the future. I still don&apos;t make much being a college student, but I&apos;ll be graduating in June and have a few job offers already, so I know my income will be substantially higher then.Would it be smart to get back on my parent&apos;s card now or when I graduate to have the extra line of credit, an increase of 20k to my available credit, and an older age of open credit. I want to keep my credit score good (currently got a FAKO from Karma of 715 due to AVG age of credit being 1yr 7mo, 2 hard pulls, and only 2 open, 1 closed line of credit) just incase an investment opportunity comes along.

 Added on : Sunday January 02nd 2011 04:40:04 PM I am 25 years old. I graduated with my masters degree recently - and have had a job for about a year. I was making 70k/yr and recently got a raise to 95k/yr. My job is very stable - and I&apos;m fortunate enough to be in a field where if something happened I could find another job without a problem, probably making more (but I love where I&apos;m at now). I had around 70k in student loan debt, which I&apos;ve paid down to around 50. The monthly payment on that money is $500/month. However, I&apos;m so far paid ahead due to making extra payments, if I didn&apos;t pay anything untill mid-2012, I wouldn&apos;t go delinquent. The monthly payments come directly out of my checking account, and I&apos;ve been sending in extra on top of that whenever I can. The monthly amount I would owe is around 550 dollars. I also have a car payment (at 0% interest) of 603 dollars per month. I&apos;ve got a cell phone bill that costs me 40 dollars a month, and a cable bill that costs me 20 dollars a month. I spend, on average, 50 dollars a week on gas. My insurance (full coverage) is 60 dollars a month. So, my absolutely minimum ammount I owe per month is 1271.75. However, if I couldn&apos;t work for a year for some strange reason and couldn&apos;t pay my loans for a year, they would not go into default and I would only be obligated to pay $721.75. I&apos;m also saving 5% of my income in a 401k, I have an employer match of 3% and a cash balance pension contribution by my employer of 3% - for a total of 11% savings into retirement per year. I&apos;m comfortable with that amount for now.I&apos;m estimating my monthly income, after taxes, health care etc. will be 5500-6500 a month when I get my first post-raise paycheck. I&apos;m guessing 5500 to be conservative.So now what? I live with my parents. I was planning on moving out once I got my degree/raise to ensure things were more stable. I&apos;ve decided if I allow myself 200 dollars a week for other expenses (food, entertainment, clothing, etc.) I can save up 40k in a year. I&apos;ve already got around 6k in savings (I had been putting all my extra money into my student loans/car/car down payment). My car is at 0% interest, so I&apos;m really not interested in paying that back any sooner - and I&apos;ve got gap insurance and new car replacement if it&apos;s totalled for 2 years.So - I can save up 40k per year if I continue to live at home. I&apos;ve priced apartments - and can get into something for around 1k/month. Adding food (75 dollars a week), utilities (250 per month to be conservative, internet (which I need for work) 75 dollars a month - I would be adding 1650 in expenses per month, or around 20k. So I would then be able to save approximately 20k per year.I&apos;m new to all of this, so I&apos;m sorry if this sounds dumb, I just don&apos;t know what to do. I would really like to move out. But I don&apos;t know if I want to move into an apartment. The interest rates/prices on homes are so low right now, and I would like to take advantage of it. From people I&apos;ve talked to, I don&apos;t see things changing within the next couple of years. So if I could save up for a year and a half, and continue to live at home, I would have a healthy down payment and an emergency fund to buy a house. But then I have to live at home for another year and a half.I&apos;m just confused because I don&apos;t know how people do these things. Am I thinking correctly? Am I forgetting something? What is the prudent financial decision to make? I know there are some who say - pay off all of your debt before you do anything. I could pay off my car and student loans in about 2 years. However, the car is at 0% interest, and I&apos;ve taken a huge chunk out of my student loans and do plan on putting any extra into those. The interest rate on my student loans varies between 2.5-6.8, however I&apos;ve mostly paid off the 6.8% loans. I&apos;m ok with paying those out for the next several years with my &quot;minimum&quot; payments. I can afford to do that I believe. I&apos;m getting stir crazy. I want to get out of my parents house. I moved out for undergraduate, but have been here for almost 3 years now while I completed graduate school. I&apos;m scared to get an apartment because I feel like I&quot;m just throwing money away I could be saving for a house to take advantage of the market and get something nice for a reasonable payment. I&apos;m used to being a poor college student and not spending anything (my loans were high - but that was undergraduate and masters sequentially, so around 10k per year to pay tuition, room and board, etc.). I worked in college. I just am so nervous to make a commitment to anything. I love my car, but it took months to decide to do that (while my old car was falling apart) and I still feel guilty about doing that. I researched that to death. I&apos;m commitment phobic.I&apos;ve been reading these forums for a long time, and I know i just created this account and am now begging for help/advice. However, I don&apos;t know much about money (I watch Suze Orman and sometimes listen to Dave Ramsay) but I had nothing valuable to contribute to posts because I&apos;m not experienced. So, sorry this is my first post.So I don&apos;t know what to do. I don&apos;t know what to do with my money. I don&apos;t like living with my parents. I feel like a loser. They refuse to charge me rent because they&apos;re trying to help me out. Am I missing something in my logic? Should i just get an apartment? How do people figure these things out? I feel overwhelmed and terrified... Kidz-Med 5-in-1 Non-contact Thermometer = $36.57 + FS @ Amazon.com

 Added on : Friday December 31st 2010 02:40:04 PM This post is to vent and also to see other people&apos;s opinion.My brother wants to open up a very expensive franchise restaurant. He doesn&apos;t have the requisite asset(1-2 mil) so he would like my parents and I to invest.Here are the cons:
He&apos;s a screwup. I love him but he&apos;s still a screwup. He has had a string of failed small business(no where near as capital intensive) that have all been funded by my parents and in fact his living expenses are still all paid by them. He has zero restaurant experience other than working part time in taco bell in high school for a few month to put on his college application. His college degree is a useless liberal arts degree that took 8 years to obtain because of his partying. He always desires the luxurious things in life. He&apos;s been recently looking to buy a new audi s5 for god&apos;s sake while I&apos;m driving an accord.My parents want to retire soon but probably won&apos;t with this amount of cash at risk. My father is very conservative financially and even though he probably can retire even with this investment, he won&apos;t be able to sleep unless there&apos;s a significant amount of cushion. My father&apos;s dream is to travel the world and he&apos;ll have to put that dream on hold with this for several years. If they do go along with this, I&apos;ll be contributing nearly all my liquid asset to lessen their burden which will probably amount to 1/3 of the investment. I won&apos;t be able to start investing in real estate for a while.Here are the pros:
It&apos;s a very safe franchise with an outstanding record for return. Brand recognition is incredible. Corporate is very strict about nearly everything and lack of experience would not be fatal. I&apos;m 90% sure this will succeed because of the franchise track record. I&apos;ll be active in managing this restaurant as well. I&apos;m not very worried about contributing this much cash because I spend significantly less than the income from my job and saving will accumulate quickly. I just turned 30 and am single without any obligation. If it does succeed, it&apos;ll provide additional retirement income to my parents. I&apos;ll also have a nice supplemental income. My brother(who recently got married and now has a daughter) will finally be able to be somewhat financially independent from my parents although not really. My mom&apos;s dream is to see all her children succeed and this will help achieve her dream.To prevent this from post from depicting me as the perfect son, I&apos;m not. Everything I&apos;ve accomplished was because of them but I fight with them ALL THE TIME. We constantly argue and fight about inane things although never about money. This might be my first real fight with them about money. Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread 2010 
 Added on : Tuesday December 28th 2010 12:40:04 PM Greetings and Happy Holidays to All! It&apos;s time to start the 2010 Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread. I started doing these threads annually on the FW Finance board in 2006. When I originally started this thread four years ago, I thought it could serve as a great resource for people to learn about the ups and downs of various careers, including information such as salaries and benefits. I have always found these threads particularly informative and interesting.I thought last year&apos;s thread was probably the best of all of them. Lots of people contributed information about their careers, and the thread remained active until May. The 2008 thread was a bit of a disappointment, but things got better last year, so let&apos;s try it again!Now gang, here&apos;s a reminder of the rules, which 99.9% of you have been great at following over the past four years:If you participate, please try to keep this a positive, informative thread, and let&apos;s not get into any arguments about how one&apos;s career/education/compensation makes him/her superior/inferior to other people. Contribute as much or as little information as you&apos;re comfortable sharing, but please be honest so that this may serve as a truly informative thread for people mulling their career options.So, now that the ground rules have been set, how did your job go this year? Did things go well or not so well? How well were you compensated for 2010? Did the poor economy have a serious effect on your career? Maybe each person can give a brief description of themselves, their job, their education levels, and their salaries, present and maybe even projected salaries for the future. As always, since I&apos;m starting the thread, I have to bite first:
Gender: MaleAge: 38Location: Northern NJOccupation: Urban Educator (My fancy title for a teacher in a city of low socioeconomic standing)Education: M.A., plus 33 additional credits2010 Salary: $90,000 (Base Pay + Retro Pay from a newly settled contract + a little extra money from some after school work and a few other extra things.) Base pay for the 2010-2011 school year, without extra money, is just about $88,000. Future Salary Projection: This is a tricky one this year. There is a strong possibility that my salary (and the salaries of many other teachers) will be frozen for at least the next year. If salaries are not frozen, my salary should be in the $95,000 ballpark for the 2011 calendar year, and in the $100,000 range for the 2011-2012 school year. (More on why our salaries may be frozen later in the thread.)Benefits: Full medical, modest dental, generous sick and personal time, a decent pension plan (for now, more on that later), tremendous job security once you achieve tenure (but virtually none before that, and even with tenure, you can still have the daylights menaced out of you. Also keep in mind that not all states offer tenure, in which case you can pretty much be fired at will no matter how much time you have in a particular district.) In almost all districts in NJ, you can accumulate sick time from year to year. This is a tremendous benefit, as I found out two years ago, and again just a few weeks ago when I suffered two major long-term illnesses. It was nice not having to worry about getting paid during my absences. What&apos;s the job like?Very difficult and getting more difficult bu the year. Tremendously long hours, almost no down time during the school day (I don&apos;t take lunch very often),lots of work at home, deplorable working conditions, with some classrooms reaching temperatures of 90+ degrees and others below freezing. Prepare to adopt some small scurrying pets who have made your classroom their home in older buildings in urban districts. You will also most likely need to spend a decent amount of money on supplies for students because your school won&apos;t provide them, even though they insist on your using them. Very little respect and support from most supervisors, parents, and students. I do it for the good kids and because I love teaching. Massive budget cuts have made the job even more difficult. Many teachers (myself included) are now finding themselves doing two jobs for the price of one due to massive retirements and staffing cuts. Would you recommend the career to others?Every year, it&apos;s become harder and harder for me to recommend teaching as a career. If you get a job in a district that treats you with some respect, is on solid financial footing (along with your corresponding state), and pays you a salary that ensures you won&apos;t be eating cans of tuna for the rest of your life, then I can recommend teaching as a career.However, things here in NJ have gotten real rough over the past year. Our governor has pretty much made it his mission to make things much rougher for teachers, and has publicly vilified us on many occasions. He reduced state aid for all districts, resulting in massive layoffs. He wants to drastically alter our pension system, and there is a lot of fear that he is going to try to significantly reduce pension benefits for all public employees. This resulted in massive retirements of veteran teachers. He put tremendous pressure on teachers at the end of the last school year to accept salary freezes, even in districts that had valid contracts, and he is likely to increase the pressure this year. He wants to eliminate tenure, and while total elimination is unlikely, it&apos;s likely going to be made much tougher to get and to retain. He wants to institute merit pay, basing teacher salaries on their students&apos; performance on standardized tests. This, of course, is infuriating many teachers, but especially those in urban districts like mine, where teachers sometimes get kids who have never attended school a day in their life show up to begin their educational careers on the day the standardized test starts. How is the kid going to pass the test if he doesn&apos;t even know his alphabet, let alone how to read? How is this kid going to compare to the kid in the affluent district who has a private tutor?Then of course, you have to deal with all of the discipline problems, especially . What do you do when a kid curses you out, flips a desk over, smacks another kid in the head without provocation, and runs out of your class? You could tell your building administrators, but chances are they will not impose serious consequences on the student. They don&apos;t want to make the school look bad or deal with angry parents. Then, if you have administrators who are unsupportive, they may ask you, What did you do to make the kid curse you out, flip over a desk, and smack another student in the head? Then they&apos;ll tell you to better motivate your students to learn. When you ask how, they won&apos;t tell you. (Yes, this stuff actually happens.) There are great moments, however. There are a lot of great kids in all districts who will give you their all every day. This is what keeps me going in my district. I know that I&apos;m helping these kids to have the best future possible, even though they often face difficult circumstances.Teaching is not an easy job, especially in an urban district. If you think that you will be able to face the challenges that await you, then go for it!

Alicia Rasley (Author)Editorial Reviews
Product Description
The tragic mystery at the heart of their family has finally surfaced . . . When Ellen Wakefield O&apos;Connor is confronted by a young man armed with a birth certificate that mistakenly names her as his mother, she quickly sorts out the truth: his birth mother listed Ellen on the certificate to cover up her own identity, but also because Ellen is, in a way, related to the child. The birth father is Ellen&apos;s troubled husband, Tom. The secrets of the past soon engulf Ellen, Tom, and everyone they love.
From the Author
The Year She Fell by Alicia Rasley
Reader&apos;s Guide

The Year She Fell is set in the mountains of West Virginia, a beautiful but impoverished state. Discuss the situation of the Wakefield sisters, growing up rich but surrounded by poverty.
Both Ellen and her sister Theresa have religious vocations, but while Ellen&apos;s faith is low-key, Theresa&apos;s requires constant sacrifice. What about their personalities and experiences might account for the difference in religious intensity?
Mitch Price is an artisan, a man who works creatively with his hands in a traditional craft (wood-carving). In his own way, he is as much a throwback as Mrs. Wakefield. How might the remote setting (mountainous West Virginia) lead to an embrace of more traditional forms and roles?
Jackson McCain was a delinquent who grew up to be a cop. What sort of experiences might account for such a transformation?
Mrs. Wakefield is a society matriarch of a sort not seen much in these days of grannies in hiking boots. Tom calls his father &quot;a professional Irishman,&quot; deepening his accent and Irishness to impress the Americans who come to his pub. Trevor O&apos;Connor. and Mrs. Wakefield are both most comfortable in the personas imparted by their social class and situation. Is that sort of role-inhabiting a thing of the past in our fast-changing society? Contrast this with the discarding of early roles (delinquent and debutante) shown by the younger Jackson and Laura.
Laura and Jackson never got over their early love, and they reunite as adults. Is this sort of &quot;reunion love&quot; an example of self-deception, or can what attracted us at 16 still be alluring in midlife?
In his reckless youth, Tom betrayed Ellen. Do you think it&apos;s possible to forgive and forget in a case like theirs? Is she a fool if she believes him when he says he loved only her?
Cathy is the great enigma, and her death the mystery that her sisters must solve. Consider the damage she has done to each sister. Does her reason absolve her of guilt? How much should childhood trauma excuse adult misbehavior?
Were Mrs. Wakefield&apos;s attempts to protect her family admirable or lamentable? Chief McCain thinks she&apos;s crazy, as are most rich women. Do you agree that wealth distorts reality for the wealthy?
All families have secrets, though the Wakefields have more than most. Have you discovered secrets in your own family? What did your parents and grandparents hide from you, and why?http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CFBMR4/ref=s9_pop_gw_ir03?p...

I really like the 9000, works great with Windows 7. Just got one as a gift for my favorite baby&apos;s parents Parents want to buy me a house and have me pay them back. 
 Added on : Tuesday December 21st 2010 03:40:07 PM Going to not be long winded here.... might not work. Currently own a house. 1500sq ft. owe $130k Going to rent it out when I move.Have an offer on a short sale house $200k. My parents have recently retired. My parents came to me and said they would buy my house and the house I have an offer on. I would then pay them like I would any other bank. So they would be getting 4.x% of interest on the money they give me (whatever the going rate is for a home loan). When they told me I kinda just looked at them and said I would think about it. Their resoning is that they get a safe return on the money. Also if something happend to them I would just be getting their money anyways so might as well get some return on it. I just don&apos;t understand how it would work... would I be able to write off the interest I pay them like i would a bank? Does this sound like a crazy thing to do? To me it would not bennifit me much as far as money saved.. but I would be giving my parents interest instead of just paying it into a bank. If something happend to them (god forbid) i would get whatever they have anyways.Is this something that people do? I have not looked into it but wouldnt they be able to make more interest just buying bonds or something?sorry if i sound kinda stupid.. I just wanted others advice or thoughts.

Eat a healthy meal and drink plenty of water before donating.Whole Blood: A whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. To donate whole blood, you must be 17 (with a parents permission) or older, weigh at least 110 pounds, have not donated in the past 8 weeks, and are not currently taking antibiotics. YOU MAY NOT DONATE IF YOU:
==========================
have cold or flu symptoms on the day of donation or do not feel well.
have ever used a needle to take nonprescription drugs.
had hepatitis after the age of 11.
ever had a positive Hepatitis B or C test.
been in Germany for the past 3 years (Due to Mad Cow Disease)

Double Red Cell: With the automated process called double red cell donation, donors can give just red cells - but two units of red cells - and thats the component of blood that is in the greatest demand. Along with meeting the regular blood donor qualifications, double red cell donors must meet special requirements. Men must weigh at least 130 lbs. and be at least 5&apos;1&quot;, while women must weigh at least 150 lbs., and be at least 5&apos;5&quot; tall.
Platelet Pheresis: With the automated platelet pheresis donation, you can donate up to ten times the amount of platelets as in a whole blood donation. Platelets are used in large quantities, and over extended periods of time, by leukemia, cancer, aplastic anemia and marrow transplant patients. Along with meeting the criteria for whole blood donors, they have one added restriction, which is NO ASPIRIN or anything containing aspirin, or Piroxicam (Feldene) can be taken 72 hours before donation. Going from a lower income to a higher income - any suggestions? 
 Added on : Saturday December 18th 2010 03:40:04 PM Hi all,I&apos;m looking for some advice going from a lower income (~$75k/yr) to a higher income ($100k + upto 40% bonus, where the 2010 bonus for someone in my new job was $37k at $107k base, so about 34% - but 2010 had a decent recovery from 2009 numbers - I expect to make at least a 15-20% bonus, if not more). I&apos;m also moving from a cheap city (Las Vegas) to an expensive one (NYC - Brooklyn). Single, no family, no kids, no debt, no home ownership, 1 years living cost (well, maybe 8 months now that I&apos;m moving to such an expensive place) in accessible savings, 12% of salary going to 401k with 4.5% total match from employer, and a comfortable enough IRA/stock/CD/retirement balance for a person my age (31). I live a fairly frugal lifestyle, but travel frequently to visit famly&amp;friends - but usually, on the cheap.I&apos;ve got a place to live lined up in NYC - 2 bedroom for $1800/mo utilities included so I feel pretty good about housing costs as I&apos;m at about 1/55th of my salary monthly vs. the max that many places required in NYC, 1/40th, monthly (i.e. if I make $100k/yr, I&apos;d be approved to live in a place upto $2.5k/mo.Taxes are a factor in the new cost of living (NV has no income tax, NY/NYC is around 10%, I think).From what I recall, if you make more than $105k, you can&apos;t contribute to a Roth IRA. I&apos;ve put in my contribution for 2010 already and will contribute to a regular IRA next year and onwards.I&apos;ve never met with a &quot;Retirement Counselor&quot; or a &quot;Financial Advisor&quot; because 1) My parents taught me the value of a dollar when I was young 2) I never made enough money to think I needed one 3) I feel like I&apos;ve got a decent grip on my future savings/retirement - the goal is $3 million in the bank when I retire - not quite at that pace yet, but goals should always be slightly out of reach, but attainable.At this new level of income - any suggestions on what I need to be aware of? I really don&apos;t feel because of my increase in income my lifestyle will change all that much.Thanks in advance! Alex Ready, Set, Go! Red Trike is $49.99 (75% off) at Amazon

 Added on : Wednesday December 15th 2010 03:40:04 PM First post here! Looking for advice. My parents will be gifting approx. $30,000 total for my 2 children. They are 2 and 5 years old.
My parents said we could use the money to pay down our mortage or for an emergency, but they would prefer it be left for the children. Currently we are able to pay our mortage and other bills with no problems.
I was planning on just putting the money in a CD in their names, but long term I would want them to get more interest.
Not sure how this would effect my taxes, and would I have to file a tax return for them also? This is the childrens only asset.
Open to suggestions.

Taking Advantage of a (Temporary) Low Tax Bracket in an LTR 
 Added on : Wednesday December 08th 2010 12:40:09 AM Hello, FWFers.Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I&apos;ve searched and can&apos;t find a topic that quite matches this. I apologize if I&apos;ve overlooked something obvious.I&apos;m currently a student in a long-term relationship. We&apos;re not currently married, but will likely become so in a few years.I am in the lowest of low tax brackets and will remain so for the next 3 years. In contrast, my girlfriend is in a much higher tax bracket (~$170k / yr... but with a few deductions, e.g., mortgage).Here&apos;s the question: Given the recent extension of the capital gains tax rates (i.e., my capital gains taxes will be 0% for the next 2 years), what are the possibilities for and implications of transferring some of my partner&apos;s investable assets into my trading account, such that any gains are accrued tax-free (assuming we sell before the end of 2010) in my name?We&apos;re sensitive to a few areas that seem like they could be problematic:
Gift Taxes:
Would this sort of a transfer be technically considered a gift in the eyes of the IRS -- such that we&apos;d be limited to $10k or $12k per year? Are there any ways to get around this limit without exposing ourselves to excessive risk (e.g., via a separate joint account into which she could deposit funds and from which I could transfer to the trading account)?
Documentation:
I know that no relationship is 100% solid, so we definitely will want to document ownership, transaction costs, and all such things to be sure that -- e.g., in the event of an unfortunate accident wherein either of us are bludgeoned, dismembered, or otherwise kicked to the literal or proverbial curb, she can still re-claim her invested assets.
Upper Limits on the 0% CG Tax Bracket:
I suspect we may need to be careful about how much capital gains are actually accrued under my name, seeing as it&apos;s possible that the combined total of my piddly income plus the CGs would cause me to exceed the upper limit for that tax bracket. Is this likely to be an issue -- or are CGs not considered part of my total income in the eyes of the IRS?Sorry for the very long write-up. If any of you have insight into this situation (which I imagine is similar for parents who would want to transfer assets into their adult-student child&apos;s name for the same purposes), I&apos;d be grateful to hear your thoughts.Thanks so much for everything you all have taught me over the years! I look forward to being a contributing member. (Edit: Formatting) 5 Pairs of Baby Legs $29.99 Shipped @ Baby Steals

This vignette-laden, nostalgic view of Christmastime in 1940s Indiana follows nine-year-old Ralphie, who desperately wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas--and is waging an all-out campaign to convince his reluctant parents that the toy will be safe in his hands. By turns warped and winsome, the comedy follows Ralphie as he prepares for the big day with his rather idiosyncratic family. Based on the novel by humorist Jean Shepherd (who also narrates the film), A CHRISTMAS STORY gained popularity long after its theatrical run, through frequent holiday broadcasts that turned its schoolyard &quot;triple-dog&quot; dares, family neuroses, and childhood indignities into a Yuletide tradition.

 Added on : Friday December 03rd 2010 08:40:04 PM So its been almost 4 years since I wrote my original thread on March 18th, 2007. To provide some context, I was a senior in college with a job lined up to start in June 2007.The old thread is now archived but can still be viewed here:
http://www.fullofdeals.com/forums/finance/713924I&apos;ve always enjoyed when others come on here to update folks on threads they created years ago so I thought it&apos;d be nice to return the favor.First off I&apos;ll start with my original stats:Age:22
Annual salary:45000
Current Roth IRA:4000
Current 401k:0
Student loans: 12000 @8% and 5500 @6.8%
Credit cards: 2000@0% until may of this year
Cash: Total between accounts 14000
Current Fico: 700 @ experian
Location: MA living with parents
Credit cards: 2
Credit Avail: $3k Now my updated stats almost 4 years later
Age:26
Annual salary: 73000
Current Roth IRA: 15943 (-10.1% return since inception)
Current 401k: 68069 (4.7% 2007, -52% 2008, 8.3% 2009, 13.1% 2010)
Student loans: 10566 @3.25% and 4738 @6.8%
Credit cards: 7400 @0% until April of this year
Cash: Total between accounts 16000
Car Loan: $23000 @ 2.99%
Current Fico: 792 @ credit karma
Location: MA living with friends
Credit cards: 16 open cards
Credit Avail: $130kSo when you look at these stats these are the things that come to mind for me and what I hope to learn from1. I&apos;m a terrible investor and CANNOT time the market.
2. I&apos;m an awesome saver despite my awful abilities as an investor.
3. I slack when it comes to paying student loans
4. Still working the credit card game to give me extra liquidity.
5. I haven&apos;t changed my emergency cash reserves at all
6. Bought a 3 year old BMW because I enjoy driving and ended up getting tired of the Honda (92 civic cx with no options)
7. Awesome credit score
8. Girlfriend broke up with me a year after writing the original thread and I moved out of parents place.
9. Lots of credit available from two AORs, one in 2007 right after graduation and another a year later in 2008.Comments
1. After graduating, I was completely undiversified sitting on 100% emerging market contribution just riding the wave in 2007. When 2008 came around, I saw about a 20% drop by the summer, but sat with the same contribution completely unaware of the chaos about to come. When the market crashed in 2008, I panicked and moved 100% into money market funds from Oct 2008 (Fall of Lehman) and parked it there all the way until Jul 2009. I completely missed the bounce from March 2009 to Jul 2009. STORY HERE IS DIVERSIFY AND DON&apos;T TRY TO TIME THE MARKET. Now I&apos;m completely diversified and letting dollar cost averaging work its magic. I&apos;m at a 13.1% return so far this year with a 85% stock 15% bond portfolio.2. I&apos;ve done a great job maxing out both my 401k and Roth IRA over the years. As promised, I put my entire bonus into my Roth every year for the past 3 years as well as maxed out my 401k every year since graduating. You can see that despite the market taking a complete dump, I&apos;ve still managed to save a considerable amount in a short period of time. I&apos;ve gone from $4000 to $84000 in total retirement savings over 3.5 years in during one of the worst economies our country has seen.3. I&apos;ve honestly put my student loans on auto-pilot and just had the minimum payments deducted from my account each month. THIS HAS GOTTEN ME ALMOST NOWHERE. If there&apos;s one thing I&apos;m going to focus on more, its getting rid of this debt.4. I still sign up for credit card deals, however instead of working the 0% BT game, I&apos;ve been working the Air Miles game. With the combination of the British Airways 100,000 mile deal, two 75,000 mile AAdvantage cards and the 32pt + $500 gift card Chase Southwest deal, I think I&apos;ve been far better off than the 0% BT days.5. This is my emergency fund, it should be good enough to get me through at least a year and has kept me financially stress free6. I got so tired of my 92 Honda and felt embarrassed and unsafe driving it around. It still ran perfectly and never gave me problems, but having no power steering, door locks, windows, brakes etc got old. I&apos;m a driving enthusiast so the used BMW 335i bought with a 2.99% penfed loan is really enjoyable for me.7. AOR + High HHI (living with parents) + Paying my bills on time = EXCELLENT CREDIT8. So I find it funny to read through the other thread about how great things were with the girlfriend at the time. I can&apos;t believe I was so naive. A year after I graduated she decided that she&apos;d missed out on the college experience and decided to move half way across the country on a student exchange for a year. She broke up with me the night before she left and started dating another guy a month later. I decided to move out of my parents place about 2 weeks after that and live with 3 friends I&apos;ve known since high school in a huge house we rented for a steal. This was probably one of the more surprising moves I made over the past 4 years and its also been one of the best. It increased my expenses by $1000/mo (rent, food, utilities, commute), however it has more than paid for itself with a lifetime of memories and women.9. Doing those two AORs so early in my life have really set me on the path of excellent credit for the rest of my life. I&apos;m instantly approved for everything I sign up for and I receive the best rates on every loan. I also have no problem closing credit cards because I already have a solid amount of credit and history available to absorb the blow. This allows me to sign up for air miles cards and close them before getting hit with annual fees.Anyway, I&apos;m done with my novel and promise to provide another update in a couple years.My goals for the next 3-4 years are:1. Get over 100k in my 401k
2. Get over 30k in my roth
2. Get my MBA from a top tier school
3. Earn a salary over 100k
4. Buy an exotic car (Porsche, Lambo, Aston Martin)
5. Find my future wife
6. Possibly buy a house (I&apos;m enjoying my freedom right now so this is a maybe) JC Penny Set of 4 Princess Dolls for $5.99

 Added on : Monday November 29th 2010 01:40:05 AM I am currently in the market to get a new car since my old one needs a complete engine rebuild and a few other repairs to get in good working order.
Being a college student I spend my time split between school, work and my parent&apos;s house. I have no set home so I am unclear where to select that I am from to get insurance since all three places are in different states.
In the past year I have gone to school for 7 months in Upstate NY, CO-OP in Virgina near DC for 4 months and spend the rest of my time at my parents house about an hour outside of Philly in PA.
If it matters my license is in PA so that is where the car will be purchased and registered.
Does it matter what state I insure my car in? Should I go with the one I spend the majority of my time in or just the one that my license is tied to? Parent&amp;Child Mag $4.39 1yr Sub + FW CB

Coupon Code: FATWALLET16 Should I refinance? ING home loan (3% + Costs) vs Parents (4.5%) 
 Added on : Saturday November 27th 2010 02:40:03 PM Thoughts? Yesterday took advantage of the ING Black Friday deal. They&apos;re mailing me the paperwork, not sure if I should sign. Right now I owe my parents ~$74,000 on an undocumented mortgage. I&apos;m paying them 4.5%. There&apos;s no extra fee&apos;s. The rate through them will reset in 4 1/2 years.ING is offering me 2.99% (calling it 3%), with bi-weekly payments (matches my bi-weekly pay cycle). Also, there&apos;s up to $3,600-$3,800 in closing costs, less the $2,000 credit. Plus ING charges late fee&apos;s (plan for 2 unwaved in 5 years), and will charge a renewal fee at the 5 year market (assuming $500 PV).I&apos;m in the 25% tax bracket, but that credit rebate doesn&apos;t apply until April the following year. I&apos;d look to close in January 2011, which means my closing costs wouldn&apos;t be credited for ~15 months (April 2012).What&apos;s my break-even point in ING Fee&apos;s? (Ie, no Fee&apos;s take ING - $5,000 in fee&apos;s, stick with parents.)

6 pounds of pens.....what will they come up with next? Ok, here&apos;s the deal. You use pens almost everyday of your life. Your parents used pens and even your computer age children still use pens. Yes, it&apos;s lovely to have a $200.00 Cross or Monte Blanc handy, but reality is that most of us riffle through our kitchen drawers looking for something to write with. Well, now&apos;s your chance to fill those drawers up on the cheap.Here&apos;s the scoop on this deal. Each pen is a brand new click pen. Most pens would sell for $0.40 or more each if you bought them in bulk blank. but these aren&apos;t blank. They have logos, addresses, phone numbers and more from various businesses. They&apos;re misprints and overruns from companies looking to promote themselves. Do we care....NO! because they&apos;re brand new working pens just like we need at home, at the office or at school. * Get 6 lbs. of pens (approx 315 pens in all)
* Each pen is a click pen (none of those crappy pen caps like in the hotels rooms)
* Pens will range in color and size (see picture)
* You will be pleased with the qualityPackaging: 6 pounds of brand new pens with company logos on them in a brown mailer box How to minimize transaction costs/taxes on international private lending. 
 Added on : Monday November 22nd 2010 12:40:02 PM Please be gentle, this is my first post.Looking to borrow US$1M from my parents. The money is currently in Asia under my grandparent&apos;s account. The loan is going to be interest bearing at 5% APR for 30 years. Parents are US citizens, grandparents are not. This is essentially going to be a mortgage (buying investment property).Getting the money here is not a problem, but how do I repay the loan with the minimal amount of taxes/transaction costs?Ideally the &quot;grandparents&quot; will get the payments until they pass on. My parents will then assume the note and for some reason if they pass on before the 30 year period is over, they have stated that the note becomes null since I would inherit the note and would therefore be paying myself.Any tax gurus out there? My concern is if the note passes to my parents, will they be liable for any taxes on the interest income? I believe this may depends on their overall income but with their investment accounts being in Asia as well as the US, I&apos;m not sure how this will shake out for them. Obviously they want to pay minimal taxes on it.If the note eventually finds its way to me, what tax consequences will come with it?Any help will be appreciated! Thanks!

Plus 10.0% Cash Back with FW opinions on living with parents (not out of necessity) 
 Added on : Sunday November 21st 2010 05:40:03 PM hey, this topic has come up in the past... but I wanted to ask people&apos;s opinion on my situation. I moved out of my parent&apos;s house after high school and spent 9 years away in college (through doctorate), visiting on holidays etc. I just moved back to town and am working at a well paying job, but I&apos;ve been living at home. The house is big enough that I have my own space and privacy, and I get along with my family. I&apos;m recovering from a recent relationship breakup and their support has also been amazing.I pay enough rent that combined with interest from investments my parents&apos; mortgage is covered... things are good and I&apos;m also saving a lot of money. The only thing is I feel really silly telling people I live with my parents There is this huge stigma, like those people who have no career/life and people don&apos;t understand. But this isn&apos;t the case -- I can afford to move out whenever I want. While I was born in the US, my parents are asian where tradition is for the child to move out when they get married, so they are actually encouraging me to stay home.But now I&apos;m starting to wonder...am I crazy for living with my parents?? I&apos;m thinking of moving once I am ready to start dating again (could become awkward)...but that would be the only reason. Great webcam for $6.99 
 Added on : Sunday November 21st 2010 01:40:15 AM Amazon has one great webcam for $6.99:LinkPlease note that this is their every day price. The reason I post it is that it is a great deal even though you can get it most days of the year. Regarding to this webcam, it does not require any software installation (plug and play, a big plus). It is simple without any software programs to capture a photo or video. And it does not auto-focus. However, with easy manual focus, its image is amazing. Both my wife and I think it beats of the image of the high-end Logitech webcam pro 9000 we currently have. I cannot comment on its Microphone as we use the one in the laptop. I bought one for my parents-in-law half year ago. It worked so great that I bought a second one for myself last week. Parents Magazine Subscription 3 Years $6 @ Tanga 
 Added on : Saturday November 20th 2010 10:40:20 PM code PARENTSLINK UFC Gym membership deal 2010 Black Friday Special $31.25 a month prepaid 2 years *CA only* 
 Added on : Friday November 19th 2010 02:40:15 PM Hi All, Ive searched the forums and did not find anything on UFC gym membership pricing.
So I went in to do a little negotiation of my own and wanted to share a deal that I got offered if we can get ten to join.The manager I am working with will give us $750 for two years which equals to $31.25 per month with no enrollment and no initiation fee. This pricing is for the ultimate package, with this we get unlimited classes. As an added bonus you get:

Compared to their regular price of $99 per month which equals $1188 per year plus fees no extras included, its a good deal. About the Gym:
There are currently two locations, Concord and Rosemead with a third one opening in Corona.
There are two packages available, Regular (access to gym Fitness classes) and Ultimate which includes MMA class, Muay Thai, Jujitsu basically any classes they offer there. This membership lets you go to any UFC gym.While some may say 24 Hour Fitness has better deals, more locations, etc This deal is for UFC gym. In my opinion the mixed martial arts classes pays for itself. (From what Ive researched, if you do a Jujitsu class, you are looking at a starting price of $50 a month) Another great perk worth mentioning is that you get to watch the UFC fights for free at the gym on fight day. I have been going to this gym on a guest pass and so far this gym is different than any other gym Ive been to. UFC gym is not overcrowded, they have new and unique workout equipment, and they offer a wide selection of classes for both men, women, and children. Inside the facility they also have ARM bar, which is their juice bar; they also have a day care inside just in case you plan on bringing the kiddies along, which is a huge plus for parents such as myself. So PM me if you are interested so we can jump on this. I can also get guest passes so you can check out the gym good until the 26th of this month. PM me for details on that.

What are my chances of getting an amex FR? 
 Added on : Monday November 15th 2010 10:40:03 AM I would really like to apply for the new blue sky card (the one with the annual fee). I know its $75 but they credit your account $100 on airline fees and etc and gives points and all that jazz. However, I&apos;m worried about being FRed. Facts:
1)Med student (24), should be passing out within 2 months. No debt, household income 100k+.
2)Existing AMEX blue card with 24,500 cl, 5 years history. Authorized user on AMEX clear (9k)
3)Other cards like cap1 (1k+5k+5k);schwab (6k); bofa (4k); citi (3k+5k); discover (4k); plus a sprinkling of others that are all sock drawered
4)Credit score of 760
5)no real assets, liquidity of about 5kNow I love my AMEX card, brilliant customer service plus warranty, premium car rental protection, chargeback support (actually side with you instead of merchant) and we all know the rest. Now I&apos;d love to apply for the AMEX but chances are, considering my existing card with high cl, they might FR me. If they look @ my tax return (filing as dependent of parents), they might take away my card altogether which is pretty much unacceptable. I also remember hearing that even if you ask to convert the card, they&apos;ll still do a credit check and all so I might still get FRed. Any comments, suggestions, or advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys! Is purchasing a multi-family house a good idea for a first time home owner? 
 Added on : Sunday November 14th 2010 08:40:04 PM I was debating posting in the rental/investment property thread, but decided to start my own.I&apos;m 27 and currently living with my parents, I moved back in with them almost 3 years ago so I could pay off all of my debt (was stupid in college... had 60k of credit card debt at one point), which I&apos;ve finally done and I&apos;m starting to save up some money. I only have 10k in the bank right now, and depending on how frugal I am I can bank 2-3 grand a month. Living with my parents is great for my financial well being, but that&apos;s about it.. I&apos;m looking to move out and starting to think about purchasing a 4 unit home in the near future (a year max), living in 1 unit and renting out the rest to offset the cost of the mortgage. I&apos;m a very handy person and so is my father who used to be a general contractor, would help out. So the cost of all minor-medium repairs should be parts only.I&apos;m looking in the city area so I think that issues with vacancies may not be a problem, though I assume quality of tenants is going to be more questionable. Would purchasing a multi-family unit be a wise choice for a first time home owner? Is it a reasonable plan? (W/C)ould it work out assuming I find the right property? What else I am not considering?

 Added on : Wednesday November 10th 2010 11:40:03 PM Hi everyone,I been a long time lurker of this forum and have learned much about personal finance but I am seeking advice to my plan to solve my sister&apos;s credit card debt. The family just discovered that she has $30,000.00 in credit card debt; this was a result of poor vision on our part.
Here are the facts:- 26 years old, single
- Works 20 hours a week as a teller
- No college education, aspiring personal banker (40k salary)
- Rents in-law for $600.00 a month
- No car payments (belongs to parents)
- Owns a cute dog
- 632 credit score (CreditKarma)
- Two credit cards with balances (20k+10k=30k)
- Missed 5 payments on one card and 3 on the other card
- 18 credit card accounts, 9 closed and 9 open
- High spending habits
Here is my plan of action:- Move back home to eliminate the $600.00 monthly rent.
- Sell cute dog (I categorize this &quot;asset&quot; as a recurring cost over time.)
- Increase work hours to 50 hours a week from 20 hours a week. Direct her to obtain a full time salary job as a personal banker with the bank she currently works. While she waits, she can work another job to use her time wisely.
- Open a few new credit cards for a few 0% APR balance transfers to save on interest.
- Create and enforce weekly spending budgets.
- Monitor her spending via online accounts.
Questions:
1. She has been contacted by FIA Card Services to help resolve her debt. - Offered a 5 year plan to pay off the debt.
- Details include only charging a 1.7% interest rate (odd) on the $30,000.00 balance.
- My parents will have to co-sign and state that if she does not pay it off completely in 5 years then it will become my parent&apos;s responsibility.
- Monthly payments are only $600.00.Any advice on this company? After a quick Google search, it is a subsidiary of Bank of America. 2. We all hear and see debt consolidation companies, would these companies be a good idea to turn to?
Thank you in advance for the recommendations. Please let me know if I am missing anything that can help my sister resolve her debt. Choosing Health Insurance plan 
 Added on : Tuesday November 09th 2010 12:40:04 PM I&apos;m finally going off my parents plan at age 24 and have no idea what to get. Aside from occasionally going to a clinic, and maybe once or twice annually going to a physician for something serious, I don&apos;t need much medical attention. I see a dermatologist twice a year, but even that isn&apos;t necessary. My parents plan is a very high coverage (which they need), very low deductible, which is great, but they want to drop me since the costs are going up and I&apos;m the only kid left on the plan. I&apos;m a fed employee in MD (Link for Benefits) and there are way too many options for me to even know where to start, and my parents are not helpful. I only barely understand the difference between an HMO and PPO...the rest is gibberish. Any help would be great. Free sample of Advantage Infant Formula Sample.(Walmart)

 Does this exist? Question about an account for minors 
 Added on : Thursday November 04th 2010 02:40:03 PM Is there a type of investment account I can set up for a minor where they can log in to view only? Trying to help get my cousins more interested in financial dealings plus their parents always nag me if I buy them birthday/xmas gifts they won&apos;t care about in a week lol Recently Married - Tax status 
 Added on : Wednesday November 03rd 2010 10:40:03 PM My mother-in-law and I have different opinions on what is appropriate for the 2010 tax year, so I thought I would ask you all here so we can get it sorted out soon.My wife and I both graduated in May from college and got married in August. We were both dependents of our respective parents through college, up until August when we got married and I started a full time job and started supporting both of us. Her mom says that since they supported my wife for more than half of the year, they plan to file with her as a dependent. I believe this would prevent my wife and I from filing a joint return and getting the tax benefits of being married. The way I understand things, though, is that filing status is determined by marriage status as of December 31, 2010. Am I correct in filing a joint return, or is my mother-in-law correct in filing with my wife as a dependent? I tried searching, but my Google-fu is lacking today.Thanks guys! smart or stupid? buying a house with cash with intention of getting mortgage after closing 
 Added on : Monday November 01st 2010 07:40:03 PM Let&apos;s say one has enough cash to purchase a place, but it wouldn&apos;t make financial sense to do so (i.e. would use up most of a person&apos;s cash, wouldn&apos;t get tax benefits....). However, one believes an all cash offer would make one&apos;s offer to the seller much more appealing. Is their a big downside to doing this and then getting a mortgage after the fact (sort of a refinance?) Would it make getting the mortgage easier/harder because one already owns the property in full?The related question would be, let&apos;s say this makes sense, but one doesn&apos;t have enough cash oneself to do it, but one&apos;s parents could help one out to do it. Would it be possible to protect one&apos;s parents interest over oneself, until one got the mortgage to pay them (and oneself in a way), back. without increasing costs so much that such a plan wouldn&apos;t be worthwhile?wondering what people think or pointers they could give me.

http://www.pncgrowupgreat.com/parents_caregivers/happy_healthy.h... OFFICIAL Magazines Giveaway Thread (Magazine Transfers- NO REQUESTS) AND Phone Contact Info for Tons of Magazines 
 Added on : Sunday October 31st 2010 04:40:07 PM I sensed a serious need for this, so here goes. This thread is NOT a request thread- DON&apos;T request magazines- it is to be used as a way of GETTING RID of magazines you don&apos;t want in the spirit of FatWallet. It is also NOT a trading thread- please DON&apos;T ASK for any magazines- this is the Free Stuff forum and everyone should play fair- any trade requests should be done via PM, not as posts. Also, when you have successfully given away your magazine, please edit the post to say GONE and get rid of the excesss words- this way the pages become less cluttered and it&apos;ll be easier to see what mags are available. Thanks and most importantly, HAVE FUN!!!It&apos;s best to transfer subscriptions on the phone, because if you do it online, all the magazines published by that one publisher might get transferred. When you call, specify that you wish to transfer that magazine ONLY. If you do want to transfer it online, BlakBeard&apos;s extensive online list is here: http://www.sjev.net/magazineaddress.htmlBelow are MANY magazines&apos; phone numbers to call to switch addresses- you don&apos;t have to give an email address on the phone (if they ask, say none). When you call, specify that you wish to transfer that magazine ONLY. This is courtesy of me and a google search! If you have any additions, PM me- I will update it constantly.4 Wheel Drive&amp;Sports Utility 800-767-7006

 Added on : Friday October 29th 2010 10:40:04 PM http://www.thebusinessjournal.com/finance/6942-clovis-couple-creates-kardashian-debit-cardKey points:
Once activated, the prepaid card can be funded from a savings or checking account or a cash transfer service such as MoneyGram, and it can be loaded at a physical payment center or via Internet or mobile phone.
Torosian said she partnered with Mobe Inc., a mobile financial services firm that works with major credit card companies, fund handler University National Bank in Minnesota, and payment processor TransCard for the mechanics of the card.
Its all federally regulated banking, Butler said. Were a sales and marketing organization. We dont touch any of the money or anything. Its all secure. As for how many cards the couple hopes to sell, he said: Im not even sure. It could be tens of thousands. We set it up with the printer to automatically print as soon as the cards start to sell.
Torosian said there is no rewards program affiliated with the card Most are very ineffective, she said but discounts will eventually be offered on Kardashian products bought with the card. She said the virtual account linked to the card can store up to $750,000, and companion cards can be set up so parents can transfer funds to their childrens accounts.
Mobile Resource Card will get a percentage of transaction processing fees, and the card has a monthly maintenance fee, Torosian said. Our fees are very attractive, very competitive and very low. And with a prepaid card, there are no overdraft fees. It appeals to the underbanked and the unbanked.
She said one target for card users is 25- to 35-year-olds making $60,000, but she noted that an array of consumers could flock to a product with such photogenic superstars embossed on it.
Im in my 50s, and Im very attracted to them, she said of the Kardashians. understanding HSAs 
 Added on : Friday October 29th 2010 02:40:03 AM So, it is time for reenrollment into all my heath care needs with my company and I&apos;m trying to understand the pros/cons of getting the High Deductible PP with HSA vs. the regular PPO.From what I can tell, it seems the primary difference (as perhaps should be obvious) is that they have different deductible levels.As I&apos;m an individual, the PPO&apos;s in-network annual deductable is 964 while the out of network is 1686. while the High
From what I can tell, it seems the primary difference (as perhaps should be obvious) is that they have different deductible plan doesn&apos;t differentiate between in and out of network and has a flat level of 2079.beyond that, it seems the regular PPO has an out of pocket maximum of 6425 for in network and 11789 for out of network. while the high deductible actually has a lower limit for in network, 5950, and a slightly higher limit for out of network at 12573.beyond this, the company will contribute $500 to the HSA and I can then contribute up to 2550 in addition. Is this basically like a IRA (roth or traditional?) that can also be used to pay for specific medical needs before I&apos;m 65 and eligible for regular distributions?If this money that is put into the HSA is not taxed (like a traditional IRA), I&apos;m unsure how its really worse than a regular PPO. Obviously there&apos;s a higher deductable, (approx $1100), but the company gives you a free $500 for that, bringing the difference down to $600. In addition if I max out the HSA with 2550 and that money is no longer taxed, I&apos;ll have lowered my taxbill by almost $1000 (38% marginal tax rate 28% federal +&gt;10% city/state) and its basically just savings for the future. If I can comfortable max this out without a problem, is there any reason to not take the High deductible PPO w/ HSA?This is all new to me, so any pointers would be appreciated. I grew up with my parents having just standard PPO type plans, so dont really know much about this.thanks Rockettes, Radio City Christmas Show, Nashville, TN - 24 hour sale, $24 tickets (regularly $66)

 Added on : Monday October 25th 2010 03:40:03 PM In a continuation of the last exciting episode of white trash adventures -&gt;The boundaries are now know. GF&apos;s parents own 1 mobile, the &quot;nice&quot; one. Unfortunately, that is all they own. The trailer is flanked by crap mobile and crap sliver.Crap trailer has the water meter and gas hookups. These would be $2000 to put into &quot;nice&quot; mobile. Neighbor owner of crap trailer and sliver have trashy property and are generally pissed off they didn&apos;t get the &quot;nice&quot; trailer. They won&apos;t clean up their property and they likely won&apos;t sell because they think they can muscle GF&apos;s parents into giving them &quot;nice&quot; trailer...&quot;Nice&quot; trailer could be sold for maybe 8k. But moving it would likely infringe on neighbor&apos;s property. This cannot be done without their permission correct?I&apos;m thinking they should pay and have the hookups installed, then rent below market rent in an attempt to make some money. It might increase their leverage to buy out neighbors and at least it will spite them and start some kind of trailer trash inverse one-up-manship &quot;I can out filth you&quot; race. Jesus, I need to get the hell out of the south! Anyway, insights and advice appreciated as well as how you&apos;d handle the situation.

 Added on : Sunday October 24th 2010 01:40:05 PM [Kindle eBook] Chosen Ones by Alister McGrath (Free)
&quot;Chosen Ones&quot; by Alister E. McGrath
(Christian novel) free ebook is available for download on the Kindle, only limited time!Description: World building and character development take a back seat to religious themes in British theologian McGrath&apos;s opener to The Aedyn Chronicles. Teenagers Peter and Julia fall into a glowing pond in their grandparents&apos; garden and find themselves in Aedyna small, former paradise ruled for the past few centuries by a trio of masked tyrants. Hailed by the enslaved populace as chosen ones sent by the Lord of Hosts to throw off the oppressors, Peter and Julia participate in a secret communion ceremony (Why do we eat salted fish on this night of the year and on no other night?) then lead a successful rebellion. Along the way they learn to reject ritualistic temptations to choose personal safety or power over the greater good, and by the time they return to their own world they&apos;ve also learned something about having faithboth in a higher power and in each other. Periodic black-and-white illustrations add a dramatic touch to the story. The perfunctory story line may not linger long with readers, but the clear, simply presented messages of its religious core will. Grades 4-6. --John Peters

 Added on : Thursday October 21st 2010 07:40:03 PM It appears that if the parents can file 1040A, FAFSA skips parents&apos; assets. We have been trying to avoid anything that would require 1040 (e.g. not to sell any stock, which would incur schedule D then 1040). But to my disappointment, I just found merely having an HSA account would make us file the full length 1040 - I have HSA at my employer starting just mid of this year.The FAFSA help page (below) does not say anything about HSA and I heard certain items that force you to file 1040 are exceptions and you still can say &quot;yes&quot; to Were your parents eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ?Any one can help with a little more info? Select Yes if your parents: Filed or will file a 1040 or a foreign tax return but were eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ
Filed a 1040 only to claim Hope or Lifetime Learning credits and but would have otherwise been eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ
Filed a 1040 and were not required to file a tax return
In general, your parents are eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ if they:Make less than $100,000 per year
Do not itemize deductions
Do not receive income from their own business or farm
Do not receive self-employment income or alimony
Are not required to file Schedule D for capital gains
Select No if your parents filed or will file a 1040 and were not eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ.Your parents are not eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ if they:Make $100,000 or more per year
Itemize deductions
Receive income from their own business or farm
Receive self-employment income or alimony
Are required to file Schedule D for capital gains
If your parents do not know if they are eligible to file a 1040A or 1040EZ, select Don&apos;t Know. GameStop 25% off Accesories today only: PS3 Move $37.49 plus $25 AMEX PASS Bonus

 Added on : Monday October 18th 2010 01:40:02 PM Hi guys,I live in NJ.
I currently own a 380k on a house that is worth (hopefully) 400k (based off &quot;soft&quot; appraisels). It is a Freddie Mac loan. My rate is 5.375.
I am also borrowing 85k from parents to add two bedrooms and a bathroom, which should add at least 100k to appraised value. This work will take at least 6 months. The plan is to pay them back once I have enough equity in my home to borrow against.Assuming my LTV is 95/5, should I refinance now using Federal programs that will allow for a low LTV?
I do want to pay back my inlaws with another Refi/cash-out after the work is completed.Two options:
1) Refi now, and refi again in 6 months.
Considerations that I&apos;ve thought of:
a) closing costs x2 - though I can get zero closing costs for higher rate for the first.
b) ???Should I wait it out and refi only once?
a) Not sure how the 417k number is going to affect me. At that point, my house will be worth at least 500k (crossing my fingers here)If you guys have any helpful advice or other considerations that I should think about please let me know.I&apos;ve looked at my budget carefully, and I can afford this work.Thanks in advance! Seeking Advice on Commercial Mortgage Foreclosure Consequences 
 Added on : Sunday October 17th 2010 01:40:03 AM Hey guys, I&apos;m having a hard time figuring out what the consequences of a commercial mortgage foreclosure are. I&apos;ve done a bit of reading about foreclosures in general, but everything I&apos;ve seen thus far has been about primary residences, rather than commercial properties. Internet searches generally turn up spam or junk and haven&apos;t been particularly fruitful thus far, so I&apos;m hoping that asking people directly might be more useful.Context:
My parents recently informed me that they were defaulting on the commercial property that they had bought in Tennessee in several years ago. The space has room for 4 tenants, but only one of those slots has been occupied for a while, and they&apos;ve had no luck finding more tenants. In addition to that, my father&apos;s been unemployed for the last 20 months or so, so their rainy day funds are drying up. The property itself has some problems with the roofing (and possibly the foundation) which would cost additional expense to repair. All in all, the property&apos;s been a big headache and a financial drain to them, so they&apos;ve just sent notice to the company that they&apos;re defaulting on payments. At first, I was mostly concerned because this property represented a significant amount of their nest egg. Now I&apos;m just worried that they haven&apos;t thought through the implications of foreclosure, but I personally don&apos;t know what a foreclosure here could mean. My parents claim that this is a commercial mortgage, so commercial foreclosure shouldn&apos;t affect their personal credit history too much (they will not be declaring bankruptcy). They also claim that they would not be responsible for the entire balance of the loan, that they would actually only be responsible for just the difference between the balance and what the bank sells the property. (My dad further maintains that this amount is so small that most of the time banks will not pursue the defaulters).My questions to you all:
1. Do you see any other options besides defaulting? They already put it up as &quot;For Lease or Sale&quot;, but no bites. They applied for a loan modification, but declined when they found that the process was super slow and felt that the language of the documents was too heavily in the bank&apos;s favor.
2. What will the bank pursue my parents for? The entire balance of the loan? The difference between foreclosed sale price and the balance? Nothing?
3. Will this affect their personal line of credit? How? (I suppose this is dependent on #2)
4. How long can they keep collecting rent from their remaining tenant?
5. What is the worst-case scenario? Am I missing anything beyond bank pursual of the entire loan balance?Bonus Question:
They live in CA, but since the property is in TN, so they have a property management company handle the day-to-day. The other day, the property management company sent them a text claiming that someone had ripped off the utility meters at the property and pulled out some of the copper wire. The local utility company called and said they needed an electrician ASAP. After 2.5 hours, the management company sent another text that the electrician fixed the problem. That was all the contact they provided. The management company now claims the repair cost almost $5000. The quote is so high that my parents think they&apos;re being scammed. Anyone have thoughts on whether this is reasonable, and if not, what we can do to dispute it? Renting house in AZ that&apos;s going up for foreclosure. Have questions. 
 Added on : Saturday October 16th 2010 05:40:02 PM My parents and I have been renting a house in Arizona for over a year on a month to month basis. 5 or 6 months ago, we get notified that the house was going up on short sale. Since then, there has only been one offer on the house which was turned down. Last weeek, the bank / whoever, sent another broker over to take pictures / second opinion and we also learned of a possible 2nd offer by the listing agent. Today, we receive a certified letter in the mail indicating that the property is undergoing foreclosure and that a sale at auction may or may not occur on 1/12/2011. My parents and I have done some research online but still have alot of questions which I hope can be answered here.
1. What happens to our security deposit. Is it gone or do we ask for it back?
2. Do we still make rent payments. If so, to whom?
3. Do we need change the keys on the house (don&apos;t know if landlord has a key / gave one to someone. Not even a lock box on the house.)
4. What happens after we received the foreclosure notice. When might we expect to have be out? 90 days after sale? Will we receive evication notice?
5. Cash for keys?
6. Should we leave the sign up in the yard. Has agents name and number, nothing more. *Expired* &quot;Family Fun&quot; Magazine Subscription $3.69/yr @ BestDealMagazine.com (Deal of the Day for 10/15/2010)

 Added on : Thursday October 14th 2010 12:40:01 PM I have been searching for awhile now and I thought maybe someone on here would have an idea of where to go next..We are planning on holding a family reunion next August 2011. We will have family coming from all over the US, Canada, and France. We used to hold our reunion in Quebec at a lake side community where you would rent a cottage for a flat fee for a week or weekend. That location closed and we ended up at Sherkston in Ontario in &apos;05. Our family didn&apos;t like it there.We are looking for a location while keeping the following in mind:-large enough to hold about 70 ppl
-we prefer to have each family pay a flat fee rather than a per person per night fee (ex-rent a 4room house for the week rather than pay for each person in that house separately)
-on a lake with access to swimming (lake and indoor/outdoor pool), canoeing etc.. (not necessarily motorized)
-either a place on site to hold a large, more formal dinner or a restaurant nearby we can negotiate with
-if we are renting rooms (hotel style) there will have to be LARGE, comfortable, common areas which we can kind of take over..
-most families have kids in college/late 20s and their parents. We don&apos;t need specific kids entertainment.
-there are quite a few elderly family members who will be in attendance. They will just want to be with everyone.. again, we will need a large common area.
-within about 1.5hrs of Montreal or Toronto (people will be flying in)-also, I want to make it as affordable as possible...

 Added on : Monday October 11th 2010 11:40:03 PM So my parents applied for a loan modification through the loan investor, Impac Lending, via Excel Mortgage Servicing (also owned by Impac Company). They had to pay $3k in upfront fees. Impac agreed to modify the loan terms by lowering the interest rate for five years. The modification was processed through their loan servicer, BofA.During this (long and agonizing) loan mod process, BofA sold the house to Deutsche Bank. Within two months of this sale, my parents received several (i think three) notices to vacate the property. When my parents inquired about the issue, Impac told them that hey still own the loan and that the house was not sold. Also, during this time, they received new loan modification documents from BofA.Ultimately, my parents got sued by DB with an Illegal Detainer lawsuit. Impac gave them the same advice when they asked. So my parents hired a real estate attorney. Their lawyer told them the lawsuit was legitimate, and that they can probably stay longer at the house (for the rest of the month - about 15 days) if he can negotiate a deal with DB. No one from DB showed up to sign the agreement, so their lawyer told them DB has technically agreed since they didn&apos;t show up, and that they can stay in the house til the end of month. The agreement was for my parents to vacate the property by the end of the month.
You can probably imagine how hard it was to move everything to a storage, the cleanup, and looking for a place to rent.Now, just after a week of moving out, my parents received a call from their lawyer saying that BofA messed up and that they can move back to the house. He also asked them if they want to go ahead and sign the new loan modification documents.I&apos;ve told them not to contact their lawyer, not to sign any docs, and not verbally agree with him. I told them to start looking for a new attorney.
So can they sue for damages? If so, who can be sued here? kidkraft nantucket toddler bed $48.88 (free shipping) -sold out 7 hrs later-

 Added on : Saturday October 09th 2010 08:40:14 PM This deal got red a while back during the online sale. Since then a $300 Sony trade-in program has come to light, and the Microsoft Store has thrown in a 3-year extended service plan w/ accidental damage protection. It is sold out online, but still available at B&amp;M;Microsoft Stores (Scottsdale, AZ; Mission Viejo, CA; San Diego, CA; Lone Tree, CO) for $1499 + tax out the door ($1949.99 list price).Please note that this deal is not for you if:
You don&apos;t care about performance
Your laptop only sits on your desk and you don&apos;t care about weight
You don&apos;t care about screen quality
You don&apos;t care about warranties with accidental damage protection
If you don&apos;t care about the above things, please don&apos;t thread-crap and ruin it for those of us who do care and have been looking for a deal on them. I&apos;ve been looking for a lightweight portable replacement for my desktop (I&apos;m moving my data to an NAS) with a screen good enough for photo editing on the road, and the 3D oomph for the occasional game. $1500 wasn&apos;t enough to make me pull the trigger, but with $300 for a trade-in and the 3-year full service plan, I jumped on it. Basically, this is the best laptop in the ultralight class by quite some margin (it weighs the same as a Macbook Air), and the feature list puts even most larger laptops to shame.Laptop details here.

The trade-in program is here and will give you $300 for a wide variety of functional laptops, including 1.6+ Ghz Core 2 Duos, 1.8+ GHz Core Duos, and 2+ Ghz older processors. I&apos;m giving my parents my old laptop, and sending in their laptop (which we bought for $350 AR) for the trade-in. If you don&apos;t have one, you should be able to pick one up from eBay for a lot less than $300. They give less for lesser laptops, but don&apos;t say how much less.The extended service plan from the Microsoft covers accidental damage and normally costs $329 (in fact, the price on the receipt is broken down as $1170 for the laptop, $329 for the service plan). None of the paperwork says how many years it covers, but I called the store and was told they only have a 3-year extended service plan. The regular Sony warranty is 1 year.I&apos;ve heard you can get an extra 10% discount with student ID. But since I&apos;m not a student, I can&apos;t verify this.$1499 + tax out the door

My financial situation, when will I be ready to purchase a home? 
 Added on : Friday October 08th 2010 12:40:03 PM Purchasing my own property is a big goal of mine and for my parents. I want to purchase a home soon that they can live in.
A couple of points: I will be splitting the monthly mortgage in half with my sibling. 40k will be used as down payment on the home (this amount is from my parents)We have a specific city that we&apos;re looking into. Thinking definitely long-term in this city so I&apos;m willing to make the investment. My salary is 74k
I contribute 6% to 401k and max out Roth IRA.
My take home is roughly 4,100
My debt is currently 13k for my car and 20k for student loans. I am looking at a 2bd condo type house that is roughly around 350k. Any thoughts on my readiness to purchase a home?
I am targeting middle to late 2011. Stock Buyback question (PUK) 
 Added on : Friday October 08th 2010 11:40:03 AM My folks have a small amount of Prudential (PUK) stock, and they keep getting harangued by Prudential to sell it back to them. The company authorized a big buyback in 2008.I don&apos;t really understand this, I get that companies authorize these buybacks when they feel a stock is undervalued, but why are they bothering individual small investors personally? Isn&apos;t there enough PUK being traded on the open market?The stock has performed pretty well since 2008, and see no specific reason for my parents to sell now. Can someone explain this?

 Added on : Friday October 08th 2010 08:40:14 AM I&apos;ve been asked by a lot of parents lately what parental control software I recommend. Without a doubt - Norton Online Family. The parental controls are amazing, and the software is very intuitive. No software will lock out the bad stuff 100%, but Norton has done a good job making it easy for parents to watch their kids&apos; online habits.I have nephews that have no boundaries. When I gave them their computer, I put this software on it, and any time they do something questionable, I call and let them know I&apos;m watching. Over time, the questionable behavior has stopped. I did this after I caught one 8-year-old nephew searching for &quot;girls gone wild.&quot; Additionally, I can temporarily disable their accounts whenever they do something wrong.Rumors suggest that Norton will likely integrate this software with their Norton product line soon, so now&apos;s the time to sign up (while it&apos;s free). No amount of software can compare to a parent who is actively monitoring their child online, but this software helps whenever you can&apos;t be there. 20% off diapers code for amazon.com (stackable) - Parents Magazine (November 2010)

Non-conventional IRA - real estate, precious metals, etc 
 Added on : Wednesday October 06th 2010 01:40:03 PM has anyone invested in a non-conventional ira? how has your ira performed? i know the risks but here is why i&apos;m looking into it.in 2000, my wife and i had a combined $1 million in our traditional equities based ira accts, thanks to my daytrading skills and dot.com stocks. i seriously thought about transferring $500k to buying a home in manhattan beach, ca with a real estate ira, and receive $3k+ monthly rent to go back into the real estate ira any pay the ira custodian fee, property taxes and maintenance. unfortunately, i kept our ira in stocks and by 2002 or so the accts dropped to about $350k. (fwiw, that 3 br manhattan home is worth over $1 mil today and the monthly rent is&gt;$4k/mo.....oh well.)today our accts are up to $800k again, mostly because of $10-20k annual contributions to our 401(k) accts, which we then rolled over to self-directed iras when we left our jobs. i also had a few &quot;home run&quot; stocks in our iras during the past decade which helped our portfolios.well, i honestly realize that most of our gains have been due to my &quot;luck&quot; in stock picking, but i don&apos;t want to watch my stock portfolios as much and i&apos;m getting stressed by the volatility of the markets.i&apos;m thinking of transferring $100-350k into a real estate ira, but i live in socal and even in today&apos;s depressed real estate market that amount doesn&apos;t buy much so i&apos;m also starting to look out of the area, but don&apos;t know enough about other real estate markets. i already own real estate investments in socal so i want to diversify by owning outside the area.fwiw, i&apos;ve been investing in the stock market for about 30 yrs, and have owned socal real estate for about 25 yrs and the amount of equity in our real estate holdings exceed our stock holdings. if i had never sold some of my earlier stock holdings i would be retired by now, but like most investors i panicked and sold too early. i actually bought 4 shrs of berkshire hathaway &quot;A&quot; shares back in 1985 when it was about $2,500/shr, and i was still living at home with my parents. i panicked in the 1987 october &quot;black monday&quot; crash and also because the wsj said the shrs were overpriced, and sold at no gain and didn&apos;t get back into the market for a while. today those 4 shrs are worth about $500k. i learned about warren buffet and berkshire hathaway from reading the wsj, but it was also the wsj that caused me to panic and sell!from experience, buying and holding stocks, or trading stocks is not easy to stomach. i&apos;m sure there will be more market crashes (black monday, flash crashes, etc.,) that&apos;s why i&apos;m looking to diversify our iras. anyone else interested in looking into non-conventional iras? i missed the precious metals boom but real estate is still depressed so i&apos;m more interested in real estate iras. Long Term Capital Gains Arbitrage 
 Added on : Sunday October 03rd 2010 10:40:02 PM Question for the FWFers. I have done my own research, and I do have an accounting degree. That being said, I&apos;m not a seasoned tax veteran, and would like advice on this particular transaction.I graduated this May, and have been working since July. Because of this, I will only be in the 15% tax bracket. I live in a state that does not have state income tax. For those who were unaware, the Long Term Capital Gains tax for my bracket is 0% for 2010. My question is this:Are there any ramifications that I&apos;m missing when I say that my grandparents could gift me ~$26,000 in securities ($13,000 each, the maximum before the gift tax comes into play), I can sell them and realize the gains at my 0% tax rate (as long as I don&apos;t bring my income up into the 25% bracket) in December 2010, and then gift the proceeds back in January 2011 (of course, avoid the wash sale rule), thereby avoiding any tax on capital gains?I would appreciate any advice and I hope that this can potentially present an opportunity to others in my situation .

 Added on : Tuesday September 28th 2010 02:40:02 PM My GF&apos;s parents inherited a dilapidated property with 1 mobile home on it maybe 2.Anyway the city sent notice that the lawn must be cut or outrageous fines will be due. The only power meter is on the mobile that is maybe on the property, yet the power company insists there is a meter on the property. This seems like strong evidence that both mobiles are on the property. We need that power turned on to clean up the place.The neighbors are of zero help.I know they could hire a surveyor, but the whole thing has been a tremendous hassle and they don&apos;t want to spend any more money on the POS. The questionable mobile is probably not up to code and will need to be removed at owner&apos;s expense.Any tips on how we could easily find out without large delays and expense?___

How much car insurance coverage do I need? 
 Added on : Thursday September 23rd 2010 09:40:04 PM Stats: 24 y/o male, 35k/yr income, car worth 10k (owe 7k), 8k in bank accounts, no other assets.
Two years ago I purchased my first car and broke away from my parents coverage, and started paying on my own. My premium has gone up from $1440/year to $1850 to now $1974/yr (in 6 month installments). These have been the cheapest rates I could find at the time, from scouring multiple companies. I&apos;ve never had an accident, claim, ticket, break in coverage since I was first licensed or any other type of violation. In 2009 I was told &quot;MD insurance costs from the state went up&quot; and therefore as the consumer I had to absorb it. I&apos;m sick of this crap...I don&apos;t even drive some ridiculously sporty car (2007 Honda Accord).Anyway, I probably could lower my rates my lowering my coverage, which is something I&apos;d like to do, but have no idea what levels of coverage somebody in my status needs. My parents have always had relative high amounts of coverage, and therefore I do to... I don&apos;t have assets, so why would I need such high coverage? Any help would be appreciated. My current coverage levels are as follows...Bodily: 100k/300k
Property: 100k
Medical Payments: 5k/person
Uninsured Motorists Bodily: 100k
Uninsured Motorists Property: 100k
PIP: 2,500
Both Deductibles: 500 each
Towing/labor: $75 each (isnt AAA prob cheaper?)
Rental limits: $40/day, $1200 maxRight away I assume I can afford to get rid of towing and rentals, but Id prefer to not change the deductibles. Anyway, all help is greatly accepted. Thanks FWF!P.S. I realize my rates will drop in April once I&apos;m 25, but I still have 6.5 months between now and then. Family Reading Night Planning Kit

 Added on : Monday September 20th 2010 02:40:03 PM About Me
I just graduated college in August. I have the following student loans: Total of $34000, and estimated monthly payments of $375 (Still in 6 month grace period) TYPE Original Balance % Interest Accrued
A) Subs. stafford $4500 6.8% $0
B) Subs. stafford $4500 6.0% $0
C) Subs. stafford $5500 5.6% $0

F) Unsub. stafford $2000 6.8% $218.74
G) Unsub. stafford $2000 6.8% $86.75 I also have a nest egg of cash saved up(sitting in a money market account earning next to nothing) of approximately $9000My budget is as follows: (Total monthly of $1855)
Student Loans $375
Car insurance $40
Health/Dental $120
Gas $300
Auto repairs $100
Netflix $20
Food $250
Entertainment $200
Rent/Utilities $450My paycheck monthly is $2532.57 (after 5% 401k contribution; employer does 2% automatic vesting and 3% graduated)My plan
I am very thankful to have parents willing to help me out in terms of student loans. They will be paying off loan A, which will drop my payment down to $325. Furthermore I was considering using some of my nest egg and paying off loans F and G , dropping my payment down to $275 a month which I am more comfortable with in the event I go back to school/ lose job/ incur financial distress. Is this a sound idea? I know I can invest the $ and earn a higher yield than my interest rate, but the thought of lower payments sounds nice to me. I also want to invest more into my retirement. I am unsure if I should attempt to open a IRA as well or what other avenues I have to build wealth. Ideas? What to do with hidden money? 
 Added on : Saturday September 18th 2010 09:40:03 PM A very close friend of mine always contacts me for advice on purchasing things and financial questions, even though I&apos;m not much a financial guru. He called me about an hour ago to tell me his mother let him in on a very close secret, that he wasn&apos;t supposed to share with anyone, but felt the need to take action to help her out. Apparently she has almost $100k hidden in her basement in a large fireproof safe that no one knows about, not even her husband! She knows that if only she has access to it that it will always be there and doesn&apos;t want to chance her husband wanting to spend it. His parents are close to retirement age (mid 60&apos;s) and I guess his mother doesn&apos;t want the government to know how much money they have, otherwise she would have it in a hidden savings accout or CD. They have two homes, both worth about $200k, one of which they&apos;re getting ready to sell and move to the other for retirement. He said she was worried that once Medicare kicked in that having a large sum of money in the bank would hurt them and they would be charged a lot more than someone else that appears poor to the government. I don&apos;t know what she plans on doing after selling one of their homes as far as hiding it, but I think $300k in the basement isn&apos;t the best plan of action. His father will have a decent pension when he retires, but that&apos;s not always guaranteed. I don&apos;t know if they have any other savings.So, I&apos;m turning to you guys to shoot some ideas as to what I should tell him to convince his mother to do. I can&apos;t see how having visible assets in the bank or other financial accounts of $300k could hinder someone with Medicare but maybe she&apos;s right? I mean, at least put it into some kind of guaranteed return that will keep up with inflation, or close to it.

 Added on : Sunday September 12th 2010 10:40:03 PM I came across a house for sale in the town my parents live in today and almost cannot pass the purchase up. It is a house(1120 sq ft) as well as another &quot;house&quot; on the lot 800 sq ft, that had been stripped inside. The electrical is all gone, plumbing gone, holes in drywall etc, but this town has been hit like so many others lately with economy issues and I think we can make a profit from these and possibly live in one, but I wanted to get the FW communities input first. The house sits on .15 acres 6600 sq feet so could that essentially be split?? into two separate dwellings? Also the seller is out of state, but willing to meet to go through the purchasing process, but I need to know what I should watch out for? What the good and bad aspects of what can happen would be. Lot cost is roughly $2000. Free Museum Admission - San Francisco Only - Grandparents free today (Sunday) at the San Francisco Zoo!

VALID FROM September 1-19, 2010 Housing Idea --- Looking for feedback 
 Added on : Thursday September 09th 2010 04:40:03 AM Hello all,
Im a avid reader of these forums, but have never posted. This will be my first post. The time may show as early, as I am writing from Afghanistan. I am an Army Ranger medic, currently on my 5th deployment. This is all relative, because I return in several months, and I will be exiting the service shortly after Xmas, after serving 6.5 years. I plan on returning to college (Didn&apos;t have the discipline or appreciation for education out of high school) and pursuing my degree in economics and international finance. Fortunately, I&apos;ve always had a knack for personal finance, so I&apos;ve saved up a good amount for &apos;college&apos;, and I&apos;m always looking for ways to stretch my dollar.
I am from the Washington DC metro area, in Virginia. For those of you that know the area, it is somewhat expensive, and hasn&apos;t been too damaged by the declining housing market. I have enough for a 20%+ down payment, but I would like to continue to rent and save up capital until things calm down. I did look for housing before this deployment, but I knew that once the 8k tax credit expired, that homes had to drop at least --- well, $8k. To me, that just feels like common sense. To sweeten the deal, since I was deployed in 2009 as well, my $8k tax credit was extended 1 year, so I can still use it until June 2011. That means I could theoretically take advantage of a $16k difference. However, I am also aware that if Im making bold decisions on a half a million dollar asset, all because of a $16k (peanuts in comparison to 500k) perk (that I am not/was not a supporter of), that perhaps I should slow my roll. So slow my roll I am doing.
I am married, and my wife works. She makes decent income. I secured an apartment before I deployed (stationed in GA, but will return to the Virginia area when I exit the service) in Virginia, and she currently lives there, and I moved all our furniture up there. The apartment is not in a bad area, but not in an upclass area either. For my GI Bill benefits, I am granted 100% tuition, plus a housing stipend per month. That stipend is given at the average cost of housing for the zipcode in which the university is in. That puts me at a stipend of about $1900/month. That is awesome, and covers my current apartment there now. Along with my savings, and my wife working, there is plenty of financial cushion. I like that. However, as I said earlier, I would like to stretch my dollar as far as it goes, and I am also all about family... so here is my idea.
I don&apos;t want to buy just yet, but I dont want to throw my money down the drain with rent. My parents had 6 kids, and all are now adults and have all moved out of my parents home. My parents also live in the area. They are, as you may guess, baby boomers, and they are looking to downsize to a smaller home. The home they have now is not too large, but a decent 3Kish SQ foot home. My father still works, but is getting a bit too old to upkeep such a house/yard, etc. It&apos;s a beautiful home, just needs some updating and TLC. He mentioned to me about selling, and I came up with this plan. I&apos;m not exactly asking for a handout from him, but I would definitely receive the advantage of this deal (Also why I&apos;m posting this, to look for any add-on ideas, feedback, etc.)
In my idea, I would basically rent their home from them. They would be my landlord. In turn, they can (and they do have the means) to purchase the smaller home to live in. I could even help them move, as I would be fresh out of the military and take care of any odds and ends for them before I start school/work. My rent, in turn, would basically be their entire mortgage (PITI - principal, interest, tax, insurance). The perk for them is, they can still deduct interest on their taxes, and a perk for me is that the amount of principal in the mortgage amount can purchase me a &apos;stake&apos; in the total value of the home. Almost like purchasing stock in the home. Granted, my father and I would have to come to terms to a set value for the home. For the sake of an example, we will say 500k. If the mortgage-PITI was $2500/month, and the principal was 1000 of that. For 1 month, I would then own a .2% stake in the house. So in the future, if the house were to increase in value, my .2% would get me more than $1k back, but if it were to drop, I would get less than my $1k... Either way, I&apos;d get something back, opposed to just throwing rent money to a stranger. This is sort of a &apos;keeping it in the family&apos; type ordeal. Other things I would do include renovating the home, and doing the upkeep to keep it in good shape. Costs of renovation could either be provided entirely by my father, or we could share it. Honestly, I think he would provide the funds entirely, and wouldnt even ask to increase the before mentioned &apos;set value&apos; of the home. However, I&apos;d be more than willing to cover a pro-rated amount of the upgrade in lieu of how much of a &apos;stake&apos; on the home I had, if you can follow that. The break down is this. I could continue to rent an apartment at say 1500 month, and just tuck away $1000 that I would not be spending to pay the mortgage of a larger house, so I can gain capital... Or I can spend 2500+ on housing, and probably see that $1k per month later on down the road. They both equal to about spending $1500, the difference would be a 2br apartment, and a 5br single family home, nice neighborhood. (I do have 1 daughter). I also would be putting money into my fathers home, which has about 7 years left on the mortgage. I suppose another option is I could use all or some of my &apos;down payment&apos; money to put towards paying off his mortgage, thus getting me more principal per month... (Just an idea, this is the type of stuff I&apos;m looking from all you guys) If the house were to sell later, I could use my stake as a down payment for our own house, or just continue saving it. I dont like the market (I think houses are waaay overpriced up there). Or, if my father would like to keep the house, and use it as an investment property, he can rent it out to people, and use it for income in retirement. (He could &apos;buy&apos; my shares of stock back if he wishes, or we could share the income, or I could maybe buy more &apos;stock&apos; from him). So, in a nutshell (if you want to call this monster post that), that is my housing idea. I would like it because it keeps money in the family, it provides a nice safe enviroment for my family, and I would enjoy doing home improvement projects which would help out my parents, etc.So, if you&apos;ve made it reading this far, I would like to hear any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may have on this idea. For this particular case, no one in my family is really &apos;strained&apos; by the present economy. I could manage just fine renting on my own. My parents are more than willing to &apos;help&apos;, and are not trying to make money or anything else. So, all the terms are pretty loose. If my dad said I could get $1 of ownership in the house for every $2 of principal I put in, that is fine too. I feel good just putting my dollars towards my family rather than a stranger. I&apos;ll rent no matter what.
Of course, I have no idea about the legal aspect of this whole thing, or who claims what or tax form x,y,z, etc... But Im sure that can all get figured out with any professionals on here, or friends I may have in the industry, or through family contacts (sister is an attorney, etc.). Either way, my folks and I both will not &apos;sweat the small stuff&apos;. Thanks again everyone! =) Looking forward to your feedback.JoeAlso, I&apos;ve been brushing up on my high school academics through KhanAcademy.org in preparation for college --- If you have school age (middle/high school/college aged) children, and they need some tutoring (or you want to relearn what you forgot from school), it is a great resource. It&apos;s free, and its ran by a man named Sal Khan. He got his MBA from Harvard, and has made about 1600+ videos on topics covering anything from math, to history, to economics, to &quot;Buying vs. Renting&quot;... It&apos;s worth checking out. My daughter stinks at math, so I bought a cable to display my laptop on the tv, and we can go over certain math areas together in the living room on the big screen when I get home.

The lack of a comprehensive resource for materials specifically targeted towards children with ASD was the launching pad for our business. Our mission here at Different Roads to Learning is to help children and their families get the most out of their home and center based programs.Different Roads to Learning now carries over 500 products carefully selected to support the Autism Community. On our site, youll find everything from basic flashcards, books and timers to advanced social skills tools to support you at every step of your program.We understand and embrace the unique needs of every child on the spectrum and strive to enable parents and professionals to help our children grow to their full potential.

 Added on : Monday August 30th 2010 10:40:02 AM Hey friendsWe are looking if anyone here can help us find a cheaper deal than we have.
We have, my husband and I with his parents (4 adults) for 2 nights (Fri and Sat, Sept 17 thro 19) in Niagara falls, NY.
The best deal we were able to find is: 2 separate rooms for a total of $480 in a 3 star hotel or a 2 separate bed suite for about $350. We are leaning toward the later obviously because we are tight pressed for money but am hoping to seek help here to see if anyone can tweak this price a little bit. We are driving our own car and will save on the rental (hopefully!).Thank you all! Renting a car (would this be allowed?) Trying to save some money 
 Added on : Friday August 27th 2010 06:40:01 PM Going to see some family around Thanksgiving (Wed 11/24 thru Mon 11/29.) The rental car prices at the airport are extremely high. Around $256 for the 5-6 days that I need.I found an Enterprise rental location near my parents house. They have a weekend special for $9.99/day for Friday 11AM thru Monday 11AM. Comes out to $33 for an economy car. So I booked that (can always cancel it if need be.)Then, I had an idea to look at the same location for a rental for Wed 10:30 AM thru Fri 10:30 AM. It would be roughly $82 with a coupon I have.So it would be a total of roughly $115 vs $256 at the airport.Do you think Enterprise would let me do this? Let me rent a car at one rate, return it, then get the same car for the weekend special rate? FREE SIGN LANGUAGE COURSE - American Sign Language University

Or for just the parents if they already started Housing Fades as a Means to Build Wealth 
 Added on : Monday August 23rd 2010 01:40:03 AM Housing Fades as a Means to Build WealthHousing will eventually recover from its great swoon. But many real estate experts now believe that home ownership will never again yield rewards like those enjoyed in the second half of the 20th century, when houses not only provided shelter but also a plump nest egg.The wealth generated by housing in those decades, particularly on the coasts, did more than assure the owners a comfortable retirement. It powered the economy, paying for the education of children and grandchildren, keeping the cruise ships and golf courses full and the restaurants humming.More than likely, that era is gone for good.There is no iron law that real estate must appreciate, said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the real estate site Zillow. All those theories advanced during the boom about why housing is special that more people are choosing to spend more on housing, that more people are moving to the coasts, that we were running out of usable land didnt hold up.Instead, Mr. Humphries and other economists say, housing values will only keep up with inflation. A home will return the money an owner puts in each month, but will not multiply the investment.Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that it will take 20 years to recoup the $6 trillion of housing wealth that has been lost since 2005. After adjusting for inflation, values will never catch up.People shouldnt look at a home as a way to make money because it wont, Mr. Baker said.If the long term is grim, the short term is grimmer. Housing experts are bracing themselves for Tuesday, when the sales figures for July will be released. The data is expected to show a drop of as much as 20 percent from last year.The supply of homes sitting on the market might rise to as much as 12 months, about twice the level of a healthy market. That would push down prices as all those sellers compete to secure a buyer, adding to a slide that has already chopped off as much as 30 percent in home values.Set against this dismal present and a bleak future, buying a home is a willful act of optimism. That explains why Adam and Allison Lyons are waiting to close on a $417,500 house in Deerfield, Ill.Were trying not to think too far ahead, said Ms. Lyons, 35, an information technology manager.The couples first venture into real estate came in 2003 when they bought a condo in a 17-unit building under construction in Chicago. By the time they moved in two years later, it was already worth $50,000 more than they had paid. We were thinking, great! said Mr. Lyons, 34.That quick appreciation started them on the same track as their parents, who watched the value of their houses ascend for decades. The real estate crash interrupted that pleasant dream. The couple cannot sell their condo. Unwillingly, they are becoming landlords.I dont think were ever going to see the prosperity our parents did, but I dont think its all doom and gloom either, said Mr. Lyons, a manager at I.B.M. At some point, you just have to say what the heck and go for it.Other buyers have grand and even grander expectations.In an annual survey conducted by the economists Robert J. Shiller and Karl E. Case, hundreds of new owners in four communities Alameda County near San Francisco, Boston, Orange County south of Los Angeles, and Milwaukee once again said they believed prices would rise about 10 percent a year for the next decade.With minor swings in sentiment, the latest results reflect what new buyers always seem to feel. At the booms peak in 2005, they said prices would go up. When the market was sliding in 2008, they still said prices would go up.People think its a law of nature, said Mr. Shiller, who teaches at Yale.For the first half of the 20th century, he said, expectations followed the opposite path. Houses were seen the way cars are now: as a consumer durable that the buyer eventually used up.The notion of housing as an investment first began to blossom after World War II, when the nesting urges of returning soldiers created a construction boom. Demand was stoked as their bumper crop of children grew up and bought places of their own. The inflation of the 1970s, which increased the value of hard assets, and liberal tax policies both helped make housing a good bet. So did the long decline in mortgage rates from the early 1980s.Despite all these tailwinds, prices rose modestly for much of the period. Real home prices increased 1.1 percent a year after inflation, according to Mr. Shillers research.By the late 1990s, however, the rate was 4 percent a year. Happy homeowners were taking about $100 billion a year out of their houses, which paid for a lot of good times.The experience we had from the late 1970s to the late 1990s was an aberration, said Barry Ritholtz of the equity research firm Fusion IQ. People shouldnt be holding their breath waiting for it to happen again.Not everyone views the notion of real appreciation in real estate as a lost cause.Bob Walters, chief economist of the online mortgage firm Quicken, acknowledges that the recent collapse will create a mind scar just as the Great Depression did. But he argues that housing remains unique.You have to live somewhere, he said. In three or four years, people will resume a normal course, and home values will continue to increase.All homes are different, and some neighborhoods and regions will rebound more quickly. On the other hand, areas where there was intense overbuilding, like Arizona, will be extremely slow to show any sign of renewal.Its entirely likely that markets like Arizona will not recover even in the 15- to 20-year time frame, said Mr. Humphries of Zillow. The demand doesnt exist.Owners in those foreclosure-plagued areas consider themselves lucky if they are still solvent. But that does not prevent the occasional regret that a life-changing sum of money was so briefly within their grasp.Robert Austin, a Phoenix lawyer, paid $200,000 for his home in 2000. Five years later, his neighbors listed a similar home for $500,000.Freedom beckoned. I thought, when my daughter gets out of school, I can sell the house and buy a boat and sail around the world, said Mr. Austin, 56.His home is now worth about what he paid for it. As for that cruise, it may be a while, Mr. Austin said. Showing the hopefulness that is apparently innate to homeowners, he added: But I wont rule it out forever.

 Added on : Wednesday August 18th 2010 09:40:02 PM So here&apos;s my situation... I graduated with a BS Engineering degree in May 2009, and have been working for the federal government since graduation. I am now at a point where I want to try something completely new and different in a completely new and different role, city, position, etc. I am not 100% sold on leaving yet, but if I can find the right opportunity, I would take it. If I don&apos;t find something new and exciting, I am still OK with staying in my current position. I don&apos;t want to go the route that I have seen my parents go, which is to stay with the same company until they get fired/laid off/etc, and then be SOL and end up looking for a job later on. I&apos;d like to stay with the government (great benefits), which isn&apos;t really a big issue as there are thousands of government jobs out there. However, I am hesitant to post my resume and apply to a bunch of positions (especially ones in a related field to the one I am currently in) on usajobs.gov as there is a good chance that someone I currently work with/for will stumble across my resume or get wind of my job search and take it the wrong way. Any advice here? I don&apos;t want to go to my boss and tell him I am looking for a new job, because I am still happy where I am, but I would like a new opportunity. On the other hand, I don&apos;t want him to find out without my telling him directly. Private Loan Consolidation? 
 Added on : Wednesday August 18th 2010 03:40:03 PM Hello there, everyone!I have three private loans with Iowa Student Loan. Here&apos;s the current principal loan amounts and current IRs:$4,772.40 - 4.630%
$5,684.15 - 4.630%
$9,707.42 - 3.130%
-----------
$20,163.97My first question is, should I even consider private loan consolidation? I have already decided to consolidate my federal loans that equal about $22,000 into a graduated repayment plan. My current credit rating is 747, and I do not think my parents will consider co-signing my consolidation because they didn&apos;t do that for my school loans, and don&apos;t want to be liable (completely understandable considering their current situation). My second question is, according to FinAid.org, there are four different private loan consolidation lenders: http://www.finaid.org/loans/privateconsolidation.phtmlHere is the text from that page at the bottom:
Chase Private Consolidation Loan -- $7,500 minimum. $150,000 cumulative borrowing limit. No fees. 30 year repayment term. Interest rates of one-month LIBOR + 6.0% to one-month LIBOR + 11%. 0.50% interest rate reduction with a creditworthy consigner.

 Found out I have absolutely no credit, advice on getting started 
 Added on : Monday August 16th 2010 11:40:02 PM So, after a couple hours of trying to get my free credit reports, receiving error messages, calling the agencies themselves, and inquiring it seems that I have absolutely no credit history. I am 21 years old. I lived on my own for a year before I was forced to move back into my parents house to save money for my newborn daughter and rent (my previous roommates were laid off together and seeing as how we were on one lease I loaned them several grand in rent, keeping a detailed itemized report and payment record that they signed, and have been slowly collecting it back from them as they get paychecks at new jobs). I paid all utility and rent checks on time the year that we had our home and I had assumed that that would be favorable to my credit history. However it seems that it only affects your credit if it goes to collections. I bought my car with cash and don&apos;t have my own phone bill (family plan) so I have no credit. My parents have credit scores in the high 700s (I believe around 780). I have amassed about $5000 in cash since I moved back in with my parents.What would you recommend I do to get started building my credit from ground zero? I had originally planned to get 3 credit cards and utilize them to about 10% each month before paying in full. My current monthly expenses are about $400. However seeing as I have no credit history I am not sure if I would be denied. I don&apos;t mind doing a secured card if needed. My parents are willing to make me a co-borrower (is that the correct term?) on their card so that I may inherit their history as well. I was already planning on getting an account with a credit union as it will give us a discount on our phone bill (10%). I *could* get my own phone bill and have those bills being paid monthly, if they report to a credit agency that is (I have no idea), but unless it will pose a significant gain credit wise I would prefer to stay on my parents family plan as it a 7 year old plan and I can pay them for my usage and it costs about half as much as paying Sprint directly for my own line.What ways can I leverage my money to build my credit other than a secured card?Also, after talking to a CSR with Equifax she informed me that my DOB and phone number were not on my account and that I would have to mail a cover letter with all of my current information and various proof of identity to get it updated. Has anyone encountered this before? She gave me an address for a &apos;CSC Credit Services&apos; office near my home to send it to. Anyone know anything about this? I would really like to get more info before mailing a copy of my social security card anywhere!Sorry if this doesn&apos;t merit it&apos;s own thread but I couldn&apos;t find any good threads via search on other people with a complete lack of credit, plus there were multiple questions I needed answered. I am trying to build my credit for some real estate investments that I would ideally like to begin within the next 18 months (pending stable financial means). I would like to see if I can get my credit score above 760 before then. Student Loan Repayment Help 
 Added on : Saturday August 14th 2010 08:40:03 PM Hello everyone! I am back not so soon after my last thread to ask another question. This has to do with student loan repayment and consolidation. Recently, the government has been sending me more and more email about getting a leg up on this while I am still in my grace period (which I feel is way too damn short for us students, but hey, I don&apos;t write the laws around here).So, my current situation is this: I am 22-year old currently working for a small business for a consultant out of her home. I will soon be signing a contract where I would be earning a cut of her paid site that is currently being implemented (with a lot of my help as a Marketing graduate) to help sell a lot of her items she sells including a couple new textbooks she has coming out next month. The thing is, all I have been getting is a monthly paycheck (rather on the small side) but that looks to grow, and she is also really adamant about getting me on some sort of full-time salary as soon as possible, and that means also helping me get medical insurance and a 401(K) plan in place, but that won&apos;t happen for a while (I am hoping by the middle of next year). Lately she has been getting many, many offers from people who want her to speak and do keynotes for their events (she&apos;s even heading to Dubai in November). She&apos;s about ready to really hit it big, but I am not expecting to see any real returns for that until, again, maybe next year. I currently live at home with my parents after having graduated from college in May, and do not have a car or any other sort of liabilities like that. My credit card is paid off, so I am &quot;debt free&quot; until the end of November when these payments begin. I am still being claimed as a dependent on my parents&apos; taxes, and my parents are currently caring for my twin brother who has Aspergers. I have around $22,125 in Direct student loans -- $18,125 is Direct Subsidized, $4,000 in Unsubsidized, along with $4,000 in a Perkins loan. If I consolidate these loans, the interest rate would be 6.303 fixed. I also have $20,164 in private student loans (two of them have a 4.63% variable interest rate, and one has a 3.13% interest rate). There are 4 different repayment plans I can decide on: Standard, Graduated, Income Contingent Repayment (which I am leaning towards, and Income-Based Repayment. I currently do not have any other funds besides that amount I have in my bank account (under $1000) and the money I have invested into Ford stock (which currently sits at $150). I am really open minded, and would love to hear any suggestions you guys may have on what I can do in this situation. You guys have been really great to me so far, so I feel I can trust you guys in giving me some real quality advice. I would really appreciate the tips. Thanks! Looking for options to force agent to fork over deposit 
 Added on : Friday August 13th 2010 04:40:04 PM A few years ago my parents were selling their house and they got a buyer who put a deposit in escrow with the agent. I think it was the buyer&apos;s agent but I&apos;m not 100% sure of this.In any case the buyer got cold feet and for some strange reason decided not to show up to settlement. A few months after that the agent asked my folks to release the deposit and they basically said &quot;hell no&quot;. A few weeks ago they got a certified letter saying that unless the agent heard from them in 10 days they would release the deposit to the prospective buyer. Once again my folks said &quot;hell no&quot;.Any advice on how to get that agent to send that pile of cash over? Preferably without having to incur too many fees in the process -- but something is better than nothing. Looking for advice in helping my parents keeping their house 
 Added on : Friday August 13th 2010 01:40:02 PM Hi everyone, I have a question about mortgage and ways to help out my parents. So the situation is that my parents have a mortgage, but recently my father&apos;s workplace shut down because they can&apos;t keep up anymore. Over the years they (my parents) have saved up some money but it&apos;s not enough to pay off the principal amount and if this drags on, they will have trouble keeping up with the mortgage payment. So I was thinking of using my savings to help them pay off the principal amount. My question is, how do I do this without incurring anymore tax for them?Thanks, As a tipped employee, should I have my parents get pre-approved for a mortgage, buy the house, then sign it over to me?? 
 Added on : Friday August 13th 2010 12:40:03 AM Hello all, this is my first thread! I have been lurking here for months though. I have an important mortgage question...
I am a single guy, 25, no children, in the market for a home. I have been bartending for 4 years and the money is great. I usually make 700 bucks a week working full time (I live in Michigan) however I am only taxed at the rate of what is on my pay stubs (7.75/hr). The problems: At the taxable rate of minimum wage or close to, I would be approved for 35,000$ tops, even with excellent credit (I do). Having never claimed any of my tips at the end of every 2 weeks or even at income tax time leaves me with this problem of getting a mortgage.I am looking at houses in the 100K range. There are a lot of great deals around this area. I also have 25K to put down, however, it is only semi-liquid (in an investment that is not a bank.)2 possible solutions:1. Should I ask my employer to up my pay to 17/hr and I reimburse him the 9.25/hr for every hour I work (+ matching his extra taxes.)?? I figure I make this anyways, but this way, it is &quot;proven&quot;. After 60 days, I should get pre-approved for 100K and after which time, I go back to my normal rate.2. Should I try to get my parents who are both working (for a bit longer) and who gross 65K/year attempt to get a mortgage, they get approved, they buy the house, then after a couple months sign it over to me for 1$. 
I don&apos;t need to be reminded how I got myself into this mess because I didn&apos;t claim all/any of my tips lol, but in all seriousness, I did speak to a mortgage planner at my bank and did not seem thrilled to engage with me (plus I know he was stereotyping me) etc. What route should I take?

 Added on : Thursday August 05th 2010 05:40:02 PM I don&apos;t know if I should ask these questions here or in the Travel category.My husband and I are planning on taking our twin girls and my parents to Washington DC and Williamsburg VA in mid-Octobor. We will fly to Washington, then rent a car to drive to Williamsburg, then fly back home from Williamsburg. The twins will be 5 months by then. We know we need to rent a car when we are at Williamsburg. But how about in Washington DC? We talked about it, but not sure about what to do. With babies this little, is it realistic to depend on subway and our feet? I assume we can&apos;t take a cab because there will be no carseats in the cab. But if we do rent a car, how difficult it will be driving around in Washington- touring, finding parking places, etc...I love finding deals, but have never rented a car. Can anybody point a direction on finding car renting deals too?Thank you so much for your help! Helping elderly mother with money problems 
 Added on : Monday August 02nd 2010 06:40:05 PM Sorry I know this post is a bit disorganized but I&apos;m stressed out and trying to quickly work on this problem. I really could use some help to point me in the right direction. Here&apos;s the deal.My mom (widowed) is in a bad financial situation. She lives alone in a fairly small house.Her home is currently valued at $210k-$240k.
No savings or other assets except a fairly large undeveloped property in Texas. It generates a small variable income (averaging $300/month) from contracts with an oil company to mine natural gas. I have no idea what this property is worth as it bought several generations ago.
She owns a car outright but it has little value.One home equity loan of $45k at 8.5%
One home equity line of credit (now fully tapped out) of $175k at 2.5%. (Do the math. She now has approx zero equity in the home.)
Credit Card balances totaling $16k with each one between 25% and 30% APR (ouch).Monthly income (SS, tiny pension, part time job, Texas contract) is about $1300.
Monthly expenses (home equity, min credit card payments, insurance, utilities, grocery, eating out, etc.) are $3500 approximately. My mom is not especially frugal and is not likely to change.She&apos;s currently not late on any house payments but sometimes pays credit cards late (ouch again).My wife and I live about 4 hours away. My mom kept her financial dealings very private until this week when she dropped the bombshell that she has run out of money. She has now allowed me to know everything and I&apos;m scared. She&apos;s 75 and is beginning to have trouble keeping the house clean and the lawn mowed. We visit about once every month and feel that we&apos;re working much of the weekend getting the house back in shape. However, my Mom desperately wants to stay in the house. Also, she won&apos;t even consider selling the Texas property. She says it&apos;s in a &quot;trust&quot; but I haven&apos;t found any paperwork on this yet.My sister lives less than 1 hour away from her and she is very handy at fixing things, so she is a tremendous help to our Mom. She is married (no kids) and I know she has been giving Mom money (a few thousand so far). My sister has some money and a good income, and thinks she may be able to keep up with Mom&apos;s monthly shortfall. She made the arguments that she&apos;ll be able to get this money back from the &quot;estate&quot; once Mom dies, but I am doubtful this plan will end well.I have one kid in college and three more headed that way soon. In other words, I can&apos;t spend real money on Mom as it will be a huge financial struggle to get these kids through college. I must fulfill that obligation to make it possible for them to get a degree.I know we can help cut her expenses some as her cable bill, internet bill, cell phone and house phone bill are all ridiculously high. But as you can see from above, it won&apos;t help enough. It feels like I&apos;m fixing tiny leaks in the Titanic and ignoring the huge holes.What do you guys recommend? We&apos;ve thought about bankruptcy for her but we have no idea how to even start looking into this. Medicaid, too?We&apos;ve thought about having her alternate living with us and my sister for about 3 months at a time. Honestly this will be tough for all parties involved but we&apos;ll do it if we have to.Some type of elder housing where she can interact with other people the same age would be ideal. She&apos;s not very social anymore and does get lonely.For those of you reading this that have non-wealthy parents living alone: Learn from my mistakes and sit them down now to find out what&apos;s going on with their finances.Thanks everyone.

Tax Question on Dependent Parents 
 Added on : Friday July 30th 2010 11:40:06 AM My dad recently passed away earlier this year. My brother took care of him and paid for at least half or more of his expenses. My dad had a job and his own apartment. He also was not aware of filling out a W-4 properly so the max was take out of his pay check each pay period. My question is can my brother go back and claim him as a dependent and get any refunds owed. My father was very ill during this time as well with no medical insurance and the medical bills are a large part of what my brother paid for along with clothing, food, etc plus all the time involved in caring for a sick parent. My dad did pay his own rent on his apartment. At the same time my dad did not file his taxes over the last few years either. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. We are looking to use the money to help pay for the funeral expenses that are now sitting on a credit card since my dad had no insurance or nothing set up. He was 52 years old if that matters any.

 Added on : Tuesday July 27th 2010 06:40:02 PM This is on behalf of my parents. We purchased an extended warranty for a 2002 Honda Accord at the time of purchase of the vehicle. The terms were, that if you don&apos;t use the warranty, then you get your warranty purchase price back. We&apos;ll admit, we couldn&apos;t find this warranty certificate for a while, but now we have. The warranty period expired on 6/1/2008. We submitted a claim to an address. The dealer itself has now been sold to another entity, which further complicates the matter.The &apos;old dealer&apos; has a PO Box which they can be reached by. I&apos;m attaching a copy of the warranty certificate, as well as the dealer response upon request for a refund. Things to note:
A) We are 2 years after the warranty expiration in requesting this refund, but there&apos;s no time limit for requesting the limit as dictated on the warranty certificate.
B) We have furnished documentation from our Firestone which shows the mileage on the car at the time of warranty expiration met the minimum requirement of qualification #2
C) Qualification #3 was crossed out and initialed by the selling person at time of sale. However, as you&apos;ll see in the dealer&apos;s response, this is still marked as a reason the refund cannot be issued. This is in Illinois. We now all know that this was a stupid move on our part to buy this.Questions to the FWF:
1) Do we have a valid claim. Or how big of a problem is it that we&apos;re requesting the refund this late.
2) Is it worth suing them in Small Claims Court (Cook County, Illinois). The value of the refund is $864. Filing fee I believe is $50 - $100.
3) Any other thoughts on how (if possible) get this money back. Right now, all correspondence is via a PO Box -- no phone #, nothing. Thanks. P&apos;kolino Children&apos;s Desk (Orange) for $38.87 shipped at Amazon

 Added on : Monday July 26th 2010 03:40:02 PM Can&apos;t think of a better thread title off hand.My mom, crazy as she is, wants to get this whole life insurance plan for the baby ($50k):https://www.gerberlife.com/gl/planassistant.do?errorPath=/guide_...I&apos;ve outright told her (in nicer words) &quot;look -- our life insurance policy already comes with $10k for the kid, and it&apos;s not like if the baby dies, we&apos;re going to be missing his income to the family. If you want to help towards education, we&apos;re going to be setting up a 529 and you can contribute to that if you like -- this looks like a waste of $.&quot;she wrote back saying she&apos;d do that too, but she also wanted to do this since he could &apos;borrow against it when he gets older&apos;....I guess what I&apos;m asking here is: is that plan as horrible of a decision as I&apos;m making it out to be, and are there any other recommended ways to allow her to help other than a 529?(baby is due Thursday! wooo -- scheduled c-section)Thanks! Roommate can&apos;t pay but has assets to cover if liquidated, how to separate our ways? 
 Added on : Sunday July 25th 2010 02:40:02 PM Hi thereFor some reason I feel like I&apos;ll get flamed and get all the reds. Anyways, I&apos;m renting my parents&apos; 4 bedroom house and living with 3 other roommates. I&apos;m paying the rent to my parents automatically on 15th and collecting the rent a little more flexibly from my roommates. After all, they are all in tight budget with student jobs and may not be getting paid at that week etc. One of my roommates is having financial problems and have been having issues paying on time and in full amount. He has not paid utilities for May, and nothing for June and July. When he was first having issues we talked and he said his business is not doing fine and has been applying for jobs and not getting any replies back. He duplicates CDs for local bands for them the sell in their bar/event concerts and apparently nobody is buying CDs anymore so the bands are not ordering for new copies... Now with 1k rent he owes, I just don&apos;t think he&apos;s going to be able to do it... It&apos;s just getting piled higher and deeper... He&apos;s been living in his mom&apos;s house in a different city 2 hours away for the last month and a half to cut his living costs. He has a contract till the end of August but I will just have to send an eviction notice. Now the thing is: I like this guy; he&apos;s been a good friend for the whole year we&apos;ve been living together. I&apos;m definitely in better condition financially than all my roommates and can even take a 1k loss (but I just don&apos;t want to... He was not THAT good of a friend)... He&apos;s got a racing bike in the garage that I know is quite expensive. You can literally lift the whole bike with 1 finger. Is there any legal way of taking a non liquid item as collateral while giving him a very long extra time to pay, and evictim him? What kind of an agreement should I make? I am thinking about offering to keep the bike at my parents house for 6 months for him to pay the total amount he owes. Not necessarily to make monthly payments but pay the whole amount by 6 months. If there is any amount left (like 1 or 2 hundred) I can keep it for another month or two till he pays. After all I&apos;m not trying to rip him off, or try to make more money off of him like charging interest or liability insurance in case something happens to bike. (Or maybe I can do that insurance, after all it&apos;s an expensive bike and I wouldn&apos;t want to pay for it if something happens to it while it&apos;s at my parents&apos;). So what do you guys think is the best way to end our roommateship without ending the friendship and taking any financial losses?Thanks for your helpTosPS: About thanksgiving of last year, when a new roommate with a new job came in, he was not getting paid for 3 weeks, and still not enough to cover for deposit + rent. He had a PS3 which i took as deposit and locked it in my room till he closed the amount... So it was a practice I have done before and the rest of the roommates (including him) all saw and agreed was a reasonable move. How to balance guilt w/irresponsible family members? 
 Added on : Friday July 23rd 2010 11:40:02 AM OK, here goes, and I&apos;ll try to keep it short&amp;sweet. I realize we could just say no, and I know money problems aren&apos;t solved w/money, but I&apos;m hoping for some clever&amp;creative ways to minimze the drain on our savings, since the perception is that we have &quot;deeper pockets&quot;.Us - DINKS, plus several investment properties that are slowly turning a monthly positive, albeit very sporadically. It&apos;s a long term investment, that much we know. Also recently relocated to TX from NY, dealing with the first year expenses of getting a new home established. Both employed, but hubby&apos;s time at his current employer is limited - we expect him to be downsized within a year, and then he wants to do a career change, so our income will go down significantly. We are actively preparing for that now.His Parents - Unhappily married, but can&apos;t afford to live apart or divorce. Still living in grandma&apos;s basement, paying almost no rent. She works in NYC and makes about $40K, and commutes via super expensive express bus; handles her depression issues with a wicked Home Shopping Network habit. He&apos;s been unemployed (AGAIN!), for the past 2 years; his car is in shambles, and he&apos;s got significant credit card/IRS debt from the past. They order a lot of take out and think that&apos;s better than going out to eat. Had no qualms about throwing an expensive birthday party for her 60th this past November, even though they had to finance it. Their 401K&apos;s are under $20K apiece. No savings. Coming to visit in a month, which means they&apos;ll be evaluating their safety net, which is what they think we are.My Mom - mentally gone, but still quite young, we had to fly her down to TX to put her in assisting living, as my (older) sister was in the habit of drugging her or dropping her off at the hospital when she wanted a weekend to party w/friends. She is thriving here, great facility, at about 75% less cost than something comparable in NY. We are currently draining through her assets at about $6K/mo, and I am painfully aware that she could live in this state for another 20 years, so I&apos;m tryng to mitigate the burn rate as much as possible. Selling her house at this point does not make sense - modifications needed to make it saleable, and the area has taken a hit, but should bounce back - plus she has enough cash to last for about 2 years before we&apos;d need to cross that bridge. Medicaid planning was done, but not in time for the lookback period.My sister - lives at home, also been unemployed for about the past 1.5 years. Has no comprehension of the real world. Just landed a temp to perm job in NYC this week, lets hope it sticks. Lots of small expenditures, doesn&apos;t get that it all adds up, fast. I&apos;ve gotten her to agree to move into the smaller basement apartment at the house, in exchange for paying taxes, utils, insurance, etc on the property, and I expect to rent the main house for about $3K/mo, but she is moving slowly, as usual - nail appointments and hangouts get in the way of selling all of Mom&apos;s stuff so we can rent out the main house. I arranged for one auction liquidator to come in and help, but he said we didn&apos;t have enough stuff to make it worth his while. Financially, my sister has about $50K in 401K, and had about $20K in cash savings, but I suspect that &quot;boyfriend&quot; is using a charity event to drain her of some cash - every time I see a post on Facebook about some event for the charity, I notice a few grand being pulled from savings. She inadvertently gave me online access to view her acct (one of my Mom&apos;s savings accts is under the same login), so I&apos;ve been watching, but can&apos;t say anything, or else she&apos;ll pull my access.Any ideas on how to mitigate the financial messes that are brewing here? Hubby&amp;I work really hard and make sacrifices to get where we are, and it pisses me off that we might have to step in and solve problems caused by their financial stupidity! Any creative advice would be appreciated - I really don&apos;t want all these people moving in w/us at some point in the future! Financial gift for newborn (some family complications) 
 Added on : Thursday July 22nd 2010 07:40:02 PM So I am now an uncle. Anyways I would like to give the kid something financial that will grow with time and hopefully get them interested in financial things. I was thinking that DRIP stock that hit the front page might be a good idea. I also would like to give something for a future college fund ideally in a way that would be tax free (I got screwed on taxes for savings bonds because my grandparents did them wrong).But there are some complications. The aunt is going to be a single mother. The guy broke up with her when he heard she was pregnant. It seems likely that the aunt will end up on wealfare or disability (Just stating facts... I don&apos;t agree with her decisions). The guy makes decent money so child support is possible, but my aunt does not want him to have anything to do with the kid. I suspect however she will end up getting child support from him.Anyways to summarize I am looking for suggestions on what to give the kid financial that can grow and be more something to get her interested in finances in a low dollar amount ($500 max) that while I would like it to stay with the child I wouldn&apos;t be heartbroken if that didn&apos;t end up happening and it would be low enough dollar amount not to have significant impact on any aid. Also what to give in the way of future college savings that hopefully can&apos;t be spent or taken into account for the mother&apos;s income/assets that would hurt her if she ends up getting public assistance or child support. Dollar amount will probably only be a few thousand over a good many years though we shall see I am very big on college and kids getting the chance so I if I end up with significant assets there is a chance it would be more, but at the present super complicated schemes are probably not worth the time/effort and if I ended up giving significant amounts I would do more research. I would like to know that the kid gets the money even if it is a small dollar amount and it doesn&apos;t just result in a reduction somewhere else leaving no net benefit. $35 for $115 Worth of Personalized Keepsake Books from Photobook America

Completed in 5 to 7 days LAS VEGAS Grandview 1-Bedroom Suite $54/night with flight purchase 
 Added on : Wednesday July 21st 2010 11:40:13 PM I&apos;ve never posted before but I&apos;ve gained so much useful information here that I thought I&apos;d pass this along. Hotels.com&amp;Expedia have Grandview at Las Vegas 1-bedroom suites at a considerable discount when you purchase a flight&amp;hotel package. Not sure if it is something they usually offer, but my Grandview room worked out to only $54.03/night (taxes&amp;fees included) on top of my flight cost. The rooms are currently on a 72-hour sale for $100/night if just booking a hotel room and are $129 on the Grandview website. The biggest drawback is that the property is a few miles from The Strip (across from South Point), but we have small children so it is actually a plus for us. It is also a time share, but my parents have stayed there, loved it, and were not asked about doing a presentation or anything of that nature. Is Grandma still renting her phone? Surprising number of older adults are being overcharged for basic services. 
 Added on : Wednesday July 21st 2010 02:40:02 AM You would think it would be common knowledge that phone rates have changed over time. You think people would know not to lease a phone anymore. Sadly, some older adults are overpaying phone companies for basic services. AT&amp;T;and other phone companies may not be eager to tell older adults or set them up on a plan with reasonable rates. We just had a case where an older gentleman was still renting a phone for $7 a month for as many years as he could remember. His family realized what was happening and purchased him a phone, canceling the lease that AT&amp;T;was only too happy to keep extending year after year. Some older adults are being charged the highest rates for phone service, up to 40 cents per minute or more. Talk to your neighbors, your grandparents, friends, and family. Help them know what options they have with landlines and/or cell phones. It&apos;s shocking how many people (tend to be older) are still renting phones and have very high priced calling plans.This example is older (from 2006) but proves my pointhttp://blogs.computerworld.com/node/3538Help the older people in your life understand newer phone plans and practices. If they are on an older plan or renting a phone, please assist them in getting a phone and obtaining a reasonable rate for calls. Question: Buying a new car outside of the resident state 
 Added on : Friday July 16th 2010 11:40:03 PM Hello All!I hope the finance forum is the right place to post this question.My parents are visiting us here in Texas; they reside in Arizona. What do I need to be aware of in terms of tax, license, registration, etc if they decide to buy the car here in Texas and then drive back to Arizona?Thanks! Help set up a cruise, please? / Does cashing discover rewards for cruise stuff make sense? 
 Added on : Wednesday July 14th 2010 09:40:02 AM My parents just turned 55 and are also having a wedding anniversary soon and we&apos;d love to give them a gift of a first cruise (probably to Mexico as they live in Oregon and wouldn&apos;t want to fly too far). I have a lot of discover card points and I know you can cash those in for the princess cruise and carnival or something, but is that actually economical? Is it pretty much always better to just book at lastminutecruises or something of the sort?Any help (and suggestions on best/cheapest time to go) would be GREATLY appreciated.Thank you. 2 free confidential mental health counseling / therapy programs (conducted online) by Australian National University

MoodGYM is an innovative, interactive web program designed to prevent depression. It consists of five modules, an interactive game, anxiety and depression assessments, downloadable relaxation audio, a workbook and feedback assessment. Using flashed diagrams and online exercises, MoodGYM teaches the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy a proven treatment for depression. It also demonstrates the relationship between thoughts and emotions, and works through dealing with stress and relationship break-ups, as well as teaching relaxation and meditation techniques.Who is behind MoodGYM?
MoodGYM was designed and developed by staff at the Centre for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University, in collaboration with other researchers, mental health experts, web and graphic designers, and software engineers. Why was MoodGYM created?
Depression affects one in five Australians at some point in their life, and about 121 million people worldwide. Although immunisation and other preventative measures are widespread in many areas of medicine, there is little recognition for the need of protecting mental health. With this in mind, MoodGYM was developed as a training program to help prevent depression in young people. Making it available over the Internet seemed to be the most practical way of reaching the broader community. Since its launch in 2004, MoodGYM has received several IT and health awards, and has over 200 000 registered users worldwide.Will MoodGYM help me?
There is evidence that MoodGYM is helpful for its users. Scientific trials evaluating MoodGYM have shown that the using two or more modules is linked to significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms. The trials also found that these benefits still last after 12 months. Although MoodGYM may reduce depression in some people, the Centre for Mental Health Research and its staff make no claims that MoodGYM will be helpful for every individual.Does using MoodGYM mean that I don&apos;t need to see a doctor?

 Added on : Wednesday July 14th 2010 12:40:07 AM Forgive me if I missed a post from the past which goes over this &quot;basic&quot; information, but I searched and didn&apos;t come up with anything which seemed to fit what I was looking for. Part of that problem is likely because I&apos;m not fully sure what to search for. My parents are by no means well to do, so I wasn&apos;t really brought up and given this type of financial information.I&apos;ve been employed for a few years now and just recently got married. I&apos;ve finally relinquished all of my outstanding debts from college with the exception of a small amount of student loans. My wife owns a home with an affordable mortgage. Other than this we have no debts. I moved to her area after we got married, and have recently accepted employment in the area. I received quite a fair salary -- only taking a small pay cut after moving from a major metro area.I want to ensure that our long term plan is laid out to build a strong financial foundation for the two of us for many years to come. Our mortgage will come out to about 11.5% of our net income once I begin working -- this net amount includes full 401k funding for both of us for the year.
I&apos;ve discussed with her about fully funding a Roth IRA as well, which she is open too. We should have a decent amount of cash left over each month with which to save / invest -- we budgeted in travel and savings, but our &quot;rainy day&quot; fund in this scenario was still too high imho. Combined we already have a strong emergency fund -- due to the low cost of living here, we should be able to live a year on savings. Most people would state not to aggressively pay off the mortgage due to the tax savings -- I would normally agree with this, but the problem is the standard deduction is much much higher for us as a married couple than we pay in interest on the mortgage in a year. We already participate in a rewards checking account and I am doing my best to get her to utilize reward credit cards once our debit transactions have been posted, thankfully she is coming around.My question is what are our next steps? It seems that in most of the advice posts the following steps are frequently stated:1) Fund emergency fund
2) Fully contribute to Roth
3) Fully contribute to 401kI ask because it seems that we have taken these beginning steps people normally take when beginning to save, but I guess I need some pointers for what to do next. We have no kids, nor do we plan on having them for a few years, at which point we would begin the 529 plan (our state also has a lottery scholarship).Note: With her current job we receive free local hospitalization. 20% off diapers code for amazon.com (stackable) - Parents Magazine (August 2010)

First time home buying advice - San Diego 
 Added on : Monday July 12th 2010 12:40:02 PM Hey Fatwallet, need some advice.I have a general home buying question. Me and my soon to be Fiance (got the ring and everything, just looking for the right time) are ready to move out of our parents homes. Jointly we have about $10,000, 2 cars and other minimal assets. We have been looking into renting; however, we noticed many homes around San Diego under $100,000. We realized that some monthly mortgage payments would be low enough that we could afford them.We were under the impression that we could perhaps cosign for a loan with one of our parents.
Background on our parents: Both of our parents are homeowners; my parents actually own 3 (1 we live in, 1 home we rent out, and 1 condominium).Background on us: Im 1 month shy of 21 and shes 24. We did a credit check that showed we have a credit score in the 780s.
We would like to know what our options are in terms of buying a home. We are aware that there are many programs for first-time homeowners and we would like to be better informed before making any final decision. If this is a bad place to ask and someone knows where we should ask instead, please let me know.Thanks,

This Deal Has Expired 100K cash deposit, will it be suspicious? 
 Added on : Monday July 05th 2010 10:40:02 AM Being extremely old-fashioned (and paranoid of banks and any investment vehicles), my parents have been squirreling away cash for the better part of 30+ years. Before you start harping on how foolish and naive they have been and how they&apos;ve been losing value on that money, trust me, I have already been down that road with them before to no avail. Anyway, that&apos;s not what this post is about. The reason for this posting is that my wife and I are considering buying a house possibly in the next 10-12 months. As such, my parents have indicated that they would be interested in footing 20% of the purchase price (in additions to whatever sum we would put down - probably 10-15% on our part for a total of 30-35%) to avoid PMI, etc. The central issue here is that the 20% from my parents would be least $100K (if not slightly more). The problem is that sum from them will be $100K+ in cash. Obviously, we&apos;re not going to be able to fund the home purchase with cash (it would need to be in the form of an electronic payment/check). Therefore, the question is, how do we put that $100K+ into our bank account without incurring suspicions of illegal activities or special notices from the IRS, fraud, etc. on both of us and our accounts (i.e. mine and my parents)? Should my parents just start putting in smaller cash deposits into my account now on a regular basis? If so, how much should these deposits be?

 Added on : Saturday July 03rd 2010 03:40:02 AM Hi, Recently found out about FWF, but in that short time I have really fallen in love with it.
Some of the math in action I see here is amazing.
I&apos;m 22, a recent college graduate with a stable, but low paying job. I have almost no expenses (live with parents).
I just starting to get into investing and was hoping to get some input on a Roth IRA I plan to open in the near future.Today I opened up a ShareBuilder Individual account to take advantage of the independence day deal.
They have 2 pricing models, Basic and Advantage ($12 Monthly Fee)For Tuesday Only/Automated Investment Transactions (The only kind I plan to use) the per trade cost comes out to:Basic
Buy: $4
Sell: $9.95 (Real-time Sell)Advantage ($12 Monthly Fee)
Buy: First 12 Included With Monthly Fee, Then $1 Each
Sell: $7.95 (Real-time Sell)For the Advantage Plan, they give you the first month free, and who am I to turn down 12 free trades, I signed up.I plan to open up my first Roth IRA sometime this winter. I want to minimize the fees in the account as much as possible. I don&apos;t mind paying a bit more in commission if it can be paid for outside the account (doesn&apos;t effect my $5000 contribution limit), but most of the brokerages I&apos;ve seen just add commission to the cost of the trade.When reviewing the Advantage plan terms I see that I can pay the monthly fees with a credit card.I don&apos;t plan to actively trade in the IRA, and also plan to buy and hold until retirement.
I also plan to stick 100% of it in high dividend value stock. (For now anyways)
I&apos;m fine with performing 12 buy transactions/year, all at once.Considering those facts is the following plan doable?
Sign up for a Roth IRA @ ShareBuilder using the advantage pricing model.
Deposit the Contribution limit of $5000.
Perform 12 Purchases utilizing 100% of the $5000 contribution limit.
Pay the $12 Monthly Fee (On My 2% Card )
Revert to the basic pricing model immediately afterward and Repeat Once a Year.
This comes out to be 11.76 in commisions/year, but more importantly the fees are not taken from the account.I have also researched Zecco&apos;s Roth assuming you have at least $25,000 in equity you can have 10 trades/month commission free with a $30 Annual Fee. (Not Sure if it is taken out from the account itself)
And I&apos;ve heard good things about BoA offering 30 free trades/month if you have 25,000 in checking/savings/CDs, but I&apos;m not sure if this applies to Roth IRA&apos;s.In both cases at the moment I don&apos;t have $25,000, though I plan to fully contribute each year so in 5 years moving over might be an option.So I guess I&apos;m asking for some feedback and criticism on the plan.
And am I being crazy to think that paying commissions outside the account is worthwhile?Thanks! Graduate sues father for college tuition and wins 
 Added on : Friday July 02nd 2010 05:40:08 PM Link
Really makes my generation look bad. I know it was a legal document but come on, this is very selfish. 
Arguing over money is nothing new for most families, especially when recent college graduates with massive student loans start looking to their parents for economic assistance in today&apos;s tough job market. And things can get tense when parents try to decide how much of that debt they&apos;re willing to help out with.Dana didn&apos;t take a lawsuit against her own father based on a mere promise, howevershe had a legal document to back her up.When Howard and Deborah Soderberg divorced in 2004, Howarda property developeragreed to pay for the education of their three children.Apparently Dana foresaw that his word wouldn&apos;t be enough. In 2005, she convinced her father to sign a written contract that would require him to pay for her college tuition until she turned 25, as well as cover related expenses such as textbooks and car insurance. For her part, she agreed to apply for student loans that her father would cover if she received them.But Howard stopped paying her tuition just before her senior year, forcing Dana to take out a $20,000 student loan (co-signed by her mother). After graduating as an art major, Dana filed a breach of contract lawsuit against her father with the aid of family attorney Renee C. Berman.Representing himself in court, Howard contended that his daughter nullified their contract first when shesupposedlydidn&apos;t try hard enough to apply for student loans. He even filed a counterclaim alleging that she dropped a few classes and kept the money for herself. In Dana&apos;s defense, Berman pointed out that Dana was forced to drop some courses due to the continued tardiness of her father&apos;s tuition payments.&quot;They just don&apos;t have a relationship,&quot; Berman said about Dana and Howard. &quot;It has to be weak to begin with if you enter into that agreement.&quot;Berman also noted how unperturbed Dana&apos;s dad seemed throughout the trial. &quot;Here his daughter&apos;s bringing him to court and there&apos;s no sadness, no remorse that his daughter was in this situation having to sue him.&quot;After two-day trial, the judge ruled that Dana had indeed fulfilled her part of the contract and awarded her about $47,000 in damages, which covered the initial loan, interest and attorney fees.If a daughter successfully suing her father for nearly $50,000 to recoup the cost of her college loans sounds unusual, Dana&apos;s attorney would be the first to agree. &quot;Nothing that I&apos;ve researched has shown any cases like this and hopefully there won&apos;t be any more, because it&apos;s a sad situation,&quot; Berman admitted.As an art major-turned-teacher facing a grim economy (liberal arts majors&apos; salaries&apos; dropped 8.9 percent in the last year), Dana&apos;s legal victory should ease some of her monetary concerns. But most college grads can&apos;t turn to the legal system to relieve them of their student loan woes. Unlike other types of debtsuch as mortgage or credit cardstudent loans aren&apos;t wiped away by declaring bankruptcy.That means grads who can&apos;t afford to make ends meet can end up defaulting on their loans, which effectively ruins their credit. What&apos;s worse, defaulting means being turned over to a collection agencyand the fee that incurs can turn an already imposing amount of debt into downright terrifying numbers.Dr. Michelle Bisutti, for instance, finished medical school in 2003 with $250,000 in student loans. Today, she owes $555,000and $53,000 of that is just a fee for being turned over to a collection agency.The New York Times recently shared the story of Cortney Munna, a college grad who was convinced her NYU degree was worth the approximately $97,000 in loans she took out to pay for it. Now almost a third of Munna&apos;s income goes to covering the federal and private loans she took out to nab that NYU degree.While most college grads don&apos;t owe money in excess of $100,000 (10 percent of the 2007-08 class owes more than $40,000), at least two-thirds of those who complete a four-year program end up owing an average of $23,000 in student loans.And that&apos;s bad news for people who are slowly finding out a college degree isn&apos;t necessarily as profitable as they have been led to believe.Recent studies indicate that while having a college degree tends to ensure a higher salary than those with a high school diploma, the increase in pay scale isn&apos;t as large as society often assumes. According to a study conducted for Bloomberg Businessweek, most of the people who recoup the cost of their higher education and out-earn high school grads by over a million dollars (over the course of their lives) primarily come from elite private schools.For the majority of Americans who can&apos;t afford an Ivy League education, there are plenty of state schools that offer competitive academics at much more reasonable prices. The University of North Carolina recently topped Kiplinger&apos;s &quot;Best Value in Public Colleges&quot; list, and UNC grads don&apos;t seem to be hit as hard by the student debt crisis. The average UNC grad ends up with $14,936 worth of debta full $8,000 less than the national average.So, for those whose parents aren&apos;t legally bound to cover the cost of their education, there&apos;s still hope for earning back the money you invest in your education. 6 Lbs. of Quality Click Pens $14 is back @ graveyardMall

The Story Behind the Product Nana was born to a family of 9 children in the town of Kumasi in Ghana, West Africa. His parents divorced when he was only 8 years old and Nana became so rebellious that his mother sent him to live with his father in Tamale (in the Northern region of Ghana) when Nana was 12 years old. It was there that he developed an interest in art. He dropped out of school when he was 14 and started training with a master carver in Tamale. In 2000 Nana began selling his products through Worldstock. Nana is now married with 3 children and lives in Accra, Ghana. He is now a master carver with his own shop and 10 employees. Nana?s life has been so improved since he began working with Worldstock that he named his son after his contact at Overtsock.com. amazon.com Get a Free Leaplet When You Pre-order a New LeapFrog Explorer

 Added on : Monday June 21st 2010 11:40:03 AM My parents had a fire in their home in New York City. They live in a portion of it but rent the other part out. It appears that a tenant had a bunch of candles she didn&apos;t extinguish before going out, and her drapes caught fire. No one was injured but the house sustained severe fire, smoke, and water damage. Property is insured. We boarded up the windows and put tarps on the roof and skylights as necessary. The next step is dealing with the insurance company. The biggest question is if they should hire an adjuster. A bunch of adjusters showed up arguing how they can help maximize insurance proceeds. The fees range from 2% to 5% of the proceeds. Do we need to hire our own adjuster to talk to the insurance company&apos;s adjusters? What should we do? Thanks.

 Added on : Monday June 14th 2010 03:40:03 PM Have parents coming up on retirement and my Dads pension will have to roll over. Thinking of the bond funds from Vanguard that look good and am wondering what sort of diversification others would put together. I was considering this sort of structure, without naming specific funds:5-10% cash
60-65% short
20% intermediate
10% longI don&apos;t know to incorporate the use of tax free bonds into his structure unless I do that upfront to make the earnings post fed tax until he has to take minimum distributions when he hits 70.5 then convert them to the taxable type or... We could diversify some small percentage into stocks but the way it is structured right now if he gets a 5~6% ROI it should keep is principal static and be able to live off the interest. I would like for him to keep it that way for a while so he is not in a money crunch for assisted care / medical assistance later in life. I am going to help him assemble a proper team: attorney for will/trusts, accountant that is versed with retirement rollovers and long term fiscal planning, and a independent financial adviser that is paid per hour to objectively offer detailed planning advice. He has solicited offers from various annuity groups that I will probably need to discredit (if needed) as I am sure having a physical presence registers higher with his report. I have been reinforcing to him that the free services offered by particular groups or companies more then make up for themselves with front loads on fund purchases and higher management fees. Please share any strategy or thoughts on what you have done or would do to assist, I just want to have a better understanding before I sit in on the meetings we will have. I know they have worked hard for their money and I want them to have a comfy, worry free, stable retirement structure. Thanks Auto loan amount vs part-time job

This Deal Has Expired U.S. Child Born in 2009 May Cost $222,360 to Raise 
 Added on : Friday June 11th 2010 02:40:01 PM http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-09/u-s-child-born-in-20...June 9 (Bloomberg) -- A middle-income family may spend $222,360 to raise a child born in 2009 to the age of 18, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture study.The estimate is less than a 1 percent increase from 2008 and the smallest jump in a decade, which likely reflects the state of the economy, the USDA said today. Increases in child care, education and health services were largely offset by a decline in transportation, the study showed.The typical two-parent family spent from $11,650 to $13,530 on each child last year, the study shows. Households that make less, spend less, USDA researchers said. A family earning less than $56,670 a year is likely to spend $160,410 in 2009 dollars to rear a child, while parents earning more than $98,120 may pay $369,360, according to the study.Child-rearing expenses vary considerably by household- income level, USDA analyst Mark Lino wrote in the report.Expenses are highest for children raised in the urban Northeast, followed by cities in the West and Midwest, the USDA said. Housing accounts for the biggest portion of expenses, averaging 31 percent over 17 years, the USDA said. Child care and education average 17 percent, with food costs at 16 percent. The cost estimates dont include college expenses.The study provides a way for courts and government agencies to estimate child-support costs, the USDA said. The projections have been published each year since 1960.However, encouragingly, the bigger a family is, the less each individual child costs. The report shows that families with three or more children spend 22%less per child than families with two children, mostly because they can share with one another and mom and dad can buy in bulk. Notably, when the study was first completed in 1960, a child cost its family $25,230 ($182,860 in 2009 dollars). The increase over the years is primarily due to a rise in the costs of child care and education. 
Interesting article about the nature of children. Buy in bulk.It&apos;s also a shame that we have simply paid for these large increases in child care and education without using technology to reduce the costs of both of those (especially education). The article doesn&apos;t include college, which swings education expenses into the stratosphere. Free Journey to the Stars DVD - NASA

Fine print here If you were investing $5k each for your infant niece&amp;nephew... how would you do it? 
 Added on : Thursday June 03rd 2010 07:40:06 PM IMPORTANT NOTE: This is NOT for their college educations. My niece/nephew have multiple other relatives and their parents contributing to that.STORY: My wife and I both firm believers in the benefits of world travel. We both had very positive experiences traveling at young ages (late teens) despite coming from small towns and having to go against parent&apos;s wishes to do it (who hadn&apos;t traveled themselves). To help ensure our niece/nephew have the same opportunities regardless of their current finances, we would like to put money aside for them now so it can grow. They are 2.5 years and 6 months of age and we are planning to invest $5k each (or $10k total). I&apos;ve already talked to my sister and her husband and they are cool with us gifting the money for that purpose so this decision is not going to cause familial strife. That said, there are a few restrictions we would like on the investment(s):
We would like the kids to have some &quot;ownership&quot; over it... aka it be at least partially in their name.
However, they can only use it before they are done with college if it is for a structured, study-abroad-type trip.
Or, if they get a degree, they can use it for any travel they wish.
So our options/questions are:
Should we do two separate accounts or one joint account (if it opens up other investment options)?
This is not even remotely enough money for a trust... so we assume that is out.
CDs would definitely be an option... but we are wary about getting locked in at lousy rates.
Money-market/investor-advantage type accounts we assume would also be likely options?
Are there other long-term, relatively safe options we are missing (some sort of joint account for mutual fund, bonds, etc...)?
We are also unsure of the tax implications... In a joint account is the money gifted now? Or only after it is officially handed over?

I searched on the forum and didn&apos;t find any similar posts so I thought I would open it up to you all. If you were in the same position, how would you structure the investment(s)? Maybe 2-3 year CDs now while the economy (hopefully) rebounds, and then re-assess? Or screw it and just bet it all on renewable energy stocks (kidding)? I figure less complicated is better, but we also don&apos;t want them blowing it on the &quot;best spring break&quot; ever. Thanks in advance for your thoughts! Social lending: Formalizing a private mortgage through family? 
 Added on : Thursday June 03rd 2010 09:40:03 AM My parents and I have recently opted to cut the banks out of the loop on my next mortgage. Despite insanely low rates, banks have gotten very slow and very expensive with a lot of their mortgage lendingThe idea is that my parents (the lender) will benefit from a stable retirement investment, while my wife and I will benefit from reduced closing costs and a slightly lower rate. We&apos;re structuring it exactly how a bank would do...around 80% LTV with no unusual items. Nice home in an established area, within a relatively stable market (no bubble, just some price stagnation). 30 year fixed rate with no fancy options, payment skips, interest only, or anything weird like that.A lot of my research on this leads towards &quot;Social Lending&quot; sites like Virgin Money, but I was wondering if anyone knows whether it&apos;s safe to simply formalize our own documentation.Key concerns:
1. Deduction -- My wife and I want to maintain a legal mortgage interest deduction that will hold up against IRS scrutiny.
2. Interest income -- My parents want to be sure they&apos;re reporting interest income appropriately.
3. Survivorship -- if something happens to any of the parties involved, we want a objective document to refer to.
4. Saleability -- the ability for us to &quot;refi out&quot; with a bank (if the situation changes drastically).Thank in advance. We&apos;ve been looking forward to cutting the banks out of our lending for quite a while, and now it&apos;s getting very close to becoming a reality! Got A Will Video Tutorial 12.95 50% off Coupon

Help to create student budget (child is going to college this fall) 
 Added on : Monday May 31st 2010 03:40:02 PM Child is going to college this fall.
We had a deal with her if she will get scholarship that covers tuition + fees; we will pay for books + for her to live on campus (room and board).
So now she got enough money to cover full tuition for 4 years + fees + books + some leftover (about $600 per semester if we estimated cost of books right - about $600(???)) We (parents) looked at college dorms + food plans - got really disappointed with price/quality. For 4 years it would cost us about 50k if she lives in double room and have food at the college facilities (does not include summer months). There is no kitchen to cook and food would be most likely fast food quality which she does not eat due to health problems.So we decided to go alternative way - buying very small condo on campus where she can live. Financially for us it will make more sense because mortgage payments + condo fee will be about the cost of the dorm, but we will have some money go to equity, and have interest hopefully deducted from out taxes. Child will have better living quality and more independence. We did not buy yet but already under contract - hopefully all will go through.Now we need to estimate what we should give her as living expenses. HELP!!!!We want it to be just enough to live ok, no fancy staff but at the same time being able to survive without work if needed due to school load. She does have a job that we expect her to keep and that(+ leftover scholarship) should pay for all clothes, entertainment, gifts, eating out, cable/internet AND continue to save in ING direct (she put right now $25 per week and that is her emergency fund that required by parents). BUDGET - will give her lump sum every 6 month. Does it make sense or should we do it monthly?Here is what we think - 3k for half of the year ($500) per month.Car insurance~$500 every 6 month (has to have car to go to work and we would pay it anyway)
Utilities~$300 ($50 per month electric bill only, water included in condo fee)
Gas~$300 ($50 per month)That leaves $1900 for food and household (about $315 per month or $73 per week)
Not a lot but I guess just enough (???) to have normal food at home. She can supplement it by earnings and if not working - Gas money will go there. Does it sound reasonable?Also did we miss any expenses? Thanks in advance. free T, seminars&amp;activities for Nebraska children (3-12) from BryanLGH medical center

 Added on : Sunday May 30th 2010 04:40:07 AM http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/happynews/ct-met-lake-for...Like many people who lived through the Great Depression, Grace Groner was exceptionally restrained with her money.She got her clothes from rummage sales. She walked everywhere rather than buy a car. And her one-bedroom house in Lake Forest held little more than a few plain pieces of furniture, some mismatched dishes and a hulking TV set that appeared left over from the Johnson administration.Her one splurge was a small scholarship program she had created for Lake Forest College, her alma mater. She planned to contribute more upon her death, and when she passed away in January, at the age of 100, her attorney informed the college president what that gift added up to.&quot;Oh, my God,&quot; the president said.Groner&apos;s estate, which stemmed from a $180 stock purchase she made in 1935, was worth $7 million.The money is going into a foundation that will enable many of Lake Forest&apos;s 1,300 students to pursue internships and study-abroad programs they otherwise might have had to forgo. It will be an appropriate memorial to a woman whose life was a testament to the higher possibilities of wealth.&quot;She did not have the (material) needs that other people have,&quot; said William Marlatt, her attorney and longtime friend. &quot;She could have lived in any house in Lake Forest but she chose not to. She enjoyed other people, and every friend she had was a friend for who she was. They weren&apos;t friends for what she had.&quot;Groner was born in a small Lake County farming community, but by the time she was 12 both of her parents had died. She was taken in by George Anderson, a member of one of Lake Forest&apos;s leading families and an apparent friend to Groner&apos;s parents.The Andersons raised her and her twin sister, Gladys, and paid for them to attend Lake Forest College. After Groner graduated in 1931, she took a job at nearby Abbott Laboratories, where she would work as a secretary for 43 years.It was early in her time there that she made a decision that would secure her financial future.In 1935, she bought three $60 shares of specially issued Abbott stock and never sold them. The shares split many times over the next seven decades, Marlatt said, and Groner reinvested the dividends. Long before she died, her initial outlay had become a fortune.Marlatt was one of the few who knew about it. Lake Forest is one of America&apos;s richest towns, filled with grand estates and teeming with luxury cars, yet Groner felt no urge to keep up with the neighbors.She lived in an apartment for many years before a friend willed her a tiny house in a part of town once reserved for the servants. Its single bedroom could barely accommodate a twin bed and dresser; its living room was undoubtedly smaller than many Lake Forest closets.Though Groner was frugal, she was no miser. She traveled widely upon her retirement from Abbott, volunteered for decades at the First Presbyterian Church and occasionally funneled anonymous gifts through Marlatt to needy local residents.&quot;She was very sensitive to people not having a whole lot,&quot; said Pastor Kent Kinney of First Presbyterian. &quot;Grace would see those people, would know them, and she would make gifts.&quot;Groner never wed or had children the sister of one prospective groom blocked the marriage, Marlatt said but with her gregarious personality she had plenty of friends. She remained connected to Lake Forest College, too, attending football games and cultural events on campus and donating $180,000 for a scholarship program.That allowed a few students a year to study internationally, including Erin McGinley, 34, a junior from Lake Zurich. She traveled to Falmouth, Jamaica, to help document and preserve historic buildings in the former slave port. The experience was so satisfying that she is trying to get Lake Forest to create a similar architectural preservation program.&quot;It affected my (career ambitions) in a way I didn&apos;t expect,&quot; she said.But Groner was interested in doing more, so two years ago she set up a foundation to receive her estate. Stephen Schutt, Lake Forest&apos;s president, knew of the plan for the past year, but had no idea how large the gift would be until after Groner passed away Jan. 19.The foundation&apos;s millions should generate more than $300,000 a year for the college, enabling dozens more students to travel and pursue internships. Many probably wouldn&apos;t be able to pursue those opportunities without a scholarship: 75 percent of the student body receives financial aid, Schutt said.But the study and internship program is not the end of Groner&apos;s legacy. She left that small house to the college, too. It will be turned into living quarters for women who receive foundation scholarships, and perhaps something more: an enduring symbol that money can buy far more than mansions.It will be called, with fitting simplicity, &quot;Grace&apos;s Cottage.&quot; Placing the Blame as Students Are Buried in Debt 
 Added on : Saturday May 29th 2010 11:40:02 AM Link
Like many middle-class families, Cortney Munna and her mother began the college selection process with a grim determination. They would do whatever they could to get Cortney into the best possible college, and they maintained a blind faith that the investment would be worth it.
Cortney Munna hoped for the best when she decided to attend New York University. Now she owes $100,000.Citibank gave Cortney Munna $40,000 in loans, though she had already amassed debt well into the five figures. It was like the no doc loans that home buyers used to get in over their heads.
Today, however, Ms. Munna, a 26-year-old graduate of New York University, has nearly $100,000 in student loan debt from her four years in college, and affording the full monthly payments would be a struggle. For much of the time since her 2005 graduation, shes been enrolled in night school, which allows her to defer loan payments.This is not a long-term solution, because the interest on the loans continues to pile up. So in an eerie echo of the mortgage crisis, tens of thousands of people like Ms. Munna are facing a reckoning. They and their families made borrowing decisions based more on emotion than reason, much as subprime borrowers assumed the value of their houses would always go up.Meanwhile, universities like N.Y.U. enrolled students without asking many questions about whether they could afford a $50,000 annual tuition bill. Then the colleges introduced the students to lenders who underwrote big loans without any idea of what the students might earn someday just like the mortgage lenders who didnt ask borrowers to verify their incomes.Ms. Munna does not want to walk away from her loans in the same way many mortgage holders are. It would be difficult in any event because federal bankruptcy law makes it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debts. But unless she manages to improve her income quickly, she doesnt have a lot of good options for digging out.It is utterly depressing that there are so many people like her facing decades of payments, limited capacity to buy a home and a debt burden that can repel potential life partners. For starters, its a shared failure of parenting and loan underwriting.But perhaps the biggest share lies with colleges and universities because they have the most knowledge of the financial aid process. And I would argue that they had an obligation to counsel students like Ms. Munna, who got in too far over their heads.How many people are like her? According to the College Boards Trends in Student Aid study, 10 percent of people who graduated in 2007-8 with student loans had borrowed $40,000 or more. The median debt for bachelors degree recipients who borrowed while attending private, nonprofit colleges was $22,380.The Project on Student Debt, a research and advocacy organization in Oakland, Calif., used federal data to estimate that 206,000 people graduated from college (including many from for-profit universities) with more than $40,000 in student loan debt in that same period. Thats a ninefold increase over the number of people in 1996, using 2008 dollars.The FamilyNo one forces borrowers to take out these loans, and Ms. Munna and her mother, Cathryn, have spent the years since her graduation trying to understand where they went wrong. Ms. Munnas father died when she was 13, after a series of illnesses.She started college at age 17 and borrowed as much money as she could under the federal loan program. To make up the difference between her grants and work study money and the total cost of attending, her mother co-signed two private loans with Sallie Mae totaling about $20,000.When they applied for a third loan, however, Sallie Mae rejected the application, citing Cathryns credit history. She had returned to college herself to finish her bachelors degree and was also borrowing money. N.Y.U. suggested a federal Plus loan for parents, but that would have required immediate payments, something the mother couldnt afford. So before Cortneys junior year, N.Y.U. recommended that she apply for a private student loan on her own with Citibank.Over the course of the next two years, starting when she was still a teenager, she borrowed about $40,000 from Citibank without thinking much about how she would pay it back. How could her mother have let her run up that debt, and why didnt she try to make her daughter transfer to, say, the best school in the much cheaper state university system in New York? All I could see was college, and a good college and how proud I was of her, Cathryn said. All we needed to do was get this education and get the good job. This is the thing that eats away at me, the navet on my part.But Cortney resists the idea that this is a tale of bad parenting. To me, it would be an uncharitable reading, she said. My mother has tried her best, and I dont blame her for anything in this.Sallie Mae gets a pass here, in my view. A responsible grownup co-signed for its loans to the Munnas, and the company eventually cut them off.But what was Citi thinking, handing over $40,000 to an undergraduate who had already amassed debt well into the five figures? This was, in effect, a no doc or at least a low doc subprime mortgage loan.A Citi spokesman declined to comment, even though Ms. Munna was willing to sign a waiver giving Citi permission to talk about her loans. Perhaps the bank worried that once it approved one loan, cutting her off would have led her to drop out or transfer and have trouble paying back the loan. 
I fully have to concur with this. I believe 99% of kids would be better off going to a public school and investing the difference rather than going to a private school; The only exceptions being your Harvard/Yale/Princeton candidates.Most 18-20 year olds I know (and certainly me when I was that age) are not mature enough or forward thinking enough to merit the extra money.Subsidized loans have led to higher tuition have led to more subsidies. Rather than boosting grants and tossing away taxpayer dollars in a frivolous manner as some in power want to do, it&apos;s time to break the cycle. Not everyone is cut out for college.

Can My Parents Retire on 1 Million Dollars? 
 Added on : Thursday May 27th 2010 04:40:03 PM I&apos;m getting opinions and suggestions for my parents. My Dad is 73 and my Mom is 68. They own four-plexes that are in not-so good to plain bad parts of town. They&apos;ve been &quot;managing&quot; the properties themselves for years but are getting too old and tired to continue. They&apos;ve never managed them properly either, in my opinion. They don&apos;t screen the tenants and they pay for that over and over. Tenants up and leave all the time, sometimes after just a few months, but not beforing totally trashing the place. Rents are paid late all the time, etc. etc.So, this brings me to my question. If they sold all of their properties, they would amount to over 1 million dollars. They&apos;re all paid off, as well as their home. How do I calculate how long their money would last them if they just sold everything? They live quite modestly, with no interest in travel or any hobbies or anything (sadly enough). Their main expense is my brother, who still requires a supplemental income from the parents, although he did finally get a job recently...Can you guys point me to calculators or tell me how to figure this out. I bet the answer is probably so simple, I&apos;m going to feel stupid, but I&apos;ll take my chances. I&apos;m sure you guys will have some good info to go with the insults...Thank you. Need help with private Sallie Mae Loans Please! 
 Added on : Wednesday May 26th 2010 12:40:03 PM I need help with decisions regarding my private Sallie Mae Loans. Any advice would be greatly appreciated My situation: I went into school thinking my family could afford it (our finances were good) and then we lost our business, and my parents went through an expensive divorce. They encouraged me to stay and continue to take out private loans (very, very different from federal loans), as they felt we would find a solution down the line. Since graduation last May I have been working temp jobs, but not making nearly enough to pay my $800 a month Sallie Mae wants from me (I owe around 125,000). The worst part is that this is JUST interest, and the lowest amount they will allow me to pay. Deferment costs $150 and only lasts 3 months. I really don&apos;t want to get bad credit...but feel it will be inevitable. A few questions for anyone in the know.1) If I default, will Sallie Mae eventually negotiate with me/offer me a lower balance? As of now, talking to them on the phone is like talking to a cement wall.2) Are there third parties who would consolidate my debt for me at a lower interest rate (my interest rates are currently 8-14%)? Banks...other companies?3) What would YOU do? Paying is near impossible, and doesn&apos;t even bring down my principal balance. Defaulting sounds horrific (garnished wages, ruined credit, etc). Should I a)try to pay and be broke, b) pay a couple hundred a month and hope for the best, c) not pay at all? Thanks so much to anyone who can help me!! REQUEST hawaii vacation

 Added on : Thursday May 20th 2010 01:40:02 AM My parents and I are renting a house here in Arizona. Our landlord lives in California. Months ago, our landlord contacted us letting us know that they were considering selling the house. They had a very unfriendly and rude agent come out for a few minutes, did her stuff, and left. Hardly spoke to us or answered our questions. A week or so later, our landlord contacts us again letting us know that they decided not to sell the house. That was great news for us for various reasons. Well months go by and we get a knock on our door yesterday (Tuesday). I answer it and this kid ask me if this was such and such address. I said it was and he told me he was there to put a for 4 sale sign out. I immediately went and got my parents and informed them as to what was going on. This took us by great supurise. They went outside to talk to the kid for a minute but he didn&apos;t know anything. We ended up contacting the agent who told us the house was going up on short sale. Once again she didn&apos;t really seem to want to talk to us and didn&apos;t have anything to say.Our landlord hasn&apos;t even made an attempt to let us know the house is going up on short sale. The real estate agent didn&apos;t even let us know. Apparently the house was listed on Monday and on Tuesday the kid came out to put the sign up. Had to find out on our own. How rude!What&apos;s strange about this is about two week&apos;s ago, the landlord contacted us wanting us to make the rent check out differently. Instead of making it out to &quot;Blow Joe and Barbie Doll&quot; he now wants it to read &quot;Blow Joe or Barbie Doll&quot;.We haven&apos;t contacted the landlord yet to ask what&apos;s going on.We really don&apos;t know what to do. No other place to rent unless we move an extra 20 to 30 miles out which is really going to hurt us. My parents and I still want to pay rent as we always have but really don&apos;t want to give the landlord any more money as they are just pocketing it and our deposit.

 Added on : Sunday May 16th 2010 01:40:03 PM I am looking for getting medical insurance for my parents visiting US from India for two months. Unfortunately there are not many reviews I found online on folks who had to unfortunately use the insurance policies. I am comparing Bajaj Allianz (policy from India) as compared to US policies (like visitors insurance)and am looking for any experiences from fatwalleters who had to to go through the process of reimbursements. Parents on the risk of bankrupcy --need advice for them 
 Added on : Friday May 14th 2010 10:40:03 AM My mother just got her hours cut to about 15 hours per week. My father has been on unemployment for about a year and his time is running out (3 months to go).There financial situation doesn&apos;t look good. Both cars are paid for, a small fishing boat (2k) and their house 85k owed (val 100k)
My mother has 25k in CC debt. Her monthly payments are 500 month. My father has 5k in CC debt. My mother has great credit. and she says she has about 20-25k room in her credit cards.Both don&apos;t have health insurance nor any retirement. (Very bad situation) Took 401k out to put down payment on house..They can afford mortgage, utilities and food on what little income they have right now. I need everyone&apos;s advice on what they could do.
Option A:
Take cash advances on CC and pay minimium on CC&apos;s. Eventually they CC&apos;s will grow if they both don&apos;t have solid positions in the future, to the point where they have to DEFAULT. Am I write that the CC companies then can sue them and the court will garnish their wages?Option B:
Declare bankruptcyOption C
Live off CC and pay minimiums. Then declare Bankrupcy
Basically i realize its unethical to take money out of your CC&apos;s. I think its fraud if you do cash advances 90 days before a bankrupcy.What stops them from taking 20k in cash advances, then in 4 months go to a bankruptcy lawyer and declare bankruptcy? Personally, i would never do this, but if there is no other option and food, water, heat, home are on the line then I see no reason to pay for these life essential items via CC.I think it will be beneficial for my mom to loose her Credit. She is horrible with money and shopping. My parents don&apos;t combine their money. They argue about money constantly.Please help them out. I will have them read your responses.

 Career Thoughts and Compensation - Past, Present, and Future - 2009 Edition 
 Added on : Friday May 07th 2010 06:40:02 PM For the past three years around this time, I started a thread where people could describe all of the ups and downs of their careers, including their level of compensation. I find these threads particularly informative and interesting.I debated whether to start another thread this year. Last year&apos;s thread started off pretty well, but stopped dead in its tracks in February. The other thing I&apos;ve noticed is that most of the people participating and posting in this thread tend to be people who are compensated extraordinarily well. I guess I&apos;m a little guilty of this myself, as I know my salary is above average for my profession. That is not why I started this thread, however. I thought that this thread could be a tremendous resource, especially for people graduating college or looking to switch careers. So, gang, what do you think? Should I continue these threads every year, or should this be the last year we do this? If you participate, please try to keep this a positive, informative thread, and let&apos;s not get into any arguments about how one&apos;s career/education/compensation makes him/her superior/inferior to other people. Contribute as much or as little information as you&apos;re comfortable sharing, but please be honest so that this may serve as a truly informative thread for people mulling their career options.So, now that the ground rules have been set, how did your job go this year? Did things go well or not so well? How well were you compensated for 2009? Did the poor economy have a serious effect on your career? Maybe each person can give a brief description of themselves, their job, their education levels, and their salaries, present and maybe even projected salaries for the future. As always, since I&apos;m starting the thread, I have to bite first:Gender: MaleAge: 37Location: NJOccupation: Urban Educator (My fancy title for a teacher in a city of low socioeconomic standing)Education: M.A., plus 33 additional credits2009 Salary: About $72,000 (70K Base + about $2K for extra activities and a bit of summer work.) This figure is actually a little lower than my total salary last year. My district hasn&apos;t had a contract since the 2007-2008 school year, which has frozen everyone&apos;s salary. However, we will get retroactive pay once the contract is settled. Future Salary Projection: If our contract gets settled, my base salary for this school year (Sep. 2009 - June 2010) should be about $82,000. Next year (2010-2011), it will be around $92,000. Base pay for the 2010 calendar year (Jan. - Dec.) should be about $86,000. Extra work should add on another $2,000 or so, and I&apos;m expecting about $10,000 in retroactive pay. Benefits: Full medical, modest dental, generous sick and personal time, a decent pension plan (for now, more on that later), tremendous job security once you achieve tenure (but virtually none before that, and even with tenure, you can still have the daylights menaced out of you. Also keep in mind that not all states offer tenure, in which case you can pretty much be fired at will no matter how much time you have in a particular district.) What&apos;s the job like?Very difficult. Tremendously long hours, almost no down time during the school day (I don&apos;t take lunch very often),lots of work at home, deplorable working conditions, with some classrooms reaching temperatures of 90+ degrees and others below freezing. Prepare to adopt some small scurrying pets who have made your classroom their home in older buildings in urban districts. You will also most likely need to spend a decent amount of money on supplies for students because your school won&apos;t provide them, even though they insist on your using them. Very little respect and support from most supervisors, parents, and students. I do it for the good kids and because I love teaching.Would you recommend the career to others?It&apos;s getting harder and harder to recommend teaching as a career, especially in an urban district. Each year more and more demands are placed on you, while more resources are taken away from you. There are plenty of people who are ready to tell you you&apos;re a horrible teacher, but these same people won&apos;t tell you why you&apos;re a horrible teacher or how you can improve. My current principal has been good to me, but I&apos;ve been in a situation with a principal who always told me what a horrible teacher I was but refused to tell me what I was doing wrong or how I could make improvements.Some components of our curriculum have reached new levels of madness (and I didn&apos;t think that was possible). Our literacy program , for example, requires students to be in differentiated groups. And within those groups, activities have to be further differentiated for students according to their testing strengths and weaknesses. Oh, and you have to design the center activities.The students have to do these activities independently, but of course, most (especially the younger students) can&apos;t. The facts that we have many students who are unable to read at grade level (or at all) and who have never learned to work cooperatively with other students doesn&apos;t seem to matter to the powers that be.So chaos ensues, with kids in groups playing around and arguing. Meanwhile, you can&apos;t help them or discipline them, because at the same time, you have to meet with another group and assess their reading. This is not a once in a while thing. This is daily. And there&apos;s no other time in the day to help the students learn how to work successfully in groups. Then you have to display work from every subject in your room, with descriptions, evaluations, and state standards. You have to make giant charts for all the skills you&apos;re teaching and display them too. And you can&apos;t make charts or grade papers during the day (unless it&apos;s during a prep or a lunch period, and even both of these periods combined don&apos;t provide nearly enough time to do all this stuff).I also teach computers. We moved to a new building, last year, with new computers. Nearly a year and a half later, the computers STILL don&apos;t work properly. You can imagine how much fun it is to teach computers without properly working computers!If you do decide to become a teacher in NJ, you will be paid well compared to teachers in most other parts of the country. There is, however, an astonishingly wide gap between affluent and needy districts in NJ. NJ&apos;s suburbs are some of the most beautiful in the country, and NJ&apos;s inner cities are some of the toughest in the country. You will earn every dime of the money you make, especially in an urban district. (See above.) In addition, we have a new governor coming in and he&apos;s ready to slash and burn everything related to education. He is no fan of teachers, and he&apos;s ready to slash salaries and benefits if he can. He&apos;s probably not going to get everything he wants, but realistically, pensions will likely be affected somewhat, and eventually all teachers will probably be paying for health benefits. I struggle every day with whether I should start to look for other opportunities. I want to stay to help the truly deserving kids, but the annual increases in the level of nonsense (very little of it having to do with the kids) are making the decision tougher and tougher, despite the good pay.Every year I begin by saying, &quot;It can&apos;t be any crazier than last year. &quot; And every year, it gets crazier. Oh well, hopefully in another 20 years, I can retire! Hotel shut down; deposit not returned. Options? 
 Added on : Friday May 07th 2010 12:40:02 PM My parents were organizing a 50-person dinner at a local hotel (Staten Island Hotel) for the 4th-of-July weekend 2010. They put down a $500 deposit via check back in March 2010. The hotel called and left a message last week saying that hotel was shutting down (here&apos;s a story about the hotel shutdown). My parents have been calling but no one has been returning their phone calls.When the &quot;group of private lenders bought the 187-room Graniteville hotel on Friday at a foreclosure by power of sale auction for $24,000&quot;, did these new owners assume the previous owner&apos;s debt -- including my parents&apos; deposit? I&apos;ve tried contacting the new owners (Crowne Plaza Hotel STATEN ISLAND), but they have not returned my voicemail and email messages.I know that paying by check was NOT the smart move. But are my parents pretty much SOL? Outside of leaving complaints with BBB and raising awareness via Yelp, Facebook, Consumerist, etc. is there anything else that I/my parents should be doing to recoup their $500? Why does not having a job have such bad stigma? 
 Added on : Thursday May 06th 2010 12:40:05 PM I was once unemployed for several years. I&apos;ve noticed that some people (including my parents) believed that I was in such an awful situation by not having earned income. The most awkward situation to be in was when I would meet people in a party, they would ask &quot;What do you do?&quot;. I was torn between saying &quot;I&apos;m unemployed&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m in between jobs&quot;, &quot;I work for myself&quot;, or &quot;I&apos;m retired&quot;. The &quot;retired&quot; option was not feasible as I was only in my 30&apos;s. Although I have money saved up to keep me afloat for years and years without a job, I always felt that people felt that I was &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;in a bad situation&quot; just because I didn&apos;t have a 9-to-5 job. I noticed that people tend to attach a person&apos;s personality to his/her occupation. All FWers know that a person&apos;s occupation and what he/she makes in his/her job is not a good determining factor regarding his/her overall financial situation.I guess most people have the &quot;how will you make ends meet without a job&quot; mentality. Seasoning sucks! 
 Added on : Wednesday May 05th 2010 08:40:02 PM Hey Folks:Sorry if this has been addressed elsewhere (I did search and found nothing) but want to warn all of the dangers of paying CASH for a home.So my parents buy a nice bitchin&apos; ranch in Oxnard, CA in December 2009. Pay $325,000 CASH and the deal closes in 3 weeks. Cash purchase required due to seller&apos;s (failed bank) desire for very quick close.House worth around $375,000 - I was the broker representing my parents, with the seller, a failed bank, ponying up around 2.7% commission split for both agents. House sold &quot;as is&quot; - did manage home inspection and termite report. No major issues - around $2,250 for tenting, etc., but parents paid for that just last week.The house was filty (oh, the SMELL would have peeled the coating off the Space Shuttle) and was a jungle. On, and it came with a 79 year old alcoholic, rat and mouse droppings, and a human femur. My brother and I MOVED the seller to his new place the day before closing. And his booze. And his clothes, prescription drugs, silverware, towels, etc. The femur remains in a cabinet.We had to trash out the house, which included an entertainment room with full bar - yes, the painting of the naked woman remains in place, along with maybe 50 to 60 half empty bottles of booze.The guy wrote for various men&apos;s magazines so some of the work involves going through file boxes spiked with nudie magazines from the 1960s and 1970s. Larry Flint would blush at some of it.The yard was so overgrown that a machete was needed to whack through ivy, morning glories, etc. We still work there every weekend to get the house ready for renovation.So I&apos;m looking for financing so my parents can get a loan of $200,000 on the house. Parents are retired with a 810 credit rating, a house owned free and clear in Texas and a half interest in 135 acres in Eact Texas.Amazingly enough, they can&apos;t borrow $1 on their $325,000 house.Not until six months has passed can a conventional loan be obtained on the place.Fannie Mae guidelines require 6 month &quot;seasoning&quot; on title for a conventional loan.Yes, they could go VA or FHA but the upfront fees are high and they take a while. Same goes for HELOC and HEL.And with respect to portfolio lenders - they still go by Fannie Mae regs even if not required.I had no clue this would be a problem for a CASH purchase. Even the FHA three month flipper rule has been quashed yet this six month conventional lock-out remains in place.So for anyone who wants to help a family member out by spotting them some cash to buy a house quickly be prepared to wait at least six months to be paid back. 10k tax free yearly gift to children? (condo payment-repayment idea) 
 Added on : Saturday May 01st 2010 10:00:01 PM In thinking of ways to pay off my condo faster (currently a little over 20% paid off, so my interest payment is almost equivalent to my principal). One idea I&apos;ve been kicking around is borrowing money from my family. They already helped me with part of the down payment to avoid PMI and I promptly paid them back. I haven&apos;t looked far into it, but can&apos;t parents give their children something like 10k/year tax-free? And what does that actually mean? That I don&apos;t have to pay taxes on it? Can they also write it off as an expense (lowering their AGI)?Thanks! Self-organized consumer group for under 50 crowd? 
 Added on : Saturday May 01st 2010 01:00:02 PM We have AARP, the teamsters, the AFL-CIO, and all kinds of other acronyms.I am going to be straight. I hate how much influence AARP exerts. My parents are over 50, and they get some benefits through AARP, like &quot;reduced-rate&quot; car insurance. I question all this &quot;reduced&quot; rates, because I am not sure if they could get cheaper rates by just shopping. In a mathematical sense, proving non-existence is much hard, unless you enumerate every possibility.Also, I sincerely doubt that a lot of the AARP programs are conflict free and truly serve the members. Just look at the slick talking salesman on TV advertizing a &quot;guaranteed life insurance benefit to members&quot;. Yea, right a 10K term life insurance for pennies. A 10K life insurance is like ordering dinner, then letting someone take all the good pieces, and leaving you with the leftover rice and the bread that has already been bitten into.While I don&apos;t think AARP serves in the best interest of its members (at least not always), I absolute hate how much power they think they have (or maybe they actually have). Also, I hate that it is an exclusive group that discriminates on the basis of age (I understand there is nothing illegal about it). And for all of you jumping on me and saying, you can become an associate member, I don&apos;t want to a second class citizen in any group, let alone a nasty group like AARP. Before anyone says why is AARP nasty, I ask the following question: &quot;what has AARP done for me lately&quot;? And before anyone thinks this is just my personal blog on which I am ranting against AARP, let me get straight to the first business of the day.I want a membership based organization that will look after the interests of people like me. You might ask, who does that include and what do you get out of it?1. Minimum age 26 or 28,2. Maximum age 50 (unless you explicitly forgo joining AARP, and you prove every year that you are not a member. Too burdensome? Take a hike.),3. Minimum income: $75K. Too high? Too bad. But if you do legitimately think that this level is not high enough, we can have a sliding scale that is pegged to the median salary in an MSA, or even a more narrowly defined geographical division,4. Maximum income: maybe the level at which AMT exemptions end. Why such a condition? Well, we like it if you are doing well, but we don&apos;t like it if you are filthy rich. If you are filthy rich, perhaps a country club membership is better. Also, we firmly believe that beyond some level income, there is a persistent deterioration of moral judgement, and thinkin as part of a larger group,5. Minimum education: we can be flexible here, but we want to be somewhat exclusive while also being inclusive. E.g., we would admit people with AA degrees who are successful RNs, earning at the top of their range. We are also willing to accept college rejects like Bill Gates, if he wishes to join, and if he forgos his membership in the AARP,I am sure that some of the more creative and clever members will chip in with more suggestions.Now, why would we want to have such a consumer organization? A few reasons:A. Negotiation power for all kinds of products, e.g., insurance, travel, consumer durables,B. Election lobby. I understand that the impact here might be small, because of the way US elections work (e.g., on a national basis, you might have a lot of members, but there are no true national elections in US, even at the executive office level).But think of creative ways that election and campaing laws can be bent, and think of the purchasing power of this group&apos;s members vs. say the general public.C. Standing up against the employees. That&apos;s right, I said it, you heard it here loud and clear. Most people in US, even the middle-income, or upper-middle income, are getting pushed by employees all the time. If you don&apos;t think this is true, then you are a sleeping lamb, snoozing sheep, or any other naive animal. Seriously, the corporations really push their employees around. They don&apos;t push you when you are strong, climbing the ladder, or have influence. They push you around when you are sick, when you are having difficulty (family, health, personal reasons, etc).Membership fees will be high and are not for the faint of heart. Nothing molecular like the $16 / year for AARP. I am thinking something more substantive like $500 / year. If you guys think that is too low, I am willing to go to $1000 / year.What do you get in exchange for this? Well, you get A, B, C above, and more. But at the end of the day, you get a true consumer advocate in every sense of the word.Would appreciate your thoughts and ideas. Universal Studios Hollywood - Annual Pass $39 
 Added on : Saturday May 01st 2010 01:00:06 AM This is a great deal for So Cal residents (or anyone who wants to go to Universal a bunch of time this year). I got a postcard with this information and link (below). I don&apos;t know if this works for everyone, but I haven&apos;t had a season pass in a couple years and my parents have never had one but this worked for all of us. I believe this deal expires at the end of January.Normally these tickets cost $69, with this link you can buy an annual pass for $39 ($3.25 per month). There are a 12 blackout days - Jul 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, Aug 7, 14, and Dec 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.Or you can buy an 18 month pass with no blackout days for $79 ($4.39 per month).Or you can buy an 18 month pass with no blackout and free parking before 5:00pm for $119 ($6.61 per month).Parking is normally $14 so getting one pass with free parking makes sense if you&apos;re going to go more than 6 times.
http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/ap_renew/
UPDATEJust got another email from Universal Studios Hollywood.Renew your season pass for $39 from this link (you actually have to input your old season pass number though)linkAlso, it says Free Admission to Jon Lovitz&apos;s Comedy Club at CitiWalk for Annual Pass Holders (plus one guest). Not sure when this expires or if there is some kind of minimum food/drink purchase required. It just says show your annual pass at the box office and get free tickets for you and a guest.
UPDATE 2
Season pass holders: Be on the lookout! We just got a coupon postcard in the mail from Universal Studios Hollywood, 25% off food (unlimited use) until May 31, $10 off $25 merchandise (unlimited use) until May 31. Food and merchandise must be purchased inside the park (not CityWalk).Also, coupon includes $20 off general admission for your guests (up to 6 tickets). Not sure if this is unlimited use (does not mention). 24 Hour fitness Free Membership for HS athletes

*Less than $5k in any added cash. Pretty abundant lives SS analysis to the next.Questions: Is there any acknowledged accountability to my grandma&apos;s children? Can anyone sue them for loses?
What do we do if she dies? Can we just airing abroad and never attending back?
There is a will axis the acreage over to her kids. Its WAY underwater. Should the will be re-written so the advocate is the executor?Long Story:
Its searching that my grandmother alone has a few canicule left. My mom took her in (at my parents house) and is getting caregiver (has POA) while still alive her job. My parents never had abundant jobs, and got even worse in the endure 2 years (back surgery, both cars died, bare new roof). Point: they are bankrupt too.Since we don&apos;t apprehend her to get better, we are closing accounts now while she can still do it, aback she has no charge for acclaim cards, etc anymore. I ran her acclaim address to acquisition annihilation she didn&apos;t acquaint us about. If I did that, we begin a mortgage for $230k opened in 2006. Don&apos;t apperceive annihilation about it, added than one of her sons lives next aperture and consistently has had huge money issues. We aswell knew he was about to lose his abode in 2006, but again he didn&apos;t and never addition word.We don&apos;t apperceive if she advisedly active the mortgage, or was tricked, but that&apos;s not the better affair we are afraid about.

But we will get her ancillary afterwards we aggravating to amount out how the accommodation came about. Update: The mortgage is in grandma&apos;s and alone grandma&apos;s name. Hard to accept a case for artifice it seems.The affair is that the mortgage is at atomic 6 months accomplished due (per the acclaim report), and antithesis is $225k. Went through her checking, and she never fabricated a payment. But anyone fabricated 4-5 payments amid 2006-2000.

Will/can the coffer appear afterwards my mom, aunts, and uncles for the accident they will yield for the acreage getting underwater?
What about the will? Is there any point to it? Should my mom try to move to accept the will &quot;destroyed&quot; (write anybody out) or invalidated. My grandmother will do whatever we adjudge if she finds out about this. Thinking of accomplishing this so if she dies, they don&apos;t accept to accord with it aback there is annihilation to get, alone possibly lose?Again, the affair is not convalescent money.

___________________________________________


SECTION ONE: WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT MY CREDIT SCORE?

A. The Accent of &quot;Adequate&quot; Acclaim Scores

Clearly, accepting an abundantly top acclaim annual is added important in contempo years than at any time back scoring models were developed. If your annual is not sufficient, you will:

-pay added to get mortgages, car loans, and added credit;
-be beneath acceptable to get offered a job;
-be clumsy to get abounding allowance or coffer accounts;
-pay more, conceivably abundant more, for insurance;

and those are just the furnishings that are broadly documented. Because the accretion use of acclaim array by assorted agencies is controversial, we about don&apos;t apprehend about their use.

B. &quot;Adequate&quot; vs. &quot;Super&quot; Acclaim Scores

A allocation affinity ability advice deflate the accent of acclaim scoring. For a lot of people, a acclaim annual is added like a &quot;high canyon / canyon / fail&quot; brand than a letter grade. If you annual a &quot;high pass&quot;--roughly, amid a 680 and a 720, depending on the model--then that&apos;s &quot;Adequate&quot; for all activated purposes. Added improvements artlessly aren&apos;t important, and will not annual you. Moreover, the academy into the 700 ambit one gets, the added difficult it is to accession them still further. The basal band is that in the all-inclusive majority of cases, already one&apos;s accurate array are able-bodied into the 700s, it artlessly isn&apos;t annual annoying about them anymore. The key is befitting a &quot;high pass&quot; or &quot;Adequate&quot; score.

C. Why would a &quot;Super&quot; acclaim annual be helpful?

I can anticipate of three reasons. First, cool scorers sometimes accept the tastiest &quot;by invitation&quot; pre-approvals for new credit. Capital One has been abnormally advancing about this, sometimes alms superb acceding and huge curve to&gt;760 acclaim scorers. Second, a actual few lenders save their best ante for cool scorers. Farm Bureau Bank, for example, will accord a no-fee prime + 0 business LOC to cool scorers (generally 760 or better) Finally, it&apos;s nice to accept a &quot;margin for error.&quot; For example, my acclaim contour is WAY too alive to accumulate a annual abundant aloft 750 on any abiding basis. But it&apos;s actual important to me that it&apos;s consistently at atomic &quot;adquate&quot;, as I acquire several thousand a ages from my acclaim curve and would ache absolute losses if some snafu alien me into &quot;sub-prime&quot; status. So, I like to shoot for the 740-760 range, so that I apperceive that the accessory issues (wrongly appear lines, abrupt inquiries, etc.) will not bead me beneath 700.


SECTION TWO: GENERAL FEATURES OF CREDIT SCORING

A. Acclaim scoring models are carefully ambiguous.

The three aloft acclaim advertisement companies / agencies (CRC or CRAs) are Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. They are private, for accumulation entities. They all advance the position that their scoring models are &quot;trade secrets,&quot; and they action tooth and attach to acknowledge as little as accessible about their details. Moreover, they are consistently tweaked, in agency that are not publicized. This is one acumen why there can be no reliable acknowledgment to absolutely how abundant a assertive agency would affect a accustomed person&apos;s acclaim score. This aswell explains why there is so abundant misinformation amphibian about on acclaim scoring, even from journalists and others who should apperceive better.

B. Scoring archetypal complication prevents extrapolation.

Theoretically, two identical acclaim profiles, if faced with the aforementioned pertinent change (a new line, backward payment, whatever) should accept their array change in the aforementioned way. But in practice, no two acclaim profiles are anytime alike. There are artlessly too abounding accordant factors. The age of anniversary acclaim line, its type, its transaction history, its size, the amount to which it&apos;s used, and abounding added factors are get put into the &quot;black box&quot; of acclaim scoring. If all these factors are advised no two humans are absolutely alike. That&apos;s why you should be apprehensive of anyone claiming that &quot;doing x will admission (or decrease) YOUR annual by y points.&quot; There is NO WAY that they or ANYONE abroad could apperceive that information.

C. Scoring Depends on Reporting--which can alter considerably.

First, if a acclaim grantor doesn&apos;t abode the use of the credit, again it isn&apos;t advised in your score. A lot of business acclaim curve don&apos;t abode to one&apos;s claimed acclaim at all--which is why business curve can be a abundant way to &quot;hide&quot; use of credit. A lot of claimed cards do abode the limit, the antithesis (generally as of the abutting of the endure announcement cycle), and the minimum transaction due (at that aeon close). A few do not. Capital One is apparently the a lot of arresting exception, advertisement the &quot;high balance&quot; instead of the absolute to the CRCs. Counter to accepted belief, such exceptions are rather calmly formed around, provided one knows they are there. (Note: Cap1 in accurate is about consistently accommodating to action no fee antithesis transfers, and they will sometimes even action &quot;purchase checks&quot; that acquiesce you do bead your CL into a coffer account. Artlessly pay the antithesis off afore the aeon closes, and your new &quot;highest use&quot; will be your acclaim limit, while your antithesis (which is abstinent as of the close) may be as low as zero.)

D. Scoring models and their key &quot;inputs&quot; are evolving significantly.

The ambiguity of scoring models and the changes in advertisement mechanics complicates the tracking of changes in CRC scoring models. Even so, anecdotal affirmation and casual industry comments affirm that aloft changes accept occurred over the accomplished few years. Actuality are a few annual noting:

-Inquires are about beatific to the CRCs abundant added bound than previously. Years ago, it wasn&apos;t aberrant for all 5 inquiries fabricated on a Monday to not appearance on one&apos;s abode until Tuesday or later. Now, a lot of of them will appearance up about instantly. Needless to say, this has implications for acclaim appliance strategies. In particular, huge &quot;App-o-Ramas&quot; don&apos;t authority absolutely the allure they already did.

-Secured revolving curve are added accurately appear AND beneath damaging than they already were. Along with the HELOC bang of the aboriginal 2000s came abounding consumers whose acclaim was abominably aching by their&gt;50% appliance on their disinterestedness lines. Gradually, disinterestedness creditors began to added absolutely specify their curve as &quot;secured revolving,&quot; &quot;heloc&quot;, and the like, rather than the simpler &quot;revolving&quot; that all CCs are coded. Also, CRCs began alleviative them differently, acquainted that top use of a HELOC (at the prime amount or thereabouts, and anchored by absolute assets) was a abundant bottom accident agency for creditors than agnate balances on acclaim cards.

-Multiple accommodation inquiries aural abbreviate time frames are added about bundled. Not continued ago, &quot;rate shopping&quot; for a mortgage or a car could absolutely bang one&apos;s score, back every analysis by anniversary lender one batten with would beating it down addition notch. Now, CRCs acquiesce for assorted inquires for assertive articles (generally mortgages and car loans) to calculation as one, provided they are done aural a 14 or 30 day period. This added allowing analysis does NOT administer to CCs, however.

One key point can be accepted from the observations in the endure brace of sections. That is, DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOUR CREDIT SCORING EXPERIENCE DICTATES WHAT OTHERS WILL EXPERIENCE. I&apos;ve credible MANY humans accomplish claims like, &quot;credit scoring doesn&apos;t plan that way--I apperceive because it didn&apos;t appear to me.&quot; Well, THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT FOLLOW.

E. Scoring seems headed appear consolidation.

The big contempo annual in acclaim scoring is the accession of the Vantagescore . Among added advantageous revisions, this annual will use an &quot;Identical scoring algorithm and collapsed acclaim characteristics beyond all three civic acclaim advertisement companies.&quot; That will accomplish ecology one&apos;s annual abundant easier, and application the annual decidedly fairer to consumers. There is agitation over how continued it will yield afore this afterlight is phased in. Thanks to ksd for pointing out that consumers can get admission to this annual for $5.95 (as of July 2006) at vantagescore.experian.com .

F. Scoring is consistently individual, not &quot;joint&quot;.

Unlike assets taxes, area spouses can book &quot;jointly&quot; as one unit, acclaim array are consistently individual. So, a wife can pay a household&apos;s bills on time for 40 years, and if she&apos;s never accustomed acclaim in her own right, it WILL NOT MATTER if her bedmate dies, and she needs to get a mortgage or buy allowance on her own! Appropriately it&apos;s acute that every developed authorize the acclaim that they ability charge IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.


SECTION THREE: RULES FOR KEEPING CREDIT SCORES HIGH

While the accountable of acclaim scoring is absolutely complex, the a lot of important &quot;rules&quot; for acclaim scoring are simple and able-bodied known. You don&apos;t apperceive what abracadabra blueprint will get you an &quot;A&quot; on a UNKNOWN professor&apos;s appellation paper. Yet you do apperceive that bad grammar, misspelled words, the amiss subject, and missing the page banned will accumulate you from accepting a top grade. And you aswell apperceive that if you do a advantageous job of afterward the guidelines of the assignment, and accomplish abiding you beam any close rules, you&apos;ll apparently do OK. Well, acclaim array are similar. Follow the rules, and you ability not get &quot;straight A&apos;s&quot;, but you&apos;ll do just fine--and anon will get &quot;high pass&quot; grades. (If you accept already &quot;broken&quot; the BIG rules--e.g., a chargeoff, bankruptcy, et cetera--then you charge a acclaim adjustment action first. Added forums like creditboards.com are bigger ill-fitted for this. Amuse agenda that this isn&apos;t meant as a action at all--just an accepting that (1) I&apos;m beneath abreast on such issues, and (2) acclaim adjustment absolutely is its own subject, and (3) sites that specialize in these issues do a bigger job than we could here.)

So, actuality are the key &quot;rules,&quot; about in adjustment of importance:

A. Do not EVER pay late.

Paying bills backward abundant so that they abode as &quot;30 canicule late&quot; or worse is quickest way to bead your scores. OTOH, if you don&apos;t accept any backward payments, and all curve are credible &quot;paid as agreed&quot;, it&apos;s difficult to get abundant lower than the 600s, behindhand of what abroad you do. If you charge to beg, borrow, etc, to accomplish payments on time, do so! Do agenda that accepting a brace of canicule backward on a transaction will about never aftereffect in it accepting appear as &quot;late&quot;...OTOH, traveling oversees and apathy to pay that endure Acceptance bill afore you leave apparently will, so BE CAREFUL.

B. Accumulate your credible acclaim &quot;utilization&quot; low.

BOTH the allotment use REPORTED to the CRCs (which may alter from what&apos;s in fact USED) on EACH accessible line, AND the absolute (aggregate) allotment acclimated beyond ALL your REPORTING lines, are the acute factors here. The amount to which these corresponding factors will amount varies considerably. I&apos;ll action my added abstract opinions below. But it&apos;s safe to say actually it&apos;s best NEVER to go aloft 90% on any line, abnormally a abounding line--and never to go aloft 50% on all your curve combined. Beneath the 90% threshold, there&apos;s abounding affirmation that 50% is a key level, and somewhat beneath affirmation that 70% and 30% are acclimated as &quot;break points&quot; for acclaim scoring models as well.

C. Seek academy acclaim limits.

Since low appliance is consistently bigger for one&apos;s acclaim score, it follows, that accustomed the aforementioned acclaim acceptance patterns, academy banned will consistently accomplish academy acclaim array than will lower limits.

D. Accumulate your &quot;credit quality&quot; high.

The best accounts are a alone home mortgage (ideally infrequently re-financed), and one or added aloft UNSECURED coffer cards (Visa, MC, AMEX, Discover, etc.), and conceivably one or two abundance acclaim cards. Car loans, claimed loans, added abundance acclaim cards, etc. charge not be big negatives, but they about will do added abuse than good. SECURED cards are to be abhorred whenever possible.

E. Cultivate a continued acclaim history and an old boilerplate annual age.

The added accustomed your acclaim profile, the academy your score. This is bent primarily via the age of your oldest REPORTING band (closed or open; acclaim agenda or mortgage, doesn&apos;t matter) and the AVERAGE age of ALL your REPORTING lines. Of course, there is alone so abundant one can do to change this...it&apos;s abundantly a amount of time. But there are techniques that help. For example, curve in which you are an &quot;authorized user&quot; (AU) will about (but not always) abode on your acclaim file.

F. Abstain boundless &quot;hard inquiries&quot;.

Most credit-granting companies, and some banks/brokerages/etc. will &quot;pull&quot; a acclaim abode from one or added of the three CRCs. (Customer annual reps are about capricious on whether and which letters get pulled.) They again abide on your abode from that CRC for two years. Accepting added than one or so of these at a time is a negative, and accepting too abounding (generally 5-7 or more) may disqualify you for a accurate acclaim product. Generally, the acceptation of these as a acclaim scoring agency declines afterwards they are 6 months old. Already on, they are difficult to remove. One loophole: &quot;bumpage&quot;, which after-effects from breeding abundant &quot;soft&quot; inquiries through such agency as affairs your own acclaim via bartering casework like PrivacyGaurd and through the abode of &quot;pre-approved offers by added companies. Bumpage can abolish inquiries from Equifax or TransUnion, but not Experian.

Note that while a few issuers cull acclaim at added than one CRC (notably cap1, which does all three), a lot of will do alone one. However, IME it&apos;s about boxy to adumbrate which one of the three it will be. I&apos;m frequently told it will be x and instead it&apos;s y. One acumen ecology is can accessible is because it lets you apperceive how your antecedent inquiries are &quot;distributed.&quot; For example, if you accept 6 contempo inquiries, but alone two per CRC, you&apos;re not in bad shape. OTOH if all 6 are at one CRC, it would be best to abstain new inquiries that would cull yet addition one from that aforementioned CRC.


G. Abstain frequently alteration your &quot;official residence&quot;.

One agency that makes a accessory but assessable aberration is how continued you&apos;ve remained at one residence, with best periods accepting better. You don&apos;t accept to accumulate physically active at the aforementioned place, of advance (not that it would be achievable for abounding anyway)--just accumulate the abode you annual as your &quot;official residence&quot; for credit, bank, etc. purposes consistant area feasible.

OK, now that we&apos;ve discussed the key rules, let&apos;s move on to some well-proven tactics.


SECTION FOUR: TIME-TESTED TACTICS FOR FOLLOWING THE RULES

A. Authorize acclaim early.

Shortly afterwards one graduates from top school, it&apos;s a acceptable abstraction to seek out one or two high-quality coffer cards with favorable acceding and get accustomed for them, even if one doesn&apos;t intend to use them. Afterwards those abode auspiciously for a year or two, again band increases and abounding added adorable offers may appear your way...at that point, acrimonious the chrism of the crop and advancement the mix to a few added cards can be a acceptable idea. AS ALWAYS, the big admonition actuality is that one should alone administer for acclaim if they accept the abstemiousness to use it responsibly.

B. Be dainty about the superior of your acclaim applications.

For example, one shouldn&apos;t &quot;ghettoize&quot; themselves by assuming &quot;secured&quot; acclaim cards (NOT to be abashed with &quot;secured lines&quot;, like disinterestedness lines), rather than apart ones. If you are convalescent from acclaim problems, it may be difficult to get apart coffer cards, but in that case one should attending for cards that will be acceptable for about-face to apart cards aural a reasonable aeon of time.

C. Use &quot;authorized user&quot; cachet strategically.

Many acclaim grantors will abode AUs to the CRCs just as they would a primary cardholder. OTOH, if anyone is removed as an AU, again they are appropriate to stop advertisement action on that line. This opens up a apple of opportunities for managing one&apos;s acclaim profile. For example, if you accept a parent, spouse, etc. with a an earlier annual and absolute transaction history, it ability advice a abundant accord if you were to become an AU on that account--particularly if you accept no or a abbreviate acclaim history. Also, if you&apos;re accustomed a abounding antithesis on a agenda in which there are AUs, again accept the AUs removed from the agenda until the antithesis is paid off. That way, the AU&apos;s appliance will appear off abundant added favorable. The AU approach are one added acumen it&apos;s about a bad abstraction to administer for &quot;joint&quot; credit. Far bigger to accept one being administer as primary, and accept the added administer as an AU.

D. DO NOT CLOSE ANY CC UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC REASON.

Open acclaim cards that don&apos;t accept any abrogating transaction history alone abound earlier with time, allowance your &quot;average age&quot;, transaction history, and all-embracing appliance factors. Counter to accepted belief, closing the agenda will not abolish it bound from one&apos;s acclaim profile. It will abatement off eventually (generally in 7-10 years from closure), but by that time it would about consistently accept been old abundant to advice your beyond acclaim profile.

E. Time acclaim applications strategically.

If you are absorbed in, say, 3-10 new acclaim products, it&apos;s about adorable to accomplish abiding that your acclaim abode is at its concise best, and again bound abide all the applications at once--ideally the aforementioned day. This is the account abaft the &quot;AOR&quot; / &quot;App-o-Rama&quot; / &quot;application spree&quot; action that&apos;s so about mentioned at FWF. There are several affidavit for this. First, assorted same-day inquiries beggarly that one acclaim issuer about can&apos;t see that you&apos;ve just activated abroad too. Second, some CRCs accept not counted aforementioned day inquiries as added than one(!), which acutely helps that factor. Third, this &quot;bunching&quot; agency that all the new acclaim grantors don&apos;t see the new &quot;unseasoned&quot; acclaim on your report, back it will not be appear to the CRCs until afterwards their accommodation to admission you acclaim has been made. Forth, accepting the &quot;damage&quot; of assorted applications over with in batches will accord the abode time to &quot;heal&quot; (inquiries will bead off, new curve will season, etc.), acceptation that aural a year or two one&apos;s annual can be as top or even academy than it was previously.

F. Anticipate through your &quot;official&quot; address.

For example, one who is renting an accommodation for a year or two alone abreast their academy campus ability administer for acclaim from their parent&apos;s address, and not about-face that abode for several years until they accept a abiding abode of their own. (It goes afterwards adage that this requires that you accept complete assurance with your parents!) Addition example: if you accept two homes, and absorb allotment of the year at each, it&apos;s apparently best to alone administer for acclaim at the abode that&apos;s been associated with you the longest.


SECTION FIVE: MONITORING YOUR CREDIT

A. Why Bother?

There are several affidavit to adviser one&apos;s acclaim abode and score. First, credit grantors and CRCs both accomplish errors all the time, abounding of which can abate your score. The alone way to accumulate this from accident is to analysis the letters regularly, and altercation annihilation that&apos;s anachronous or contrarily in error. Second, ecology one&apos;s abode character annexation is a growing problem

B. FICO, FAKO, Vantage, and added &quot;scores&quot;

For purposes of this FAQ, I&apos;ll agree that one&apos;s &quot;true&quot; acclaim annual is artlessly what the appellant will accept from the CRC at the time they abide their request. I DON&apos;T beggarly that it&apos;s what one&apos;s acclaim annual &quot;ought&quot; to be, or even that the annual is acquired from actual data.

It can be maddeningly difficult to admission your &quot;true&quot; acclaim score. Virtually all of the acclaim array awash through ecology casework are &quot;FAKO&quot; scores: fabricated up scales that associate alone actual about with accurate acclaim scores. Moreover, even if you can get a &quot;true&quot; score, it may actual acceptable be a altered annual than the one your -to-be lender will receive, back they may cull a altered CRC&apos;s abode or even a altered adaptation of the aforementioned CRC&apos;s &quot;true&quot; score.

For these reasons, it&apos;s a acceptable abstraction to affably ask the lending administrator to accommodate you with the annual they accustomed aloft your applying for credit/insurance etc. Abounding are not declared to allotment this with you, but in my acquaintance they about are accommodating to. Some lenders (e.g. PenFed mortgages) even forward you a accounting account with the array they accustomed on you.

C. Accepting Admission to your Abode and Score

Note that accepting your own annual anon (vs. through a lender) is never counted as a &quot;hard&quot; inquiry, and appropriately DOES NOT abnormally appulse your score.

While you can&apos;t get your array for free, you are advantaged to get one chargeless report from anniversary of the CRCs every twelve months.

I apperceive of several ecology casework that accommodate acclaim letters and &quot;FAKO&quot; scores. Examples cover Privacyguard and Truecredit . I subscribe to both, at about $100 yearly, but alone because they both acquiesce me to cull new acclaim letters every day. Added FWF users accept appear that they are no best accustomed admission to new letters anniversary day.

Providian/WaMu acclaim cards accommodate you with a chargeless &quot;Bankcard Industry Option FICO score&quot;, and amend it monthly. This advantage is one acumen we best up the contrarily banal WaMu card. (See CreditGuy&apos;s posts beneath for added on this.)
