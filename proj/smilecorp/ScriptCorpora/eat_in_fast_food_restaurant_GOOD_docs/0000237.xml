Fish Fry Party Decorations
 Written by Emily Weller 
 Give your next picnic or backyard barbecue a different spin by swapping out the grilled burgers or steaks for fried fish. Depending on the way you decorate, the party can be laid back and casual or upscale and refined. 
 
Tableware
 
Paper serving baskets, much like the ones you would get at a fast food restaurant, add to the atmosphere of a casual fish fry. Cover the table in a red and white checked tablecloth and use paper napkins and plastic forks and knives. Make things a bit more fancy by using a vibrantly colored, striped tablecloth, cloth napkins and woven baskets plate holders.
 

 
Centerpiece
 
Turn old fishing accessories into playful centerpieces. Fill an empty fishing basket with fresh herbs and flowers or fill a small fishing net with dried leaves and flower blooms. You can also arrange clean, empty seashells and driftwood in the center of each table.
 

 
Lighting
 
As the sun goes down, use antique looking fishermen&apos;s lanterns to light the party area. Place a lantern or two on each table or string several on a cord and hang them between two trees or posts.
