 Plan for that Other Emergency: Death 
 Published July 8, 2012 | By 
Cancer. That dreaded disease took the life of my friend last week.  I’m glad he was able to spend his last days at home, surrounded by his family and friends. Still….

Even prior to his passing, chaos reigned just out of earshot.  His children were arguing about funeral arrangements, who would speak, who would pay the expenses, and yes, who’d get what. Three of the girls were sullen, refusing to talk to each other. One son broke the silence by yelling at his siblings. They fought over inconsequential things as well as major issues. It was miserable for those of us who stood by, shocked and silent.

Normally, this column speaks of preparing for unexpected occurrences such as earthquakes and ice storms. Today, however, I wish to speak to the event that will assuredly touch each and every one of us eventually: death. No one lives forever. We should accept that…and “plan, purchase, and prepare.”

When my mother died rather unexpectedly, my sister and I didn’t have to make any decisions; they had all been made years earlier. An insurance policy paid for her funeral and all associated costs. She’d chosen a casket and bought the garments in which to be buried. She had filled a binder with instructions and copies of all important documents as well as where we’d find the originals. She had chosen favorite photos to display and made suggestions for her memorial service.  She even insisted: No orange flowers!

Mom’s determination to ‘be prepared’ allowed us to mourn her death in a tranquil environment. We only needed a program, which my talented sister and nephew created. I simply watched.

I want to make my eventual death as stress-free as possible for my family. While I hope these arrangements won’t be needed for quite a while yet, my current project is to complete what my kids call the ‘dreaded black book.’

It contains all the necessary documents, forms, and information needed upon my demise: Social Security card, insurance policies, financial records, wills, directives, even the DMV forms for the transfer of title of autos upon the death of the registered owner.

I’m creating a check list that explains each step of the entire process. Most importantly, I have written a letter to each of my loved ones discussing the joys of my life, my hopes for their futures and expressing how very much I love them.

My children refuse to discuss my death: they’d rather pretend it will never happen. That’s unrealistic but understandable. My goal is to free them from the need to make difficult decisions when they are emotionally upset.

Pre-planning is a gift I can offer my grieving family… as can you. However, it is a gift that must be prepared well in advance.

If you decide to start a “dreaded black book” for your family, my website has detailed suggestions. Also, cemeteries in theGigHarborarea all offer basic pre-planning advice.

Incidentally, at my funeral…no orange flowers!
