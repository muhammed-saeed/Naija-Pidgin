What is the correct etiquette for tipping when you get carry-out?
 I went to two different places in the last week, Quizno&apos;s and Chili&apos;s, for take-out for my family. At each counter there was a tip jar. I was just wondering what is expected of you when you get carry-out. Are they expecting a tip? Is it optional? Would the change from your bill be an insult? or appreciated? I guess I never really thought about it because I wouldn&apos;t tip a drive through worker and they do the same amount of work as the person who puts my food in a bag and rings me up. Also, I am a cashier at a grocery store who does about the same amount of labor per person as a carry-out worker would, but I don&apos;t expect a tip. Is it because waitstaff makes so little per hour? Just curious what everyone thought and what everyone does in this situation. I&apos;d love to hear from customers AND employees if possible. Thanks!

 I usually never tip at a place like Quizno&apos;s or any other service chain, although if I have loose change left over from my change, I might throw that in the jar if the staff were courteous, gave quick and friendly service or put a little&quot;extra&quot;on my sandwich - I don&apos;t expect it, but when I get it, I will try to pay it back.

At a place like Chili&apos;s, you have three options - dine in, take out and carry out service where a server brings your items out to your car. For dine in, definitely tip. If you go in and pick up your items, then no tip - they are doing the same job you do as a cashier. If they are performing carry out service, then you might tip the server a buck or two, particularly if they are quick or the weather is nasty.

As you have mentioned, in many places watiers/waitresses do make very little money and depend upon tips to earn a living wage. Fast food workers make a steady salary at or above minimum wage and shouldn&apos;t expect a tip - I don&apos;t believe that I have ever seen a tip jar at McDonald&apos;s or Burger King, and I don&apos;t think most other chains should allow this. But I will often tip at a mom&amp;pop sandwich shop or restaurant, especially if it seems family run - the same 3-4 people there EVERY time I go in.

I hope this kind of makes sense to you, but for me, it is usually one of those&quot;it depends&quot;situations.

 Asker&apos;s Rating: Asker&apos;s Comment: So many answers were great, but yours mentioned the one thing I will do from now on. If I go in and get it, no tip. If someone brings it to my car and they are fast or it is cold/rainy, they&apos;ll get a tip. Also, I&apos;ll tip at mom and pop shops...not a chain like Quiznos.

 I don&apos;t tip for carry out. I don&apos;t believe that you should be tipping someone when all they have done is take your money and hand you your packaged food. Now, if they are actually providing a service, then that;s different.

 I retired from food service after 40 years. You don&apos;t tip take out. Tipping is not a custom, nor is it a city in China. T.I.P. is an achronim for:&apos;to insure prompt service&apos;. Taking your order at a counter, is not service. It&apos;s thier job and they have provided nothing extra to be tipped for.

 I never tip anyone when do carry-out. No one is waiting on me, so no service was given. I don&apos;t think anyone expects a tip, but if you want to give one, they&apos;ll gladly accept it.

 I&apos;ll usually throw a buck in the tip jar at a place like quizno&apos;s or chipotle. The way I see it, they&apos;re working hard (especially chipotle...they get slammed) and it&apos;s not like one dollar is that much money. I&apos;ve never gotten chili&apos;s to go so I&apos;m not sure how that works but usually when I get&quot;To-Go&quot;at a restaurant that primarily does Dine-In I will tip about 10-15% to the person who took the time out to make sure the order was right, bag it up, put napkins/condiments etc. I do that because I have worked in restaurants that are primarily dine-in (As in, no take out counter) and I know how bad putting together to go orders sucks because although you are taking time away from your other, tipping tables to make sure this person&apos;s order is correct and they have everything they need, you also know that 90% of the time you&apos;re not going to get a tip from them. Maybe just because I&apos;ve been in the industry but usually when there&apos;s a way to tip, I tip. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing.

 I don&apos;t tip for take out, I tip pretty well when it is deserved, I&apos;ll even tell a manager about great service( they&apos;re not used to that). I think the tip jar is being overused.

 I think we&apos;ve gone tip crazy in the US. Sorry but I would not leave a tip. A tip is for service received. If you ate in and the waiter/ress had to serve you and attend to your needs (refilling drinks, bringing you your food, clearing your table prior to dessert etc.) than he/she would deserve a tip. It&apos;s like you said, you, a cashier don&apos;t get a tip and you have to bag groceries, lift heavy items and put them in the customer&apos;s cart but you don&apos;t receive a tip. If you feel inclined to leave something when you pick up an order, then by all means do so but it shouldn&apos;t be expected or proper etiquette.

 When I did carry-out for a restaurant I was only paid $3.50 an hour a little more than my hourly rate on my serving shifts (which was $2.13 an hour). I was a bartender, server and carry-out specialist at this restaurant for about 2 years.
When doing carry-out you should still tip b/c the person taking care of you is going to be taxed 8% of their sales just like the servers. I always tip them like I am eating their. I also tip the carhops at Sonic.
