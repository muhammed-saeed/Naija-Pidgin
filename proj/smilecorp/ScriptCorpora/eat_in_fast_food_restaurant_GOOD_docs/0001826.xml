1986 WS6 Trans Am - Takeout T/A
 How The Offer &quot;Order Whatever You Want&quot; Ensured A Pampered Life For An &apos;86 WS6 Trans Am From the May, 2007 issue of High Performance Pontiac By Christopher R. Phillip Photography by Thomas A. DeMauro 
 
   
 Here&apos;s sound advice for every young man in America: If your mother offers to take you out and says, &quot;Order whatever you want,&quot; make sure you go to the closest Pontiac dealership-not the nearest fast food restaurant-and order the best and most-powerful Pontiac available.
 
Sound farfetched? Not really. Every young man&apos;s automotive dream list includes an entry about taking his parent(s) into a dealership and choosing for them his favorite car. The addendum to that dream is, of course, &quot;How then do I talk them into giving that vehicle to me?&quot;
 
Such is the story of Wayne M. Peters of Olmsted Township, Ohio, whose dream came true in 1985 when his mother, Barbara Scherrer, allowed him to take her to a Pontiac dealership and order whatever he wanted. Wayne agreed, and in doing so, he acquired a taste for a Trans Am that he satisfies to this day.
 
In 1985, Wayne was a 25-year-old motorcycle-parts and service-shop manager at AA Cycle in Parma, Ohio. Both he and his mother loved the looks of the then-current Third-Gen Firebirds introduced in the &apos;82 model year. Barbara, a manager with Ohio Bell Telephone Company, had already bought a new &apos;82 Firebird SE, but it wasn&apos;t built for performance, nor was it particularly reliable. After three years of ownership, she sold it outright.
 
Wayne watched the Firebird model-year changes closely as his hunger grew, but it wasn&apos;t until the release of the &apos;85 and &apos;86 Trans Ams with their 5.0L 305ci Tune-Port Injection (TPI) motor did he feel that performance had successfully returned to the model.
 
He then talked his mother into giving Pontiac&apos;s F-body a second chance, bringing her to Axelrod Pontiac-Buick in Parma, Ohio. &quot;I picked out the meanest T/A I could find at the time,&quot; Wayne recalls. He checked off the 5.0L TPI engine (Code LB9), the WS6 suspension package, black upper and lower body paint (Codes 41U and 41L), Carmine custom interior (Code 72C), silver, red, and orange lower body stripes (Code 80A), power door locks (Code AU3), power windows (Code A31), and removable hatch T-tops (Code CC1). You see, when his mom said, &quot;Order whatever you want,&quot; Wayne Peters took her statement literally. He was hungry not for a 59-cent burger but for a Trans Am.
 The screaming chicken is in... read full caption The screaming chicken is in single color and listed as RPO Code DX-1. This Trans Am didn&apos;t gain this option from the factory, so at the customer&apos;s request, it was dealer-installed. It doesn&apos;t appear on the Trans Am&apos;s buildsheet. 
A dealer search revealed that a brand new &apos;86 T/A with the same colors and factory options the family desired was in a showroom at Foster Pontiac-Buick in Agincourt, Ontario, Canada. The Pontiac was shipped back to the United States, its metric-style kilometer/speedometer was replaced with a mph indicator, but the Canadian oil pressure/temperature gauge remained. Axelrod Pontiac received the T/A on January 23, 1986.
 
Wayne and Barbara&apos;s Trans Am&apos;s TPI engine was the top-of-the-line performance powerplant producing 205 hp in &apos;85 and 190 hp in &apos;86 (the same as the L69 four-barrel H.O. engine in &apos;86).
 
This small-block Chevy-based engine features a 3.74 bore and a 3.48-inch stroke that equates to a 5.0L displacement (305 ci). The block is stamped with factory code DKJ.
 
The two-bolt main block contains a nodular crank, steel connecting rods, and cast-aluminum pistons. Compression ratio is 9.5:1, and the valve sizes check in at 1.84/1.50. Cam specs are 179/194-degrees duration with 0.350/0.385-inch lift. The TPI system features a set of long, tuned intake runners to boost torque and port injection to feed fuel to the engine. An electronic control module (ECM) incorporates a mass air flow (MAF) sensor among others to control the system. The 700R-4 four-speed automatic came with a 2.77:1 rear-gear ratio to complete the drivetrain.

 It took Pontiac until the &apos;86 model year to finally offer something more than the 85-mph speedometer. Shown is the 140-mph speedomer available on the &apos;86 Trans Am.

 Here is how Pontiac described the &apos;86 Trans Am: &quot;Lean. Mean. And outrageously beautiful. Trans Am for 1986 is raw power, sleek aerodynamics and crisp handling. And it&apos;s ready to prove its performance title ... whenever you are.&quot; This &apos;86 Trans Am also contains two first-year-for-Pontiac features: basecoat/clearcoat paint and the center high-mounted stoplamp. 
 Pontiac&apos;s 305ci LB9 motor... read full caption 
 Pontiac&apos;s 305ci LB9 motor features GM&apos;s TPI system. In stock form, the engine produced 190 hp in &apos;86. On this example, the belts and hoses are original, but a few minor clandestine upgrades increase power output. 
For those who like the curves, the most sought-after option on Wayne&apos;s Trans Am is the legendary WS6 performance package. The WS6 group of factory-designed modifications substitutes 16x8 Hi-Tech aluminum wheels matched to Goodyear Eagle P245/50VR16 blackwall tires for the standard 15-inch rolling stock and adds disc brakes in the rear. Also included is a special suspension package with stiffer MacPherson struts up front and a thicker 36mm front stabilizer bar. In the rear, specially valved gas-charged shocks are employed, as is a 24mm stabilizer bar. A limited-slip differential was also part of the package.
 
With all of this corner-carving performance, the Pontiac must have been a dream to drive, right? Well, Wayne confides that his mother found her WS6 T/A wasn&apos;t practical for her personal daily driving, so in July of 1986, she relinquished ownership to him. He says &quot;a mother-to-son deal was struck,&quot; and a young man&apos;s second dream had come true. The Trans Am has been meticulously cared for ever since.
 
In the 10 years that followed, Wayne registered only 17,000 miles on the odometer. He began detailing and showing the Trans Am in 1997, logging an exiguous 8,000 more miles by 2005. During its lifetime, the Trans Am required three batteries, replacement of the original tires and lower striping, and the rear bumper cover was repainted due to a parking lot scrape.
 
Though it appears all stock, Wayne performed a few subtle mods that focus primarily on the fuel, air, and spark delivery systems, as well as the exhaust. He added an SLP &quot;Ram Air&quot; airbox with a K&amp;N;filter (this was later swapped back for the stock box for stock-class competition), and many products from TPIS, including a modified MAF, throttle-body airfoil, ported stock plenum, adjustable fuel-pressure regulator, plug wires, and fuel injectors. Bosch plugs, a Hypertech performance chip, a 160-degree thermostat, and a Flowmaster 3-inch after-cat exhaust system with stock exhaust tips round out the upgrades.
 
 Wayne&apos;s efforts have resulted in an impressive array of awards for his &apos;86 Trans Am including: 
 &apos;99 Trans Am Nationals-Second Place, D Stock Class &apos;82-&apos;92 &apos;00 Trans Am Nationals-Second Place, D Stock Class &apos;82-&apos;92 &apos;01 Ames Pontiac Nationals-First Place, Stock Class T/A-3 (&apos;82-&apos;92) &apos;03 Ames Pontiac Nationals-Second Place, Stock Class T/A-3 &apos;04 Ames Pontiac Nationals-First Place, Stock Class T/A-3 &apos;04 Trans Am Nationals-Second Place, Stock Class D (82-92) 1st Annual Pontiac-Buick-Olds SuperNationals-Second Place, Third-Gen 
 Firebird Class 
 &apos;05 Great Lakes Regional Firebird Gathering-Second Place, Stock Class &apos;05 Ames Tri-Power Nationals-First Place, T/A-3 &apos;06 Ames Tri-Power Nationals-Second Place, T/A-3 &apos;05 Buick-Olds-Pontiac Nationals at Summit Racing-Top 30 &apos;06 Great Lakes Regional Firebird Gathering-First Place, Stock Class 

 
Currently, the now 21-year-old Trans Am shows only 25,758 miles on its odometer-a testament to a young man with the vision to preserve this F-body as part of Pontiac&apos;s history. You can be sure that the next time someone says to Wayne, &quot;Order whatever you want,&quot; he&apos;s not going to think of bellying up to the fast-food counter. Instead, he&apos;ll have to fight off the urge to head to the closest Pontiac dealership to order the best Trans Am on the order sheet-because Pontiac doesn&apos;t make them anymore.
