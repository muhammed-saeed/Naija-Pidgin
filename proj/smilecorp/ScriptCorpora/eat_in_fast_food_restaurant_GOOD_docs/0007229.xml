Eating out is a nice treat once in a while or a convenient option when you don&apos;t have time to cook a meal. But, if you have to regularly consume food from outside, you should be very cautious about the nutritional value of the food. Here are some tips for making your restaurant meals as diet friendly as possible.

- most fast food restaurants and restaurant chains post nutritional information about their food offerings on their web sites, check them out.

- keep it small. Portion sizes at fast food counters and restaurants are usually bigger than what you would normally eat at home. Share a large meal with a friend, or ask to take leftovers home.

- pick nutrition over value, order foods that have been steamed, baked, broiled, grilled, stir-fried or roasted. The hidden fat and calories add up quickly when food is fried, deep-fried, breaded or served with rich sauces and gravies.

- if you ask for sauces and dressings on the side, you can control the amount that you eat. Often you can use less than is normally used and still enjoy the same taste. 
- order much of vegetables and food rich in fiber- content.

- many of the restaurants have nutritional value menu, ask for it and make a smart choice accordingly.

- when choosing, be aware of highly caloric additions such as salad dressings, cheese, sour cream, etc. Sometimes, making your choice healthier is as simple as removing the condiments.

- drink water, low-fat milk or 100% fruit juice instead of soda pop. If you drink alcohol, limit it to one or two drinks.

- remember that healthy eating is about balance and enjoying your food. If you happened to overindulge at a meal, then plan on choosing some healthier choices over the next few days.

However, eating the home cooked food is beyond comparison how much so ever health consciousness is adapted. But, owing to the nature and timing of our work, we cannot help it. And thus the only way out is to be aware of the nutritious value of the food and avoid consuming food with high calorific or fat intakes for which you must have some knowledge in order to make a choice.
