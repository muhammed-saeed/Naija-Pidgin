 Secret Service Seizes Million-Dollar Bill Tracts from Christian Ministry 
 E-mail | Friday, June 2, 2006
 | Staff 

 Posted on 06/02/2006 3:06:53 PM PDT by DaveLoneRanger 

The Secret Service seized a large supply of Million Dollar bill tracts from The Great News Network in Texas. The tracts, manufactured to look like large bills, have Christian gospel messages printed on the back, and are designed to be distributed as eye-catching tools for Christian evangelism.
The Secret Service explained that an individual in North Carolina attempted to deposit the bills in their account, and as a result, the ministry was threatened with arrest if they did not surrender their supply of tracts. According to an e-mail from the ministry, authorities intend to seize the supply of tracts from the California location as well.

 first 1-50 ,  51-100 ,  101-103 next last I wrote the body of the&quot;article&quot;myself based on the text of an e-mail I just received: 
Today (Friday, June 2nd) the Secret Service seized a large supply of our Million Dollar Bill tracts from The Great News Network in Texas. They told them that someone in North Carolina tried to deposit one in their bank, and that if they didn&apos;t give up their supply, they would arrest them. Then they said they are going to seize our supply in California. If you want Million Dollar bill tracts, you had better order them pronto. 
You may still want to order them, but at last check, the link did not work.

Can you counterfeit a denomination of bill that doesn&apos;t exist?

It&apos;s not even the size of a regular dollar bill. They can&apos;t do it legally unless the bills are too big.

Oh, this is funny.. a woman was arrested in Mohave Valley night before last trying to pay for fuel with a million dollar bill.... she told the police she knew it was phoney, but she needed it to put fuel into her stolen 2006 Lincoln.

Well .. I&apos;m wondering what kind of idiot would propose such a track in the first place. Duplicating a likeness of our money is a FELONY .. so whoever thought up this idea doesn&apos;t know the law very well.

1 - there is no such thing as a million dollar bill.
2 - it was &apos;oversized&apos;, not bill size.

 To: DaveLoneRanger A bunch of folks were distributing these at the Main St. Arts Festival in Fort Worth in April.
I told the guy who gave me mine that it was a felony to even attempt to reproduce a facsimile of our currency.
He said they had that all worked out with the government.

I&apos;m thinkin&apos; the Secret Service is going after the wrong folks here. For starters, the guy who attenmpted to deposit fradulent funds. Check also to see how bright the bank clerk is...

I remember back in the early 90&apos;s, when the Clinton $3 Bill was a popular gag. I would wrap one of the phony $3 bills around a couple of $1 bills as tips to smart aleck car attendants or waiters.

This is absolutely riduculous. How can you make a big deal of this when there&apos;s no such thing as a 1Million dollar bill?? The gov&apos;t ought to leave these people alone! It&apos;s not their fault that dimwit tried to deposit it! SS, go home, read the tract and leave &apos;em alone!!

Squat [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: CyberAnt This has been done by Gospel tract ministries for at least 50 years, and probably longer. You can still TODAY order tracts that appear, at a distance, to be folded $5.00 bills. The idea is to leave one on a table or on a counter in, say, a shopping area or a fast food restaurant.

When someone picks it up and unfolds it, it is only about 3 inches long altogether! Once it&apos;s within 12 inches of your eyes, it is obvious that it is not genuine. On the inside is a message and/or some Scripture verses.

I never heard of the Treasury Department complaining about these. I don&apos;t believe that it is illegal, myself. And I think it was ridiculous for the Secret Service to waste time to go and confiscate the literature.

Because making products that look like money is not illegal, as long as there are clear indications that the money is not truly intended as counterfeit. I just finished a ten-minute search (FindLaw.com, google, SecretService.gov, etc.) for the statues on illegal tender, but couldn&apos;t find size requirements. I know somehow, it&apos;s legal. I imagine they&apos;ll probably give them back after a while.

There&apos;s a fellow who can draw really really well - and not surprisingly has been in trouble before with bogus bills. As I heard it he doesn&apos;t actually try to spend them as currency, but most people (at a diner, say, for not too unreasonable purchases) will trade-in-kind because they are so neat. Read about it in one of the coin magazines or wherever, can&apos;t remember.

As I understand it part of the problem with counterfeiting - the US outsourced a lot of heavy industries, and with it apparently intaglio press, and even by god, the sort of machine that will make a seamless beret as per spec. Anyway - through a circuitous pipeline the wrong folks got a hold of the right machinery and paper, and ink presumably, to make completely undetectable forgeries. Years ago I heard that fully 70 per cent of the actual cash is outside the U.S. of America. One time, I actually had a street vendor try to refuse a $100 bill because it was a little bit wrinkled, or a corner was bent. US dollars make up a significant part of people&apos;s savings throughout the world so it has to be made good - and one of the ways is to maintain the security through modernization.

That&apos;s it. Let&apos;s hold the religious group responsible. American justice circa 2006...

Perhaps someone should tell the Secret Service that we don&apos;t make a $1 million dollar bill these days. You&apos;d think they might know that.

Sorry, I can&apos;t support this lunatic enforcement exercise.

Well .. the Secret Service doesn&apos;t take it lightly when people make funny money which so closely resembles the real kind.

As for monopoly money .. it doesn&apos;t resemble REAL money at all. The size is different, the color is different, etc., so your analygy doesn&apos;t work.

But .. when a person mistakes the money for REAL stuff .. there&apos;s a problem .. the money looks too good .. and can be mistaken for the REAL stuff.

I remember getting those instead of tips when I was a waiter--Bible study groups in particular left them. It&apos;s one of the least effective outreach tools, because all it does is convince waiters and waitresses that Christians are lousy tippers.

My husband bought a stack of tracts from www.livingwaters.com several years ago -- they look like $100 dollar bills (Ben Franklin), except they&apos;re 18&quot;long and 6&quot;tall! Their mission statement is printed over Independence Hall. We gave them out at Halloween -- wrapped around full-sized candy bars -- and have about a dozen left.

A person would have to be a total burbling moron to cash this thing.

Now that I think of it, there seems to be a growing population of those types in the USA these days...
