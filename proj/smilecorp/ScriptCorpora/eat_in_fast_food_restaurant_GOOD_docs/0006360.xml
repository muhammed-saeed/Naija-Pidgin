 Seito Sushi One of the best 
by Zubu Tine ( 5 reviews )
 July 12, 2012 - This really is one of the best places for dining in Baldwin Park. Great food. Great Staff. Great bar. That pretty much says it all.

 Kyoto Sushi&amp;Grill convenient and reasonably priced! also delicious 
by Bianca ( 4 reviews )
 July 11, 2012 - so i go to kyoto quite a bit, probably at least 1-2 times per week, mainly for the sushi. they have a good sushi happy hour which is from 4-6 everyday. the happy hour roll is 6 pieces where the regular one is 8, and its about $3.50 or so, which is a good deal. the hibachi (especially lunch) is also a good deal! the only negative thing i&apos;d have to say is about the chicken. yes the lunch special is around $5-6 but they use fatty, low quality chicken. i felt like i had to spit out most of the pieces because they were just too fatty. it reminded me of the chicken you&apos;d get at a food court restaurant. they give you the option of upgrading it for about $2 more (they also give you this option with the steak) but then a $6 lunch special (with the addition of the upgrade, tax, tip and a drink if desired) turns into a $10 meal if not more! i&apos;ve also tried the soba stir fried noodle with chicken (about $8) and I ended up not even eating the chicken because it was just too fatty. so unless you would like to upgrade to better quality chicken, i would suggest steak or veggies. (some people even complain about the steak, but i think it tastes good- especially for the price. i&apos;m not a seafood person so I can&apos;t give an opinion on the quality of it.) one thing i love about kyoto, however, is the drive thru for pick up orders. you can call ahead for take out (usually 10-15 mins) so by the time i leave my house and get there, my food is ready. and i love that i don&apos;t even have to get out of my car (GO AMERICA!). all in all, kyoto has good specials and service, and for the price that you pay its a good deal.

 Deep Blu Seafood Grille Sarah is the best server EVER

 Deep Blu Seafood Grille Ribeye&amp;Salmon by Brian ( 1 review )
 July 09, 2012 - Many of the reviews seen here are just individuals writing feel good statements because they refuse to speak the truth. I took my wife to Deep Blu at Wyndham for our 26th wedding anniversary on 07/07/2012 at 5:40 P.M. with anticipation of a romantic dinner for two. List of meal items ordered; Crab Cake $15, Fresh Greens $10, 2-Iced Tea $6, Salmon $36, N.E. Chowder $8,&amp;Ribeye $36. Total: $118.22 + $20 (Tip) = $138.22 I requested a table that was out of the way to obtain a bit of privacy due to the occasion. They have no tables out of the way so all positive atmosphere reviews are null and void. If you desire a romantic atmosphere then do not reserve a table at the Deep Blu. I could hear conversations of virtually every couple in the place and there were only four (4) couples total. The objective of a limited menu is to obtain cooking perfection and expedite meal preparation. The wait time for our entree’s was acceptable and allowed my wife and I time to converse and enjoy our appetizers. The Crab Cake was very good, but very small and the Chowder was little more than vegetable soup with a clam in the bowl which added a trivial chowder taste. All in all, the appetizers do little more than make your appetite grow with anticipation. This is not a bad thing if the entree delivers as expected. Upon arrival of the main course, my wife and I looked at each other wondering when the rest of our dinner was going to arrive. My wife had the Salmon which was cooked well and tasted wonderful but very little portion leaving her almost as hungry after the meal as upon her arrival. I ordered the Ribeye (Medium Well) as it was cooked slightly over to almost a (Well Done) condition which produced a tougher meat than I desire. The end result of our entire experience was one of more comedy instead of romance. Not what I had envisioned. The Bottom Line: For $118 you should serve at least three (3) sides with the main course if not four (4) and not just a few greens to dress the plate. The drinks should be as ordered by your customer and not as per the menu. Flexibility goes a long way and costs very little. For $118 you should never have guests leave your establishment hungry and believe me when I say, my wife and I will never leave your facility hungry again. This dinner experience should have cost no more than $50 at best. I was embarrassed in front of my wife but don’t worry, lesson learned. One Final Note: Nick was our server. He and the staff that assisted him did a fantastic job throughout our dinner which earned a tip of $20. They were the most positive happening of the dinner. Please give each of them a raise because they are the only real assets your establishment has at this point.

 Urban Hibachi Hawaiian Roll&amp;Flame Roll by Glenda ( 64 reviews )
 July 09, 2012 - Urban Hibachi We visited Urban Hibachi for the first time on Sunday, July 8th, 2012 via Restaurant.com. We arrived at the restaurant at around 3:30pm; there were not a lot of people at the place. We were seated and greeted promptly. Our waitress, Heather, was polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. She suggested a few sushi to try, which we did and there were fabulous. Overall, the food was great, the service was perfect, the food was reasonably priced, and the taste was out of this world. We recommend the Hawaiian sushi roll. Also, it really helped that at each table there is an explanation and picture of the most popular sushi rolls. The place was clean and neat, they offer hibachi style service for those who want a full meal. My husband had the chicken teriyaki bento box and I had the salmon teriyaki bento box along with the Hawaiian roll and the Flame roll. Would we come again? YES!!! Great place for sushi.

 Robata Horrible service 
by zpmotola ( 1 review )
 July 08, 2012 - My and husband and I have been eating at Robata since it opened and never had a problem. Please make sure that they never see you share the 20.00 all you can eat plate. First, the waitress embarrased us by screaming NO SHARING like if we were children. Second she then told the chef, who then told the kitchen staff and soon we had at least 4-5 staff members just looking straight at us while we finish our dinner. The sad part is that I had ordered a regular prices dish and my husband decided to get the all you can eat, it is not like I did not order anything and ate from his plate. The service is terrible and I will never go back!!!!

 Ichiban Hibachi&amp;Sushi Buffet mobile review 
by NYCEaterrr ( 2 reviews )
 July 04, 2012 Ichiban has the potential to be one of the better sushi hibachi buffets Orlando has. However there are some key elements that would keep from returning. If your familiar with the area, Ichiban used to be a Perkins restaurant that eventually closed down. This being said the space is pretty big. I went in on a Friday night unknowingly with 2 friends for dinner. The first downside I will present is that the pricing was a mystery all the way untill we each recieved a check. We had a gracious hostess who explained the concept and took our drink orders. With all the copious seating available I thought the food selection would be as well. Unfortunatley Ichiban only has two hot tables with many of your generic pan Asian foods with a few American favorites, a confusing hidden dessert , the hibachi station and a sushi table. the food was great but the poor selection was very underwhelming. However, the quality of sushi and sashimi is THE BEST I have tried from a buffet and believe me I have been to several in the surrounding area (Good Fortune, Giant Panda etc) by far between the sauces they offer and the sushi, that was my favorite part of ichiban. To end it all, my check came out to 17 dollars after taxes and before tip which in my opinion is pretty pricey for the selection of food available. Their lunch price is 8.50 but Id even have my reservations paying that much for a poor selection. There is more seating in Ichiban than food. Giant Panda right down the road is a verrry similar concept with a better price which explains why its always busy. Ichiban has great quality food, but I believe management needs to revist the drawing board in price and expanding food selection if they want to compete.

 Kobé Japanese Steakhouse&amp;Sushi Bar Food discrimination!? 
by raquelita2007 ( 2 reviews )
 July 01, 2012 - Ok...so I was happy to read in the menu that I could adapt my diet and have it with butter yay!....@ the table there were 2 more guests that wanted low sodium soy, me none. So when the chef began the order I was surprised that he went out of his way to accommodate their special requests, mine ignored:-( I was served my veggies with soy. I thought oh well maybe he forgot...but when he called the other waiter to get him extra bottles of soy for the low sodium guests he did not even bother himself to call for extra veggies so I could get mine without soy! So I sat there ate nothing and everybody else, yep you guessed it sat eating their veggies and giving me the pity look! WOW I will never order ANYTHING there again. So I was discriminated because of my food choice! Well if then don&apos;t put it on the menu if you are NOT going to serve it. So all I ate was the lobster. My noodles were put on top of the soy soaked veggies! Sigh...I have never felt any discrimination in my life and I tell you folks it might seem silly but it is an awful feeling. There are many people that can&apos;t simply have soy and to be humiliated like that sucked! You know it&apos;s discrimination when one need is taken into consideration over the other.

 Osaka Japanese Steakhouse mobile review 
by C t ( 1 review )
 June 28, 2012 - BEWARE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES!!! Poor service from chefs. We recently dined here and we have to say the chefs don&apos;t take kindly to food allergies. My mom is deathly allergic to shrimp. After kindly asking the chef to cook the shrimp last (so it wouldn&apos;t contaminate her food) he quickly agreed. Not a minute later he placed the shrimp on the grill, causing for contamination. My mom politely told him his mistake, causing a whole ordeal in which we sat hearing him complain about my mothers allergy and how he had to start over for her meal...the entire time he finished cooking!!! Also, he served burnt food to the entire table. Incredibly rude service. BEWARE TO ALL!

 Koy Wan Hibachi Buffet bridal rehearsal dinner 
by croach29 ( 3 reviews )
 June 25, 2012 - I always knew I wanted an Asian bridal shower since I was born in Vietnam many years ago but raised here in America with my American Dad. I chose Koy Wan for its decor,price,quality, and service. I was so happy with my choice. They set us up(45people)in a back banquet hall with a separate cash alcohol bar and the service was excellent. Mongolian Grill and Sushi bar are the best part of it. The Chinese buffet is good as well. Lots of choices for those who like and do not like Chinese food.

 CRAVE Satisfied my Crave 
by Gordo Pollo , Lancaster
 ( 10 reviews )
 June 24, 2012 - After spending a Sunday afternoon window shopping at the Millenia complex, I decided to try Crave for the first time. At first glance, I&apos;d tried to figure out its speciality since its advertised pizza, steak, sushi and flatbreads. The nice and friendly hostess explained its vibrant American food philosophy which made sense with all it&apos;s different offerings on the menu from pizza to sushi. The atmosphere was upscale casual with entries ranges of $10-25, which complemented the nice decor and envoriment that is expected for the Millenia area. After reading blogs from other reviews complaining about overpriced items at Crave, it was nonsense. The restaurant was affordable and reflected quality of service expected from Millenia. I recommend those bloggers to dine at McDonalds inside the local WalMart to get great prices. Anyway, the staff and waiter were friendly very knowledgeable of the menu. I let my waiter know I wanted light and good. First he recommended to try the Bamboo Bites which was sushi with shrimp, cream cheese and other tasty items. It was an off menu item and it was spot on, great choice Jack. Next, I ordered the steak salad. You may ordered the steak to your liking, mine was medium. It was served over a bed of spinach which balsamic dressing. It was had other toppings as well. Both dishes were delicious and big serving portions. At glance of the menu, I will be returning to try some pizza and maybe it Sunday special of $19.99 all you can eat prime rib, but I&apos;ll have to come with a bigger appetite. Also, for the husbands who hate shopping with their wives, hang out at Crave&apos;s nicely decorated full service bar while your wife satisfies her shopping crave at Millenia. Its a definite to place to go after walking and shopping at Millenia.

 Imperial Dynasty Chinese Restaurant and Lounge mobile review 
by Amora ( 1 review )
 June 23, 2012 - This restaurant was the highlight of my day! Speaking as an ardent foodie and having dined at many prestigious restaurants this gem of a place really takes the cake for creative and delicious Chinese cuisine. They&apos;ve implemented a sushi bar (though not Chinese, they taken care to create fresh and delectable selections) that offers mouth watering specials such as the the Coral Delight (non traditional sushi rice containing a perfect mix of masago and crunch that offers a new texture to the rice) and the Aloha (smoked salmon topped with fresh pineapple and oven toasted coconut flakes!) Of course, I must recommend their    new addition to their Chinese menu: Tony&apos;s Special Eggplant w/Shrimp, an impeccable balance of non greasy crunch on the outside and preserving the  succulent flavors of the eggplant and shrimp. Also be sure to try the all time favorites: Jalapeño Beef and Fantasy Sea Bass. If I&apos;m ever in Orlando in the near future this would be the my first stop:)

 Ichiban Hibachi&amp;Sushi Buffet Japanese&amp;Sushi Buffet 
by Cheryl Revadelo ( 1 review )
 June 23, 2012 - We have been twice now since they have opened last month and have been COMPLETELY satisfied both times. The Hibachi grill is excellent, you can pile up your plate and they cook it and bring it to your table. You can ask for white rice and your choice of numerous sauces, I suggest the white sace for the hibachi grill. If you don&apos;t get filled up with the hibach grill (which I don&apos;t know how you wouldn&apos;t) you can eat something off of the teppan bar or sushi bar, and also a desert bar. The servers are all very friendly and keep your table cleared of empty or finished plates. I suggest the hot tea (free of charge) or you can buy soft drinks or wine or beer, japanese or domestic. All of this for $14.95 I feel is totally reasonable for all that is offered. My husband is a very picky eater, but he has voted this his very favorite place to eat.

 Cheng&apos;s Asian Bistro Horrible Service by Manager 
by Max Mirabella ( 1 review )
 June 23, 2012 - On June 21, 2012 my wife and I returned to Cheng&apos;s for a casual dinner, we have been in this restaurant many times and the servers have always been fantastic. The big change that night was&quot;The Manager&quot;that I have never seen before, a 50 years old man who at 9:50 pm handed us the bill without me even requesting it, and when I asked him why he was giving me the check and what was the rush since I just got my plate with food he replied:&quot;We close at 10pm, you must pay and you must leave&quot;. The server that always attends me could not believe what he had just said to me!! She had to pack our meals to go and she didnt stop apologizing for this Loser Manager behavior until we exit . Never felt worst in my life, unwelcomed , rushed and been asked to leave before even closing time!!! I shall never returned as long as that rude manager is there. Max

 Gizmo Sushi Spider Roll, Volcano Roll, California Roll, Rainbow Roll, Dancing Eel by ATL Foodie ( 1 review )
 June 22, 2012 - I can&apos;t speak for the dine-in experience, but my boyfriend and I have gotten take-out from Gizmo&apos;s four times in the past three months and 3 of the 4 times it was excellent. We&apos;ve been to some really nice places downtown for sushi and we ultimately decided that Gizmo&apos;s was much better. The one night that it wasn&apos;t all that great we chocked up to a fluke. So, if you see the negative reviews, maybe give it a shot anyway because it really is great sushi!

Despite the lack of many choices for sushi, it taste better than Seito and most local sushi joints. Grab it on your way home from work or when you are stuck in traffic on Aloma. I welcome Japan Express in what used to be KFC. This is much better.

 Koy Wan Hibachi Buffet Best Asian Buffet in Orlando Area! 
by tyc929 ( 1 review )
 June 19, 2012 - First of all the interior is very beautiful and nicely decorated. The way the food was displayed made it very attracting and the way the stations are set up allows the chefs/cooks to check on it constantly to replace food. What makes this buffet different from the other buffets I&apos;ve been to is that when you first come in the atmosphere is quite marvelous. The music is very soothing and unlike other buffets this buffet doesn&apos;t have a weird smell. Just a nice refreshing smell. I tried mostly everything the buffet had to offer and lets say I am very satisfied to have visit this place. The way they cook the food taste way better than the other buffets in Orlando. What I really like about this buffet is that they provided a large variety of sushi. Not only did they have nigiri but they also had the raw sushi and specialties. Did I mention FRIED Sushi!!!! Other buffets would have a small section with raw and California rolls but Koywan have a huge variety of them. I would definitely revisit this place again and if you are looking for a good Buffet and not impress with the other Chinese Buffets in Orlando. This is a must try and cheap! Best Asian fusion buffet in central Florida. I tried all the large Asian buffets in and around Orlando and Tampa, Koywan Hibachi Buffet is by far the largest and best. 1)They have enormous selections of Sushi (both rolls and by the piece) and Sashimi. Unlike other buffets where they tried to cut corners by making sushi ahead of time and placed them in the fridge, Koy Wan has four sushi chefs preparing fresh sushi and sashimi in front of you. 2)They have a huge selection of seafood, vegetables, beef, pork, etc. for the hibachi grill. Again, they have two chefs custom cook the food for you. 3)Besides Japanese sushi and sashimi, hibachi, they also all the famous Chinese dishes you find in a Chinese buffet. 4)Their decor is second to none in FL. They have a large indoor koi pond with waterfall where you can watch colorful koi fishes play.

 Bayridge Sushi Terrible x2 
by David Ginsburg ( 1 review )
 June 19, 2012 Living in Avalon Park, we were thrilled when an apparent upscale Sushi restaurant was moving in. Sadly, after two times, we&apos;ve decided to part ways. On our second visit tonight, the following happened: 1) Told that the offers that were available, weren&apos;t. Or, technically, the way they are written is poor (Kids Eat Free-Mondays and Early Bird Dine In) 2) Given a waiter who had no idea what the specials were. 3) Ignored by waiter multiple times, even trying to flag him down. 4) Were not given any silverwear until the main course. See #3 - Tried to get silverwear and was ignored. 4b)Silverwear was dirty and had foot still on them. 4 out of 5 forks were this way. 5) When the waiter did come, he never asked how we were, simply just coming in, taking plates. It was a shock to get a refill. 6) Subpar food for the second time. During our second visit, we also saw three other tables express frustration at our waiter for forgotten food and issues with service. Management does not seem to even care about the issues with the waitstaff and or the lack of restaurant issues.

 Aji Hibachi steak and chicken by wherethespamlives ( 1 review )
 June 18, 2012 - I joined urbanspoon just now specifically to write this review. Our meals were $18 each, and both our orders were wrong and the service was horrible: We entered the restaurant asking for two for Hibachi. They seemed annoyed and confused at the idea of finding a spot for only two people, and after some waiting and stumbling around, they offered either two seats far from the hibachi part (watching the chefs backside the whole time) or waiting 20 minutes for more people to arrive to make it worth their time. Great start. We took the bad seats. The waitress took our orders: two steak and chickens with no noodles--double rice instead. The soup was fine, the salad was fine, and then the chef came out. He plopped the white rice on the table, and I immediately knew it wasn&apos;t going to be enough given the size of the group we were sat with. We were served last, and my husband got a small/regular portion and I got about one and a half servings. For $18 per plate, this was not good. The rice tasted fine. I had to hunt down anyone working there. The hostess was sitting at a table chatting with friends and I had to ask her to get our server. It took a long time for her to finally come, and I told her about the rice situation. She brought the chef rice to cook some more, but by then he had moved on and refused her. He started with the chicken and I kindly asked for teriyaki sauce. Without so much as turning to face me, he abruptly said&quot;It already comes with it&quot;, and that was that. The chicken was really dry and peppery (not spicy, just too much pepper. It tasted overwhelmingly like pepper and plain dry chicken.) I also was served last from the group and got less than everyone, but it&apos;s fine. It was nasty anyway. Meanwhile, a plate of fried rice came from the kitchen. It was horrible. Not sure what was wrong with it, but the flavor was really off and the whole thing was kind of gooey and wet, tasting the way dishwater smells. Then he asked how everyone wanted their steak, but he ignored me. I flagged down the waitress to ask if he had the order right and she disappeared for a very long time (not sure why she didn&apos;t ask him or check right there. I would have asked him myself, but he had already been rude and dismissive a few times, so I was done dealing with him). After everyone had been served but me and was halfway through the meal, she came with refills on drinks. I had to point at my plate and ask about my steak, this after the chef was already cleaning the hibachi. Clearly put out, he put another steak on when she brought it, and I asked for teriyaki sauce with that. He again didn&apos;t bother to acknowledge my request, but at least he did it. His explanation for the oversight?&quot;Oh sorry. I didn&apos;t notice you.&quot; Yeah. I know. He never asked anyone how the food was and didn&apos;t offer refills on the white and ginger sauces, so that my husband had to ask him for more--then the rest of the table asked for more, too. The waitress came with the checks and asked if we wanted a box for the barely touched rice, to which I said (politely, mind you!)&quot;that&apos;s ok, the rice was really bad actually, so no thanks&quot;. She just said&quot;you&apos;re welcome&quot;and went away. Really?? The other people in the big group at our table also seemed to have issues and were joking about the food, but nobody ever asked anyone how it was, and everyone was too polite to say anything. This is NO way to run a restaurant.

 Kobé Japanese Steakhouse&amp;Sushi Bar Repeat Customer 
by Incognito ( 7 reviews )
 June 17, 2012 - We eat at this location almost once a week. We always request the head chef Koji but if he is not available the other chefs are just as good. The food portions are great but just tonight we realized they started including an 18% gratuity even for a party of two people. We normally are good tippers anyway but I do not feel as if they should automatically include what they think their services are worth. However, this will not keep us away, we LOVE this place! Also they have happy hour on appetizers and drinks from open - 6pm and 9pm - close. If you go after 9pm you can also get the dinner for 2 for $35 which includes steak, chicken, and shrimp.

 Eastern Pearl too pricey 
by lisa ( 1 review )
 June 17, 2012 I went today with my family for lunch. I will not say the food is bad but its nothing to write home about. The dinners only have white or brown rice. No egg roll come with the dinner. we had to order the food we wanted Ala Carte.The typical dinner is 13.00 fro just chicken and rice. Tea is not included with the meal and fortune cookies come in a plastic wrap like at a fast food place. Not impressed at all. I will continue my search for a Chinese rest like the ones they have up north.

 Bonsai Sushi mobile review

 June 16, 2012 - Still the best in town. Try their sashimi cuts. We&apos;ve been to at least 20 Orlando metro area Japanese restaurants, and we keep coming back for their high quality food and friendly service. Love their owners as well.

 Imperial Dynasty Chinese Restaurant and Lounge Tasteless food, terrible service 
by Kay S. ( 2 reviews )
 June 16, 2012 - First they delivered Won Ton soup when we ordered Hot N Sour soup. The delivery guy then dropped off sushi and a salad instead of correct soup, came back a couple of minutes later when he realized what he did. The soup was tasteless and had a gel consistency. The fried rice was not done and dry, the raw rice and raw shrimp also had no flavor. Does no MSG mean no flavor? Imperial Dynasty is off our list forever, we&apos;ll go back to China Gate where we&apos;ve had nothing but good food for years.

 Sushi Storm Thai + Japanese Restaurant Good New Restaurant in town 
by SS ( 5 reviews )
 June 15, 2012 - I thought the restaurant was closed. It is used to be Gekko Sushi. It is now under new owner, new name, and new menu. I gave it a try. So I visited the restaurant couple times in the last few weeks. The place is updated which look much better than before and foods are reasonable priced and more variety. Server and manager are very friendly. I will go back again.
