 5 Things You Need to Know About Fast Food 
 Aug 11, 2011 | By jeanie casison 
1. Paying a Price for Convenience 

With the busy lifestyle of most people, it&apos;s hard to find time to focus on nutrition. But if you frequently find yourself sitting in the drive-through line at a fast food restaurant, you need to think about the long-term health consequences that fast food creates. High fat foods lead to heart disease. High levels of sodium lead to high blood pressure, heart attacks and stroke. And it all leads to obesity, which has reached epidemic proportions and is of particular concern in children.
 
2. Super Size Equals Super Bad 

It&apos;s so easy to think, &quot;For only pennies more, I can have extra large!&quot; But the amount of calories in a super-sized meal comes close to what most of us should be consuming in a whole day; much less for an individual meal. Since the calories are largely made up of fat, sodium and carbs, you&apos;ll find yourself hungry again much sooner than if you&apos;d eaten a healthier meal. It&apos;s easy to see a number of reasons why eating fast food on a regular basis leads to obesity.
 
3. Fast Food Addict? 

Do you ever find yourself craving fast food? Research is showing changes in the brain of those who regularly eat foods high in fat and sugar. The body normally produces hormones that tell us when we are full. But the more fat and sodium we consume seems to trigger an immunity to the signals these hormones produce. Other hormone levels affected by high fat consumption seem to make us crave even more fat, and making it worse is the low energy level that a high-fat diet brings. The effect is that it becomes a vicious cycle of eating high fat foods, craving more, then not being able to work it off because all that fat is making us tired.
 
4. Healthier Alternatives 

There are healthier alternatives to a traditional burger and fries. But let&apos;s not confuse &quot;healthier&quot; with &quot;healthy.&quot; A three-piece chicken breast strip entree is &quot;healthier&quot; than a burger, but with 20 grams of fat and 930 milligrams of sodium, it&apos;s hardly considered healthy. And some chicken sandwiches are surprisingly higher in fat and calories than a burger. Even salads can quickly fall into an unhealthy category when you pile on a dressing loaded with fat and sugar.
 
5. Everything in Moderation 

Grabbing a fast food meal once in awhile when you&apos;re traveling or when your schedule is tight won&apos;t have much of an effect on your health. But if fast food is a regular part of your diet, you might want to consider the health ramifications. The key is being well-informed before you walk into a fast food restaurant so you can make better choices. A little Internet search will help you to decide ahead of time what to order. A little pre-planning to allow the time to eat a healthy meal, or packing a healthy alternative to eat on the road is more than worth the effort.
