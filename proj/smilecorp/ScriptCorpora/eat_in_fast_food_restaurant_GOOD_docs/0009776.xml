 Reviews For KFC Corporate Office 

 dave 7/5/12 
 I visited KFC in Viva shopping mall Shuangjing, Beijing China today the 5th July 2012.
I asked for 2 chicken legs and a drink.
The two legs were put on the counter.
One of these had no meat on it and they still wanted full payment.
I had major difficulty with what looked like all the staff to have it replaced.

Why did they think they could cheat an expat? 



 Brooke 6/1/12 
 Tonight my family of 5 visited Kfc in REEDLEY. CA. WE had never been to a kfc before. Our whole family had the bucket, and Cole slaw. We all were sick with the runs and stomach gramps. Called the manager. He didn&apos;t even care. He has no business working with the public. If he worked for my business he would have been fired for the way he spoke to me.

 Dear Sir / Madam,

KFC is celebrating its 15th anniversary in Pakistan. On this occasion KFC has introduced a meal, MEAL BOX @ PKR 500 each, with instant gifts through scratch cards.

I regret to inform you that I bought three meal boxes from KFC BHERA outlet on May 6,2012 and got three scratch cards. I won one key chain and two Panini burgers through scratch cards. The KFC counter staff/ official gave me the key chain and two printed vouchers, bearing the picture of Panini burger, redeemable on all KFC outlets in Pakistan. On May 08,2012 I visited KFC Thokar Niaz Beg outlet, situated in Lahore and presented those valid vouchers for redemption. The counter staff / order taker refused to redeem those vouchers without any excuse. I talked to the floor manager and he also refused and said that he had to confirm it from the head office. After-wards, the manager told me that he had talked to head office and they had not allowed me to redeem those valid vouchers. He scolded and humiliated me as well on the floor of the KFC outlet. It was really a disgusting situation for a KFC customer.

I lodged my complaint through KFC UAN and also talked to KFC high officials in Pakistan, Mr. Sohail Masood cell # 03008401066 and Mr. Shah Rukh cell# 03008430014.

No one in the esteemed hierarchy of your food chain ( Pakistan Chapter ) is ready to address my complaint / apprehensions.

You are kindly requested to take an appropriate action at the earliest.

Note: I have all the documentery evidence with me and I reserve the right to go to the honourable court of law.

Regards

Nabeel Sabir

Pakistan.

 For the 3rd time I have gone to the wauconda il kfc and they have either not had any pot pies or they only have two. I need 4 for my family and tonight I was told that it would be a 22 minute wait. I talked to the manager and was told that if we needed more than 2 pot pies we had to call ahead of time and order them for pick up...its kfc! Its fast food! Have it ready or start taking reservations.

 KFC, Limonite Ave, Riverside,CA
Against my better judgement-while out running errands I ran in here for lunch.
While standing at the counter waiting for my order I observed the following.
THe shift manager (little black uniform) was running all over doing this and that.

She opened the drive thru window with her hands, she adjusted her headset, she adjusted the volume on her speaker at her waist unit, she used a filthy rag and wiped off the counter, she handled money, she packed bags and then with HER BARE UNWASHED HANDS--she proceed to remove FOOD out of the warmer....no gloves, no tongs WITH HER FILTHY DIRTY BARE HANDS and NEVER left my sight to wash her hands!

I filled out their &quot;Your opinion counts&quot; thing on my receipt and got a call back from the next SHIFT MGR with a canned speech --sorry you didn&apos;t enjoy your visit and we are sending you a free meal. I asked for the store manager. She said &quot;oh she is on vacation&quot;...I said until when ??...the answer was MONDAY --

I said have her call me---and hung up! I think I need to go higher---this is disgusting! 



 Tricia L. 6/10/12 
 My husband and I went to the KFC in Hyannis, MA. I spent $8.99 on a Variety Meal; to include a breast for an additional charge. I could not believe what I was given when I got home: a piece of chicken the size of what would be in an order of wings and NO chicken breast that I the paid extra for. I called KFC and the MGR. told me that I would have n problem verifying that he was to give me two breasts and two sides for free, and there was a note to be left, on his desk until I came in for it at my convenience. The mgr. at KFC lied telling us that no male managers work there and she knew that I was referencing toThursday Night. My spouse said that the female manager was looking at me like I had three heads and in front of all those people. We were promised the meal due to a bad order to begin with with the main item missing from the order. 



 ANM 6/10/12 
 The manager of the Kfc in west memphis arkansas is sexual with his employees! I could&apos;ve sworn in the handbook that that is a no tolerance thing! 



 6/10/12 
 i went to KFC in anderson,sc and i ordered 3-3pc chicken fing. combos and alot of other items. They only gave me a 3 pc ch. combo. So they had me pull up. I waited 20 min. and then backed up to the window. Nobody ever came to the window even tho the girl was looking at me. Finally she opened the window and said i&apos;m sorry, we forgot about your order. She said they didnt tell me it was up. So i had to wait on them to cook some more ch. fingers bc they gave my to the cars after me. So in all i was there about 40 in the drive-thru. They rest of the food other than the tenders were old and cold. I will NEVER eat at this KFC again. They need to clean house. Especially the management!!!! 



 PT 6/11/12 
 Today, my dad and I went to the KFC in Warner Robins, GA so that we could get the two extra sides that came with the 10pc meal as seen in the television promotion. We were really excited, but at the same time a little wary of this KFC because of a previous visit where we couldn&apos;t get anything we wanted. The restaurant, however, ran out of most of their sides (including macaroni and coleslaw, which we really wanted). We ended up with the extra sides being small sizes of things we never really ordered before. When we got home, we discovered another problem: the chicken didn&apos;t have the flavor it should have. We weren&apos;t about to go back and exchange the chicken (since we didn&apos;t get the sides we wanted anyway), so we dealt with. It&apos;ll be a really long time before we go back to KFC. I&apos;d suggest that maybe when there are promotions for extra sides on a meal that extra food be delivered to all the restaurants (Better to have a little extra than none at all at six o&apos;clock in the evening. This restaurant closes at ten.) 



 candy hanson 6/11/12 
 I would like to tell someone that we need a kfc somewere near siren wis. All we have is subway and dq. And everyone i know loves kfc i think it would do teal good here thank you candy hanson 



 Kaddi Sanders 6/11/12 
 I am sick and tired of sex and or anger/violence being used to sell family products. What happened to the good ole guy attitude instead of pist off people making a point. The world has enough of that going on every day and it is nice to escape reality for a little old fashion kindness. What kind of example does your commercial set for the young kids?? Not much of one!! I just happened to pick up chicken today at my local KFC and the food was good. Saw your new commercial tonight and regret that I helped support KFC and the attitude that goes with it. Trust me, I could come up with a much better sell for KFC and it wouldn&apos;t cost you thousands of dollars to come up with something less offensive. I respect a company that has confidence in their product and willing to let it sell itself without being caught up in anger, hatred, and violence. Enough is enough!! 



 Daryl Price 6/12/12 
 The KFC in Galax, Va. Has delicious chicken and sides. Especially the Cole slaw and green beans 



 Vicki 6/16/12 
 I thought I&apos;d take a moment to commend you on what I know as your newest commercial, I really enjoy it! But trying to find a way to drop you a quick note is the pitts, so I hope you can read this. The &quot;grampa&quot; and &quot;grandson&quot; being so much alike is really cute to the very end, where g-pa grabs g-son&apos;s arm to stop him from getting the last bisquit!(sorry if that is spelled wrong) Don&apos;t mind watching that one at all. KUDOS to the idea person and the one who cast the actors...grampa looks kind of familiar..should I recognize him from something else? 



 Tony Carapinha 6/18/12 
 I can not understand why? I still did not get an answer form these Guy&apos;s, does the KFC not have the same standards in Poland (http://www.kfc.pl), Krakow as the rest of the world. See my third e-mails.

I&apos;am still waiting for a reply to my concern (see below) that I sent to your Website . If they do not reply, I will be forced to call Kentucky or elsewhere at the Cooperate Headquarters. I want the is issue resolved , this is my second e-mail...So far noted. impressed ....Tony

My complaint.....
I&apos;am a Business from Canada living here in Poland, I&apos;am also a Restaurant expert (http://www.krag.nets.pl/tony/welcome.html, not finished site ) . I took 3 of my visitors to the KFC 33 Florianska UL , Krakow Poland on June 11 at 11:30pm and on ordering a big bucked side of fries for 4 Persons in addition to my chicken, cost approx 65Pln., they gave me only 3 packs of ketchup. They refused to gave me any more, but 3 times they where pushing and pushing the 3-sauce packs on us, which I told them repeatedly &quot;no&quot;. In the end &quot;we had to pay &quot;extra for more ketchup&quot; . This is completely pity-full for KFC....If I do not get a reply, I will write your USA HeadOffice. I have been with KFC for years all around the world, but &quot;never&apos; did I get this type of treatment. Really up-set...Tony 



 John Q. Public 6/18/12 
 I went to the KFC on West Ave. in Lockport N.Y. many times over the past years. There was never any CHICKEN! Now they built a new location on Transit Rd. also in Lockport N.Y. I thought to myself &quot;This could be a good thing.&quot; Well, different dog, same fleas. They substitute wings for thighs, and breasts in the bottoms of 12 piece buckets, NEVER have Mac&amp;Cheese, and absolutely no butter for biscuits. This is more than an isolated incident. It is a chronic situation with all KFC&apos;s. The lack of Managers visible on the floor, and in the kitchen is evident just by looking. Not to mention ,if you have a legitimate concern. How can they conduct business in this manner? If Public Relations is truly important to the future of the KFC franchise, shouldn&apos;t they treat their public well? I think it&apos;s a shame that this franchise that I grew up with has gone to hell in a bucket without Colonel Harland Sanders. I&apos;m convinced there is no hope for quality at this, or any KFC. So I bid good day, and good riddance to all KFC&apos;s, and will make sure my friends and family go elsewhere. Maybe I&apos;ll grab a burger instead. 



 Katdog 6/19/12 
 KFC in Madison by East Towne mall sucks. I paid 56.40 and all I got was crap. I will NEVER eat KFC again. I also have told all my face book friends not to eat there also. IT TOTALLY SUCKS. I called the store to complain and the manager told me to bad. REALLY???

 Hi ,There is a descrimination in KFC store in 3rd street/Martel in Los Angeles CA. Long time i am buying 8 piece chicken on drive tru and when i ask than they give me honey mustard sauce with it. But when one of my friend &quot;other race&quot;(don&apos;t want to mention) asks the same stuff. They denied saying that we are not supposed to give honey mustard sauce along with 8 peice of chicke. and later they mention that they stopped serving honey mustard sauce in this branch. ITS ALL DESCRIMINATION WHICH IS DANGEROUS TO OUR COUNTRY 



 Thom Clark 7/2/12 
 If your ever in Galesburg, Illinois (why would you be) bypass KFC There about as po-dunk as you&apos;ll ever see or stop in for a coke&amp;a laugh and see for yourself the manager even has his front tooth missing. Geeez can&apos;t KFC&amp;pepsi corporation do any better than this ??? Popcorn chicken is just cut up chicken strips, I watched them do it. Don&apos;t bother KFC I won&apos;t be returning unless I&apos;m taking others there for a laugh before a movie - WHAT A JOKE !!!!! 



 Anna Marie 6/22/12 
 Popcorn chicken was my passion! Sometimes I would get it twice a day. So you can imagine I was infuriated when popcorn chicken was taken off KFC&apos;s menu for a while. We stopped eating at KFC during that period. Then hurrah, popcorn chicken was brought back. But wait - it had changed. I loved the popcorn chicken because of its small crunchy bites. Now, most of the pieces are more like chicken nuggets. Not at all what I want from KFC. I can get those at any fast food restaurant. 



 Ann 6/22/12 
 Very disappointed with recent TV ad that is running. This depicts an elderly man (grandfather) and younger man (grandson) getting into a physical altercation re: what&apos;s for dinner (chicken or Mac n cheese). I think this ad is terrible. As a grandparent, I&apos;m offended!! Shows absolutely no respect for older adult. This ad should be pulled immediately. It is bad and continues to contribute to settling any disagreement with increasing levels of violence.
Our society needs to stand up and say no more. 



 Maury scarborough 6/22/12 
 I just saw your commercial and I am appalled. it is so disrespectful that a young boy would be wrestling with his Grandfather over the merits of mac and cheese vs mashed potatoes and gravy. This is offensive to me as a grandparent and as a consumer.And for the parents to watch happily waiting for the outcome makes it even more repulsive. Is this KFC&apos;s contribution to the breakdown of American values? I love your Original Recipe chicken but HATE the lousy potatoes and gravy and am very tempted to boycott your stores while this is airing. 



 Keisha Jackson 6/22/12 
 Every time I come to the Algiers, Louisiana location they are always cleaning up trying to get out the store at 10:00 on the dot&amp;customers have to wait 10-20 minutes for food. This is very unprofessional&amp;even a t one point I arrived at KFC drive thru a little before 10 pm&amp;they refused to take my order, I believe they are suppose to take your order even if it&apos;s 10:00! Something needs to be done because this location is ridiculous!!!!!!!!! I need I talk to corporate!

 upset customer 6/29/12 
 I have been to the KFC in Davis, CA on Research Park Drive a couple of times, and I will never go back again. The employees are rude and inefficient. The two times I went through the drive-thru, there was no one in line, but I had to wait for a response from the drive thru person. And when I tried to get their attention at the speaker, I was rudely told to wait because if she took my order and had me wait at the window for more than minute she would get in trouble. This happened both times and from two different employees. I am not responsible for their inability to perform their job. If the employee cannot perform their duty as asked, then it is their responsibility and it should not be taken out on the customer. KFC headquarter should review this store. There seems to be an issue with management setting the bar for their employees or the employees cannot perform their duties. 



 Mary Shady From Marshall, Texas 6/29/12 
 As I have been a private mystery Shopper, Your Marshall, Texas Rest. Would have failed the test. Took 30 min. to get Order, Got home, The Order is Wrong. This is not the first time. Nor is it fresh. I call to talk to someone, I was put on Hold without even being asked to hold. Ive been waiting on the phone for 1 Hour. And As Im typing this letter. Im still on hold. If KFC is waiting to get shut down, Just Shut down. Your Busniss has gone down hill, For this past year. You need to Start making surprise visiting your Rest, And check the services, quility of your Food, Everything as inside and out. This is worse then Poor. Not even worth a 1 Star. Matter of fact. it -10 Poorest.I will be calling. Tks Oh by the way, still on hold. Total now on hold. 1 Hour 30 min. I will hang up now. 



 melina hartshorn 6/30/12 
 me and my husband went to kfc and orderd a family meal it was not crispy it was way to moist of breading and the chicken was tasting as if it sat for 5 days and the macaroni and cheese was dry as if it had sat out also!we will never eat there again.lees all the way. 



 Lou C Vaughan 7/1/12 
 This afternoon around 6pm I went through the KFC drive-thru and ordered the meal with two extra sides. I requested mac&amp;cheese and when I got home I did not have the mac and cheese. This is not the first time that I did not get what I ordered thru drive thru. My meal was 22.88. I get home which is about 11 miles one way from KFC and don&apos;t have what I ordered. I have tried calling them on 804-443-3912 which is the number in the phone book and after about 5 rings the phone goes dead. I have called about 10 times and get the same response. I live in Dunnsville Va. If was not worth going all the way back for mac&amp;cheese. 



 Won C. 7/1/12 
 Dear, whom it may concern.

On July 1st of 2012 at 7:20pm, I went to the KFC located in Montgomery rd ellicott city MD. I waited in line for 20 minutes before I got to even order my food and once I stood before the register, Courtney the cashier told everyone that they ran out of all the white meat tht are original. So I ordered the 6piece dark meat crispy so I can get out of the place with my food before my lunch break is over. I had to wait for 10 more minutes and Courtney made another announcement saying that they are out of chicken and that people who ordered the white meat or original have to only wait for 10 minutes and the dark meat crispy chicken will take another 15 minutes. When I asked one of the guy and Courtney why I have to wait 15 more minutes when she stated tht they had my food, she said she gave it out to drive through people who didn&apos;t even wait at all. At this point, Courtney rolled her eyes at me in front of all of the people who were waiting, like I was the dumb person and made a scene out of it by stating I can just get the refund if i dont want to wait. She didnt evn want to sincere apology at all! 5 minutes later, another customer asked if her food was ready, Courtney smiled and said yes you ordered the crispy dark meat so your food is ready. When I asked why she was getting the food before me when she was standing behind the line, Courtney raised her voice and said your food is not ready! Just wait! After 15 minutes, she asked if I wanted original instead so I said I would like to get out fast so yes and she rolled her eyes yet again and said that&apos;s not the right answer. I just want you to say yes or no. She made it very clear that she was not happy with me although I did not give her any attitude or disrespected her at all. I am very upset that I had to wait for 45 minutes in line to get such a bad service and for her to make me so upset and embrassing in front of other people.

All I wanted was to get my food fast from the fast food chain that I now used to like and eat my food in peace. She ruined my mood, made me feel guilty for just asking the questions, and embrassed me in front of so many people. Courtney deserves to be fired and I want sincere apology from the headquarter that I deserve! My email address is wc56950@hotmail.com. I hope I can get a respond from you guys soon.

Sincerely,
Won C.

 To whom it may concer,

My husband and I puchased 10 Hot wings, they were hot, and they were old.

The quality of the chicken was poor, tasted rancid, as if it left over for about two days.

I am very dissapointed, The quality of this KFC does noy deserve any stars as far as Im concerned
no raiting would be sufficient.

Today I visited the KFC at Marion, Ar. On the service Road. There was no one in front of me when I pulled up to the outside order speaker. I ordered an 8 PC. Bucket with mashed Potatoes, Gravy and Slaw. Plus Two small sweet Iced Teas. I was told They did not have but 4 pieces of origional fried chicken, would I take some Extra Crispy? I said Yes. Then I was told there would be a wait for the Iced Tea. I said O.K. I&apos;ll pull over and wait............ WELL after a 50 minute wait I Drove around to the main parking lot, got my cane and hobbled inside to inquire as to where my order was? and why it takes 50 minutes to get KFC Fried chicken and Iced Tea. The manager wanted to know if I had a ticket. I told her NO. I have been sitting outside in the parking lot righr across fron the drive thru window for 50 minute waiting for my order! Whats taking so long? Are you all still plucking the feathers off the chickens.
the on duty shift manager at 5:50 P:M 05-05-12 could not give me an answer as to wher my order was or when it would be ready! The service at this KFC has been an a downwars slide for the last six months.

The next time I want Fried Chicken I&apos;ll Cook it Myself.

I am calling KFC Corporate headquarters on Monday.. 



 Becky Leeper 5/7/12 
 I purchased the 12 piece meal on 4/27, and didnt get what I wanted which was the extra crispy. I was told that it would be 20 minutes, this was at 11 am. I wound up getting original, it was raw and pink when I returned home and had to throw most of it out. I called the 800 number and spoke to Elise, never got a call back from mgmnt. I called your corporate office on wed, and spoke to Anna, and still have yet to speak to any form of mgmnt from your company. Is this how you really handle customer care issues? I shouldnt have to keep doing the follow up with the mgmnt. I work in retail and a big box store and have for the past 15 years, your customer service is lacking and upsetting.

 Shoe Lifts were created back heel pitching wedges that are put inside the sneaker to improve the peak from the foot. Typically, you can use them regarding either beauty reasons or healthcare functions. With a footwear raise, you&apos;ll feel like wearing a higher heeled sneaker. The first concept of these kinds of lifts was descends from escalator sneakers. Should you be looking toward buy a footwear raise, you can get more info regarding them below.

mens Shoe Lifts History

Lift footwear had been the first sort of heel lifts. They were a totally diverse category of sneakers, and they seemed like footwear with program heels. But, the designers think it is difficult to produce escalator footwear with the exact same layout as those of the normal footwear. The design options had been restricted. Therefore, they could not attract many customers. Furthermore, they will found out that a lot of of individuals desired an sole which can be placed inside the typical footwear. Therefore, the manufacturers eliminated the interior soles from your lift sneakers, making a few adjustments so that it will certainly fit into the conventional footwear. Hence, the very first mens Shoe Lifts were created.

At first, the particular insoles weren&apos;t very comfortable. However afterwards, walkfit shoe inserts with increased comfortable components started visiting the market. Also, they were available too in a number of sizes and also height. On one hand, the products dished up the same advantages as that of the particular elevator sneakers. Alternatively, you can substitute the lift type with one thing trendier. Thus, these types of walkfit shoe inserts shot to popularity actually quick. Apart from helping your own pumps, these kinds of shoe inserts will even assistance the mid-foot ( arch ) as well as remove virtually any discomfort inside the foot or perhaps lower-leg.
Kinds of mens Shoe Lifts

Over time, the general type and appearance of the walkfit shoe inserts have altered a lot. These kinds of shoe card inserts have become obtainable in 3 various varieties - easily-removed, total as well as 50 percent sneaker inserts.

Easily-removed insoles usually have greater than One layer, as well as the height can be altered. If you want more elevation, it is possible to increase that by adding levels. If you wish to slow up the peak, you can eliminate layers as you desire. The particular advantage is that you could have a custom made look on a regular basis. These kind of mens Shoe Lifts can be produced because equally half and also full elevates.

Another kind of elevate will be the complete insole lift. The insole handles the complete interior part of the ft .. Fortunately that you will not seem like you might be putting on a top heeled footwear. These kinds of lifts will give you the style as well as sense regarding located on any program sneaker. They&apos;re also more comfortable when compared to the other sole types.

50 percent insole is an additional type of raise insole. That handles merely the high heel of the foot. When you use these kinds of [url=http://join.com.nu/member/blog_post_view.php?postId=972 ]Shoe lifts [/url], you will feel like sitting on a top high heel. In terms of comfort, they aren&apos;t just like another kinds of shoe inserts. But, they may be used in just about any shoes and so are a lot more adaptable.

Whichever substance you select for the [url=http://1parentdating.com/dolph/blogs/entry/Everything-Regarding-Leg-Length-Discrepancy ]height increasing insoles [/url], you can rely on that to accomplish the career.

 I&apos;m a fan of KFC, but don&apos;t go near as much since they have discontinued their peppercorn mayo sauce. I drive throughout the day for work and would stop at KFC 1-2x&apos;s/wk just for the sandwiches w/ peppercorn mayo. I know it was popular and not sure why it was discontinued. I now go once a month. Wish you would bring it back!!!!!! 



 Phil Rogers 5/22/12 
 Your KFC on the South Trail in Venice, Florida is run by the biggestr bunch of crooks in Florida. We have been getting orders from there for a number off years, and basically always paying the same price. They got a new manager about 2 -3 wks ago&amp;he told me last week that they were goingt to raise the price on the product we buy. Went in tonight&amp;placed the order&amp;sure enough he had raised it by 40%. I told him thanks but no thanks and went down to WalMart&amp;got my chicken for even less than we were paying before..and idin&apos;t have to put up with the egotistical attitude. 



 john servizio 5/22/12

 Holly Mann 5/23/12 
 😡Very very disappointed about my experience this afternoon, not only did they get my order wrong, but they left out my sides and the biscuits were dry. So I call to tell them n the manager tells me that I have to bring the food back and he will replace it w the correct chicken. So I asked are they going to give me some money back or compensate me in anyway n he tells me no because according to the receipt the order is correct, and I say well it&apos;s not my fault that your employee took my order wrong n he tells me well it dosent matter because according to the receipt your order is correct. Then he actually said you should have checked the order.😳I couldn&apos;t believe it. 



 Lo Hilt 5/8/12 
 I went to the local KFC today for lunch. I went through the drive up service lane and went back to work. When I sat down to eat my lunch I discovered that my chicken was very dry and probably very old as well. It was not even edible. They need to learn to treat their customers as they would like to be treated. I sure they no one there would have eaten that chicken. 



 Denise Richardson 5/8/12 
 East Moline, Illinois KFC
I ordered through the drive through, two pot pies. When I got home, there may have been 1/4 cup of pot pie sauce in one and the top crust was suck to the bottom. The second, maybe had 1/3 cup of pot pie mix and the top did not appear sunk in. I called KFC of East Moline and the manager said to me that the man who made them had gone home for the day. He stammered a bit and then asked if I wanted to come back. I told him I lived six miles away and was not returning tonight. He then stammered some more and said would I like one replacement! I was MAD and told him, no, I didn&apos;t want &quot;A&quot; replacement, but he better check the rest of the pot pies. What I should have told him, was that he LOST A CUSTOMER FOR GOOD this time. This isn&apos;t the first time this place has gipt us! I asked him, don&apos;t you have to weight the contents??? He replied there should be 10 to 11 ounces. This KFC is a disgrace to all KFC establishments and should be closed down. The chicken parts are banti hens at best (very small chickens). Sometimes you get a tablespoon of mash potatoes. I really have no idea why I ever returned, but this time was the last! If you don&apos;t go out and do quality control checks on this establishment, then KFC will disappear one day, but don&apos;t wonder why it is, okay, you have been told. The telephone number, I believe, is 309-796-0055. Second thought, what an INSULT to be offered one replacement for two bad products!!!!! I will definitely tell my church friends and my colleague to stay away from KFC! 



 Connie 5/10/12 
 This is regarding your Fairfield, CA store (PE720465)om Sunset. I have not ever gone to this particular KFC and received at the least good customer service. The employees at this location act as though they are doing the customer a favor when they APPROACH (not greet)a customer. I am vision impaired and I when asked about a specific item on the menu I was told by the server, it is located on the menu under... Sad to say, I did not go any futher with my order and the only reason I did not cancel what I already ask for (was served in a manner not very presentable) was because I NEEDED to eat right then.
I hate going to this KFC store and only stop if I have absolutely no other choice. I have also had the drive through person give me a price different than what I get if I go inside. WHAT&apos;S UP WITH THAT! I cannot have fried chicken for health reason and I love KFC grilled chicken, but I rather take my chances eating your competitors fried chicken than to continue receiving such unprofessional and ungrateful service from your employees. What is even sadder is that it is not just one employee but all that I have encountered at this store. It almost seems like people with no personality are sought out to work at this store.
As good as KFC may be, this store leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 



 Jamie Johnson 5/14/12 
 I visited the KFC in Radcliff ky and they were horrible!!!! They are rude and not accommodating at all! They refuse to try to make orders accomidating to people who have special needs. I will never eat there again and I will make sure everyone I know is aware of the less then customer service friendly atmosphere! Thank the lord there is another chicken establishment so close to them who are happy to accommodate a simple request of a side of cheese! 



 permila kaur 5/17/12 
 I went to KFC in Surrey,BC(Nordel Way)last week to purchase a burrito.the cashier was so nice n helpful with a lovely smile but when time came to give my food i asked a person serving me her name was (aman)on the name tag was so rude and disrespected me when i asked her about the burrito that does it contain any lettuce on it.please advice kfc staffs to show respect to customers. 



 Catherine Pittsburgh, P 5/18/12 
 What kind of contest are they running anyhow????????????? You put in your code and then they ask you to type the 2 words you see. One is readable and the other is totatlly impossible to read and I tried with at least 20 different words. What a scam. You are absolutely right about the chicken not tasting like it should and mine was dripping in grease. Had to take 2 pepcids to get rid of the heartburn from the grease. KFC can put their sweepstakes in a bucket and deep fry it. 



 Dave H 5/20/12 
 I just saw a commercial and decided to google &apos;how to sue KFC for false advertising&apos;. Most recently you have put a commercial on tv saying you give away a &quot;free&quot; drink. That&apos;s a LIE! When I went to the drive thru, i asked for the 2 pieces of chicken, 2 sides and a biscut, plus a &quot;free&quot; drink...I&apos;m going to puke in my mouth. Do you rapist realize how dumb you are ALL making yourselves seem? All you do is over price everything else, which covers the soda, which would honestly cost a few cense anyway. I&apos;m sick of a lot. Sick of the Obama administration, sick of high gas prices (b/c of the obama admin) and I&apos;m also sick of fakes that rip and take advantage of people like me. SHAME ON ALL OF You! 



 EDWARD DEWEY LINVILLE 4/26/12 
 ACTUALLY I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE THE KFC STORE I VISITED TODAY A STAR AT ALL IF I COULD.
I VISITED THE KFS RESTERRAND, STORE # H950005 AND THE YOUNG LADY AT THE DRIVE THROUGH WINDOW , CASHIER: DESIREE, WAS VERY DISRESPECTFULLY TO ME. I LET HER KNOW THAT I HAD A $10.00 COUPON FOR A 10 PIECE BUCKET OF CHICKEN, AND SHE SAID THAT KFC DOESN&apos;T HAVE $10.00 BUCKETS OF CHICKEN WITH A COUPON. i FEALT THAT SHE WAS RUDE AND DISRESPECTFULL TO ME. i DROVE 5 MILES TO YOUR STORE AND 5 MILES HOME. AND WHEN I GOT HOME I DISCOVERED THAT I HAD ONLY 8 PIECES OF CHICKEN. SO I DORVE BACK TO KFC AND EXPLAINED TO THE STORE MANAGER WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND HE TOO WAS VERY SHORT WITH ME. THE CHICKEN I RECEIVED WAS TINY PIECES AND COLD.
I HAVE BEEN BUYING CHICKEN FROM KFC BEFORE IT WAS CALLED KFC, KENNY KINGS, AND I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS TYPE OF SERVICE OR DISRESPECT BEFORE UNTIL NOW.
I FEEL THAT YOU NEED TO REVIEW STORE # H950005, AND MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE WAY YOUR PEOPLE ADDRESS THE CUSTOMERS. 



 John B 5/2/12

 I worked for kfc/taco bell in herk.Ny.I have been working since I was 15yrs. Old an I have never been so degraded,dis respected an talked about at any other place of employment in my life.By the business Manager her self.She is the worst person I have ever worked for.I have witnessed her telling cooks too cook moldy expired chicken that stunk so bad the cooks would complain.Moldy tomatoes she would just say scrape it off and use the bottom layer..Ew..I told my friends and family to stop eating there like my 3rd month there.And they no longer do.After my cousin and her son getting very sick after eating the chicken.The whole place is gross,they either need to shut down or get someone who actually cares about the place and not the people and all their drama or causing it! Hire other then high schoolers who actually need and want to work! 



 Valencia (vnbaker@hotmail.com) 4/9/12 
 Back in February of this year I was discriminated against in one of your stores. 2 of my good friends and I were on our way back home from a weekend in Las Vegas, NV and we stopped at the KFC/Taco Bell restaurant in Primm, NV due to traffic. One of my friends didnt want to get out of the car, so she handed me her debit card and pin and asked me to get her 3 hard shell tacos. When we got in line I noticed there was a white lady already at the register ordering her food when she was done ordering I noticed she didnt show her ID card with her credit/ debit card. My friend was in front of me and she went to another register. I went to the register where the white lady just finished ordering her food from. I told the cashier that I had 2 separate orders, the first was just 3 hard shell tacos. I went to pay with my friends debit card and was going to put the pin number in and she asked me for ID. I said when you started showing ID with debit card purchases. She replied we ID everyone. I said really because you didnt ID the lady that was just up here. She said again, we ID everyone. I said yea, ok and asked her to add my meal on to the bill. I paid with my debit card showing her my ID card the total price of my meal including the 3 hard shell tacos was only $12 and some change. While we were waiting for our meals to be made, I noticed 2 white men behind me in line they first guy paid with cash, the second guy paid using a debit/ credit and she didnt card him. When I saw that I asked to immediately speak to the manager.
When I spoke with the manager he told me that they check everyones ID. I said thats a great policy, but you dont follow it, because out of 3 people in the line I was the only on IDd. My friend who went into the restaurant with me and was on the other line told him that the register she went to the casher didnt ID her and she tried to give her ID with her credit card and he told her it was necessary. I then told the manager he needed to fix the problem; he then walked away and continued to prepare food. So I then asked for his name and the cashiers name and let them know that I would be calling the corporate office the next day about the discrimination and racial profiling I just endured in this store.
The following Monday I called the corporate office and let them know of the discrimination/racial profiling that I had to deal with in one of their stores. They told me that they were going to escalate the information and I should hear something from them. 2 weeks had gone by and still nothing. I then called again and I received the same line we will escalate this up and we will get back to you. Well, I havent heard anything yet. I called just last week (2 April 2012) about 6 weeks after the incident and again I am being told sorry, that you havent heard anything and we will escalate this matter. I then told the supervisor, that I am a active duty soldier and I will be going to JAG (which is the Army justice system) and will be talking with an attorney, because this makes no sense that a customer has been discriminate against and nothing has happened thus far.
At this point I am putting this on paper and will be following up with my appointed attorney and will be looking to sue for discrimination if this matter is not settled within in the next 7 days of receipt of the letter.

 I am not rating on the quality of food. To be honest I don&apos;t eat there often. I do however have a boy that recently worked for the branch in Cherokee, NC. He began working in December of last year. I know for a fact that this boy has inquired several times about the tax papers he was supposed to have recieved for the time he was employed in 2011. He has yet to recieve these papers here it is the 7th of April and the tax deadline soon approaches. Procrastination seems to be the key element here. This person&apos;s name is Quincey Wildcatt. This is my first attempt with corporate and would hope that with the time issues in the matter that your office could help expedite a resolution to this problem. Thank you. signed Minda Everhart

 The KFC in Watkins Park Shopping Center, Upper Marlboro, Maryland is the worst I&apos;ve ever been to! They are extremely slow and inefficient! The drive thru line wraps around the building only because they are so slow! Going inside is even worse! The odor when you walk in the door is disgusting! If you don&apos;t lose your appetite and go through the second door, there&apos;s a line for no apparent reason! Then they have the nerve to run out of chicken! What chicken restaurant runs out of prepared chicken??? I absolutely love KFC chicken and lady night, I walked out of that KFC after waiting 20 minutes in line, finally getting to the window, placing my order, then being told 5 minutes later &quot;we&apos;re out of dark meat chicken&quot;! There was only one person working the counter and he was overwhelmed. I could see there was much chicken up, but surely they must be preparing more, right? It was 9:20 pm; they close at 11:00! Every time I go there, I say it&apos;s the last time, but last night was it! That place needs to be mystery shopped! They ignore customer complaints and are getting progressively worse! People pull out of the drive thru because it&apos;s so slow and walk inside, turn around and leave because it smells so bad or the line is so long! They force me to go to Popeyes or Bojangles! I&apos;m done with the Watkins Park KFC! 



 Kenneth Medd (krmedd@juno.com) 4/3/12 
 This is to comment on the extremely poor meal I had at the OnNut Sukhumvit KFC in Bangkok, Thailand, a few minutes ago (store 01346, invoice 259968). I have been a big KFC fan for a long time so when I sat down at the table and looked at what was in front of me, I was very very disappointed. This was for an 89 Baht thigh/wing meal. 1. The chicken: If you drive the back roads in Thailand, you will see all over many scrawny birds and you wonder how they survive. I think that my portion came from one of these chickens. Very little meat. 2. The French Fries: They come in a small paper KFC sack. There were almost none sticking out over the top of the bag so, just for grins, I counted them. There were 31 fries, 17 of which were in the 1 inch range. This is pretty bad!!! 3. The soda: no comment one way or the other... a typical soft drink. The taste was typical &quot;original&quot;. In summary, while the locals may not comment because Thai&apos;s do not like confrontation, I would hope that a supervisor examine the product at this store. 



 Robin Turner 4/3/12 
 I certainly don&apos;t mine calling when the food sucks, but today. . . It was without a doube the best chicken I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The chicken breast was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. The legs were sooooooo goooood!!!! The slaw had the perfect tang, the potatoes were the perfect consistency and the biscuits were tender, and the crust was crispy. The TEA was mellow and perfect. Just the way I like it. If I died today. . it would be a fine day to do so, with a meal so good. It was a Jesus meal; it was so good. Good, Good, Good!!!!!!!!! 



 Susan Jones 3/21/12 
 Horrible.. horrible.. service on several occasions at KFC in Monore, LA. on Desiard St. 30 minute in drive thru line AFTER ordering..finally get to window, pay for order of chicken fried steak only to be told that it will still be ANOTHER 2 minute wait because they didn&apos;t cook it when first ordered..NO THANK YOU..refund my money and give me a number to call..this is NOT the first time something like this has happened , but it will be my last visit to this location!!!..normally they take your order and you wit for 20 minutes only to be told it will be another 15 minutes for chicken to be cooked..you have got to be kidding me...what are they doing there except standing around taling to each other..so frustrating!!!

 Mexico Kfc&apos;s are terrible
I&apos;m very disappointed in the level of quality of food and service here. I realize these are franchised own however your name is on these places. There&apos;s nooo training we go through drive-thru and the can&apos;t even hear us or say here is your total and proceed to the window. I ordered the two piece meal and the chicken was small and terrible. Also the potatoes taste processed and the cole slaw which in the states is one of my favorite things taste nothing like it. Also No selection on the menu.Very disappointing! I dont know where the quality control takes place but someone needs to inform Mexico City that this is not KFC..again your name is on it. I wont go back. 



 Anass BELHACHMI 3/23/12 
 I would like to say That KFC in Morocco is getting so bad, it&apos;s because i like the company and their products that i&apos;m actually writing this words. The head office should send supervisers in morocco to watch how th quality of the products is bad, we should wait about 30 mn to order, cz There&apos;s only one cashier, the chicken is so bad That we can not eat, the restaurants are not clean at all including the tables and th WCs, one day i&apos;ve ben There at 7 PM and i found no chicken anymore. Please do something, in all th countries i ve been in the past like France saudi arabia Thaland Canada.... Th quality is Well expect in Morocco. Tx a lot. 



 Kathy Knox 3/20/12 
 Ive worked for KFC for the past 5 years. 4 of those years at the Hutchinson, Ks. store. Mickey Montgomery was the manager there for 25 years plus along with her sister Debbie. The two of them work at least 80 hours a week and always have a smile and a nice word for everyone. just recently though, Mickey stepped down and there is a new manager. I had a lot of personnel problems last summer and quit my job but march 9th was rehired on the night shift. There is a young man who says hes deaf in one ear and doesnt always hear what product the shift leader has called to be cooked. he and i already had a problem with each other but Sunday the 18th he acted like he didnt hear me say we needed popcorn chicken down even though he and the other cook looked rite at me. several minetes later he brought the cooked product to the line and said,&quot;heres the popcorn for whoever was whining about it a while ago.&quot; the shift leader was standing next to me and said nothing. The service and attitude of the people working on that shift is mostly &quot;who cares its only KFC. I quit again because i refuse to be part of a crew that could care less if customers are happy with the food and the service and the ruination of the business that two special ladies worked their entire lives to build. Mr.Harlan Sanders would be apauled at the way this store opperates from 4pm to 10pm when all the slackers are working. Saturday at 7pm i had 3 orders that i could not complete in drive thru for 30 minetes. Needless to say a few unsatisfied customers that probly wont be back. I really enjoy working for KFC but not with loosers.

I ordered the Saturday/Sunday &quot;Special&quot; - 10pcs of Chicken @ $11.00.

The person at the Grill gave me 9 pcs. instead. The error happened
because she was not paying attention to what she was doing - due to
too much conversation with her co-workers. The customer service there
leaves a LOT to be DESIRED to say the least. The manager of the place
demonstrated VERY LITTLE concern.

It would be to KFC&apos;S Corporate Headquarters to do an UN-announced
random-spot check of the store&apos;s overall way of doing things!!!

 My husband&apos;s birthday is today. He got a gift card for KFC in the mail so i called the 800 number on the back of the card got the balance and the store that accepted the card. We live in the country so it was a 15 mile drive to get the chicken . When i gave them my card they tried scanning it. Of course they said it would not go thru. I called the 800 number on the back of the card while standing in front of the cashier. They told me to tell them to call the number themselves and get the balance and then they should honor the card. They would not do this and told me that i owed 23 dollars for the chicken . The manager would not come out of the office to speak to me about this. I told them i would be contacting the KFC headquarters and then i would go to POPEYES from now on. I am not going to contact the headquarters and try to get this honored . I cant beleive that the way i was treated and thanked them for disapointing my husband on his bday. What a joke .

 While sitting in your parking lot waiting for one of your employees to get off of work, I observed your employees, your drive thru customers, and the lost sales of people that were going to be customers. It was very obvious that every employee on duty was a teenager, there was NO ADULT supervision, and they were totally unprepared. At no time in the 45 minutes I sat waiting and watching was there ever less than 10 cars trying to either get out of the line or get to the window for their order. This store is located in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and is a disgrace to KFC management! 



 You should give the option of zero stars!!! 3/8/12 
 I went to KFC today in Central California mind you I had in hand a coupon I just printed from the website www.kfc.com. I pulled through the drive-thru and they gave me my total and I handed the guy my coupon, then he says , &quot;we don&apos;t accept these coupons&quot; so I said that&quot;I just printed it from the website so why not?&quot; and then he asked &quot;do you want to talk to the supervisor? &quot; and I said &quot;yes&quot; so I told the supervisor Patty the same information I stated previously and she says, &quot; we don&apos;t accept coupons &quot; of coarse I&apos;m like &quot;that&apos;s false advertising! If you have it on the KFC website mind you I have to enter my zip code in to get the coupons&quot; and she&apos;s states &quot;it says it on the front door&quot; mind you I&apos;m in the DRIVE THRU and have never stepped foot in the place and first time I have ever been to that one!! I told her &quot;if you had time to put a note on the door then why not put one on the drive thru too!!! Her answer &quot;well it&apos;s on the front door&quot; just proves to show some people lack COMMON SENSE and mind you I still paid the full price!!!!! WHAT HAPPENEND TO GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! You should change your name to Killing For Customers because you just lost another one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 



 Paul Ernst 3/4/12

 Cullen Thomas 2/20/12 
 Is it true KFC stopped selling popcorn chicken? I went through the drive through today at a KFC off of mill plain in Vancouver Washington and they told me they no longer serve popcorn chicken. Ive nt seen anything about this matter on tv, the Internet, or any other news source. I feel as they were just being lazy and given today&apos;s economy I know KFC can hire people who actual care about their jobs.

 I am posting this and WILL be calling monday morning! I went to your location on Veterans Memorial BLVD in Killeen TX and had to wait more than ten minutes at the drive through for my food to be givin to me. I was told that crispy chicken was not available and I was fine with that but then I was told that buiscuts were not available as well. The woman who told me this (her name is Rachel by the way) treated me like crap the whole time. Eventually I had to knock on the drive through window to get her attention at which point she treated me like trash giving me attitude. When I said forget the buiscut and just give me the food she cut me off and then started complaining about me to her co-workers Like I couldn&apos;t hear her! If this is the level of service I can expect from the people who work for you then you won&apos;t have to worry about me spending my money with your company any longer 



 JL 2/13/12 
 KFC in Malaysia, disgraceful, unethical, full of rubbish. Beating customers in the premise, unbelievable. Poor management, the CEO should be removed instantly and the staff that harm the customer should be lock up in bars. Do not partonise this restaurant..or should I say boxing ring??
 



 simon lee 2/13/12 
 Malaysia KFC is really really badly managed. Often out of chickens. THey just dont seem to care at all. I used to buy KFC regularly, but have stopped years ago as KFC dun give a sXit abt us. I will tell all my friends and family not to patronise KFC too. WE WILL BOYCOTT KFC!!!!!!!!!!!!! 



 Chee 2/12/12 
 KFC management, for goodness sake, please employ capable managers who can handle the situation properly. In Malaysia as you know recently, your staff assaulted a customer. I am not here to say who is right or who is wrong, but that if the outlet had been properly managed, this could been avoided. This is the root cause. If you want to enjoy my patronage, please improve, or else, many like me have decided to stay away from your outlets in Malaysia because of the way your staff treats the customers. He may be right in his opinion to assault someone but this should not be done with your blessing because he is after all wearing KFC&apos;s uniform. I will never go to KFC because of this until I see that the customer is indeed given proper treatment. How can the management not alert anyone that they will need to wait for the next one hour in line? 



 Exausted employee 2/10/12 
 I have been working for KFC for two years. I am a 32 year old professional that sees this job as my bread and butter, not as mall money or a optional place to go after school. I take extreme pride in my job and yet I get a manager that shows up to work belergerantly drunk, verbally abuseive, and just down right rude and obiously drunk. I do not feel that this is safe by no means nor should any employee be subjected to such mental abuse by anyone. Yes I could find another job, however I have been looking for months and yet no such luck in these efforts. 



 laughing balls 2/10/12 
 Often in a country like malaysia where the staff are majority of the population, at best less schooled but previledged underdogs have to up with a not so small minority population with the spending powers, tensions are usually high. Racial tension I mean.

So it is best the Chinese population,give KFC a miss, so as to not get into a situation like this where the customer was punched. Good for you, too in that you can choose healthier foods.

Best Rgds 



 JY 2/9/12 
 If I can choose, I would prefer not to give any star for Malaysia KFC. After the incident of the unethical way of handling food, now they fight with the customer with weapon on his hand. Now the staff which claim he is representing the part time staff association does not welcome the customer if they are so big mouth on Facebook. To be frank I have lost faith in KFC this time. I will not only don&apos;t eat but I will let all my friends and family aware about all this issue and let the judge. I believe you will know the impact from now. Hope you guys will take this matter very seriously. Else I m sure there will be no more KFC for me for sure. 

 

 Raymond 2/9/12 
 Congratulation to KFC Malaysia become Worlds no. 1 which KFC employees/staff beat customer first time inside KFC restaurant.How can it happen as KFC is a worldwide and Top Brand company.That must be something wrong with your management already. Pls investigate it and give us a satisfy solution.We don&apos;t want enter the KFC restaurant with fear and discomfort feeling. Thanks. 



 Lucas 2/8/12

have been getting the 10 for $10 promotion almost every sat or sun for some time, aswell as meals thru the week, understand the $1 increase, always gotten original mixed, today the price was almost doubled since i want mixed, cashier said the promotion was for dark only, i left with no bucket of chicken, no mention at all whatsoever on large window sign by front door, only says 10 for $11, ANY BUCKET!!! if it was at all on the sign over the counter, it was such small print it was unreadable, this is false and misleading advertising and the colonel would not be a part of it, there are two other fast food stores, Churches and Popeyes, within 1mile of this location that do NOT have to MISLEAD the public, i will NOT support KFC anymore due to this deceitful advertising, even though i grew up on KFC and have patronized this store for a number of years and prefer KFC, hands down, over the other two. I will also bring this to anyone and everyone&apos;s attention in this community where i have lived for over 24 years. As soon as time permits i will contact the Better Business Bureau a swell as any other chat rooms or review sites i can. This is so wrong for a company with the reputation and product that KFC has to fall stoop this low with its advertising and promotions.

 Went to KCF in Mt Healthy area (45231) in Cincinnati Ohio, Placed my order and was told it would take 8-10 minutes for two double downers. I was given complementary drink as I waited. I was there almost an hour!!!

My order was given away by mistake twice!!! Staff was very rude and un-trained.

I was given a full refund however, I will never return to that location again! This was totally unacceptable!!!
 



 Jill 1/30/12 
 Went through drive though in Mn in Moundsview and paid 15.00 for nothing!! They gave us 4 wings two thigh&apos;s and about 6 biscuts. We ordered the meal and that is not a meal! They ripped us off, so went back to talk to the manager, or so called manager there, couldn&apos;t get a straight answer, couldn&apos;t speak english very well, he was also the one that gave us our food, I told him that was not a meal, for that amount of money I should have gotten the whole fricken bird! I am sick of being cheated by this place and I am going to the news with this, because they are ripping off customers that go through drive through windows, not giving what they order, or half orders, then they don&apos;t give out reciepts. Then they fight about it with you, saying they want there damn food back before they give you anything. I think it&apos;s bull and places that have service like this should be shut down! Then he gives me bogus numbers to call to do a complant about them, that is not right, and I will go to the news and slander this company to the fullest and I will make sure my lawyer get&apos;s a hold of this place to take them to court, this is sick! I had to drive 3 miles back to have them give me crap! This is not a company at all, this is a rip off scam fast food joke!

 Hello. I am hearing impaired. When I went to KFC Store # J625009 at 2959 N Beltline Rd Irving, TX 75062, it was my turn so I wrote down what I need, the employee OShanta seemed like that she couldn&apos;t read ENGLISH and had to wait for her manager speaking Spanish with her. O&apos;Shanta let 2 or 3 people go ahead of me. I was there before the people and she should take care of me FIRST. That was very rude and disrespected me. That is not right. They are discrimated against me. The customers need to wait until their turn. The employees should not let other customers ahead of the current customer that is waiting.
Hearing people have to write down their orders. This may take time, but it is no different than people waiting in line and trying to make up their minds on what they want.

ALSO I ORDERED 20 PC CKN AND 8 PC CKN (ORIGIONAL). O&apos;SHANTA PUT CRISPY CHICKEN THAT I DON&apos;T LIKE CRISPY CKN. I LOVE THE ORIGIONAL ONES. I SAW THE KIND OF CHICKEN THAT SHE PUT. I ASKED O&apos;SHANTA IF THE CHICKEN IS ORIGIONAL AND SHE SAID YES. SO I WENT TO CLASS AT CHURCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE CRISPY. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THEM NOT BEING PATIENT AND LYING TO ME.
 



 Steve 1/24/12 
 Wanted some wings to eat before UK&apos;s basketball game came on tonight so, went to KFC and ordered 15..cost me almost 30 dollars! Got home and wanted a couple and on the 2nd one, lo and behold, a big long hair. Now, if I wanted a hair in my mouth I would have went to the local barber shop and licked the frigging floor! They were running around and horseplaying without hair nets on. I am from Ky and USED to love the chicken but guess what?..Once this kid gets burned, he&apos;ll never go back around the fire. As far as I am concerned, KFC can get on the fast train to hell! 



 hughes 1/25/12 
 Do not buy gift cards at the KFC on 350 Hwy and Raytown Road in Raytown Missouri. I gave one to by son in law and when he went to use it they said it was not a valid card. I took my receipt and I also called the number on the back of the card to verify that it had the amount I paid for. It did. I went to the above KFC and asked they what was the matter and they said the machine must have been down but it was up and running now. They did not tell my son in law that the machine was down, just that the card was not a valid card, like it was stolen. Food quality at this place is poor also. Tried to use the gift card at two other KFC&apos;s and they did not know how to run the card. I will give cash next time and will not go back to the one on 350 Hwy and Raytown Rd. 



 P. Fitzpatrick 1/25/12 
 Went through the driveup!

Young man spoke quickly. . .couldn&apos;t understand him. . . .he said &quot;pull forward!&quot;

Had to give my order again!

Got home!

Three chicken legs! One biscuit! Mashed potatoes! Slaw! was my order. cost $7.00

NO NAPKINS NO UTENSILS NO BUTTER FOR BISCUIT



Called KFC. . . . .girl said oh, sometimes they &apos;throw&apos; in utensils. . .sometimes not!

Same with the butter. . .sometimes they &apos;throw&apos; it in!

With so many of our fellow Americans out of work, I would suggest the people who waited on me should be out of work.

 We went to the KFC on Airport Rd. in H.S. AR on sat. night at 6:00 pm the buffet was almost empty terrible service , the counters were dirty.Where is the pride KFC used to have with their business and good customer service ? 



 Daniel Rojas 1/20/12 
 Whole chicken consist of 2 legs, thighs, wings and breast. Why are you cheating customers by excluding breast on all 8 piece orders. Church&apos;s and all others include breast on 8 piece or more. KFC charges the highest pricing and you play us like that. This is happening in Puerto Rico I hope not in USA.

Enganos!!!! Un pollo consiste de 8 prezas; dos patas, caderas, alas y pechugas. Ninguna de las ordenes de 8 prezas le echan pechugas. Church&apos;s y todos los demas que venden pollo incluyen pechugas. Despierta Boricua reclama y no te dejes enganar especialmente de este lugar que cobra mas caro por el pollo que ningun otro. Alerta!!!
 



 Altavista, Va 1/13/12 
 I am very dissappointed and will never eat at this KFC again especially after learning if chicken is dropped on the floor it still has to be cooked! You feed other people this how disgusting! 



 Sarah 1/15/12 
 The chicken I.got was to be extra crip, and make no mistake people that&apos;s exactly what I got.It look like it had been sitting under their light for about 4to5 hours.The juice wasn&apos;t in it,nor did my hands have grease on them from handling it either.WOW first time ever getting no greasy chicken, THis store master no greasy chicken.But took the juice of it away.To really get under my skin my husband ordered a ear of corn with it and got a half ear and charged for a whole ear of corn. Call and spoke to manager and he said that they just started the ear thing about two weeks ago. People wake up they are already high enough.Don&apos;t let this slide demand what you paying for.That so good fresh cooked chicken.Because you are going to pay the price they want.Or you can pay their price and still need to find something to eat. 



 chito 1/10/12 
 why is the picture deceiving from the real thing??? i ordered via delivery a family meal (9 pc. chicken). to my surprise, the pepsi was 2pcs. of 500 ml instead of the 1.5L of pepsi. thi is really a big WHY????? is the intention to fool people??? is it a honest mistake??? if it is a honest mistake, why not change the picture???? would it not be fair to both consumer and KFC???? Shame on you.... 



 1/4/12 
 I just left KFC. I sat at the menu board for 7 mins so I decided to say hello...a young lady stated yes. I asked can I order now she should didn&apos;t I say something. I politely told her I am coming in. When I got inside They did not have a manager on duty spoke with I guess she was a team lead. She informed me that they are not able to speak with the employee in front of the customer. I informed her I can.it do not make ant sense how much fast-food cost and you can not receive a thank . The KFC I visit is located in Monroe la 165 south the young lady with the bad attitude name is jarica abram. I will be contacting the District Manager...

YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THE CUSTOMER IS WHO PAYS YOUR PAY CHECK KFC HAS FORGOTTEN THIS.
I LIVE IN ELLICOTT CITY MD. I WORK OUT AT THE YMCA ACROSS THE STREET FROM KFC STORE #Y320002 PART OF MY WORK OUT PROGRAM IS TO EAT 3500 CALORIES A DAY. SO EVERY TWO DAYS I GO TO THIS KFC. AFTER THE SAME PROBLEM OVER AND OVER I DECIDED TO KEEP TALLY OF WHEN I GO IN WHAT I ORDER AND WHAT KIND OF SERVICE AND STORIES I GET FROM MANAGERS ON DUTY.

DEC.23 2011 WENT IN ORDERED 4 GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST 4 SMALL MASH POTATOES 4 SMALL GREEN BEENS WAS TOLD HAD TO WAIT (18 MIN) SO I DID /ASKED WHY THEY WERE OUT MANAGER SAID ONLY CAN COOK 4 PIECES OF GRILLED CHICKEN AT ONE TIME.

DEC.26 2011 TICKET 2499 WENT IN ORDERED 3 GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST (THAT IS ALL THEY HAD) 4 SM MASH POTATOES 4 GREEN BEEN&apos;S 2 CRISPY SNKR/WEDGES/DRINK DID NOT COMPLAIN JUST TOOK ORDER AND LEFT

DEC. 30 2011 TICKET 2879 ORDERED 2 GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST 2 GREEN BEANS WAITED (22 MIN) ANOTHER CUSTOMER ORDERED 6 PIECE GRILLED WAITED (22 MIN) A THIRD CUSTOMER WALKED OUT. MANAGER SAID THEY CAN ONLY COOK 4 PIECES AT A TIME AND CAN NOT COOK BACK TO BACK ORDERS OR WILL BURN OUT THERE OVENS AND THAT IT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM WAS MANAGEMENTS PROBLEM.

ONE WOULD THINK IF THERE IS SUCH A HIGH DEMAND FOR THIS PRODUCT THE COMPANY WOULD WORK ON A SOLUTION TO PRODUCE MORE GRILLED CHICKEN

NO ONE WANTS TO RESOLVE THE CHALLENGES THIS STORE OR COMPANY IS HAVING

I WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY TIMES I GO IN AND HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE POOR SERVICE

THE FIRST TIME THE MANAGER TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE NUMBER ON THE RECEIPT 888-731-9645 THAT IS FOR SOME CONTEST /MARKETING THING.

I THEN CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 800-225-5532 I ASKED FOR THE CORPORATE OFFICE INFORMATION OR DISTRICT MANAGER CONTACT INFORMATION AND THEY STATED THEY COULD NOT GIVE THAT INFORMATION OUT.

I THEN HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME GOING ON THE COMPUTER TO GET THE CORPORATE ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS IN ORDER TO SEND THIS LETTER . I DO INTEND TO CONTACT THEM DURING BUSINESS HOURS TOMORROW TO SEE WHERE I GET WITH THIS.

IF THE INFORMATION IS ON THE INTERNET THAN WHY DOES THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT REFUSE TO GIVE IT. AGAIN POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.





 



 Hunter Dean Patton 12/15/11 
 My wife and I took our 2 year old grandson to KFC in North Vernon,Indiana, they were packed
and we knew we might have a wait, no problem. My wife ordered and I seated my grandson
and I first notice that it was hot as hell in there, they didn&apos;t have the AC on or even
a fan to help cool the room? Then I noticed that there was food under the tables and
that no ONE was bussing the tables? Very unsanitary!!! If I had of noticed this taking
place before we ordered we would have left! A lot of older customers would come in
and feel the heat and then leave? Some would just drive away and a few would order
from the drive-thru. Now I know that when it&apos;s rush hour things become pretty hostile
and items are left unattended until time allows! But I also know that when you have
a huge turn over there is NO EXCUSE for not cleaning up tables after customers leave
the tables for the next occupants! My wife attends classes and one of her friends run the health
department so we know what is approved service and what is NOT. Just wanted to let
you know that management might need a few pointers to correct the problem. I seen
one employee come out and re-stack the trays at each station and then just walk
back into the cooking area....didn&apos;t see her wash her hands either?
Thanks...for your time! 



 Earl. Chambliss 12/13/11 
 Customer service is ghetto and extremely poor at the store located at 14201 W.Seven Mile Rd,Detroit,Michigann,48235. Employees stand arround talking to each other rather than service the customer. They get upset when you interrupt them to place an order. They are rude and one has to wonder why anyone would continue to patronize this establishment. If I never go back there it would be too soon 

 

 Jodi 12/9/11 
 I am sitting in a KFC right now and I am so disappointed. After a pretty good meal the buffet closed and I watched the workers throw away (in the trash can) brand new untouched food! Why not donate it to a local shelter or the women&apos;s shelter RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. Makes me disgusted that they are throwing food away instead of helping our local community. 



 Judy B Looney 12/11/11 
 My husband and I went to KFC in Daphne, Al today, 12/11/2100. (Store # J310057). Since we were the only customers in the store, when we placed our order to go, we thought the order would be filled promptly. We ordered a #1 and #2, both orders came with side orders and drinks.The young lady who was running the register and took our order was very disorganized and had to keep calling Theresa, the manager to help her. Well, Theresa was just about as disorganized as the cashier and keep disappearing in the back... After waiting on &quot;Theresa&quot; to get our drinks for 15 minutes, we left without the drinks.. When we arrived home, we had the chicken and biscuits after paying for a dinner with sides... What in the world is going on with KFC???? With so many people unemployed, why not hire someone with some sense and a little bit of knowledge??? This is my third trip to the same KFC with the same type of experience and of course, it will be my last!!! I am sure this store will be out of business before long, but maybe if you hired someone with some knowledge and manners????? Hummmmmmm!!!!!! A no brainer!!!!!! 



 Rose M. Neff , Syracuse,NY(3-30-1988 incident). 12/4/11 
 I just reopened a child abuse case that to clear myself of a beating of two children outside of the Kentucky Fried chicken at Kennedy&amp;S. Salina St,Syracuse,NY late morning. The large picture window that the wait staff can see out of,did not come
to aid me when my child was in a temper tantrum. That led a Lawrence Stokes and a
Onondaga Taxi Co. driver Thomas Callahan to hurt my son during an abduction.
I was accused of purchasing a bottle of CoCa Cola going outside of Kentucky Fried
Chicken and braking it accross my three year old son, Wolfgang Neff&apos;s face. Also, accused of beating my six month old infant son,Byron Neff all over his body. I ended up losing my two children and no one from that Kentucky Fried Chicken never spoke up
for me. As long as Kentucky Fried chicken have been in business, I have never know them to sell those green glass bottles of coke. I was never allowed to defend myself
nor try and re-open my case until I was harassed so bad by a prior employee of the Onondaga County Assistant District Attorney&apos;s office/Victims Witness that was involved in my case during the charges saw me back in 2006. I was in Lewis County in Village court on a traffic matter. I noticed the Village Clerk was familiar but did not know from where. In June 30 of 2009, she started throwing up in my face I beat my kids. I had continous problems with her. I learned shortly thereafter who she is.

I had nothing but problems of harassment,death threats, chased down, and falsely arrested. I contacted the State Regestry in Albany NEw York and reopened my old case.
The first time around I lost. I pursued the matter then one day while waiting to be notified of my special hearing in Syracuse,New York. I received a file in the mail on
12-31-2010. I sat in my vehicle at the time and read document over 200 pages.
As I read through the document I saw a sworn statement to authorities stating by that Taxi driver and the Stokes guy that I purchased the bottle of coke from Kentucky FRied chicken and took the unopen bottle and broke it accross my son&apos;s face.

I feel that at this late date that since I am going back into Family Court in Syracuse, Kentucky Fried Chicken should send me a email letter stating wheather or not they sold bottle glass coke in March 30, 1988 at their South Salina St&amp;Kennedy St. location. I feel this is the least they can do. My email is ccpcontractor@hotmail.com for Kentucky Friend Chicken CEO can send my a letter.

Far as Kentucky FRied Chicken&apos;s Service, I rate the as having the best service. In 1971 I worked for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Main Street, Rochester,New York.

I am waiting a response from corporate. Please inform your employee&apos;s when they see
a situation such as mine, please call authorities.

Thanks!

 I WENT TO THE KFC IN LAUREL MD. ON RT. 1. I WENT THRU THE DRIVE THRU AND ASKED FOR A 3 PIECE DARK MEAT DINNER. THE VOICE SAID WHAT SIDE WOULD U LIKE. I ASKED WHAT THEY CALLED THOSE LARGE FRIES THEY SELL. (I LATER FOUND OUT THEY&apos;RE CALLED POTATO WEDGES.) ANYHOW THE GUY SAID OVER THE SPEAKER HE DIDN&apos;T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. I SAID CAN I SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH. HE HAD AN ACCENT OF SOME KIND AND DIDN&apos;T MEAN TO INSULT HIM BUT HE ASKED WHY AM I INSULTING HIM? I SAID I WASN&apos;T INSULTING HIM JUST WANTED SOMEONE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH. HE TOLD ME TO GET LOST AND WOULDN&apos;T TAKE MY ORDER. I DROVE UP TO THE WINDOW AND GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND ASKED THE NAME OF THE PERSON I WAS SPEAKING TO. THE MAN AT THE WINDOW SAID HE DIDN&apos;T KNOW BUT HE HAD HEADPHONES ON AND SOUNDED LIKE WHO I SPOKE TO. HE SAID HE DIDN&apos;T KNOW. I ASKED HIM HIS NAME AND HE WOULDN&apos;T GIVE IT TO ME. I LATER HEARD ONE OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES CALL HIM JUAN. ANYHOW THE ARGUMENT ESCALATED. HE THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE. I NOTICED HE HAD ON A KNITTED CAP LIKE THE MUSLIMS WEAR. I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS A MUSLIM AND NO WONDER HE ACTED SO POORLY LOL. THIS IS A POORLY RUN STORE THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT OF SOMETHING AND THEY WONT SEE ME AGAIN. 



 Merie Trujillo 11/29/11 
 Everywhere you go, KFC restaurants have deteriorated. How do they expect to stay in business? Who is running these restaurants---slum managers? They no longer have the appeal, respect, the food, the service or the customers as before(before the Colonel died, I suppose)when KFC used to take pride in their restaurants. Now they are just too gross to tolerate. 



 11/21/11 
 It never fails every time I go to kfc in san marcos, Tx I have an a horrible experience. It seems like the people ate always ghetto and don&apos;t give a damn about customer service. This latest trip will definitely be my last . Am employee by the name of Sarah was so ride and kept cutting me off in the drive-thru. We were asking if kfc still had the &quot;snack pack &quot;? We told the ladybug the window that we didn&apos;t remember the name of it and she very conivingly said &quot;I don&apos;t know what that is !&quot; my daughters noticed right away that she was rude and said let&apos;s go mom, she&apos;s mean.
So then we proceeded to order and she would completely ignore the fact that we were in the middle if ordering and would start to speak. When I got up to the window she had changed her tone from rude to sweet. Of course by then she had put us all in a bad mood so when she went bi-polar and obviously was being sweet in front of her fello co-workers I just stayed quiet and didn&apos;t reciprocate the behavior. Then she shut the window and started obviously talking about us to her co-workers. By this time she cane back to the window and gave me my change which is when I told her that she was rude and had a terrible attitude. She looked at me and my daughters and w/the ugliest tone said &quot;ok! Sorry! Bye!&quot;

We will never go back

 I live in east moline Illinois. Not joking every time I got there and order chicken strips there all out gotta wait 8 mins for strips. Then it always not matter what turns into 25mins at the least. That is a fn joke usually get 3 strips and its the same story over and over we only have 2 strips. Cook more strips when ya geg that low don&apos;t wait till someone comes and orders them and make them almost wait a half hour total time from ordering at drive threw, have some common sense or quit your job. Been a few times I had to get $ back cuz didn&apos;t have the time to wait the real of my life rr chicken strips.

 KFC STORE #E720373 2006 - 6TH AVE TACOMA, WA 98403 THIS KFC IS THE WORST I&apos;VE EVER BEEN TO. EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE (NON-FRIENDLY WELCOME AND RUDE CASHIER)... WE WENT TO THIS SAME KFC ABOUT 4 YRS AGO, SO THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY IT AGAIN, BECAUSE SURELY THEY WOULD&apos;VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS AND WHAT WERE THE ODDS OF THE SAME RUDE PERSON WORKING THERE STILL. WELL, FOUND OUT THAT DOESN&apos;T MATTER WHO&apos;S WORKING AT THE REGISTER, BECAUSE THEY ALL OBVIOUSLY LACK CORRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING. IT REALLY DOESN&apos;T TAKE MUCH TO &quot;SMILE&quot; AT CUSTOMERS WHEN YOU ADDRESS THEM, AND TO AT LEAST SHOW A SPECK OF CONCERN WHEN YOU ARE ASKED FOR A NAPKIN. WERE TOLD THEY DIDN&apos;T HAVE NAPKINS. I GOT A BISCUIT, BUT NO BUTTER? ASKED FOR THAT, TOO ... WAS TOLD THEY DIDN&apos;T HAVE BUTTER. THIS VISIT WAS AT 5:45 PM, AND THEY SHOULD&apos;VE BEEN READY FOR BUSINESS ... WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE GRILLED CHICKEN, BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAD ORIGIONAL. NOT AN APOLOGY ONE WAS OFFERED FOR THE LOUSY SERVICE. I REALLY THINK THIS KFC DESERVES LESS THAN POOR RATING ... AT LEAST NOW I CAN AVOID GIVING THIS LOCATION ANY MORE BUSINESS/ CHANCES TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT, BECAUSE NOW MY EXPECTATIONS FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE LOWER THAN THE RATING I&apos;M GIVING THEM !!! I GUESS ALL I&apos;M TRYING TO SAY, IS WHEN YOU&apos;RE HIRING, AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU SHOULD BE HIRING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK.

 I&apos;ve bought original chickem for many years, in fact, from its inception. Yesterday. I went to the KFC in Dublin, California only to find that they charge more for the same plate of food in contrast to the KFC where I live in San Ramon, California which is outrageously overpriced otherwise. The &quot;original&quot; chicken was heavily breaded which is not the original chicken. When I picked up the piece of chichen, it was very greasy which I never ever found before at any KFC. There was a lot of grease in the bottom of the box, no plates anymore. I had to peel off the breading to get to the chicken, the chicken was much too firm and as I ate it I discovered that the meat would not come off the bone as it was not fully cooked.
I then went to the manager who was about 20 and dumb as a rock. Why are corporations hiring these nitwits who have no business acumen whatsoever? They are hired for cheap and do nothing as to customer service which has long disappeared for this hemisphere. She argued with me that the meat stuck to the bone was bone marrow. What a despicable explanation! Bone marrow is inside a bone. These young so-called managers couldn&apos;t manage their way out of a paperbag with the directions on it. See if you can find the name and address of the CEO of KFC. They don&apos;t want to hear from customers except to bring money. IT WILL BE A COLD DAY IN HELL WHEN I BUY FROM ANY KFC AGAIN. 



 Joey 11/3/11 
 I visited your KFC/Taco bell location at 3032 North Broad Street today during the lunch period around 12:35 PM. When I walked in there were more than 14 people in line waiting to place orders. Only one register was open and one person was presenting the orders to customers as they were being prepared by the three people in the kitchen. There was no chicken on the warmer except for a few crispy wings. There were several trays of grilled chicken breast and wings seen in the upright warmer Within 10 minutes there was a tray of biscuits brought out. After fifteen minutes I was at the window ready to place my order when the cashier told me we dont have any crispy chicken. I asked. Well what you have, she said grilled breast and wings and crispy wings. I did not want grilled or original and I dont like wings.
Now my lunch is half over so I reluctantly ordered the original two pieces with fries and a biscuit. While waiting for over 30 minutes in this location, no one came out to clean the tables, beverage counter or sweep the floors. The cashier, whom I believe to be the manager, yelled out to the kitchen not to cook any more chicken. I did not understand that since everyone standing around was waiting for chicken. There were no legs, thighs or breast in crispy or original. How can you run a chicken restaurant and not have chicken?
There were either ants or small roaches crawling around the outer section of the encased window around the counter. After 35 minutes of waiting, I received my meal. My lunch is now over. I get back to work and open my meal at my desk and it is the wrong order. I now have no choice again but to eat grilled chicken for lunch. This is my third visit to this location and each time I have been disappointed with the service and the lack of cleanliness.
The whole experience left me feeling frustrated and disappointed in your establishment. Why is the service so bad at this location? I have visited other locations where the food and service are great? This location is near a major hospital, a university, the Social Security Administration and two major transportation hubs. Its appears they dont have any interest in customer service.
 



 Michael Day 11/4/11 
 I was just recently at the KFC in Liberty Ohio. While yes I got my food it was cold and the man behind me did not get his. He was told that he would have to wait 20 minutes for crispy chicken when they had just opened. He sat there over 20 minutes, did not get his food and the lady who took is order proceeded to yell at him infront of 5 other people. I just find that horrible and what happened to the customer is always right? I will NEVER go back. That was the most horrible experience and the worst KFC I&apos;ve ever been to. 



 Cloud 11/6/11 
 I just stop in KFC in north carloine .. I Ordered 6 pieces legs at a drive thru .. The girl say NO u can&apos;t have 6 legs than she want me to order something else that I don&apos;t want..she sound like she didn&apos;t give a shi+ .. So I drove off.. I&apos;ll never ever stop at KFC again ..!! 



 Teresa 11/1/11 
 Just moved to Mt. Vernon, Ill. Very happy they had a KFC. Very small town. We have gone there several times and do take out. I have one problem, The white gravy is never right. I can say this because I worked for KFC, in Ind, for several years, and worked the buffet. The white gravy is either runny or lumpy, and the flavor flew out the window. I think you need to know because when I worked for KFC they were very precise about being consistent from store to store. It is so maddening when you crave something and get it and the flavor is gone. I have to say that the rest of the food is still great and the service is always a great experience. Hope you can solve the problem. please. 



 Lourens Haywood 10/31/11 
 Yesterday at kfc in Nigel RSA, I went to buy food, there was a problem with one of their machines a couple of weeks ago and the same story yesterday. While waiting for service at the drive through, I saw a woman working bare hands with the food, but that&apos;s not all, that same women took from another persons order a piece of meat and eat it, it fell from her mouth in the box(order) and she took it out and eat it again.
I will in my life, never again buy kfc again, its poor! Email me at

 I am not kidding. We finished working on the house tonight at 8 pm. We hadnt eaten since 9am. So we go through KFC in wadsworth, Ohio. He says &quot;sorry, we only have one chicken breast, original.&quot; We look at each other, Donnie says &quot;ok, let us have that and some wings&quot;. He says &quot;Ok, but we are out of biscuits&quot;. I thought is this KFC or WTF???. Don said give me an order of popcorn chicken.&quot; He says &quot;that will take 3 min to cook&quot; So Don is like &quot;OKAY! ??&quot; Soo We get the ONE chicken breast that was NOT original and it was hard as a brick! The wings were stuck to themselves, and were also NOT original. Unfriendly and you guys are surely going out of business!!!!!

 after reading that an employee in England refused to reserve a table for king Travolta because the employee said a customer is a customer he can wait in line like everyone else ..... I love that girl.... then a Dbag from corporate said &quot; we regret not saving him a table It&apos;s not every day a STAR eats at KFC&quot; I will no longer eat at KFC bad choice corporate one meal of a STAR vs thousands of REGULAR people who eat there often ..... 



 Alexandra Wheeler 10/18/11 
 I went to KFC last night (10/17/11). I ordered a 3 piece chicken strip dinner with Mac and cheese for my girls to share. When I went to divide the meal up between them, there were only 2 pieces of tough, old, gross chicken strips. The Mac and cheese was old as well. It was so dry. I just kind of blew it off bc, hey, things happen sometimes. This evening (10/18/11) I went to KFC again and ordered the 12 piece extra crispy chicken family bucket. I was then told by the person taking my order that they only had a few pieces of extra crispy left and I would have to get original instead. I said that was fine. ( bc, hey stuff happens, right?). I ordered Mac and cheese, Cole slaw, and mashed potatoes as the sides. When I got home to feed the family (my parents were in town), I started dishing up everyone&apos;s plate. The chicken looked disgusting!!! It was so old. The Mac and cheese was old as well. The Cole slaw was excellent! I called the League City TX store (281)334-1777. 2660 E. League City Parkway League City TX 77573. Store #D212009 Ticket #2606. I spoke to the Asst. Manager, Chris. I told him the situation and he told me the only thing he could do was give me the missing 3 pieces of chicken. He said he was only the Asst Manager. Chris said I could come up there sometime that evening to get the 3 pieces of chicken or I could wait until the manager arrived. I asked Chris when would that be? He replied with some time tomorrow. I asked for the managers name. Chris said it was Tony East. I then asked for corporates #. He didn&apos;t know corporates #. I do believe he tried to look for it, but I&apos;m not sure.
I was trying to feed my children so my mother went up there bc the rest of the adults were hungry. She took all the chicken, except for 3 pieces that were for the children, and the Mac and cheese up there. As soon as she walked through the door Chris greeted her and helped her. He was nice and replaced 9 pieces of the 12 pieces of chicken. As soon as my mother showed him the Mac and cheese he said Eewww. Chris also replaced that for us.
I believe that Chris did well with trying to fix our problem with as much power as he could. But, the food was old and not the correct order. We should not have had to drive back up there to get fresh food AND our correct order. Also when asking about corporate Chris should have known the answer. If not he should have at least known where the information was located.
We do like KFC every now and then. In the future though, I think we will try another location.

 Cecilia Cochran 10/19/11 
 I was in my local kfc this evening and it was the worst experience I&apos;ve ever had.
The Buffett was empty and was repeatedly asked for replenishment. I got fed up with the amount of money I paid to eat a good meal and not have anything to choose from. SECOND and formost I was watching this girl behind the counter SNEEZE in someone&apos;s plate and send it out the window. Then the crew laughs about it. My mother and I were the only two in the restaurant and it was terrible I will never eat there again. It was in Florence Alabama store number 35. On cox creek.

 Erica Olah the manager from Kfc selma, ca is very rude to customers and unproffesional. she yells very loud at her workers during business hours and when customers can hear and witness all of this. 



 ben schmid 10/13/11 
 There is a restaurant in William Arizona,one of the tourist traps for the Grand Canyon,and they claim to be a KFC.I LIKE KFC!!Always have.The chicken at this place in no way whatsoever resmbles KFC chicken!!No spices,no breading,just some generic bird cooked horribly.They refused to refund our money,and it was NOT edible.I plan on taking this further,as this fake KFC needs to be shut down!

 While the quality of the food is good, most of the time they get the order wrong. With that said, I am having to downgrade their rating from four stars to three.
I applaud KFC&apos;s desire to keep the environment trash-free and to encourage recycling and reusing, but I hate the new packaging. I have arthritis and these containers do not lend themselves to arthritic hands. Also, when your hands are greasy, this packaging is too difficult to open. I wish KFC would leave the tops off of the containers when dining in the restaurant. If they did this, it would eliminate trying to get the lids off, while keeping their green pledge. 



 Pacific, MO. customer 9/25/11 
 My husband and I tried the popcorn chicken for dinner. Where is the chicken? Many of the pieces were fried breading with no chicken inside the breading. Not only was the chicken missing in many pieces, even the pieces with chicken were not tasty. They tasted as if the oil was old or over-used. We will not be returning to KFC.
 



 GRANT 9/24/11 
 Hi my name is Grant and I had went to a local KFC in Hammond,Indiana On Calumet and i think 141st i will never EVER EAT THERE AGAIN-as I was expecting a nice fast dinner after work turned out to be unbealiavable-some of the employees smelled of alchol and slurred speech-then for then to be giggiling telling me that there was a wait of 20 minutes for crispy-so i told them never mind just give me the new grilled and half in original for them to tell me they only had thigs n wings in glrilled and none in original-what do these teens at this KFC do all day-? what are they really getting paid for? BAD HOSPITALITY? BAD customer service? then there was young kids playing on cell phones and packing m Wy order was so not good hospitality-why couldnt they clean the restrooms that had paper towels everyone and garbage full or the lobby that had a stack of dirty trays or the tables that were not clean ect? shouldnt these young teens be utilized and do their job right and there wouldnt be any complaints? ADDRESS 4110 Calumet Ave HAMMOND INDIANA I hope someone from cooporete would look over this and take this in to consideration that this is totally uncalled for. 



 Brianna 8/9/11 
 I am a little upset. I am a regular customer at farmington, NM kfc or Bloomfeild, NM kfc i have a complaint because you have discontinued your hot wings with the sauce i would buy those almost everyday will you please tell me why you discontinued them? Or please continue them here in my home town it&apos;ll be much appropriated.

 KFC in Tullahoma, TN needs management help. We used to eat there 2x a week but the help start closing down&amp;cleaning around 5:30 pm or so you have to get there early or you feel like they&apos;re running you out. What&apos;s with the supposedly New size for the Grilled Chicken? Recent commercials said the grilled chicken pieces were to be the same size as Original. That lasted about a week. Seriously, does the owner of this franchise ever stop by in the evening or eat the food? 



 Kimberly Barney 9/19/11 
 I recently visited the Memphis area. I was in the Memphis area to visit family. I treated the family to lunch at KFC located at 6028 Stage Road, Bartlett, TN 38134. I ordered the $20 bucket meal plus four all white pieces of the grilled chicken. My mother spoke up and stated that we needed drinks, too. I ordered five drinks but was never asked the size. Then when we didn&apos;t get our cups after waiting for quite some time as due to our white meat request, our chicken had to be prepared. An employee by the name of Talvor started mouthing off to me and my son that we would have been given cups if we had ordered drinks. It became so bad between my son and Talvor, that I finally said that is enough out of both of you. My son and I were the customers. Talvor was the employee. Someone needs to teach Talvor customer service or remove her from her position. However, the mouthy employee was not hte worse of it. The floors were greasy and the tables sticky. I almost fell in the ladies restroom. This is gross. Health Codes???????????? I suggest KFC get something done about this location. Manager: Earnest Smith The phone number (901-386-3842) shown on the top of their receipt is disconnected. The phone number (901-386-3442) shown on the bottom of the receipt is not answered. I will gladly speak with someone. My work number is 615-253-2476.

 tomas 8/16/11 
 your charging 50 cents for a piece of a wing which consists of three parts which means that your charging 1.50 for a whole wing which is a giant ripoff! The last time I I bought KFC the chicken DID NOT TASTE LIKE THE COL. SANDERS FIRST SOLD. Please go out of business as your chicken really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 



 Rachel Kemp 8/17/11 
 Someone needs to do something about the poor service within the KFC outlets. I am from Broken HIll Australia and many of time myself and other locals have had issues with the services. I recently purchased a nacho cheese roller, finding i had no nacho cheese sauce on it with just the wrap, pieces of unmelted cheese, chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken??? this is not what i asked for ! 



 Robert Willis 8/18/11 
 My Daughter wrote this letter so I wanted to share it. Dear Sir or Madam, I have been a devoted KFC fan since I could walk. Upon moving from TN to FL I wanted to try the KFC buffet down here. IT WAS TERRIBLE! I even disgraced my job Popeye chicken for you. There was hardly any chicken, terrible potatoes and what is up with NO MAC&amp;CHEESE;, no green beans and if you called that corn we need to stop growing it. What makes this really bad for me is I took my mom and paid for it with my 1st pay check. My bill was almost $20. It took me 3 hrs working at Popeyes to pay for that crap. I won&apos;t be going back EVER and I am 18 so sorry for you but you owe me $18. I laughed when I read what my daughter wrote but at the same time what a shame but a great lesson in comparing what she spent with the hours it took her to work for that experience.

 I just ordered what was listed as a &quot;Chunky Chicken Pot Pie&quot; for lunch today. I got back to my office to begin eating it and found 1 small piece of chicken in the whole pie. It was all crust and veggies. I tried to call the store in Flowood, MS and the number has been disconnected.....I wonder why....too many complaints?? I won&apos;t be going back.

 Bangash 8/25/11 
 We bought KFC from the outlet in Islamabad, Pakistan. We had to throw out the chicken it was that bad, one piece was actually burnt (probably from re-frying a number of times to sell as fresh) All complaints to the local franchise owner the international Cupola Group have not been responded to.
We&apos;ll keep after them or have them shut down. Yes, its possible to do that in Pakistan.

 i work at kfc and i know all the stuff stated on here is true. its the worst place to work they break laws all the tim ei advise everyone not to eat there. espacially at night they make us serve nasty old chicken that has been out all day. im a minor im 16 years old and they make me work like 10 hours with only one break and its crazy. they have poor service skills, they have poor management they need a new manager and a new owner this store gets so mnay complaints. they dont care about getting the order right they just want it to get out fast. also half the people there are lazy, they dont wanna do their jobs so they leave it to the minors. the cooks are the laziest all they do is complain so everyone ele has to do their jobs like wash dishes, drop chicken, open fryers, make the chicken. they let us use the mashed potatoe maker and we arent 18. i dont think that is right. i really wanna sue that place and the manager Bobbie is rude and has no trainig what so ever. Jessie is horrible she picks on the minors and makes us do all the cooks job. the only manager that shows fair treatment is Mr.Bill. i hate working at that place i know how the service is. I WOULD NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. i work there and i never eat there. also you can never call in if you cant get to work they are alwasy like well you better be here or you ll be fired like what the heck im 16 i dont drive i cant get to work if i have no way like the place sucks.

My last visit was aug.29,2011

 The dirtiest restaurant I have ever entered. The gas city indiana location that we visited with our family was disgusting, from garbage can overflowing at entrance to the bathrooms seemed that it had not been cleaned for weeks. The dining area was littered with trash and smelled aweful As we were leaving half the staff was standing at the side of restaurant smoking. Would never go there again. 



 2751 Hillcrest Avenue, Antioch California KFC 9/4/11 
 If I could I wouldn&apos;t even give my store a star. I have been going to this restuarant for 2 years, it is the closet to my home. The one accross town from me is just as bad, so I figure I will at least save on gas. If it wasn&apos;t for my family and their loving the food, I would stick to Taco Bell, or IN N Out Burger, now that&apos;s a good fast food restaurant. Well, everytime I go, I have learned to ask for fresh cooked chicken so as to get food that has not been sitting for over an hour or two, which is typical at KFC. Well, my most annoying issue isn&apos;t even the fact that every single time I go there, they forget to give me a side, or my biscuits, or give me cold and old food, it is the fact that when I tell the manager, he acts as if it is my fault! This last visit I ordered at 9:13pst, and was told that I couldn&apos;t get the chicken I wanted because their fryers were off. They said they shut them down an hour before closing, yet they close at 11pm! I told them I would wait, but they still said they couldn&apos;t. There solution was to give me half extra cripsy, and half original. My family hates original. After ten minutes of deciding and discussing, I finally broke down and said ok, but I didn&apos;t want wedges unless they were fresh because they get hard. They told me they could do the wedges. I thought that strange, they just said their fryers were done for the night.... Well, I get my food and they forgot the biscuits, gave me mac&amp;cheese that was closed to curdled, and soggy original chicken and extra cold extra crispy. I called their unbusy store once I got home, I live 3 minutes away. It took over 5 trys to get through. They told me to come back and they would give me my biscuits and a cake for the trouble. The night crew is really nice, even though they make constant mistakes. I go the next day at 11:30 because I can talk to the main mangager, make sure it is taken care of properly. I have to explain my situation over 3 times to three different people. A crew leader who had been their the night before and had dissapeared through my order process tried to blame me for the issue and the main manager acted as if I could have gotten the crisy chicken if I wanted, I would have had to wait. When I explained I was willing to wait, he said, they ALWAYS have a burner on, ALWAYS. They brought up the wedges I waited so for as if they could have done the chicken too. I explained I didn&apos;t understand that either, and I figured it was a different fryer that maybe they left on, they said no, and still continued to point the finger at me. I was so irrated, but I continued to keep my cool. He did exchange my original chicken with the extra crispy eventually, but he refused to give me the cake I was promised. I am so sick of this issue. This store is Located at

2751 Hillcrest Avenue Antioch California.

I will be calling about this issue, but any readers beware of KFC, these, like most fast food restaurants don&apos;t care about their customers, and they don&apos;t care about the quality of food. They are all just trying to make their minimum wage and this economy is not making their care for their jobs any better. If you want food made well go to In N out burger. If they do make a mistake, their corporate is awesome, they replace your entire meal over 1 item mistake. They realize good customer service is key.

 crystal 9/12/11 
 KFC in Clinton, Ar is the worst KFC their is. This is not my 1st time that it has been disgusting. The chicken was cold n tasted like pure grease, asked for baked beans and they had none, got to the window n payed abd the lady said by the way we dont have biscuits so will u take hushpuppies? And just gave me and my granny 3. Not to mention, there was NO ONE there. It is ridiculous for the price u pay. 



 AMANDEEP SINGH BHULLAR 9/10/11 
 MODEL TOWN&apos;s KFC RESTAURANT IS GIVING POOR SERVICE TO PEOPLE . M ACTUALLY FROM CANADA RIGHT N THEY DOESNOT DEAL WITH PEOPLE NICELY . I CAME HERE FOR MA COUSIN&apos;S MARRIAGE . BUT THIS KFC JUST FED MA MIND SO MUCH . I THINK THE KFC RESTAURANTS IN DELHI OR CHANDIGARH ARE GOOD ENOUGH . I JUST WANNA TELL U THAT U HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR US LIKE THEY HAVE TRAINEES AND THEY ARE NOT DEALING WITH PEOPLE BADLY AS THE MANAGER HAD PUT THEM AT MAIN COUNTER AND THEY ARE NOT GOOD AT THIS SERVICE I THINK THAT . I THINK U HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE JUST SPOILING KFC&apos;S NAME HERE . JUST DO SOMETHING FOR KFC&apos;S NAME . 



 unimportant 9/5/11 
 You have management in bolivar Mo. that the assistant and the manager are intimate with eachother and are destroying the chances of any one else keeping a job. by the way that is a conflict of interest especially when they close the office door and do nothing to work with the employee&apos;s of the store. You can either fire both of them or suffer the loss of your store&apos;s quality through disappointed customers and the loss of one of your operable businesses. I&apos;m not playing do something now. no one wants to work for an ungrateful boss, or receive bad reviews from two managers with nothing but lies to keep their jobs. word of mouth goes along way in a small town. lots of other more qualified individuals who know how to deal with public relations as well as boss employee relationships without ultimatums and threats about losing the workers job if they aren&apos;t subservient to an attitude that treats others as less than important in their own personal lives. please do this community a favor close this kfc or fix it. sincerely and obviously one more of thousands sick of kfc&apos;s fall from grace. I will continue to pursue this till Jake and Sarah are both gone 



 Ian Murphy 9/5/11 
 Hello my name is Ian Murphy and just went to the Butte MT KFC. I ordered a famous bowl which is around $5.30 and paid with 2 5&apos;s. The girl that took my order said I gave her a 5 and a 1. She continued to argue with me and then after she left she started talking to her coworkers about me. SERIOUSLY??? This is all around poor service. I will NEVER go to a KFC again. Please get employees who are smart enough to work in the fast food industry, for the rest of your stupidly faithful customers. It really isn&apos;t that hard. 



 LaQuita Smith 9/8/11 
 I Live in Houston Tx i went to Kfc Store#y343310... Me and my two sons we wanted some grilled chicken. The front cashier was very nice sweet n helpful. The team was very happy smiley and joyful. The store was so nice n clean.I love it i can&apos;t wait to go back tomorrow 



 Sharon Stevens 7/5/11 
 I have to drive 25 minutes to get to the KFC nearest my home. I do this often to shop and usually stop by KFC to get supper to take home. Tonight, I ordered the 4 peice wing dinner. Drove 25 min. home, started to eat my meal and found that I had 4 wings and a biscuit. Where was the potatoes and the cole slaw. Who knows?!?!? This is not the first time this has happened, but you can rest assued that it will be the last. Popeyes or Churches is looking mighty good. I paid almost $8. for 4 wings and a biscuit. What an outrage !!!!

 Kfc is the worst place to work for ever!!! 



 janice burke 7/12/11 
 dear colonel , until recently my family and i have been loyal customers of your fine establishment for the past 30 years. that all changed recently with the viewing of your latest commercial in which you tell us that there is a cook in every restaurant preparing your food you then procede to show us in said commercial an ungloved cook up to his elbow in chicken and batter mixing the ingrediants. i regret to inform you that because of said commercial I WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO EAT YOUR CHICKEN. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU REMOVE THIS COMMERCIAL FROM YOUR BROADCASTING VENUE AND IMMEDIATLY TERMINATE THE ADVERTISING COMPANY THAT SUGGESTED THIS CONCEPT.

RESPECTFULLY YOURS,

 I went to the kfc in Brandon ms and as soon as I walked in I started to pour sweat is was hotter inside than it was outside I mean I was sweating like a nigger in a klan meeting I was very displeased 



 S. Hodge 7/15/11 
 Hey,
I&apos;m contacting KFC in reference to the sauce that you now put on your sandwiches. To be quit honest it&apos;s horrible and I feel that it was a bad decision eliminating the pepper mayo sauce! The only reason that I personally would visit KFC was for the sandwiches or twisters with &quot;EXTRA PEPPER MAYO&quot;! Since the change in sauces I have not been back to KFC (since 2010) and everyone I know seems to agree with me and some too have stopped visiting. I would really assumed that KFC sales have dropped since this drastic change. Mcdonald&apos;s has Mayo, tarter, and still the famous Big Mac sauce, so why cant KFC at least offer both sauces for consumers to choose from. That&apos;s like going to Burger King, Mcdonald&apos;s, or Five Guys and A Burger and them saying we don&apos;t offer mayo anymore! Everyone wants the option of putting mayo on a sandwich. Outside of the side items and condiments KFC is only a chicken restaurant so why take away the little options like PEPPER MAYO and twisters that i felt really enhanced what little KFC already had! PLEASE bring back PEPPER MAYO FOR GOOD!
Thank You,
S. Hodge
 

 

 angie 7/16/11 
 I just recently quit kfc. I was sexually harassed by a male manager and cursed out by another many times. Kfc is the most unptofessional place you can work or even eat from. They&apos;re ridiculous. Many managers n workers even sat in the back in the office n smokd weed after we closed 



 Rene Bedoya 7/21/11 
 I went to KFC that is located in Phillipsburg N.J...And I order a chicken strips (12 Pieces)that were 24 dollars,along with a 8 piece dinner and some homefries, for a total of $51.25. which I question the prize and I asked the mananger on hand this particular july 21st at around 1:25pm, why so much diference between the strips and the wings, and was told that the strips were &quot;WHITE meat for WHITE people only&quot;. I could not believe what I was hearing in this day and age, I can not beleive that there is still people in the year 2011 with so much ignorance and hate and poor taste and customer relations and to topped it all off is that she was the manager...To say the least I will never step in another KFC for as long as I live. and is to bad that KFC headquarters does not even bother to keep trac on their stores or who mananges them because they are privately own and all they can say is contact the owner which is never available no matter how many times you live a message. 



 Don Barnes 8/5/11 
 To make it shot they need to close the doors on this KFC in Conway Ark..It;s the only one here...They don&apos;t care if your order is right or not ....They just don&apos;t care....I hope they close the doors...mabey if they have to look for another job they wil wake up.....

 Actually it should be zero stars...I went to the KFC on Beach Street @ SH 121 in Haltom City recently and the place sucked air....the place was nasty, my feet stuck to the floor under the table. I never got my food...after 20 minutes of waiting and people who came in long after me had gotten their food, I went up to inquire and the imbecile working the counter couldn&apos;t even find it. I got the manager and got my money back....btw I was the only white person in the store and I believe it was due to racisim that I was not served! Stay away from KFC Haltom City!!! 



 earnest johnson conyers georgia 7/29/11 
 i ordered 3 peices of chicken 1breast and 2 wings is what i asked the cashier for ,she put in 2 breast and one wing i asked her is a wing and a breast the same price and she said yes so i asked for the manager a woman came with the drive through gizmo on her head and she said it is the same price if you change your order well i did not change my order the cashier got the order wrong so the manager said something smart and walked away, i love kfc&apos;s chicken and she is not going to make me stop coming but what ever happend to customer service with this new generation i donnot know. the store # is Y3ooo47 conyers ga it was 1:08 friday 7-29-11. i could see if a cashier did that but the managers are trained for customer service and i felt bad when she acted this way for me to have only ask a question. the people at this kfc needs to be retrained on how to deal with the customers. maybe they forgot without customers no money and no money means NO PAYCHECK. 



 Chris Moretto 7/31/11 
 The KFC at 6900 E Broad St, Columbus, Ohio is about the worst KFC I have been to.
Ever since they came out with the grilled chicken, they hardly even have it cooked
when I go to the store. Today, I stood at the counter and was ignored so I left and
ate at Subway instead. I will never, ever go to this store again. I can&apos;t get ahold of the manager either because they don&apos;t answer the phone. I plan on going there in person and let them know. 



 A Not Happy Customer 7/31/11 
 Palm Harbor Fl Store #L747029. 33420 U.S Highway 19 N.
Went thru drive-thru to get a 7 piece original meal with potatoes and biscuit. Also ordered a large coleslaw. Got to window to pay, was told they have no original I would have to take crispy. They did not offer to cook more original, just stated all they had was crispy. I took it, when I got home there was no coleslaw in the bag. I called them and was told to return with the receipt for a REFUND and the coleslaw. I drove the 6 miles back to the store and was then told they couldn&apos;t give me a refund, but did offer 2 large coleslaw&apos;s. Crappy service, crappy store, crappy food. NEVER AGAIN. 



 Mark LAS VEGAS PECOLLE RANCH STORE 6/21/11 
 This restaurant on Sahara Avenue by Pecolle ranch intentionally lies and deceives you. You buy twenty pieces of chicken and they short you by half and not gic=ve you the sides you want. The Regional Manager will not return a phone call her NAme is Carollyn and they refuse her last name. her number is 702-371-0207.. They will resolve a issue and you call corporate they will not talk to you either. Transfer to customer service and they have a form evidently and they ask a question and they will not let you finish it just interupt you. They are a so poorly run and managed now I see why the store front people are so challenged.

KFC is the worst please quit buying from them and send this along to everyone you know. Eventually we will be rid of these thieves in our neighborhoods.

Mark 



 richard west 7/2/11

 k. little 7/3/11 
 i live in fayetteville ga and my this sunday my family had a coupon for buy on get one free chicken $5 meal. we went to go and order the meal and i guess she was the manager but im not for sure told us if we wanted to upgrated to all white meat we couldnt get it for free. the coupon we had didnt say what kind of meat we wanted. my great grandmother went to a kfc in mcdougnah with the same coupon and got exactly what we ordered for $5 dollars. this is nuts. dont go to kfc they are messed up.

 Mrs. Solid 6/27/11 
 I was on my lunch break and decided go the the KFC located on 1195 E. Oakton Street in Des Plaines, Il. Although the services was friendly. I notice when I got back to wwork I did not have all my food. For the past hour I have been trying to call the store at 847-296-3796 - I either get a busy signal, the phone rings and no one awsners, ot just recently, someone anwsered and hung up. I have called in the past hours 17 times. This very unprofessional. And no there is nothing wrong with the phone lines and/or are they that busy 



 Tom Mayfield 6/28/11 
 On 6/28/11 at the Sinclair lane in Baltimore, MD KFC we purchased a 6 pc chicken and it was not cooked correctly, the skin was falling/sliding off the chicken and tasted terrible, so the chicken had no crust just ugly looking chicken pcs, we called the mgm at that store and complained, however we will never go to that location again, my mother also felt sick after trying a pc to eat, never again will we buy from that location. 



 Elizabeth Bianchi 6/29/11 
 On June 28th my husband and I went into the KFC/Taco Bell located on Neltnor Ave. in West Chicago Illinois we have gone before and everytime there has been a lack of Grilled Chicken so as we stood there for 20 mins waiting for someone to take our order I asked the young man who was doing both the register and filling the food orders if they had any grilled chicken reply was it would be about 15 minutes (and this is at a time when most people eat dinner) Shocked once again that they did not have this prepared I asked to see a manager who was standing at the drive thru doing absolutely nothing because there were no cars in the drive thru (she should have been helping the guy up front doing everything) why that every time we go there they are out of everything? We got no real answer. This store is the most poorly run KFC i&apos;ve been in ever and it never gets any better!!! Maybe you should investigate exactly what this manager is getting paid for because she sure doesn&apos;t know how to run a business!! It awful and we will never be back! 



 helen mcdaniel 6/10/11 
 i live in georgia and everytime i go to the perry ga store which i feed my family once a week. I call in my order for potpies so I wont have to wait 30 minutes. for the last 3 times they sell them to the walk in people. I will not be going to kfc anymore....... i told the lady at the store i wont be back. she said they take the walk in first so long kfc 



 Creepella 6/15/11 
 Is it true that KFC defrosts their chicken in a sink, overnight, and not in a refrigerator? Yes it is true in the Butler Pa KFC. YUCK! 



 anthony d. powell 6/15/11 
 I usually try to take my son during the summer when he is with me to eat those tasty ripe tenders. The service normally very pleasing, however today made me leave you guys alone. I ordered a 6 piece and two large sides and got nothing but poor service. The manager had no control over the front service employee. i ordered it and then he told me it would take 4 minutes and felt very insulted because he did not chk with other staff to assure the order before taking it and the manager was right there and acted like it was no big deal. I felt as if the professionalism went right out the window. You can be sure that it was the straw that broke the camel back........ 



 6/16/11 
 i am highly upset!!! the kfc here in havre mt is the worst food i ever had in my life!! my family and i were big fans of kfc and we ate the alot but after moving here and trying this location im sure we will never eat kfc again. I just found out from the local people that that location has been that way for years, so my question is why hasnt anything been done about it?? so im going to assume that you didnt know but now u do so no excuses. the food was under cooked and cold. and so you know next stop health dept. 

 

 HahaGirl 6/16/11 
 I heard KFC spray paints their chickens, stomps on them and hurts them....for NO REASON. I think it&apos;s wrong and by looking at all the other complaints, it&apos;s time to SHUT DOWN KFC! 



 Tansy Leeann Symonds 6/20/11 
 I recently stumbled upon an article that i was supposed to have written. It frustrated me very much as i wasnt the one who had wrote this,,,i am not the one to talk about people behind their backs!! That is very disrespectful and childish, and if I am blunt but truthful and your feelings are hurt, all i can say is at least you were told the truth!! But anyway, the manager in question, which i know who it may be, i am not, could not, and never would be mad at you!!! What I didnt like was you know who taking way to much money out of it and he was just taking it:( Im sorry, i guess this is why people were telling me bout how you thought i was mad!! KFC in Somerset is great, clean, fast, courteous, and dependable:) I loved my job there but i just couldnt handle all the early mornings i had to be up early to go 30miles out of my way to pick up two pple, im a kind person and i didnt care,, but i got bad sick,which wasnt catching, and my body was so wore down:( with all my step kids and moving into my new home, while working, plus going and getting them.......i started to fall asleep every where lol,,,which isnt funny either,,,remember what happened,,,if that guy would have only knew how treadfully humiliating that made me,,,,,plus ended up havin to leave cause of freakin crazy ppl that was harrassin me on facebook, and to beat it off a creep followed me almost all the way home from somerset!!!! my uncles lawyer advised me to not call, dont go in, dont do anything..which was sad,,,but who was to say that creeper wasnt an employee i didnt know or even that guy who liked to prey on innocent workers without their knowledge??!! i dont care who says what,,,,pat knew i was sick and even steph asked me if i needed to go home,,,but i wear my big girl panties all the time so sick, healthy, rain, snow, or shine im going to be workin!!!! but if im contagiously sick i would at least show up to see if i could wear disinfectant gloves or something lol!!! I love yall and keep on the colonel sanders traditions!!!!
 



 joseph motyka 6/7/11 
 On June 7, my wife and I stopped at the kfc on 4420 kent roadin stow,ohio. I have never been in a resturant in such poor and dirty condition. The capet would stick to your shoes, the seats were all split open, tables were not level and my wife and I just walked out. I could not understand who would keep a place in such a condition. This is a place that the city health department should shut down. Funny as it seems I called the phone number on the back of my receipt and entered the store number of 0057 the recording told me no number was identified for this store but I was entered in the thousand dollar give away. I enter the question of my satisfaction and I pushed the key that I was not satisfied I was told I was not in the running for six weeks. As far as we are concerned kfc needs help, big time. Until we see some changes it is good bye kfc and I hope no one gets sick from eating at this location. 



 Christian imparato 5/30/11 
 I had just ate at your store in KY on mammoth cave st. It was disgusting !!!!!! The food, chairs, floor,walls, windows, bathrooms, tables . I can&apos;t believe w this being a franchise that KFC would look like this. The bread was even stale and the chicken was so brown from being from bring double dipped 2 of the 3 kids I brought would eat it. It was the worst!!!!! Clean the place up and fire the manager in charge, they obviously don&apos;t care . GROSS!!!!!

 Sandra B. 6/3/11 
 On June 2,2011 i went to the KFC here in Los Angeles California located at 5130 RODEO RD LA, CA. 90016. I placed an order and provided payment for the order in the form of a Debt Card. My total charge was $21.95 so I asked the clerk to charge my card just $20.00 and that I would pay cash for the balance of $1.95. The clerk came back to the drive thorough window and told me she made a mistake she billed the entire $21.95 to the card and that it did go through but she remembered after the fact that I only wanted $20.00 billed on the card, so she says she VOIDED the sale and ran the card again but it was declined this time of course because now it will take I believe anywhere from 5 - 7 days for that money to go back on my card. Long story short an extremely unprofessional and barely literate Manager &quot;Jose&quot; came to the window and expressed that it was not there fault and there was nothing he could do and he refused to give me the District Managers number or the Owners email or anything. He said &quot; I am the one, I am the Maanejer this is your mistake we did notting wrong&quot;. I was flabbergasted at his ignorance and illiteracy and lack of customer service skills. KFC has to be desperate to hire such uneducated and inept Management. 



 KFC Employee 5/24/11 
 For about three years now I&apos;ve been working at KFC and some of the stuff they do is just appalling. Where I work, the company (not the individual stores) were going to cut twisters, toasted wraps, grilled fillets, salads, and bbq miny melts. What were you thinking? Getting rid of everything remotely healthy?
After reading some of the comments I feel like I need to defend the employees at the restaurants though. A ton of people who come to my store (I&apos;m not a manager or anything special, so it&apos;s not my store per-say lol) complain of the cost--that&apos;s not our fault. We don&apos;t make the prices, the kfc corporation does. Sometimes, when we are slammed we run of chicken or individual pieces (breast, leg, etc) and it&apos;s not like we don&apos;t want to serve you. It takes time to bread the chicken and then for it to cook. I&apos;ve been working during the 4th of July week were we are constantly getting big bucket orders through out the whole day and sometimes we sell chicken faster than we can make it. At my store we only have 2 pressure fryers (for original) and three open fryers (for crispy, strips, popcorn chicken, wedges, hot wings, etc), so if one of our fryers starts acting up we are screwed. The fryers have to be filtered a lot through out the day and that usually takes 30 mins.

I know a lot of people who have had bad experiences at my store, but we don&apos;t intentionally piss people off. Accidents happen, we are all human. But there is a lot we can do to make the overall service better, and we are trying. Or at least I am. =( 



 Dan Jordan 5/26/11 
 I have been a satisfied customer for 42 years. The KFC in Midland, Texas N. Midkiff is an absolute disgrace. Tonight it took 30 min to go 3 cars deep in drivethru and you lost 7 cars while I was there. The food preparation has been extremely poor lately and orders constantly wrong but tonight was unbelievable. I didn&apos;t expect to run in to a rude, deliberately awful and trashy situation with the man in the window. I work hard for a living and you&apos;ve got this sloppy nasty crew with as much trash coming out of their mouths as their was on the floor. Am I supposed to accept this crappy experience because I am not a minority? Whoever is doing the hiring in this location is an incompetent liability that has destroyed this store&apos;s reputation. I would rather drive an extra 10 miles to Popeyes just so I don&apos;t have to apologize for expecting even mediocre experience and edicle food and people that aren&apos;t UnAmerican scumbags.

 The KFC in Omaha, NE on 48th&amp;L street is now open till 11:00 pm. Cool. My wife leaves the house at 10, and it is 5 minutes away. She calls me and is laughing HYSTERICALLY !! I ask her what&apos;s up. She says she is at the drive-thru...and the guy says &quot;Welcome to KFC !! We have NO chicken !!&quot; WHAT !!?!?!?!??!?! And this is NOT the first time this has happened at this particuar store. Can you imagine going to McDonalds and they tell you they have no hamburger ??

 KFC is disgusting. The meat is terrible and the workers are even worse. GO OUT OF BUSINESS!

 I have been in the drafting&amp;design field since 1990 and would like to help KFC with new or existing restaurant design. I excell at as-builds, ADAAG surveys and any other forms that KFC may require of a &quot;field-guy&quot;. Please call me at 509.386.4711 if you need assistance with any of these services.

I also don&apos;t mind travel. Although I am located in eastern Washington, I don&apos;t mind traveling as far as Arizona for work.

 I visited Kfc in Speedway, In. store #x314025 I must say that it&apos;s one of the most unsanitary Kfc I have visited.
First of all the Manager was filthy and then to top it off the young lady in drive thru was handling food and taking money and not one time was she wearing gloves, not to mention she scratched her head, rubbed her face and adjusted her clothes while fixing this customers meal in drive thru. This employee who represents Kfc along with her manager seen nothing wrong with this. I did bring it to the managers attention but believe me he was fine with this unsanitary behavior but after I brought it to his attention he asked her to put on gloves. He should have had her disgard that order she was making and wash her hands and put on gloves to remake that customers meal but of course he did not. I was so disgusted I stormed out of the restaurant, what I should have done was drove to the drive up window to let that customer know how her food was just prepared for her not to mention the mishandling of the bun with her long acrylic nails that again had no gloves on them. I will let everyone know about the type of customer service Kfc&apos;s giving there customers at the Speedway location in Indianapolis. I tried to contact the corporate office but again no way to complain to a live person with the way they have there phone system set up. I am highly disgusted with KFC!!!

Worse than &quot;Poor&quot; ------- Extremely RUDE!!!!!!

KFC Store # J718230

I picked up dinner at this store after an exhausting day. We just wanted to pick up dinner and go home, sit down to a nice meal and relax. We ordered the 20 pc chicken meal with 5 sides and 10 biscuits. As they were completing our order, we asked the cashier if she had included the biscuits with the order. TADAIJA, replied, &quot;Yes&quot;. We proceeded home with our order.

To our surprise, as we sat down to dinner, we noticed the 10 biscuits were not included with our order. I then called the KFC Store and was told I could receive credit anytime for my 10 biscuits if I would give them my name and telephone number. I explained to the Manager that her response was not very helpful at the moment since we had just sat down to dinner without our biscuits and none of us particularly felt like returning to the store to retrieve our purchased biscuits. The Manager excused her team at KFC by saying they had been really busy (we were the only customers in the store when we ordered???). I told her that was a blessing since they were a fast food restaurant and should be happy to be busy. The Manager then told me I had no business calling them and being rude to them. So, what has America come to. You don&apos;t do your job and no one has a right to call you out on it. They don&apos;t treat me like this at Church&apos;s Chicken or Lees Chicken or any other restaurant. They do their jobs and are happy to do their jobs RIGHT!!! the first time.

Sincerely,

Linda Miller

 Went to KFC a little while ago and pulled up to the drive threw. Asked for a Sunday bucket with extra crispy. The lady said she didn&apos;t think they had enough and it would be a while before it would be ready. I said that is fine then she said it would be 25 minutes. So I asked if they had original then, that it would suffice. She then proceeded to tell me that they had just sold all their chicken and it would be a 25 minute wait before there would be any chicken available. I asked her if she was serious that she was really out of the one item that they specialize in CHICKEN! I mean it is in their name and they are out. They still had two hours of business left. My other complaint is that they have quit selling the twisters. These are my husband&apos;s favorite. This store is the Quincy, Illinois 62301 store on broadway. 



 Irene Martinez 5/2/11 
 I have never had such lousy Customer Service like I did Sunday afternoon in a KFC drive thru in Pueblo Colorado. I waited in line between 20 and 30 mins. There were 2 vehicles ahead of me the first was waited on and drove foward the second waited at least 7 to 10 minutes before she was waited on. When I came up to the speaker the clerk said just a moment I waited 10 to 12 minutes then i asked if anyone was there she said wait a moment I&apos;m waiting on the car ahead of you.(she was the manager)They did not have anything prepared they were ppreparing each order as it was recieved whic included cooking the chicken. The car in front of me ordered 3 buckets with side and that manager just kept everyone waiting. This was the worst service I have every had in a fast food place. 



 Karen McCollam 5/3/11 
 I visited KFC different ones and one particular day I was out with a friend of mine and we were out around 2:30PM to enjoy a late lunch.&amp;When we got inside they were understaffed and you had to get the attention of the crew because they were in the back trying to get the mashed potatoes and gravy bowls filled. Well after we paid for our food we went walked up to the buffet bar and it was a Mess there was chocolate pudding on the top of the buffet bar and mixed in some of the fruit, the chicken gizzards were very old and hard and very little in the metal pan. there was only two original chicken in the pan.&amp;The cherry cobbler was totally gone just an empty foil pan setting there it looked old like it had been sitting there for good while. there was one hard biscuit the corner of the biscuit was broken off it was hard as a brick. I went to the front and informed the female cashier of the low food and the poor quality of food out on the buffet. she said they would be out there in a few moments to take care of it. Slowly but surely they was replacing the OLD Hard Food. I even Noticed the floors Felt Greasy as I was sliding near the walkway up to the Buffet bar. there was this little girl who walked up to the buffet bar to get her food and while she was standing there I noticed on the floor before she served herself there was Okra on the floor and on the buffet. In my astonishment of everything I got out my cell phone and began taking pictures of the KFC buffet bars Poor Quality&amp;Quantity service. I even took the extra step to go online and contact KFC headquarters and there was this guy named David Troutman supposedly from the district area of Wichita and Derby Kansas and he called me and I told him about our experience and he apologized and told me that he would get with that store and talk to the manager and even have that manager call me and that he would have the manager call us and give us a Free Buffet on them for me and my friend because of the Visit to their Restaurant was Unsatisfactory. I even told David Troutman about the cell phone pictures I took I told him it was to back up what I was seeing in person. I got the idea at the time from the commercials where the owner of a Pizza place told the customers to take pictures of their Pizzas and if anything came back unsatisfactory to their customers they would Investigate and Improve their Service to their Customers this was not the case with me David Troutman asked for me to email the pictures I took of the store and he would Investigate&amp;have the Store manager contact me to Make up for the Two meals&amp;that Never happened I even called back Mr. Troutman on his phone number he gave me through an email&amp;I even recontacted him by email and he Ignored that too.&amp;then I call KFC headquarters and the girl on the phone said she would have Upper Management contact me since David Troutman did not follow through. But NO ONE from KFC Bothered to contact me at ALL. I don&apos;t care about the Buffets bars as much as It Really ERKS me that they Really don&apos;t give a damn how the stores and the District managers Do Not Follow Up With their Promises or Contacting their Valued customers who have been Loyal in giving them Business for Years. It makes you think Twice before going into their Restaurants. Sincerely, Karen M. k_mccollam1@yahoo.com 



 HENRY LAUVER 5/3/11 
 A wise man once said, &quot;A fast nickel is better than a slow dime!&quot; I have been a weekly customer at KFC Store # J120099 in Garner, N.C. for several years. A two-piece meal with dark meat and a two-piece meal with white meat, both with two sides cost me $10.88. Then this store raised its prices by adding two drinks (weather you wanted them or not). Today was the last straw; the same two meals cost me $14.14. You have lost a regular customer; I will never purchase another meal at a KFC again. I don&apos;t mind paying for a product from a company that is in business to make a living, but I refuse to buy from a company that is in business to make a killing. &quot;A fast nickel really is better than a slow dime!&quot;

 Daniel 4/10/11 
 My family and I were traveling for spring break and decided to stop at KFC in Coldwater, Michigan. We all agreed that this was perhaps one of the worst dining experiences that we have ever had. Normally satisfied with KFC, this location was dirty, tables not wiped, food was poor tasting, waited for food and the staff was unmotivated and seemed not to care about the customer. Seemed to lack leadership in the location. 



 Sanjeet Singh 4/18/11 
 My cousin and his family had dinner at KFC near janakpuri,India. The very next morning every one got suffered with Loose Motions and Vomiting. Infact my uncle has got Food Poisioning ..We have all the bills of KFC and Doctor bills as well..
I am surely going to contact consumer court regarding this. MYSELF Sanjeet Singh and my mail id is sanjeet_2332@yahoo.co.in 



 employee( Julie Anne Brumfield) 4/19/11 
 Yes I work for your KFC store in Elberton, GA and I was wondering when would I get my first paycheck. I have been working their for 3 weeks and still haven&apos;t got anything. I got a job to bring in income to my home as I live with my disabled mother and grandmother. I don&apos;t know If their waiting for me to get a checking account or what but I the town we live in I can&apos;t get a checking account. My grandmother said she would put it on her account but would prefer I would get a check through the mail. 



 L. S. kENT 4/8/11 
 The KFC on Candler Rd, Decatur, GA, is nasty. I ordered some chicken and 1 side order. When I received the food, The side order was stuffed inside the box on top of the biscuit with the chicken pressed against it. That was nasty because I didn&apos;t know where the container had been, and how many people hand were on it. I called the manager to voice my concerns, and he appeared to not care one way or another; he blew me off. Please do something about this nastiness, there are plenty other stores selling chicken, and not germs. 



 Sash 4/4/11 
 I&apos;ve never been to the KFC closest to where I live now, but I was sure I knew where it was located. Just to make sure, I checked out the website on my phone. It showed that the restaurant was about 10 miles off. I checked the PC site, and the location on the map was wrong too. I also wanted to check out the menu, because it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been to a KFC, but neither site has one! Your maps are wrong, and you have no menu on your websites! Seeing all the problems with the sites, I didn&apos;t want to bother to even trying my chances at the restaurant. I sent an e-mail, and got a response from a G.M. saying that KFC corporate is inept. I cannot believe all these horror stories, and what&apos;s worse, the spelling! No one can spell!!!!! Jordens_dad@yahoo.com 



 Tansy Symonds 3/30/11 
 
i love the chicken but not the manager who illegally cashed my paycheck unknowingly to me!!! KFC IS A GREAT PLACE TO EAT!!!!!!!!! 



 3/30/11 
 I am also sitting eating a meal, they only gave me 5 potato wedges, did not even bother heating my doubleicious sandwich, it was thrown together, was cold and the cheese was just laying on it without being melted 



 Jessica 3/30/11 
 Horrible customer service at the location in Feferal Way, WA! I have been here twice in as many years (yes it took THAT long to get over the first incident!) and low and behold a similar experience tonight! After ordering and paying for my food, I was told there wasn&apos;t enough chicken prepared to complete my 8 pc meal. I was offered the missing prices in another flavor or told to pull around and wait which I opted to do. After 20 minutes and 32 other customers were served I went inside the establishment and was told that they &quot;forgot and were out of chicken for another 16 minutes!&quot; I was told that I could not and would not be issued a refund and to top it all off, the original order was left bagged from my initial trip through the drive thru until they added the 2 missing pieces to it! That&apos;s right for those if you counting nearly 40 minutes! The food was cold, stale and disgusting! I will NEVER return! 



 Valerie Martin 3/30/11 
 To whom it may concern,

I am not sure if I have the correct e-mail for this situation but I was in your KFC store #0750043 Show Low az on 3/29/2011 at 6:33 pm Amber was working the cash register and Ashley was getting the food together. Amber had told me that it would be a few minute for the extra crispy to be ready. I was more than willing to wait. As I was waiting James yelled at Ashley and said what are you doing standing around. Her response was she was waiting for the chicken to be done. He told her if you are standing around than you can go home. In my experience with fast food if you are a manager and you know its almost dinner time for most people you better have the food ready in a fast food facility . When I got there there were 5 cars in the drive threw and three sets of customers in side including my self. If I could hear what James the manager was saying to his employees than I am sure others did as well. I think when you are in a management position you should not reprimand your employees were the public can hear and you should be prepared for customers at any given time in a fast food facility. I waited for my food for 20:15 min and for fast food that is not very fast. I blame your manager James and will not be returning to your fast food restaurant again and will tell others about my experience with you manager unless something is done about your manager James.



Thank you for your time,
Valerie Martin


 



 Jessica 3/28/11 
 I called about my online application at the Kings Mountain, NC location. The young man who was so called the hiring manager told me he did not &apos;do&apos; online applications. I asked him when I would be able to come in and see him. He did not know. Then I asked him when he was working, and he replied &quot;it depends on what days I work&apos;. I was so disgusted I just hung up the phone. What poor management! 



 Zack Craig 3/19/11 
 Yesterday, (March 18, 2011), My dad and I when to the KFC/LGS in Knights dale, NC. I had to say it was the worst meal we ate from there. First they don&apos;t sell the honey BBQ wings anymore, second the sides were two small at 1.69 each, third we didn&apos;t get everything we asked for a first, we repeatedly when up there to get ALL of out food we asked for. The Mashed Potato side I asked for was cold, The Fried chicken strips I asked for where VERY small and the seafood basket my dad got didn&apos;t have all the components the picture on the menu said we would get, The guy taking our order was plain rude, he didn&apos;t ask if we wanted ketchup or any other sauces,(After the fact we asked for all our food that he didn&apos;t get for us, so he was kinda pissed), and he gave up honey mustard instead of the tarter sauce my dad wanted for his fish. I hope it was just a off day at that store, but all I have to say is, I don&apos;t think ill be eating there again. Lastly it was WAY to cold in there, my dad had 5 back operations and get was shivering the hold time we ate. 



 Kim 3/19/11 
 Today is the last time I will visit the KFC on newberry road in Gainesville FL. I ordered 4 wings and a biscuit. I got 3 wings and a leg. I called to complain they said they gave me the leg because there were no other crispy wings. I would have had to wait 15 minutes. Then why didn&apos;t they give me a breast or better yet give me the option of changing my order. They told me to bring it back for a refund. They had the nerve to try to only refund me for the meal and not the drink. In the end I got the entire amount back. That was my last visit. 



 Kellyn barnard 3/16/11 
 I went to store #x900031 and the employee that took my order was name Vyasha. Well I bought the $5.00 special and I was diappointed once again the did not put bacon on my double licious chicken sandwhich and chicken was hard as a rock. I&apos;m so discusted you lost my business 



 robert g. 3/11/11 
 I went to a kfc resturant 3-10-11 purchased a 16 piece which came with four sides, got home one side I ordered was not there,biscuits were dry and pasty,the gravy was nothing more than colored water,baked beans tasted like pure bbq.sauce and the chicken had no taste. I use to enjoy kfc but my family and I are done. Total cost of this disaster was $41.00 which included a three piece chicken strip meal. 



 Hmm, Summerville SC (open to &quot;concerned parent&quot;) 3/7/11 
 I cannot rate the KFC HQ but did want to comment on the service at this S&apos;ville KFC
as being HORRIBLE....the kids always on their cell phones, when taking orders acting like they cannot speak at a level nor hear you.

We have NOT been back.

I&apos;m suprised they even pay some of these people! 



 Shannon Showe 3/10/11 
 We gWo to the KFC on Mission Gorge in Santee and can&apos;t believe the service. No matter what we order for chicken, they never have enough. They tell us the wait is too long and they will add something else to replace it. We also have another problem with the amount of chicken we get. If we order a 16 piece, we get 12. COUNT YOUR CHICKEN! We are ALWAYS missing chicken. The manager in Santee, CA. is rude! Looks like we need to get the &quot;UNDER COVER BOSS&quot; show to KFC. They need a new crew. 



 Susan 3/10/11 
 The KFC in Davie Florida on Pine Island Rd. needs a visit from the health department. For two reasons:
1.-&quot;The person with her picture on the wall&quot; by the name of Emma...needs training on how to make herself presentable in order to serve any type of customers. She makes anybody fell unconfortable eating from that kitchen.
Does KFC provides with health insurance or dental????? How about making then a suggestion.
2.Emma love to serve her old pieces of chicken...:-)it&apos;s clear that these days FKC is hurting! because MC Don. Burg.K and Wendy&apos;s have a better quality of chicken!
...Does anyone has a clue from where in the world are KFC&apos;s chickens? Really.

2.- The way they cook it, and serve it, an collect the cash, plus they do not wash their hands when they are going from the register to the food!!
Have you ever seeing the same person doing all 3 task at Mc Don. Burger K. or Wendy&apos;s? NEVER, please pay attention next time.
Before you eat at KFC, think of your health!! their hygene is not on their training manuals for sure!! plus their employees are not G.E.D approved. You get it?
Really. The guys at the corner of 595 selling newpaper could look better and act smarter, plus do a much better job keeping things clean!!
Mr. KFC please get out of Davie - we need a better food chain in that location!!! 



 isela smith 3/4/11 
 i walked into the kfc store on 17701 N.w. 27th Avenue in miami florida around 3:30 pm on march 4,2011 to buy something to eat and i stood standing for 5 minutes waiting to be taken care of and no body at the restaurant not even the cashier came to my aid to try and ake me what would i like to order. i am hispanic and i feel like this is discrimination because the employees where all african american or black americans they did not even greet me. the company policy states that you should greet all customers so i turned around and walked out and on my way walking out another customer said to the cashier &quot; you guys made the customer walk away because you totally ignored them. i am very dissapointed. 



 Sandra Escobedo 3/7/11 
 I usually go to the one closest by my house store #X900068 in Phx Az. If you have any common sense do not go there. The few times I have been there the employees along with the manager have screwed up my order and thats everytime I&apos;ve gone. This last time I went I asked for the remaining of my order from the the last time and surprise surprise they didnt remember. Now this time around (please people whatever you do check your food)!!! I found a piece of plastic stuck on a piece of chicken with a time on it. Now that was the last straw.. I will never eat there again, I will submit a report to the health dept and I want my money returned to me. I did not pay 30.00 for a chicken and a piece of plastic. Now the &quot;acting manager&quot; name Angel was as rude as can be of course. What else could be expected. I&apos;ve talked to the Customer Service people and was told someone will contact me in 24 hrs well its going on a week now and I still havent heard anything. But do believe I will be calling again today.. 03/07/2011 

 

 Rhonda B 2/26/11 
 Hello Everyone. First of all. I want to say that I use to love to go to KFC.But Lately. When we pick it up and bring it home. I get ready to eat and the chicken isn&apos;t done.I have been going to the same KFC for 11 years now in South Jersey, and the past couple of years now. Your franchise has been going down hill. The cooks are not taking thier time to make sure the chicken is cooked. the orders are most of the time, not the right order.. it is getting where I don&apos;t want to got here anymore. I feel that when a person is working for an place such as yours.When you are working for a place.. You are repesnting that place. and to be honest with you. The ones that are working for you are not repesenting KFC the way they are suppose to... Your People wonder why KFC is always closing. Well. Please take a deep hard look at your workers.. To me. its like they don&apos;t care about KFC. and they don&apos;t care if anyone&apos;s order is messed up. everytime I have to call there, they say they are sorry and they will give me the meal free or another piece.. I tell them.thats not what I want. I do not care to get a free meal. I just want my order done the right way. its not asking to much. But when a person pays for a meal that they order. then that person should be able to have the right order and a cooked one. I also feel that if you really want to know why KFC is closing. Please ask your customers that go to KFC regulerly what can you at kfc do to make it better and to keep the customers coming back. I am tell you. that this is the reason why. The food is not cooked right anymore and the orders are wrong 70 percent of the time.... I have been going to KFC for over 40 years now. and I am sad to say that it is no longer the place I think of when I am wanting to eat fastfood. and that is so sad..
KFC. I thing if you want to keep your customers coming back..... Start getting involved with the store and take pride like it use to be. There is no pride anymore.. no care put into the chicken anymore. thats is just so sad.. You all have a good day....ceramic42@msn.com

 Shannon Finn 2/15/11 
 KFC suppliers cram birds into huge waste-filled factories, breed and drug them to grow so large that they cant even walk, and often break their wings and legs. At their slaughter house, the birds throats are slit and they are dropped into tanks of scalding-hot water, often while they are still conscious. It would be illegal for KFC to abuse dogs, cats, pigs, or cows in these ways. Knowing this makes me sick. 



 Mrs. Ross&apos; - What happened to the great taste? 2/15/11 
 I wanted some fresh Green Beans today and just did not feel like cooking any over the stove. I asked my husband to stop by KFC, store #1671 in Columbus and get me a large Green Bean. Well, after tasting two bites of the dish, I had to immediately go get by blood pressure cuff on to see my results. It shames me to say that the Green beans tasted as if the KFC put a entire thing of iodize salt in the large container. I called and spoke to a Christie who told me that they just started using a seasoning today for their food. Really? Has it come to this? Instead of having a fresh taste of green beans we now have to have the most saltiest, soggy green beans and yet be charged enormous prices to pay for the commercials to make us THINK that KFC has great tasting food? Do you not care about fresh food anymore? How about great tasting like the founder would have wanted it? You see, it is not about the revenue, but about the people. The money will always be there, but not if you make salty food that causes people to have heartaches in their 40&apos;s. I ask for no fame, no free stuff, no rainchecks...but FRESH FOOD. No need for that much salt in your food. Bring back what made you famous...Good Chicken, great selections...BAKE BEANS (which you stop selling).

Thank you for allowing me to vent. I was so disappointed with my dinner.

 I think your ads are false. For one thing when you say a person gets an 8 piece meal how can i count 8 pieces on the top of bucket. I just want to know whats is in that bucket. That is false advertisement. And i will be bring it up.

 I have been to 2 KFCs in Louisiana tonight and both were absolutely deplorable service. No crispy chicken, nobody responding on the drive through, and RUDE employees. I hope y&apos;all go out of business. You suck! 



 Laurie 2/19/11 
 We live 20 miles from KFC, so I&apos;m not going back today or ever. We did not get everything we ordered but of course we were charged for it. We are looking at the menu and ordering and three times we were told &quot;That&apos;s not on the menu&quot; that we were looking straigt at. then we get homw without everything we ordered. Not a happy camper! 



 Amber Glass 2/10/11 
 My first job was at KFC located in Auburn,CA on Grassvalley Highway. It was the worst first experience I have ever had. My manager, Roger, gave me a size Large for a shirt and size 34 pants in men. I only weight 115 pounds and the outfit I had to wear made me look very unprofessional. I had brought it to his attention plenty of times for him to order me the right size. I also told him I could get my own pair but he refused that I had to wear KFC brand. I could go on and on with this list. But Roger was the worse boss and I am glad that I quit that job when I did.

I wish I could make it a -100 stars.

 Gone 2x&apos;s (in the same week) to KFC here in Columbia MD, 7125 Minstrel Way
and both times they are out of potatoes. How on God&apos;s green earth can you run out of that. You have to be about the dumbest person Hired to do Inventory to let your store run out of potatoes. We should be able to charge KFC when we go there and they are out of what we want!!!!!!!!!! where is the customer satisfaction?!? 



 PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED 2/1/11 
 My name is Brittany Smith and I used to work for KFC in Tarboro, NC. I stopped working there because of the poor management that was portrayed by the store manager and because I was a full time student (something she failed to realize). Because of the distance I had from the store and the university I am currently enrolled in, I had parent go to the store to pick up my last pay check stud. The manager gave my dad a very hard time and went so far as tried to pick a fuss with him. That was so unprofessional and shows poor judgement on her behalf. My parent simply asked for a number to call the head office and she refused to do so. She has always been nasty to her employees and to her customers. Yes she is a strict woman, but there&apos;s a difference in being strict and being RUDE. 



 Janetta Boarman 1/31/11 
 I have a complaint about the way the owners of KFC in Owensboro Ky handled the closing of their store on Parrish Ave,the owners gave the employees no notice what so ever that thay were closing the store down as of yesterday 1/30/2011.I don&apos;t know how long they have been bussiness owners but this is not the way of a good bussiness and it does not reflect well on KFC as a whole. Not only am I writting this but I am also contacting the newspaper and several other websites and I will also make a website of my own telling all of this inhumain practice of KFC unless these bussiness owners are not repremanded and make some type of compinsation to their employees that they have left without any way to put food on their families table or pay their bills.Many of these people are the sole providers in their household.What these people did in not giving any notice to their employees was so wrong on so many levels,in saying that I will do everything in my power and the internets power to make sure that KFC is not welcome in our city.This is a terrible way for a bussiness with the name Kentucky in it to treat its Kentucky emoloyees. I am not a employee of kfc I was a daily patron. Janetta Leigh Boarman 316 Hale ave. #28-F Owensboro,KY 42301

 John Harper 1/17/11 
 I typically do not waist my time complaining, however this was just way to bad...
I stopped at KFC in Dequeen AR during a business trip. As I walked in I noticed they had a food bar. I paid before I looked, big mistake!!!!! The food looked like it had been there for a really long time, since I had already paid I grabbed the only piece of chicken available and set down. I bit into the thigh and blood squirted out!!! I took several pictures of the bloody chicken as proof that this REALLY happened.. The lady behind the register was kind enough to give me my money back and I left. She also gave me a hand written invite to come back and eat a meal for free; really..While the gesture was kind I could NOT possibly go back to that KFC ever again. You may contact me at john@beecreeklogandtimber.com. 



 graydon l. brown 1/17/11 
 I walked into kfc at quarter of 9 on 1/17/11 located at 1221 eastern blvd. baltimore md.21221.I asked for a 12 piece grilled chicken deal.The store is suppose to be open until 10pm.I WAS TOLD THAT THEY ONLY HAD A FEW PIECES AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO MIX AND MATCH WICH I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO DO .I asked the young girl serving me if they could make some more.She said they could not.My poinion is and i believe it to be correct is if you advertise a product you should at least sell it or at least prepare it to be sold at a customers request.I really like the grilled chicken and i was hoping this could be a regular thing but i dought it now.kj24642556002.trace#000203.appr code087135 batch#000024. thank you.

 Benjamin Galvan 1/14/11 
 To whom it may concern,

Last evening I purchaced a 6 piece meal at 6PM at your KFC store located at 2429 East Vally Parkway store # C301019 Ticket # 3071.
I have 2 complaints;

1.While I was there a cashier by the name of JOY took my order and money. I was the 2ND or 3RD customer. After attending to me she went on to make several sandwiches with out washing her hands. When I pointed out the fact she did not wash her hands, she replied &quot;Yes I did&quot; I then told her she had not washed her hands and advised her that I have been observing her. All the other employees laughed at her and some said &quot;your busted&quot;. Cashier Joy at this time walked over and washed her hands. JOY was not happy about this at all.

2. Upon arriving home (30 Min), I served my wife a plate of her favorite chicken KFC. After a couple of minutes my wife made the comment ref. the chicken taste funny...very pasty. I then took a bite of the chicken and notice a foul taste.
I then contacted the store and spoke with Manager Juan at about 7PM. I advised Juan of what had occurred and added that he should check his chicken to make sure it&apos;s not out of code/date and to check his boiler to make sure the greese was not old. I added the chicken had a foul pasty taste to it. I never told Juan about the cashier JOY who did not wash her hands. Reason, he was present during my questioning of JOY and he did not say anything to her. Manager Juan said to come back in and he would exchange the chicken. I told him I lived quite a few miles away but I would be in tomorrow to talk to a manager. Juan said he would write it in his book an advised me to come in and talk to either Norma or Daniel. I then told Juan &quot; I hope they will know all about this problem&quot; Manage Juan said they would.

On 1/14/2011 @ 9:30AM I contacted Norma at your store. After explaining what occurred, she had no idea and added that Juan did not advise her. After hearing my entire ordeal, Manager Norma offered me a 8 piece meal. I told her that was rediculious to offer a customer 2 more pieces of chicken for what I had gone through. I added, would KFC paid my doctor&apos;s bill and time off work? Manager Norma stated she would have the General Manager call me as soon as he came in later that morning. It is 3:15PM and I have not heard from your manager Daniel.

In closing, I cannot believe your Corp. inability to handle this issue. Maybe I should contact someone who can...San Diego County Health and Safety, Health Department.
My name is Benjamin Galvan (760) 535-8804 bogalvan777@sbcglobal.net I would appreciate a call or follow up to this entire issue. 



 mary freeman 1/3/11 
 My family and I were at your store at 4504 jefferson Davis Hwy, Richmond, va. on January 2,2011. They ordered their meal, and was told that they didn&apos;t serve that particular food, such as baked beans, so why did they have them advertised on the menu? They didn&apos;t give polite service. They were told they didn&apos;t serve BBQ wings, no baked beans. Then, when they wanted a bag to carry the rest of their food away, they had to wait forever to get one. No, they were not that busy, that they had to wait. When we go to the one at Chester, Va. we get good service. We surely will NOT be going to the Jefferson Davis store anymore. I am not racist. Some of my best friends are black, but I think if my face had been black that day, i would have gotten better service. The biggest majority of the customers there are black. God bless them all, but that does not mean that we should not get good service, also. Thank you. 



 Jackie 1/4/11 
 I recently went to a KFC near my home. It was this past Saturday, New Years Day. I do not go their frequently anymore. I think the prices are too high for the amount you get. We love the mashed potatoes and gravy and cole slaw, so I went. I had chicken at home but decided since my son and I love the Honey BBQ wings to stop in the pouring down rain. I ordered 2 large sides of mashed potatoes, two large sides of cole slaw and an order of 20 piece Honey BBQ wings. The young man informed me that they no longer have them but they were they same but you just got dipping sauces instead. Well let me tell you that they are not even close to being the same!!! They were so dry in was amazing!!! There was no meat on them at all. I get better wings at the Deli counter at Wal Mart! I wanted to go back but like I said it was pouring down rain. I do not know what the reason for taking the wings off the menu and adding these was, but it was a really bad one. I will not be going to KFC anytime soon again. I feel like I just wasted my money!!!! Thank You 



 John Doe 1/6/11 
 I work at Kfc.. And I read some of the stuff that yall put on here.. And is that all yall know how to do is complain!! If yall dont like Kfc then dont go back. Dont sit on here down grading the place i mean crap i hate when people complain cause it puts all the employees in a crappy mood and makes it hard on everybody good god!!!!!!! 



 nicole lensky 1/7/11 
 My husband ordered a 12 piece chicken strip meal. Mashed Potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, mac and cheese. They gave us a 12 piece on the bone mashed potatoes and gravy, mac and cheese. When I called them they argued with me about the cole slaw. They said if i returned the chicken they would give me strips. I live ten minutes away on a good day. The weather outside is very bad, the roads are very slick. The lady on the phone didn&apos;t care if I was happy or not. They will never get my business again. I even asked her about making me happy and she didn&apos;t seem to care. Their loss is another business gain. 



 Mad in Arlington 1/8/11 
 We purchased almost 70.00 worth of food from the store on Cooper St., in Arlington, Texas for my daughter&apos;s graduaton celebration. I have filed several complaints to get our money back and have been ignored for months. The chicken was disgusting even though we called ahead and asked that it be cooked fresh for the order; we were assured it would be. Our guests threw most, if not all, of their food away. It was so embarrasing. The corporate office sent us a $25.00 coupon to reuse in their store. I sent it back and asked for a full refund. They have yet to fully respond. Don&apos;t ever eat or order from here...the food terrible and the staff is even worse! 



 Eric Ruiz 12/30/10 
 The service at KFC on North Main Street in Providence, RI is horrible! There is never any hot wings available. They seem to be very unorganized. There wait time is way to long. They take your order and tell you 9 minutes for wings and it ends up being 20 minutes. I had stopped going there for awhile to see if things had changed and unfortunately it has not.I am very surprised they are still open. I won&apos;t be back!

 A Office Professional 12/3/10 
 I visited your East Orange, New Jersey location located on Central Avenue, right down the street from my office. When I entered the location I stood and waited for over 5 minutes since there was no KFC employee to greet me and to take my order. I had to raise my voice to get the attention of one the cooks in the back section and was told that someone will be out as soon as they finish what they was doing. Finally one person came out and did not offer any appology for the delay and my wait time. When the Manager stepped out, I referred the problem to her regarding the wait time in placing my order. She stated to me &quot;well when I come to your office, I have to wait&quot;. I was surprised by this unprofessional attitude regarding this matter. I stated to her that this is different, I am a customer with money to spend for a product. She answered and said &quot;well I pay for the services at your office, it is my money that pays for the lights, paper, and other things that you use&quot;. I was greatly offended by such a reply from someone who is supposed to be Supervisor and be an example to her fellow employees that she supervises. She offered no applogy and others that work with me in my office also felt that the way that she spoke to a paying customer was very disrespectful. I did report this matter to the corporate office over two weeks ago, requesting a District Manager contact me to talk about this matter. As of today, no call has been made to my office regarding the incident that occured two weeks ago. Since that time to now, I have not visited any KFC in the area where I live or work. Why pay good money to an organization when you are not treated with the proper respect that is due a paying customer? 



 Wallace 12/8/10 
 On my visit last night, I was served a chicken sandwich that was so hard it couldn&apos;t be eaten. When I asked for a supervisors number it took a while for them to track it down. When I called the person in charge of the area (Shawn Baker) I never heard back. I guess it was above him to call me reguarding my complaint. I think that your company&apos;s lack of guest relations will be your downfall. I have been in food management my entire life and love my job. I, personally, respond to every guest comment on a daily basis. This is the way you build a solid guest base and a loyal following. I have never been ignored when giving feedback (good or bad). Take notice before you lose even more guests and more profits. As said before, this review was not worth even one star. 



 David Shaffer 12/12/10 
 Hello, I am located in Niles Ohio and work in Warren at Arcelormittal Warren Coke Plant and on this evening I took a chance and made a bad decision to stop and see if I could order something to take to work. At this Warren location they seem to only hire morons, as I pulled up to the speaker I ordered a 20 piece honey barbecue wing order along with 3 orders of apple turnovers. It was about 18 minutes till 6 in the evening and I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait I said that would be fine. Did I mention that I repeated my order twice, so anyhow I pulled up and waited and waited and finally got my order at about 2 minutes after 6. I now am behind and didn&apos;t check to see if they got my order right, which I now regret. So I get to work andrelieve mybuddy and wouldn&apos;t you know it I didn&apos;t get even one honey barbecue wing but something else. I am immediately upset as what they gave me I didn&apos;t even like. So now 12 hour shift to go with only 6 turnovers to eat. I then called the store whom weren&apos;t even in the phone book, (had to call another store) anyway I called and they said if I brought them back they would make it right. Well that&apos;s not possible since I can&apos;t leave work so I asked for a gm&apos;s number and they said they couldn&apos;t give out kevin&apos;s number, I said fine give me a corporate number and was told they don&apos;t have one. I call a corporate number I found on this site and wasn&apos;t able to talk with anyone. I will not give up until I get to unload on someone in charge about this location. I will make it my personal mission to talk anyone out of going to this location. Thanks for letting me vent but I&apos;m still not satisfied. My name is David Shaffer and invite anyone from management to call me at 330-502-3437. 



 12/9/10 
 Hi, I have worked at KFC for over a year now and I am racially discriminated by a manager I work with. I have told the owner and nothing gets done about it. I cant get help from anyone an also I can believe that this is excepted and is okay in a working environment! It discusses me

 MILTON FLORIDA KFC MANAGER (CARLOS) SHAME ON YOU!!! 12/2/10 
 KFC IN MILTON, FLORIDA JUST TRANSFERRED IN A IRRESPONSIBLE MANAGER (CARLOS)THERE ONLY 3 WEEKS AND RAISED THE PRICES ON THE NORMAL 3 PIECE CHICKEN ONLY DARK MEAT FROM $2.76 TO $3.19 YOU ARE STUPID BECAUSE WHERE YOU TRANSFERRED FROM THE PRICES WERE SET IN ACCORDINGLY TO THAT COUNTY, ESCAMBIA COUNTY NOT SANTA ROSA COUNTY.
YOU DIDN&apos;T EVEN CONSULT WITH ANYONE IN THE UPPER MANAGEMENT BEFORE DOING THIS THUS IT MUST HAVE BEEN YOUR EGOTISTICAL ATTITUDE.
I HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THAT EGO OF YOURS ALSO BROUGHT THIS ABOUT.
SANTA ROSA COUNTY IS MADE UP OF MOSTLY RETIRED PEOPLE, NOT THOSE OF WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND NOT TO MENTION THAT STORE YOU USED TO WORK IS NOW CLOSED DOWN.

WHY WOULD YOU TRY AND FIX SOMETHING THAT ISN&apos;T BROKE? THIS PRODUCT IS VERY MUCH UTILIZED AND IT BRINGS IN THE PEOPLE TO KFC AT THAT LOCATION, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE..........IGNORANCE IN MOTION IS WHAT YOU&apos;RE DISPLAYING............................

IGNORANCE!!! NOW YOU&apos;LL RUN THESE VERY PEOPLE AWAY THAT RELIED ON THESE PRICES AND I CAN SEE IF WERE A BUCKET OF CHICKEN, OR LARGER PRODUCT.
JUST AS OTHER FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS ALWAYS HAVING ITEMS THAT SUIT THE NEEDS OF THOSE ON FIXED INCOMES, BUT YOU LACK ECONOMIC REASONING AND INSTEAD OF BEING THERE FOR THE CUSTOMER INSTEAD YOU COME THERE JUST NEWLY TRANSFERRED AND NOW ARE TRYING INCORPORATE YOUR INEXPERIENCED TRAINING, AND NOT TO MENTION YOUR NON-CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTITUDE ALSO. IN THIS ECONOMY WHY RAISE A PRICE ON A MEAL THAT SUITED THE NEEDS OF THOSE RELYING ON IT. SHAME ON YOU CARLOS. SHAME.....SHAME......SHAME........... 



 Alfred Dean 12/2/10 
 My wife and I have enjoyed KFC for over 40 years and were looking forward to a dishless dinner on Sunday night. I stopped at the local Leominster store to place an order and they were out of chicken! When I asked the pleasant counter girl what happened, she apologized and indicated there was a management problem. I have contacted corporate customer relations twice and have had no response. It appears that the corportate level is as uncaring about their customers as is the local franchisee. 



 Jim Dennis 11/29/10 
 I went to the KFC at the Airport Circle/Route 130 in Pennsauken, NJ back in May, 2009 and found it to be full of racist, white hating ghetto trash. I&apos;m pretty laid back and don&apos;t hate on anybody, so needless to say, when I heard one guy say &quot;Man, what this white muthaf@#cka want?&quot; followed by some more racist stuff by his buddy, I figured I was in the wrong neighborhood and left.

I called KFC customer service the next day and told them about it,and the lady on the other end could&apos;ve cared less and gave me a fake &quot;Well I sure am sorry about that.&quot; I demanded that the manager call me and that I was entitled to an apology and she basically said &quot;OK, Thank you.&quot; and hung up.

KFC doess not care. It&apos;s evident in the trash they hire, in how they don&apos;t keep the restaurants clean, in the slop they serve up, and how they treat the customers. 



 austin metzler 11/29/10 
 i have loved kfc my entire life. been reading complaints and it doesnt make since so what nothing in life is a hundred percent kfc has the perfect blend of seasonings and spices and the spicy crunchy is on point keep up the good work.

 

 

 11/20/10 
 my name is evelyn and i live in fountain colorado, i went to my local kfc on highway 85/87 and ordered a bucket of the grilled chicken. After eating a few peices i noticed that one of the brests was very raw on the inside, as was the rest of the peices at my bucket, i went to the store to make a complaint and i kept the chicken as evidence and if i get sick within the next 48 hours i will sue. if anyone of you corporate employees are reading this please contact me at 719-244-5888 or 720-322-6883. 



 P.Calaway-Webb 11/15/10 
 Tonight i stoped to get chicken from KFC, we all realy enjoy it and have it 3-4 times a month. Tonight i stoped at a store i dont normaly go to. And was my family disapointed. I got a 15pc bucket and it was over cooked, i have never had chicken as hard and it goes without saying dry from KFC befor. Store#C0002081 4 22 4638. I called and they wanted me to bring it back tonight. I told her i couldnt and asked if she just could send me coupons and i was told they dont do that. Needless to say i will not be going back to that store agen. I guess buisness is so good they dont care it they have unhappy customers who will not return. Nice. 



 Sherri Palmer 11/11/10 
 Good Afternoon, I go to the KFC store#J870017 just about 4 days a week for lunch. I go because I like the service I get for Christina. She&apos;s very nice and friendly she makes you feel very comfortable there. Great Job!

 If there was a 0 among the choices, that&apos;s what your restaurant would&apos;ve gotten, if not lower. It&apos;s inadmissible that a restaurant carrying your name can opt out of participating in &quot;KFC&quot; offers/discounts. How is that representative of the &quot;KFC&quot; brand? And to top it off, to have the KFC coupon I carried refused by a so called &quot;District Manager&quot; who refused to provide her identity or the owner&apos;s information, alledging it&apos;s part of the privacy law. Nice way of taking ownership for the words that came out of her mouth. Nice going Miami Beach! * for anybody who may be interested, the address is 930 Arthur Godfrey Rd.. Go check out for yourselves the nasty service and attitude. 



 Lisa H 10/18/10 
 My daughter has been working at KFC for six months. She was just fired for calling out on the first of the month. oct. 1. She had been sick for awhile, and going to work anyway, (which I find wrong, I don&apos;t want to eat food being prepared by a sick person)and had a note from our family doctor. They say it&apos;s in the rulebook about calling out on 1st of the month, and it is grounds for immediate termination. I had my daughter go ask for the rules, which she never received. She was told that they don&apos;t have a copy of them, they are in someones car. ??? Anyway, not that she really wants her job back, because she has been being ripped off of her pay. She is 17 and was told she can only work a certain amount of hours, so when she covered for someone else, which she often does, she was not allowed to be paid for all hours and was told they would give the rest in next paycheck. When next pay came and money still wasn&apos;t there she was told she didn&apos;t work that many hours. As far as I know they should be able to check computer. They clock in and out at their registers so how come they can&apos;t check? I am going to report this to everyone and anyone I can. I am outraged at this! 



 Worst job ever 10/16/10

 I try to eat at the KFC here in Mountain Home, AR. but it is a trial to go there. I have to use a powerchair to get around due to my disability. There are steps to get into the store unless I go on the traffic side of the building and risk getting hit by passing cars. Also, God forbid that I need to use the bathroom facilities there. They advertise that it is a &quot;handicapped Bathroom&apos; but how can people in wheel chairs get into the bathroom when there are three steps leading down to the bathroom level? It may be handicap equiped, I don&apos;t know as I have never been able to get onto the proper level to access the bathroom. I have spoken to the manager and been told to &quot;take it up with headquarters, we don&apos;t do that kind of thing here&quot;. The American Disabilities Act states that &apos;ALL&apos; businesses shall be accessable for those with a disability. So, how can they say that they &apos;don&apos;t do that kind of thing (making it accessable for the handicapped)&quot;?

 KFC in Nashville Tennesse off of Bell RD forces my boyfriend to come into work sick. On Sunday October 10th and on Thursday October 14th he was told while he was throwing up and running a fever that he had to come to work. This is an outrage. I am currently enrolled in school to become a doctor and I am aware that this is a health risk to not only the other employees but to the customers. He prepares and cooks all the food while constantly having to run to the restroom to relieve himself. On Sunday I know for a fact he threw up at least three times while cooking. It is a wonder that he didnt throw up on the fryer or any of the preparatory counters... On another note, while running a fever you are still contagious 24 hours after the fever breaks. So on Monday October 11th, he was still contagious and still cooking food. This show just how &quot;clean&quot; KFC really is.

 I went to get chicken for my Family.I asked for Crispy and was told that they longer served crispy at this location, You only serve Chicken I should be able to get fried crispy chicken not grilled or original.. Hell you are a chicken restaurant I hope they build a popeyes chicken right next to you.

PS. But they will fry two Chicken strips and two pieces of cheese and add bacon. that is just a heart attack waiting to Happen.

 We live in South Jersey and was suprised to see so many KFC&apos;s closing. I can see why now. WE went to the KFC in Woodbury the other night and ordered 2-2piece meals. We asked for a breast and a leg. We waited and waited and waited. While we were waiting, we saw 3 people walk out of there because the girl said she only had two pieces of crispy breasts and they weren&apos;t making anymore. We got there at 6:45, It was almost 7:05 by the time we finally got out of there with no chicken because she said it would be about 20 minutes or so. Why didn&apos;t she just tell us that right when she took our order. There are other things that happened also, but I&apos;m not writing a book.

 I just relocated to James Island(Charleston) SC. So far I have been to the KFC on Folly Road at least 4 times and it is always an amazing experience of the poorest service and a trial to get chicken at all. I have a older picky cat who only wants to eat KFC original chicken breast. This was no problem when we lived in Washington state but here in Charleston its been such a trial. First visit I sat at drive through for so long with no response I drove up to window where 3 employees did their best to ignore me. Finally I got out and tapped on the window. Visit #2 they had NO Chicken! Visit #3 was no original but crispy. Visit #4 was no original and such a old hard grilled breast that Elvis refused to touch it. Also the cost of the breast changes from 2.00 to 3.00 with no explanation and may i add the service is always nasty and you feel like you are bothering them! So much for southern hospitality! Poor Elvis... now I am trying to interest him in other chicken like Popeyes. When this franchise closes its doors I will know why!
Ps. I did ask for the owner&apos;s name and number, and was told to call the 1-800 number on back of the receipt. NO MORE KFC FOR US! 



 John McCarver 6/15/10 
 Iam sitting here trying to eat a breast plate from our local kfc. The store ID #J065014,
this I must say is the worst meal I have ever had from a KFC, my wife knows I love KFC and
she surprised me with this plate for supper. I suppose my biggest complaint is that the biscuit was larger than the chicken breast. The cole slaw had alot to be desired in the taste. I figure the stores are locally owned and the only person who is going to hear this complaint is the person reading it now. Oh well, at least I have made my complaint known. Thank you for taking time to read my letter anyway. By the way this complaint is real: My name is: John McCarver and my phone number is 256-437-5133.

 This is not about the food, this is about a so-called interview my son had at the resturant in nSchererville,IN.He was called in and not interviewed by the manager. This is the oldest trick in the book. This is a way for companies to see the race of an applicant. I maybe wrong, but most companies interviews are conducted by the manager. I think if the general public knew of this practice and all the Black customers KFC has, this would be a bad blow for busuness. This store should be investigated and should be told this can cause a lot of problems. This is 2010, stop this!!! 



 R. Gonzalez 8/31/10 
 Last Sunday we stopped at KFC and purchased a 20pc Bucket of Original Chicken and other items for a Family picnic.The Chicken that was given to us was nasty looking inside the bucket and it looked liked it was Mirowaved.Even the Chicken tasted old.
We couldn&apos;t believe the dead beat service we had also that Sunday Morning.
KFC: 770 34th St N.St.Petersburg,Florida 



 stuart snyder 8/31/10

 jason hart 8/4/10 
 Your KFC in Nashville Tennesse on Charlotte ave. The past three weeks we have been there they are out of chicken. This is the poorest run place I have ever seen. With the laziest workers. 



 Concerned Parent 8/5/10 
 My child works at the local KFC in Summerville, SC (Charleston, SC area), under the Phoenix Group formerly known as Charlie Pryor, and there have been re occurring incidences of the employees not being able to cash their payroll checks at the bank that the check is drawn from. They have been told that there were no funds available to process the checks. What type of example is being set for the young people employeed in these stores that are trying to do the right thing. This is horrible business ethics. I understand that this occurred at the franchise level, but it is a direct reflection KFC Corporate. KFC is a well known organization that has been established for many years, and these type of business practices makes the entire organization look bad. They are paid weekly at this particular franchise and they hold two weeks pay on the employees so how can the funds not be available?
I understand that this may be a growing issue with many corporations in today&apos;s economy, but attitude reflects leadership. So, the next time you wonder why customer service ratings are low this is why. Someone needs to be made aware of what is really going on at many of the KFC&apos;s in this area. I hope that someone from KFC Corporate will be concerned enough to correspond at P O Box 412 Summerville, SC 29484 and shed some light on this re occurring nonsense. 



 Promising Applicant 8/5/10 
 After getting the run-around for two weeks after applying. They told me they wouldn&apos;t here me because of fraternization, a policy the pres doesn&apos;t budge on, I was told; &apos;cos my boyfriend also works there. But, I&apos;ve learned that family have hired other family at this location, and others who were in pre-exsisting relationships. They just weren&apos;t gay relationships. But, they did say they would definitely hire me if we weren&apos;t dating, which we&apos;ve been solid for a year. I think I deserved an equal opportunity. They apperently didn&apos;t fuss over the other instances. Perhaps I should inform the BBB.

 I waited 25 minutes for a Double Down at the KFC located in Baltimore the Arbutus Store which is located 3815 Wilkins Ave. The cashier Chris said that it would only take 4. After waiting for the breast to cook the store was dirty and soda was spilled on the floor. Often, Chris told other customers that they were out of a lot of items. Customers were told that they didn&apos;t have chicken cooked and that it would be a short wait but it wasn&apos;t. After getting the Double Down I got home and realized that it was nothing but 4 pieces of bacon in between two chicken breast. This was the worst Double Down I have ever had. I drove back to the store and asked for a refund. KFC what a joke!!! 



 taylor d. 6/30/10 
 if there was an option for less stars then this wrould get it. i got a bucket of chicken from kfc in gaithersburg,md yesterday and when i brought the chicken home to eat, i bit into a breast and there was an internal organ in it, im pretty sure that it is a lung. i swear, i still have that piece of chicken in my fridge in a bag as proof. STOP EATING THIS GARBAGE IT WILL MAKE YOU SICK. 



 Glenn Riese 6/30/10 
 We just got home with out order from the KFC at 1552 Rosecrans St San Diego Ca 92106. They completely got our order wrong and the food was cold and dry. We ordered original recipe and got 5 pieces of xtra crispy and only one piece original. We have stopped going into this store because the help is always unfriendly and sloppy, and this is the third (and I might add, final) time they have gotten our order wrong. I have had good luck with other stores, but for some reason, this store is very bad. 



 Shamika Cherry 7/25/10 
 I ate at kfc on Monday, July 19, 2010. After eating there my stomach was hurting so I just took Pepto Bismol, I was sick on Tuesday as well, when Wednesday came I began to vomit from that point I had loose bowels as well. To make a long story short, Thursday, July 22, 2010 @ 5:27am I went to Greater Southeast Hospital where I was diagnosed with food poisoning. I haven&apos;t heard back from the manager @ the kfc on alabama avenue and it&apos;s ridiculous. My back and stomach was on fire.

That is bad business.
