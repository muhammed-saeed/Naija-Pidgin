 May 13, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Bman ( 16 reviews ) Omg worst service almost ever. Yes it is McDonald&apos;s but look at your customer when they drive up and give them the freaking food before it goes stone cold. This McDonald&apos;s has to be the worst ever. August 28, 2011 No egg means no egg!! by Saskriderfan20 ( 12 reviews ) I order the Sausage McMuffin for $1.39... it does not say&quot;without egg&quot;on the menu but if you do not say that phrase they often make the error... I have had it happen 3 visits in a row... and they even once argued with me that I said with egg! I have an allergy so I think not. I would have complained to the manager but that is who was serving me. October 16, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Why are you reading food reviews if you eat here? by Travelling Gourmand ( 14 reviews ) It&apos;s a McDonald&apos;s! If you have ANY love of good food, why are you eating here? Or even considering eating here? That said, I tried their&quot;breakfast mcmuffin&quot;once as I dashed out of town one morning on an urgent errand. It managed to confirm everything I thought about McDonald&apos;s. They haven&apos;t changed in at least 30 years - their food still tastes like I imagine that warmed over cardboard and glue would taste like. June 28, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Bella Swan ( 15 reviews ) There are no words to describe it. Yuck almost covers it all.
