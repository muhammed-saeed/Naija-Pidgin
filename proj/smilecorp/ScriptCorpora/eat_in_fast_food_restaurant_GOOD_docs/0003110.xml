Whether you love classic cars or are just looking for a fun way to spend a few hours, Saturday’s Naples Car Cruise-In will take you beyond the typical. It showcases the classic cars, hotrods, custom automobiles, muscle cars, exotic cars, sports cars and show bikes that make up some of Florida’s finest collections.

You never know what you’ll see, and that’s part of the fun, car cruiser participants say, because different clubs and car owners participate each time.

Classy Cruisers member Jim Black usually rolls in with his 1997 special edition Porsche Boxster, which he has owned since he got it off the floor. The event is great, he said, because everyone there loves cars and gets excited about them.

“There is the kind of collector who buys something and fixes it up it himself and the other kind who has someone else do all the work and shows it off,” he said. “I’m in between — our car is not the age where it’s classic, but it’s something we really enjoy.”

Black was in the insurance business before retiring, and says one of the best things about the Naples Cruise-In is the variety.

“We’ve got people here who have everything from Volkswagen to Rolls Royce, and it is fun to get everyone together and have a crowd,” he said.

About 30 percent of the vehicles at each event are new ones that have never been there before, said Ken Dabrowski, Classy Cruisers Club member. He was with Ford Motor Company for 35 years and is an avid collector. He owns nine collector cars.

“Of course we have a new Mustang GT, so we really enjoy driving our cars and this is an event where we can see many of our friends who also enjoy cars and network with them,” he said.

“There are a lot of people with classic exotic and sports cars in Naples and Fort Myers, people who like to drive their vehicles and people who like to show their vehicles, and of course there are a lot of people who like to come see the vehicles.”

Classy Cruisers, the founding club, had a vision of bringing hundreds of cool classic cars together, like a car cruising event that occurs in Scottsdale, Ariz. The group founded the event in cooperation with the McDonald’s on U.S. 41 North south of Pine Ridge Road.

“In Scottsdale, cruising has been going on for nearly

25 years and in the winter period they get roughly 1,500 vehicles a week,” Dabrowski said. “We get between 150 and 250 cars, which is a lot for just operating one season.”

All eight clubs share the expenses, and the location is key to the cruise-in’s success, Dabrowski says. McDonald’s got involved because the Classy Cruisers are a group within the Naples Sailing and Yacht Club, and the fast food restaurant’s owner Tom O’Reilly was the yacht club’s 2010 commodore.

“We feel really fortunate and we fly five checkered flags along (U.S.) 41 in front of McDonalds during the cruise-in,” he said. “We’ve been getting hundreds of spectators, and while it’s hard to count because the event is free, we get somewhere between 500 and 1,000 spectators on a typical day.”

Dabrowski and other club members have been surveying the participants and spectators and people tell them they love the variety of clubs: from hot rods to classic cars to sports cars.

“Also, it’s free, so people who love cars can just come and look at these wonderful products and talk with the owners or they can join a club as well, and the clubs tell us they’ve picked up several new members,” he said. “It’s also been great for McDonald’s and Chili’s who have picked up considerable business from the events.”

Other businesses in Park Shore Plaza where Chili’s and McDonald’s and the Naples Cruise-In events are located have also benefited.

“Car enthusiasts and their spouses often come to the shopping center together and it’s not unusual for one spouse to spend time with the cars and the other will go off shopping for a while at the Dollar store or K-Mart,” said Dabrowski. “The beauty of cruising is that people can come and go as they please.”
