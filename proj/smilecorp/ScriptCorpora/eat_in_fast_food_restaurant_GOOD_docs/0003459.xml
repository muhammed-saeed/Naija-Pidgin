 Ban on unsolicited offers to increase credit soon Banks bombarding customers with offers Interest rates on cards &quot;way beyond&quot; official cash rate 
 
 BANKS are bombarding customers with deals to increase credit card limits ahead of tough new laws that ban unsolicited offers. 
 
The marketing blitz comes as banks&apos; margins on credit cards soar.

From July 1, banks can no longer invite people to increase their credit card maximum but in the meantime they are making last-ditch attempts to get more customers to agree.

Interest rate analysts Canstar and RateCity said yesterday the banks were in danger of pushing households above their repayment ability in the race to get in before the law changed.

The blitz comes as the gap between the official interest rate and credit card rates continues to widen.

New research by Canstar has found credit card rates are higher now than they were on the eve of the financial crisis - despite a 3 percentage-point drop in the official Reserve Bank cash rate.

 Stuck with high credit card rates 
 AN RBA rate cut will not help credit card users, writes Anthony Keane.

Canstar research manager Chris Groth said the interest rate on the average premium or gold credit card was 14.5 per cent more than the RBA cash rate, compared with less than 11.5 per cent during the financial crisis.

For standard credit cards the gap is even wider.

The average standard credit card interest rate is more than 11 per cent above the cash rate. In 2008 it was only 7.8 per cent above the official rate.

Mr Groth welcomed the July change to credit laws.

&quot;It&apos;s a good thing because it will help people make a more educated informed decision about increasing their limits instead of just basically being offered an extra ten grand,&quot;Mr Groth said.

Consumer group Choice said many institutions were mass marketing offers.

&quot;We went out last week looking for evidence that banks were bombarding consumers ahead of the new rules and from our feedback they are,&quot;Choice head of campaigns Matt Levey said.

&quot;We have the situation where Australians are being upsold debt the same as they would be upsold an ice cream at the cinema or fries at a fast food restaurant.

&quot;Debt is a very serious thing and it&apos;s not necessary to send out four letters in two months inviting you to take on more.&quot;

RateCity chief Damian Smith also said the&quot;last ditch&quot;marketing could seduce people to take on more credit than they needed, and this limit counted as a liability when they applied for a loan.
