 well i work for dominos pizza and i would love feed back on the chicken. when you make an order you get and order number on a sticky tag on your box. take that off the box and go online to www.domino&apos;s.com and there is an order tracker enter in your order number and it will ask you question about your order and you can rate the food and the driver and leave feedback.
