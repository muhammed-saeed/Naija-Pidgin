 Fast Food Options That Can Help You Achieve Your Fat Loss Goals! 

Learn Which Fast Foods Are Healthy For You

While fast food typically gets blamed for America&apos;s obesity, this does not mean that fast food is your enemy. As a matter of fact, if you are able to make the right macronutrient choices when eating at fast food places, you will be just fine and actually have no problem achieving your fat loss goals!

 Before I reveal to you some good options when eating at fast food locations or restaurants, always try to follow these basic principles: 


 Drink at least 12-16 ounces of water. This will prevent you from overeating as water gives a feeling of fullness and eliminates any feelings of hunger that may be a result from dehydration.

 Make sure you get the right amount of macronutrients and the best possible selection as this is the key to achieving your fat loss goals. So for example, at a place like McDonalds, try to have a chicken sandwich with no mayo, and some extra lettuce and tomato.

 Stay away from any fried foods as they have a lot of bad fats in them.

Now that you understand these important principles, I will give you several options to choose from the next time you go to a fast food restaurant!

 7 Great Fast Food Choice Meals 


 McDonalds: The McChicken, Premium Grilled Classic Sandwich and Honey Mustard Snack Wrap are all great choices. Try to order a side salad with these meals such as the Premium Caesar Salad (without chicken) as the fibrous carbs will help balance your meal. You can also order meals such as the Premium Southwest Chicken Salad which comes with chicken. This way you get your protein with the chicken and carbs with the salad.

 Burger King: The RTU Cranberry Walnut Salad with the Tender grill chicken is an excellent choice.

 Wendy’s: The Ultimate Grilled Chicken Salad is a great and tasty choice. The Mandarin Chicken Salad or Chicken Caesar Salad both offer a high source of protein with fibrous carbs. Make sure your salad dressing is light or contains low fat as they tend to get up there with calories and the wrong ratio of macronutrients quickly. Another option is the Grilled Chicken Go Wrap which is great if you are in a hurry.

 Subway: Just about any sandwich from the 6 grams of fat or less menu is great as they offer a great combination of the right macronutrients needed in order to achieve your fat loss goals. Note: Do not consume subs larger than 6 inches at one time.

 KFC: A Grilled Chicken Breast (without skin or breading) with a side order of seasoned rice and green beans is an excellent combination of the right macronutrients. The Roasted Chicken BLT Salad or Chicken BLT Salad are both great options to choose from.

 Taco Bell: Chicken or Steak Burrito Supreme (no more than two) or Fresco Grilled Steak or Chicken Soft Taco (no more than 3). Depending on your schedule will determine the number you eat as only you can decide when you will have the opportunity to eat again.

 Boston Market: A great source of protein is either a turkey or chicken breast. The¼White rotisserie chicken is one of my personal favorites. A good choice for side items are the garlic dill potatoes with fresh steamed vegetables or green beans.
