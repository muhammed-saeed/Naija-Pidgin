 P3.1 Regression Analysis : 

 Identify each of the following statements as true or false and explain why: 

 A parameter is a population characteristic that is estimated by a coefficient derived from a sample of data. A one-tail t test is used to indicate whether the independent variables as a group explain a significant share of demand variation. Given values for independent variables, the estimated demand relation can be used to derive a predicted value for demand. A two-tail t test is an appropriate means for testing direction (positive or negative) of the influences of independent variables. The coefficient of determination shows the share of total variation in demand that cannot be explained by the regression model. 

 P3.3 Data Description : 

 Scanning America, Inc., is a small but rapidly growing firm in the digitized document translation business. The company reads architectural and engineering drawing into a scanning device that translates graphic information into a digitalized format that can be manipulated on a personal computer or workstation. During recent weeks, the company has added a total of ten new clerical and secretarial personal to help answer customer questions and process orders. Data on the number of years of work experience for these ten new workers are as follows: 

 5 3 3 5 4 5 4 3 4 3 

 Calculate the mean, median, and mode measures of central tendency for the number of years of work experience. Which measure does the best job of describing central tendency for this variable? 

 Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation for this data series, and the 95 percent confidence interval within which you would expect to find the population’s true mean. 

 P3.4 Hypothesis Testing: z Tests : 

 Beauty Lotion is a skin-moisturizing product that contains rich oils, blended especially for overly dry or neglected skin. The product is sold in 5-ounce bottles by a wide range of retail outlets. In an ongoing review of product quality and consistency, the manufacturer of Beauty Lotion found a sample average product volume of 5.2 ounces per unit with a sample standard deviation of 0.12 ounces, when a sample of n = 144 observations was studied. 

 Calculate the range within which the population average volume can be found with 99 percent confidence. 

 B. Assuming that s = 0.12 cannot be reduced, and a sample size of n = 144, what is the minimum range within which the sample average volume must be found to justify with 99 percent confidence the advertised volume of 5 ounces? 

 P3.5 Hypothesis Testing: t Tests : 

 Syndicated Publications, Inc., publishes a number of specialty magazines directed at Midwest dairy producers. As part of its sales trainee program, the company closely monitors the performance of new advertising space sale personnel. During a recent 2-week period, the number of customer contacts was monitored and recorded for two new sales representatives: 

 
   
 
   
 
 Service Calls Per Day

 Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for the population mean number of customer contacts for each sales representative. 

 B. A this confidence level, is it possible to reject the hypothesis that these two representatives call on an equal number of potential clients? 

 P3.7 Correlation : 

 Managers focus on growth rates for corporate assets and profitability as indicators of the overall health of the corporation. Similarly, investors concentrate on rates of growth in corporate assets and profitability to gauge the future profit-making ability of the firm and company’s prospects for stock market appreciation. Five familiar measures focused upon by both managers and investors are the rates of growth in sales revenue, cash flow, earnings per share (EPS), dividends, and book value (shareholders’ equity). 

 The table shows here illustrates the correlation among these five key growth measures over a 10-year period for a sample of large firms taken from The Value Line Investment Survey.

 This correlation table only shows one-half of the pair-wise comparisons between these five measures. For example, it shows that the correlation between the 10-year rates of growth in sales and cash flow is 0.793 (or 79.3 percent) but does not show corresponding correlation between the 10-year rates of growth in cash flow and sales. Why? Notice the correlation coefficient between EPS growth and the four remaining corporate growth indicators. Use your general business knowledge to explain these differences.
