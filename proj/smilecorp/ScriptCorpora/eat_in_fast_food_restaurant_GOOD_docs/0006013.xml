 January 23, 2012 Likes it following up by speakmean1 ( 1 review ) The black beans were too watery! the chicken was Okay. and the building wasn&apos;t up to expectation. Plus there wasn&apos;t any plaintains on my cobo meal either. This location was in Okeechobee,Fl November 2, 2011 Lots of food! by Brett ( 6 reviews ) We had lunch here today for the first time. I ordered the Half chicken which was well cooked and came with yellow rice and black beans and some fried plantain. This was excellent and very reasonable. My wife had the chicken fajita. Also pretty good with two caveats. The tortilla was too small and the quackamoli was watery. The service was good with prompt refills of drinks. The ambiance left something to be desired. this is the former Quarterdeck and they did no renovations from what I can see. August 5, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it not happy by djgiovanni44 ( 1 review ) I think La granja is by far the best home made style latin fast food restaurant in Florida. Having said that, I do have many complaints for the new location in Palm Beach Gardens. 1. At this location you have to wait to be seated, and worst of all you are attended by waiting staff. This only means that now you have to tip. 2. At this location the meals don&apos;t come with La Granja&apos;s signature fried plantains. In other words, you are being cheated out of a side. 3. The 1/2 steak, is everything but that, including flavorless and too well done. 4. The black beans are too watery and runny, nothing like the thick and full flavored versions at other locations. 5. Where is the condiment bar full of onions, sauces etc present at other locations? 6. The waiting staff tries hard, maybe too hard and they forget to refill your cup. Bottom line, the food hasn&apos;t the&quot;la granja&quot;flavor that we are acustomed to. I spoke to one of the waiters and he told me that... more» I think La granja is by far the best home made style latin fast food restaurant in Florida.

Bottom line, the food hasn&apos;t the&quot;la granja&quot;flavor that we are acustomed to. I spoke to one of the waiters and he told me that they had a cheff in the back and that&apos;s probably why the food is not the same. I hate the fact that at this location I have to pay for my plantains, and worst of all, now I have to tip. They need to keep the same concept at all the restaurants, you go in you order, grab your food, grab all the onions you want, look for a table and enjoy your food. On the + side, here you can drink all the soda you want 1 out of 1 found this review helpful August 28, 2011 Not as good as their other locations... by pita ( 11 reviews ) I have eaten at the West Palm Beach&amp;Margate locations&amp;the food was not as good at this Northlake location. I also prefer the&quot;order at the counter&quot;method that the other locations use instead of the sit down service... September 12, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Sakae ( 1 review ) My first visit to la granja was excellent, the food was amazing and prepared quick, the staff was very helpful this will not be my last dinner there. August 22, 2011 Likes it Latin is not a country by TheMechanic ( 1 review ) First, there is no such thing&quot;Latin food.&quot;The country of&quot;Latin&quot;does not exist. La Granja is trying to give the consumer a taste of Perubian (Peru) food. You may not like it, but it is what it is. Second, waiting at a restaurant is a not bad thing, specially if people like the food. So I don&apos;t have a problem with waiting. Seven of us had lunch there and let me tell you, the portions were outstanding. One of the guys in my group was able to eat three meals from the amount he was served. On my second trip, I had to order a Sandwich because is too much food for lunch. I fall asleep if I eat too much. June 2, 2011 Mobile review by Josie ( 1 review ) My husband and have been there 3 time in the last 2 weeks and twice they&apos;ve mixed up his order even though he ordered by #&apos;s, the service is shotty and the flavor of the food seems to be slowly going away. I witnessed a couple leaving the restaurant because the waiters were not around to take their order..We do enjoy eating at la granga and hope it starts to get better.
