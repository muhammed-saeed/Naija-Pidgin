 Sonic&apos;s XL Bacon Cheddar Cheesesteak 
 My wife and I stopped at a Sonic Drive-In over the weekend for a couple Cherry Limeades (yum!) and we noticed this sign on the drive-up menu board:

 
 

I was transfixed by the enormity of the sandwich (and its name), but my wife noticed the calorie saving hint in smaller print at the bottom: &quot;Even better with a Diet Coke and fresh lime.&quot;

If you&apos;re going to eat something like that, why bother with a DIET coke!?!? Just go for it and get the regular Coke (or at least a Cherry Limeade).

I was guessing at least 1000 calories for this bad-boy, but it totals a mere 710 calories (complete nutritional data below).

The Extra-Long Bacon Cheddar Cheesesteak is a &quot;limited-time&quot; menu item at Sonic. Their description: What, you think you have to go to Philadelphia to get a quality cheesesteak? Just swing by any SONIC® (including the Philadelphia locations) and order a big, hearty, meat-lovers sandwich—juicy steak smothered with smoky cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, grilled onions and mayonnaise. Only SONIC® makes it extra long. Because we know that the regular amount of flavor just won&apos;t cut the mustard ... I mean mayo. There&apos;s no mustard. Forget I mentioned that. As we were driving away, sipping our excellent Cherry Limeades, we made another observation: no other fast food restaurant comes anywhere close to offering the variety of drinks that Sonic does. We love it.

Sonic Drive-In&apos;s Extra-Long Bacon Cheddar Cheesesteak has 710 calories, 360 calories from fat, 40 grams fat, 13 grams saturated fat, 1 gram trans fat, 100 mg cholesterol, 1030 mg sodium, 52 grams carbs, 3 grams fiber, 7 grams sugars, and 35 grams protein.

Well, yeah!
Surprisingly, the steak in those Phillies are pleasingly non-plumpifying. The mayo slapped on them sort of puts a damper on the whole steaky taste, but hey. To each his own, eh?
I think that maybe the variety of drinks, and by extension the versatility of the entire menu (served all day, willingness to alter recipes), is Sonic&apos;s stronger point.
But the names they keep giving these interesting foods make it very difficult to read back effectively. Extra-long Bacon Cheddar Cheesesteak, that&apos;s 9 syllables. No wonder it costs almost $5!!

Perhaps the Sonic sandwich is good, but it is NOT a Philly Cheesesteak. Being from Philly, I can tell you that genuine cheesesteaks are not made with &quot;smoky cheddar cheese,&quot; but with Provolone. They also do not have bacon or mayonnaise.

Also, please check your grammar. You mentioned the &quot;enormity&quot; of the sandwich. Look it up! &quot;Enormity&quot; means &quot;great evil,&quot; but a lot of people mistakenly use it when they intend &quot;enormousness&quot; for great size.

Thank you for your comments, though.

wow, poor anonymous misses out on both claims. Go to Philly and you&apos;ll get your cheesesteak with orange cheese unless you request provo.

Also, enormity- : the quality or state of being huge
