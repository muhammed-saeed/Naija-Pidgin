Name a reason why people might prefer eating at a fast food restaurant?
 In: Inventions , Food&amp;Cooking [ Edit categories ] Answer: Maybe people like it more at a fast food restaurant because they do not have to make the food themselves, and it doesn&apos;t take too long to be served to them. Another reason might be because people don&apos;t usually have a deep fryer in their house, and they are in the mood for fried food.
