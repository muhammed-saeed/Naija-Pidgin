 Sniglets: Imaginative Words 
 Rich Hall is one of the most underrated humorists of our age. His humor is wry, dry, and witty in the original sense of the word. He also has a sure sense of the English language, as well as the American lifestyle. While working on the TV comedy series, Not Necessarily the News (1986-88), he began reading Sniglets , &quot;words that should appear in dictionaries, but don&apos;t.&quot; The feature was so popular that he wrote a book of Sniglets that sold over 2 million copies. Several years later, the Washington Post announced a contest for the best of what are, in fact, Sniglets. That year people across the world sent in their examples of words that are not in dictionaries but should be. This page contains some examples of both.

Politicide —This word was added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) this year so is it still a sniglet? We learned this year that bribe-taking and philandery have become forms of politicide. Politricks —This word, also added to the OED this year, is a good replacement for &quot;political dirty tricks&quot; of the Nixon years. wingnut —We have left-wing nuts and right-wing nuts but what about extremists of both sides? Well, this word would work if we didn&apos;t already have extremist . IMglish —We like this sniglet for the abbretiated language of instant messaging.

We only include it because of its media popularity.
