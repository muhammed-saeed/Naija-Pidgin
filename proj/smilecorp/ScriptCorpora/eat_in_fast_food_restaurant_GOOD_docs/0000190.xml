Comments about deals at Restaurant.com
 
 10 of 10 people found the following comment helpful: 
 By Bossrosen 11 months ago i purchased two certificates with the intent to use them on vacation.

Both restaurants refused to honor the certificates because they said they pulled out of the Restaurant.com deal. The frustration is that restaurant.com will only give me a credit and I do not intend to use the site anymore. Both restaurants pulled from the program months ago and restaurant.com was selling invalid certificates. So my intended $17.00 lunch cost me $41.30 instead! Do not use that site! One of the restaurants refused to honor the coupon yesterday and Restaurant.com is still selling them today.

 By snarkydeals 11 months ago Yeah, in agreement with bossrosen here, because of the coupons I purchased, only 1 worked. And it was for discounts at my favorite sushi place. They didn&apos;t honor the coupons and wouldn&apos;t offer me anything in lieu of the discounts. :( So I&apos;d recommend calling the restaurant up first before you buy. The deals on the site are amazing but if they won&apos;t work, you&apos;re just wasting your money.

 By dissappointed 6 months ago I have been to restaurants who say they agreed with Restaurants.com how long they wanted to participate or how many certificates could be sold and Restaurant.com sold far more certificates, or for a lot longer period than they had agreed to. Thus, these restaurants stopped honoring the certificates.

 By genedoowop 7 months ago Restaurants have to sign up for these promotions so they know in advance what the deal is, I know since I have a restaurant and always look forward to new customers and not how to get free ads and then put up a sign that we do not honor these certificates. These restaurants are fraudulently getting all the promotion and then not honoring the certificates creating ill will toward restaurant.com. and little do they care against themselves by embarrassing the customer trying to redeem one when they did not see the sign not allowing them.

Have you ever thought about how you prioritize vacation expenses? Do you spend hour after hour searching for the cheapest airfare? Do you choose the early-morning flight and leave long before you&apos;re usually awake because it&apos;s $20 less than the mid-morning flight? Do you shove everything into carry-on bags to save on checked baggage fees?

Many of us can answer yes to all of the above; however, as soon as we arrive at our destinations, we make a beeline to the nearest restaurant. &quot; I&apos;ve earned this expense ,&quot; we say--and it&apos;s true. Vacations are so rare that we need a chance to relax and not worry about money. Sure, our eyes may widen for half a second when the bill comes, but hey, we saved $30 on the luggage fee. This food is worth the extra bucks!

However, when you buy meal after expensive meal, the expenditures add up quickly, and suddenly you&apos;re hundreds of dollars over your vacation budget.

Last week, I covered some general tips for taking advantage of daily 
deal sites like Groupon, BuyWithMe, LivingSocial and Restaurants.com--including how to sell a daily deal coupon that you regret buying. Well, 
it turns out that this secondary market for daily deals sites is exploding . Since daily deal sites projected earnings make them to be a five billion dollar a year industry, and since 20% of daily deals sold go unclaimed , it follows that this remaining 20% is potentially worth a lot of money.

 The quintessential date night is &quot;dinner and a movie,&quot; but there&apos;s got to be a cheaper way to enjoy this &quot;must&quot; for just about any adult couple. It&apos;s hard to go out for an evening without dropping $75 to $100 for a few hours of fun. And that doesn&apos;t include the babysitter cost or dragging the kids along ( which is not very romantic ). 

The following tips are not recommended for first dates--you may scare someone off by seeming cheap--but if you are in a long term relationship you&apos;ll be instantly raised to &quot;smart, wise and thrifty.&quot;
