Will the Vatican Achieve Its Plan For a New World Order?
 Wed, 03/05/2008 - 21:55 — Arthur Cristian 
A most important read. Congress and the Judiciary are already comprised of nearly 50% Catholics.
Do you think that once they get the majority they&apos;ll listen to the people or the Pope??? Soon, there will be millions of heretics who will have to decide which master they are going to follow!

------------------------------------------------------

Will the Vatican Achieve Its Plan For a New World Order?

1. Moral Authority and the Economy

Back in 1992, the May/June issue of News Watch magazine ran a report on the interview between the much talked about former Jesuit professor, Malachi Martin, and talk show host, J.P. McCarthy. Martin said the Vatican believes the pope has the &quot;moral authority&quot; to help the world solve its problems. Martin also said that in the not too far distant future (2000 A.D.?) we will see an omni-national trading system designed to bring the worlds failing economy under control; and the pope, whoever he may be, will act as head of a supervisory agency which will oversee the movements and decisions of this new economic system.

As of March 1995, Europe had forged a free-trade zone of 19 nations with 380 million consumers. We have the World Trade Organization (WTO) and NAFTA and GATT in todays world. We also have seen the International Monetary Fund (IMF) created with Michel Camdessus, a Roman Catholic, as managing director.

The National Catholic Register (NCR), of July 1997, reported that Camdessus believes in the redistribution of wealth and views the spiritual values of a nation as key to its economic health. It is no accident that the pope holds and espouses the same concepts. The NCR further quotes Camdessus as saying he believes the International Monetary Fund can make or break struggling nations.

He is quoted as saying:

&quot;We are here to help build the new heaven and the new earth, as it says in the book of Revelation. I am called to act in such a way that by making better this world here I prepare, in a better way, for the new earth.&quot;

This man believes that, as head of the IMF, he can make life better for countries; and, in that capacity, he is doing Gods will.

Unfortunately, the IMF, WTO, and other organizations are doing the popes bidding. Only ten years ago the NCR, of March 13, 1988, reported on Pope John Paul IIs encyclical, Populorum Progressio. Dealing with social concerns, the encyclical stated:

&quot;World peace is inconceivable unless the worlds leaders come to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic, military or political imperialism and the transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration.&quot;

In other words: a one-world government. The encyclical goes on to say this:

&quot;It is necessary to state once more the characteristic principle of Christian social doctrine: the goods of this world are originally meant for all . . private property, in fact, is under a social mortgage . . the universal destination of goods.&quot;

In the NCR of November 20, 1997, under the headline, &quot;Vatican Calls for the Broader Debt Reduction for Poorest Countries,&quot; it says:

&quot;In his 1994 letter on preparing for the year 2000, the pope said the Jubilee year would be an appropriate time to give thought, among other things, to reducing substantially, if not canceling outright, the international debt which seriously threatens the future of many nations.&quot;

Let us remember that the one-world economic system will be able to control nations for the New World Order. The technology is already available. The Burroughs Corporation provides the hardware for the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, representing 1,000 banks on five continents. Revelation 13:17 speaks of a time when no man can buy or sell unless he has the mark, the name, or the number of the beast power.

In February 22-28, 1998, the NCR reported:

&quot;The World Bank and the worlds major religions are to establish joint working groups on development issues, it was announced today at the end of a high-level, two-day dialogue at Lambeth Palace, the Archbishop of Canterburys London headquarters.&quot;

In summary, we can say that it doesnt take much faith anymore to believe Bible prophecy.

2. Catholics Determined to Reclaim America

Priest John A. Perricone, the founder of Christi Fideles, Saving Americas Soul, says that October 17, 1993, was the beginning of the campaign to &quot;Make America Catholic,&quot; with Catholic values. Pope Leo XII compared the proper relation between Church and State to &quot;the union of the soul and the body in man.&quot;

In this forum, America was pictured in a crisis and in dire need of the only solution: Catholic action, which is social, political, and moral. It was pointed out that Rome owns America by right of discovery by a Catholic, Christopher Columbus.

Let us trace this campaign to 1998. Consider the following:

&quot;The facts: A new Catholic organization seeks to restore Catholic values in a post-Christian society.
&quot;The impact: The mission of the Catholic Campaign for America (CCA) is nothing if not ambitious; the group has set out not to just influence laws on Capitol Hill but to change the very hearts and minds of America. The executive director of CCA [which has its headquarters in Washington, D.C.] is Thomas Wykes. He said. We have an obligation to persuade, and the American people have not been persuaded effectively enough yet. The goal of CCA is to restore Catholic values to society by galvanizing Catholic citizens, increasing the Catholic electorates influence in public policy, and focusing attention on Catholic moral and doctrinal teaching. Those leading out say the Catholic moment is now and the country is ready for just this kind of bold initiative.&quot;Mary DeTurris, National Catholic Register, May 1, 1994.

&quot;The Catholic Campaign for America has a full head of steam. With a membership that has doubled in one years time and an ambitious plan designed to get Church teachings out of the pews and into the public eye. It is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with. Both parties in 1996 should be made aware of the Catholic vote, said Thomas Wykes, executive director.&quot;National Catholic Register; &quot;Public Catholicism,&quot; March 26, 1995.

&quot;Ten major markets to get Catholic Radio in a $58.2 million dollar deal that will bring Catholic Radio 24 hours a day by this fall: The goal is to reach the widest possible audience with radio that is based upon Catholic principles said Joseph Fessio, SJ, of Ignatius Press.&quot;National Catholic Register, May 3, 1998.

This is just part of the Catholic Campaign for America, to convince the hearers that Rome has changed. She is now presenting a fair and benign face to the world.

&quot;In a formal papal Bull the pope urges repentance for [the year 2000] Jubilee. The Church should kneel before God and implore his forgiveness He urged a new culture of international solidarity in which wealthy nations and the private sector accept an economic model that serves everyone. A panel of Vatican theologians is working on a list of sins to be unveiled by 2000, which include the Crusades, the Inquisition, forced evangelization of the New World and the Churchs failure to speak out strongly against slavery and the Jewish Holocaust during the Nazi era. &quot;Statement by Vatican City, quoted in Dallas Morning News, November 28, 1998.

The papal Bull is in exact fulfillment of a prophecy Ellen White made many years ago.
&quot;The Roman Church now presents a fair front to the world, covering with apologies her record of horrible cruelties. She has clothed herself in Christlike garments; but she is unchanged.&quot;Great Controversy, &quot;Aims of the Papacy,&quot; 571.

Rome tells the world she has changed. As a proof of this, the Archbishop of Taurin noted that the pope has spoken out on the Middle East peace process and war in the former Yugoslavia, as well as other world trouble spots. What many do not realize is that while appearing to bring peace she has had her hand in much of the trouble to begin with, and is playing a double role.

The Scriptures, in Micah 4 and Isaiah 2:2-22, speak of a great peace movement in the &quot;last days.&quot;
&quot;Many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob and He will teach us of His ways, for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&quot;Isaiah 2:3.

The prophecy goes on to say:

&quot;He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.&quot;Isaiah 2:4.

Though this may well apply to Satan when he appears to the nations as Christ, in a large measure we now see the papacy trying to act as the worlds peacemaker.

The rest of Isaiah 2 tells us God is not in this peace movement.

&quot;Therefore thou hast forsaken Thy people [they claim to worship God] the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the East, and are soothsayers like the Philistines [they are occult] and please themselves in the children of strangers [ecumenical dialogue with non-Christian religions] . .

Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands.&quot;Isaiah 2:6, 8.

The answer to this peace movement is found in another Bible prophecy:

&quot;For when they say peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them . . and they shall not escape.&quot;1 Thessalonians 5:3.

3. The Crowning Deception

We see events occurring which will cause the people of the world to call for a strong leader who will take charge of Earth and bring order out of chaos. As earthquakes, storms, crimes, disasters, and wars increase and grow more frequent and violent, people are asking &quot;What do these things mean?&quot;
Elizabeth Bird, a sociologist of the University of Minnesota, said: &quot;Supermarket tabloids speak for a large number of people.&quot; There is widespread interest in the supernatural today. The reports of Marian appearances around the world continue to grow. Horoscopes are the rage. &quot;Ancient Prophecies&quot; have been aired on television. The UFO craze is popular. Many books have been written on this subject. The Vatican has a radio telescope on Mt. Graham in Arizona, designed to listen for advice from outer space. Will Satan communicate with the Vatican?

In conclusion: Final battle plans of the devil are fast taking shape. How will he do it? Since World War II, Satan has been setting up a plan for world domination and invoking the personal worship of himself. He has always wanted the worship that belongs only to Jesus Christ. See Isaiah 14:12-14.
The one-world government plan is already in place and ready to be implemented as soon as events permit. Then Satan plans to receive the worship he has always coveted. The people are ready to accept this false christ. The leaders allied with Satan want a world crisis of just the right proportionsto set final events in motion, so that, with their false christ in place, the people can sin with confidence.
Yet God has held things in check. Satan can move only as rapidly as God allows. For the sake of His people and for those He still hopes to save, our Lord has held back those momentous events, but for how much longer? Gods people must work for souls as never before. Time is very short.

4. So Close to the End

We are living in a time when we may see this one-world economic system come together. Because of her Constitution which gives freedom of expression and worship, America has stood in the way until now. Rome has controlled South American nations by a union of church and state. Quoting from the Jesuit magazine, America:

&quot;The institutional church in Colombia has been historically linked with the state. The church is accordingly seen as a source of secular power and influence. Its financial resources and political capital have served the wealthy.&quot;America, a U.S. national Jesuit magazine.

This is an interesting admission concerning social justice issues; and it is typical of what happens in a land which Rome rules. Until recently, the United States has been Protestant. But, on March 29, 1994, leading Protestant Evangelicals and Catholics signed a joint declaration to work together in the third millennium. We are rapidly moving toward a total reaching of hands across the gulf.

Do we see the influence of the occult in the churches? The so-called Jesus Seminar is typical and has been adopted by most seminaries of the Catholic and mainline Protestant denominations. More than 100 seminary professors from almost all major denominations are members of the Jesus Seminar.
What are their beliefs? They believe that many basic Bible facts were fabricated, by the early church Fathers, to take the place of Scripture. This includes the Jewish instigation of the crucifixion of Jesus, the Lords prayer, many of the parables of Jesus, as well as other statements in the Bible.

Satan offers the manifestations of Mary, along with Earth and Spirit Conferences, to call together the people from traditional faiths and environments.

In 1990, Carl Sagen stated, &quot;To safeguard and cherish the environment we need to be infused with a vision of the sacred.&quot; He was a member of the Earth and Spirit Conference associated with Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon.

In 1885, Ellen White wrote:

&quot;When under the influence of this three-fold union [Catholic, apostate Protestants, and the occult], our country shall repudiate every principle of its constitution as a Protestant and republican government, and shall make provision for the propagation of papal falsehoods and delusions,then we may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan and that the end is near.&quot;5 Testimonies, 451.

5. &quot;A New Age Dawns: Its Catholic&quot;

That is what the National Catholic Register said on April 11, 1999.

A special article, written by Cardinal Paul Poupard, was printed in the April 11 and 17, 1999, issues of the National Catholic Register (NCR).

Pope John Paul II has given Poupard several important assignments, two of which include the &quot;Evangelization of Peoples [of the world] with Catholic Education&quot; and directorship of the Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue. The quotations given below are from this NCR Article. It is discussing how the year 2000 will usher in the Catholic New Age;

&quot;We must try to bring the politician back to Christ . . It is the duty of the Church . . to help man recover his religious dimension. This enormous task is what I call the new humanism for the new millennium.&quot;
&quot;We are planning many things for the year 2000. In my travels throughout the world, I see great anticipation for the

JUBILEE, especially in young people. It is a momentous time for the Church. To return to the job of the Pontifical Council for Culture, the time is ripe for the Church to speak the language of Man in order to help man learn the language of God.&quot;

From the above quotations we can see how the Church considers herself the vehicle to convert the world for &quot;Christ.&quot; She also has, on many other occasions, spoken out on how this is to be accomplished.

Consider this:

a. &quot;Pope calls for United Europe&quot;Jack Chick, Battle Cry, May/June, 1987.

b. &quot;Pope Seeks to Promote Vision of United Europe&quot;Bangor Daily News, October 8, 1998.

c. &quot;Catholic Bishops Declare U.S. the Worlds Peacekeeper&quot;The Monitor, McAllen, TX, November 18, 1993.

d. &quot;U.S. Catholic Conference: Intervention [in world affairs] is U.S. Responsibility&quot;National Catholic Register, 1993.

&quot;The United States has a moral responsibility to intervene in Bosnias war, including with military force, the chairman of the U.S. Bishops Conference said. He told the U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher.&quot;

e. The Pope-Gorbachev meeting that brought down Communism in Russia was an &quot;immense, epochal fact of great historic significance&quot; said Cardinal Paul Poupard, head of the Vaticans dialogue agency with non-believers. &quot;The great significance is in the fact that it is a major advance for the pope who is candidating to become the moral leader of World. This historic meeting was the capstone of 27 years of work by Cardinal Casaroli, Vatican Secretary of State.&quot;

f. &quot;Public Catholicism: The Catholic Campaign for America has a full head of steam. It is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with.&quot;National Catholic Register, March 26, 1995.

g. &quot;Sunday must be sanctified. A violator should be punished as a heretic.&quot;Detroit News, July 7, 1998.

h. &quot;Vatican diplomat outlines Holy Sees peace efforts, based on law and justice and to foster international one world order.&quot;National Catholic Register, May 9, 1998.

i. &quot;Democracys Big Gains since John Paul II: As he carried out his global mission over the past 18 years, the Polish pope has emerged as the worlds most important and effective advocate of freedom and democracy.&quot;National Catholic Register, May 3-9, 1998.

6. Summary
Let us take a look at History and Bible Prophecy:

To bring everything into the proper perspective, we need to research into the past and into what Gods Word has prophesied concerning the role Rome is to play in final events.

&quot;From the beginning of his pontificate, John Paul has been talking about the convergence of the nations. He would endow his papacy with an international profile and, as pope, move around among world leaders and nations, vindicating a position for himself as a leader among leaders, because in that competition he plans to emerge as the victor.&quot;Keys of This Blood, Malachi Martin, 480.

Quoting further from Keys of this Blood:

&quot;The competition is about who will establish the first one world system of government that has ever existed in the society of nations . . As to the time factor involved, those of us under seventy will see at least basic structures of the new world government installed . . Those of us under forty will surely live under its legislative, executive, and judiciary (religious) control. This New World Order is not something around a distant corner of time, but . . imminent. As a system that will be introduced and installed in our midst by the end of this final decade of the second millennium.&quot;Keys of This Blood, Malachi Martin, 15-16.

History Repeats itself:

Historians now know that, in ancient Rome, Bishop Sylvester I, &quot;pope&quot; of Rome (314 to 335), and Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea (260-340), were two of the principle church leaders who worked closely with Emperor Constantine and influenced him to enact the first Sunday Laws. This was supposedly done in order to save the nation of Rome from the catastrophes that threatened the nation, both military and economic.

Later, in one of his writings, Eusebius mentioned with pride about the change in Bible teaching he had a part in carrying out:

&quot;All things whatsoever it was duty to do on the Sabbath, these we have transferred to the Lords Day.&quot;Patrologia Graeca, Vol. 23, Col. 1171.

After working closely with Constantine on six national Sunday Laws, the official Church edict on the subject was then issued at the Council of Laodicea in 336 A.D.

In the Roman Catholic official Converts Catechism of Catholic Doctrine, page 50, we are told:

&quot;Ques. Which is the Sabbath day?&quot;

&quot;Ans. Saturday is the Sabbath day.&quot;

&quot;Ques. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?&quot;

&quot;Ans. We observe Sunday instead of Saterday because the Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.&quot;

The Bible tells us that an &quot;image&quot; of the Roman hierarchy is to be formed in the last days by the beast coming up out of the earth which has two horns like a Lamb, but speaks as a dragon (Rev. 13: 11).
This image to the first beast will be a carbon copy of it. The United State of America has power to give life to this image of the first beast (Rev. 1:14, 15). The Sunday is a mark of the authority of the first beast, and it will be the means set up to control the New World Order, by which no man will be able to buy or sell unless he has the mark of the beast (Rev. 13:17).

To bring about a worldwide condition of things (events) which will accept the &quot;New World Order&quot; David Rockefeller, the then powerful leader of the Council on Foreign Relations, said:

&quot;We are on the verge of a Global Transformation. All we need is the right major CRISIS, and nations will accept the New World Order.&quot;Newsweek, January 1991.

According to todays newspapers, &quot;the world is filled with storm and war and variance.&quot; Yet, we are told, &quot;under ONE HEAD the papal power, the people will unite to oppose God in the person of His witnesses. This union is cemented by the great apostate.&quot;7 Testimonies, 182.

What role will the apostate &quot;Protestants&quot; play in the One World Order?

Pat Robertson of the &quot;Christian&quot; Coalition has joined politics with religion,the very same tactic Rome used throughout her history.

We have been told this:

&quot;Protestantism and Roman Catholicism will join hands and unite their views of how America will return to God and morality. Restoring morals should be the number one priority and the prime work of Congress, national polls show.&quot;Reported by Rush Limbaugh, September 9, 1998.

The low state of national morals has set the stage as it were, for the fulfillment of prophecy, the grasp of political power by the churches, and the creation of a &quot;need&quot; for Sunday Laws to bring the nation &quot;back to God.&quot;

Pat Robertson has suggested ways to skirt election laws and align the &quot;Christian&quot; Coalition behind a single Republican presidential candidate in the year 2000. Robertson said:

&quot;We said wed have conservative control of Congress by 96; and we did it in 94. We also said by the year 2000 wed have the presidencyand thats the next goal.&quot;Pat Robertson, quoted in Americans United, April 16, 1999.

Question: Are these the words of a nonpartisan religious leader or a party boss with a political agenda for America?

&quot;To stand in defense of truth and righteousness when the majority forsake us, to fight the battles of the Lord when champions are fewthis will be our test!&quot;5 Testimonies, 136-137.

7. Will Rome Achieve Its Global Plans for New World Order?

Will the Vatican actually take over the world? The Vatican wants a New World Order formed, which, in practice, consists of a degree of Vatican control over the governments of the world.

That, admittedly, is a very ambitious plan!

Will it actually take place? In one way it will:

If Rome can get apostate Protestantism in America to coerce the U.S. Congress into enacting a National Sunday Law, under American influence that law could spread to the other nations. And, according to the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy, this is exactly what is going to happen.

We are told that, through Sunday exaltation, Rome will regain its former power and influence in the world.

And then will come the end.

Why would the U.S. Congress pass such a law? Lawmakers are desperate to do anything to ensure their own survival in their plush, high-paying jobs. Satanic excitement in the churches could lead to such enactment.

Why would other nations enact similar laws? Because of the powerful satanic delusions which will quickly result. The entire world will be astounded with the overwhelming power of enchantments which would be released, as soon as the U.S. National Sunday Law is enacted.

How can we know that the above scenario will happen? Read the present authors End of Time Series of booklets. They comprise the most complete collection of classified Spirit of Prophecy quotations on final eventsfrom just before the National Sunday Law on down to the final destruction of the wicked and beyond.

But do not stop there: You also want to know the plan of coming events, which Satan is preparing the minds of faithful Roman Catholics for. It is daring in the extreme for the devil to make such astounding predictions, through &quot;the Blessed Virgin,&quot; to seers throughout the world! vf

Ben Lowrey benlowrey.com Interviews Arthur Cristian www.loveforlife.com.au - 8th February 2012 - 89 Minutes 47 Seconds. Arthur discusses a wide range of subjects from Freeman&amp;the law to how &quot;The System&quot; is designed to have us process the curses of &quot;The System&quot;. He talks about his and Fiona&apos;s experiences with the law&amp;why Love For Life started. Arthur also discusses the remedy to the tyranny of &quot;The System&quot;&amp;the way back to peace, truth, freedom, joy, abundance&amp;Do No Harm for all of life without loss of uniqueness or the need for slaves&amp;rulers. Who we really are, what we are really part of&amp;our true purpose is very different to what we are taught by the brainwashing of &quot;The System&quot; that has us re-present the thoughts of other men&amp;women rather than thinking unique thoughts inspired by direct experience, perception interaction with nature. Everything we, the Cristian family, have gone through, from bank fraud and the theft of the family home to death threats and attempts on Arthur&apos;s life, is touched on.

 Control The Land
And You Control MAN On The Land
Displace MAN From Land
And You Turn MAN Into Slaves
By Arthur&amp;Fiona Cristian
Love For Life

 

April 2011

This is an extract taken from a recent Facebook Discussion.
Links to all these Facebook discussions/debates can be found here:
 http://loveforlife.com.au/node/3385 

 Control the land and you control MAN on the land

Displace MAN from land and you turn MAN into slaves 

All men, women and children have a natural inheritance to a piece of land (a hectare is sufficient) to care for and co-create life with, land with access to clean water and shelter where they can grow food and raise their families in peace and freedom, doing no harm to the land, to their lives and all of life, and passing on the land and its abundance to their descendants and tribes/villages/communitie​s.

Is there any man, woman or child who will come forward and say we do not have that natural inheritance?

For what are we without land?

Our natural inheritance comes without the threat of being stolen or sold, and is unencumbered by debt or any other man-made restriction BUT comes with full responsibility for nurturing that land and doing no harm. Once we give up our responsibility, we need masters and, once we need masters, we become slaves. We lose our freedom and we lose our uniqueness.

We were never meant to be in the image/likeness of another MAN&apos;S thought but, once we have masters, we are forced to mould the men, women and children we are into the likeness of the thoughts of our masters. When we are displaced from land, we have to rely on our masters for everything, thus acquiescing our freedom, uniqueness and responsibility as we accept the handouts and &quot;The Systems&quot; of our masters. We become the cogs of &quot;The System&quot;, drones turning on our brothers and sisters of life, once all MAN on the land, in the name of &quot;The System&quot; which only benefits the tiny few who control &quot;The System&quot;. The local councils, etc, have become the Land Barons of &quot;The System&quot;, at the beck and call of the Priests who control everything.

Free on the land, able to provide our families with all they need, we are free to be the unique men, women and children we are meant to be, thinking thoughts that are unique to each of us as we contemplate on and interact with nature all around us.

All our problems stem from the lie that some men and women have the right to have power and control over others and, when we accept this lie, we support and maintain it.

 No MAN is master of another MAN

All men are equal

Displacing MAN from land is slavery

MAN on the land is where true peace and freedom for all begins 

The statutes of Council rules, etc, are all part of the scam to keep MAN from being free on the land. Common Law, Democracy and Constitutional Rights, etc, do nothing to solve this problem as they also support the displacement of MAN from land because most people cannot compete in &quot;The System&quot; of commerce as their natural skills lie elsewhere and they are not good at making money out of other men and women; they don&apos;t like it. Those who cannot compete are discriminated against; they have lost their uniqueness and their freedom on the land and they become the garbage collectors, the sewerage workers and all the other cogs through the rank and file of the blue and white collar workers. The dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-fittest-and-smartest &quot;System&quot; keep the few in control of all the land so that they can control all the men and women residing on that land.

The Church, The Bar, The Courts, The Aristocracy, The Governments and Councils are the means by which the few maintain control of the land and maintain the lie of some having power and control over others. They are not to be found anywhere in nature and anywhere there are tribes still living peacefully in pristine forests. Where they exist is where all the tribes were displaced from the land and where the remnants of the tribes and those sent in to live amongst them, live under the control of the Church and its systems. Operating out of this lie, those who work for &quot;The System&quot; can only do harm. If they want to go with truth, they can only stop working for &quot;The System&quot; and do all they can to get it out of our lives.

The cogs of &quot;The System&quot; can come and do harm to anyone on the land at any time without having to take responsibility for it, although all harm is a curse and curses always return to the makers and holders of the curses.

The key to our freedom is in removing the power&amp;control of the few over the land. Once we do that, they have nothing.

Who are they to think they can tell us we are not free?

 All Man-Made &quot;Systems&quot; Require Slaves And Rulers

 

All man-made systems require slaves and rulers. It is impossible to avoid this fact, this circumstance. Being forced to live under the rules, regulations, rituals, procedures, conditions and contracts of any man-made system causes a loss of uniqueness to everyone exposed to them. No man, woman or child is answerable to anyone or anything re-presenting a man-made system. We were never meant to give up FULL-responsibility for our lives, which is what we do when we acquiesce to any man-made system, be it cashless or not, gold standard or not, religious, political, legal, social, environmental, spiritual, philosophical, commercial, esoteric, international or domestic or not, and fall under the standing of its authorities, representatives and enforcers. All man-made systems are a scam as will be the coming New World Order system with its cosmic, galactic, Christianised, feel good/feel god, &quot;Oneness&quot; glue remedy to cure the present earth-wide chaos engineered by the tiny few who still want all the power and glory. This cashless &quot;one-world&quot; remedy will be overseen by an earth-wide power structure no different to the Federation overseeing the non-sense cashless world of Star Trek.

Tools used by those behind man-made systems to indoctrinate the masses include all religions, holy books, history books, science, the New Age and all forms of education stemming from any of the many universities presently offering &quot;system career&quot; courses across Earth. Placed on the conveyor belt running through factory planet earth, brainwashed men and woman are being manufactured in sameness moulds to produce individuals (in-divide-u-all-s). We are already unique, not one the same as the next, but all man-made systems trick us through propaganda and manipulation into giving up our uniqueness so we can become the willing slaves and rulers in &quot;The System&quot;. All man-made systems (all beliefs, faiths&amp;associated opinions) cause loss of uniqueness. As already mentioned we were never meant to be in the image/likeness of another mans thought.

Broken up into individuals, we no longer feel the bonds between us which is why we think we need an artificial system to co-exist. All Freemasonic/Satanic holy books, and belief systems exist to keep us in an individualised state so that we accept &quot;The Systems&quot; that control us therefore giving our power and life-force-energy away to those hiding behind &quot;The Systems&quot; to rule us with. There is no other reason or purpose for their existence. They are all designed to con us into being ruled by man-made systems, to con us into accepting third party figures, whether saviours or &quot;leaders&quot; so that we give up the responsibility for our lives here and now to them. Even to the point where we no longer think that what is happening on Earth is important because we believe in &quot;life after death&quot; or the ascended masters of the Galactic Federation or some &quot;other world&quot; out there where we will have peace from the pressures of life under &quot;The System&quot;. They all come packaged as fairytales with fairytale props and characters for us to give up our responsibility for our lives to here and now so that we can be ruled by those Freemasons/Satanists hiding behind &quot;The System&quot; of those fairytales.

This is why the Freemasonic/Satanic world always operates in the shadows. They are the master puppeteers pulling at the strings of the belief, faith and associated opinion of their marionettes. Just as little Mary is unable to bring forward the Alice in Wonderland characters and settings she is playing to prove they exist neither are those who believe in &quot;The System&quot; fairytales able to bring forward 1st party to 1st party proof/substance of their existence. All they can do is re-present them but they are the only ones present; the characters are not. No matter how intense and for how long they believe in their fairytales and how much they argue for them and protect them, the believers only have their belief, faith and associated opinion. The brainwashing is extensive.

Individualism is as if we go to the ants and say, &quot;Hey ants! We are changing your values and giving you a new program called individualism. You are now free to be in-divide-u-all-s; you can each have your own truths and no one has the right to take them away from you.&quot; And so the ants go off to become materialists, Buddhists, Christians, Jews, atheists, republicans, democrats, New Agers, conservatives, punk rockers, journalists, psychologists, politicians, priests, banksters, judges, lawyers, etc, etc. Meanwhile back in the ant world colony, who is taking care of the babies and the elderly and maintaining the nest? Inevitably, the ant-world perishes and all individualised ants go with it! This is what is happening to MAN and MANS Earth. Is this the consequence we all want? We each need to take full-responsibility for our lives so that together the responsibility for taking care of Life is taken care of. Passing the buck to a 3rd party God, man, woman, fiction, law, political party, piece of paper, electronic/digital recording device, etc, stops each of us from taking full-responsibility for life.

We are determined to co-create Kindoms/Do No Harm Communities to be the living-remedy that provides an everlasting peace, freedom, truth, joy, abundance and do no harm for all of life without the need for having slaves and rulers or causing loss of uniqueness.

 ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER

 

Note: Updated Wednesday 17th June 2009 8.00pm Sydney Time.

Love For Life does not support harm doing in any shape or form. However, we are supporters of free speech and post articles, documentaries, etc, that represent a wide cross section of ideas. See the Love For Life extensive research library where over 11,000 individual documents, articles, videos, podcasts and debates/discussions are posted: http://loveforlife.com.au/node/82 . We clearly see the evidence of the destruction to MAN and Earth that has been caused by ALL religions over the centuries and are therefore not supporters of religions, cults, sects or any group that demands conformity of thought, speech or action, or has rules, regulations or rituals that must be followed. Religions, nationalities and cultural &quot;identities&quot; are formed as a result of the brainwashing we receive from childhood. They are part of the tactics the Establishment uses to keep us all divided from one another and fighting one another.

All religions promote discrimination and division, leading to hatred and even violence and murder. None of them have yet to produce a remedy to all the suffering, poverty, unhappiness and discrimination in the world. If any religion truly had the remedy to all the suffering on earth, there would no longer be any suffering. What have Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, atheism and the New Age done to end the suffering in the world?

The Love For Life website has information from all sides on many subjects, whether about Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Law, health, psychology, mind control, vaccination, aspartame, MSG, Chemtrails etc. There are over 11,000 individual articles, documentaries, etc on the website and they are so diverse that we are sure that everyone would be able to find something they loved and something they hated, if they took the time to search. If we removed all the articles hated by everyone, there would probably be nothing left! We are not anti anyone but freedom of speech is freedom of speech and no one should condemn the work of another without taking the time to research the subject themselves. Yes, there are articles by those who have a less-than-rosy-viewpoint of Judaism, but there are also articles on the dark side of Tibetan Buddhism (and it is very dark) for those who are interested in the truth: Tibet - Buddhism - Dalai Lama: http://loveforlife.com.au/node/6271 Should the authors of these articles be abused and imprisoned for daring to challenge the widely conceived reputation of Buddhism as being the religion of peace and love and that of the Dalai Lama as a saint, or should those interested be allowed to study the work and come to their own conclusions? The same applies to all the articles, documentaries, etc, about Christianity, Islam, Freemasonry, New World Order, etc.

The Love for Life website also shows how the Rule of Law, the Bar, the Government, the Monarchy, the system of commerce, the local, national and multi/trans-national private corporations, all the courses and careers on offer from our universities, all the educators, scientists, academics and experts, the aristocrats and the Establishment bloodlines have also done NOTHING to end the suffering in the world. The website maps the insanity of a world where there is no help for those in need, just as there was no help available for us when we were victims of terrible bank fraud: http://loveforlife.com.au/court_case orchestrated, condoned and protected by an international crime syndicate/terrorist organisation of judges, barristers, registrars, lawyers, politicians, banksters, big business representatives, media moguls and other lackeys who, all together, put up a wall of silence despite our trying many, many avenues. After the family home was stolen and business destroyed we were left close to poverty and destitution caring for 4 young daughters. Three years later not much has changed regardless of all our efforts. Where were all the followers of all the religions to help us? Or do we have to be members of those religions to receive help from others involved in them?

We have been accused of being anti - Jewish because we had posted an excerpt from James von Brun&apos;s book: Kill the Best Gentiles! http://loveforlife.com.au/node/6054 in which he blames Jews for the problems of the world. Obviously this is not our view because of what we have stated above. We do not hate anyone, whatever religion they follow. We are always open to talk to any religious leader or politician and meet with any judge, member of the Bar, experts, academics, educators etc to share the remedy we offer that heals all the divisions between MAN and MAN, and MAN and EARTH.

Today, a representative of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies is threatening to close the website down, because they have decided it is anti - Jewish and that we promote racism. What has the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies done to end the suffering in the world? Can they show that they are concerned with the suffering of ALL men, women and children AND ARE SEEN TO BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT or are they only concerned with Jewish affairs? If so, they, along with all the other religions that only care for their own, are part of the problem, not part of the solution. The man who rang Arthur today was only concerned with Jewish affairs; he was not interested in our intentions or in anybody else, just as most Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Catholics, etc, are only interested in their own. While we separate our lives into groups, dividing our lives from others with rules, regulations, rituals, procedures, conditions and contracts, we will never solve our problems.

No matter what we in the Western World Civilisation of Commerce have been promised by our politicians, religious leaders, scientists, educators, philosophers, etc, for the past two hundred years, all we have seen is ever-increasing destruction of men, women and children and Earth. None of the so-called experts and leaders we have been taught to rely on are coming up with a solution and none of them are taking full-responsibility for the fact that they can&apos;t handle the problem. All religious books talk about end times full of destruction and suffering but why do we have to follow this program when there is an alternative to hatred, mayhem and death? Why are our leaders following the program of destruction and death rather than exploring the do no harm alternatives? It seems that any mainstream politician, priest or academic are only interested in supporting the RULES OF THE DIVIDE, that maintain the haves and the have nots. For 200+ years, 99% of the world population have been so trained to pass on their responsibility for their lives, others and Earth, that the 1% of the population that make up the leaders of the rest of us are making all the decisions leading to the destruction of all of us and Earth. Let&apos;s not forget the education system that brainwashes the 99% of the population that we are free and have equal rights while, in fact, we are feathering the nests of those at the top.

At the root of all our problems is self-centredness, an unwillingness nurtured by the Establishment that keeps us concerned only with our own needs rather than the needs of others around us and Earth. Instead of creating and releasing acts of love for those around us as gifts to benefit them and Earth, we take, take and take, until there is nothing left. The whole point of the Love for Life website is to show people the root of all our problems and to share the remedy. The extensive research library is there to attract browsers and to provide access to information not available through mainstream channels. If the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies can, after careful examination of our work, prove that anything we are saying is wrong, we will be happy to accept their proof. If they cannot, and they are still insistent on closing the website down, they will be showing themselves to be traitors to MAN because they are not interested in pursuing any avenue that can end the suffering in the world.

All religions, corporations and organisations that support and maintain the Western World Civilisation of Commerce are part of the problem because our civilisation is a world of haves and have nots, exclusivity, privilege, racism, violence, hatred, poverty, sickness, discrimination, abuse, starvation, homelessness, corruption, collusion, vindictiveness, social unrest, arrogance, ignorance, fear, war and chaos. While we support civilisation, we support death and destruction.

If we truly want peace and freedom for all, we have to let go of all that which keeps us divided, and come together as MAN, conscious living co-creators of creation/life. The Love For Life website offers a remedy to the problems we all face in the form of DO NO HARM COMMUNITIES (KINDOMS): http://loveforlife.com.au/node/6608 - http://loveforlife.com.au/node/3641 For more details see here: http://loveforlife.com.au/node/6511 and here: http://loveforlife.com.au/node/3385 - We also highly recommend that everyone read the brilliant Russian books called The Ringing Cedars: http://loveforlife.com.au/node/1125 - The Love For Life homepage/front-page also provides lots of inspiring remedy based information: http://loveforlife.com.au - If you want to be kept up to date with our work please register to the Love For Life mailing list here: http://loveforlife.com.au/campaign_list We usually send two postings per month. Presently (September 2011) there are over 7000 registrations reaching over 500,000 readers across Earth. The website now (September 2011) receives up to 12 million hits per month. Since December 2006, over 100 million people have visited the Love For Life website.
