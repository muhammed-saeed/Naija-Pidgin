If hygiene is a concern for McD&apos;s play place, why allow your children to play there at all?
 Ok, the hot discussion right now is to allow your child to run free w/shoes on in McD&apos;s play place or not.

Reason to allow it although it is clearly against the rules (sorry, I am big on respecting rules) due to hygienic reservations....I&apos;m going to shoot a hole in this theory:

1. Kids eat w/their hands in this place, primarily a finger food establishment for children
2. Do you glove your children before entering it considering they are touching everything in the place?

 Just a side note at the mention of high chairs:

This group of mother&apos;s actually went to (I think it was) Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s and took some samples from the play area and eating areas, particularly high chairs. They took these samples to a lab to be examined and the germs that were lingering was just nasty. In cases like this, ignorance is bliss.

 On the note of remembering when kids were able to be kids w/o all these rules in regards to safety, do you remember back then that parents weren&apos;t sue happy and actually accepted accidents happened. Due to sue happy parents, these rules are there not to protect the children but the establishments themselves. Sad times, folks.

 Nah, I don&apos;t wipe down the highchairs, my kids would be awfully perturbed with me for even considering that one.....they are too old for them...lol

 Hygiene is particularly important for young children as they have been recognised as being at particular risk of contracting and transmitting enteric (relating to intestines) infection.

This is due to a number of factors:

- They have immature immune systems
- They tend to have a higher degress of close contact with other children
- They tend to explore with their hands, and germs from hands to mouth can easily cause infections
- They share facilities and equipment (as mentioned above)
- They may have incomplete immunisations

You can find lots more information of this sort of nature in the Tork online hygiene toolkit - http://bit.ly/9TYNAa

Parents should do their best to set good examples by washing and drying hands properly and frequently and encourage children to do the same!

 Ewww.

I do not take my kids to McDonald&apos;s because I think the food is disgusting so they have never played there. However, we eat at regular restaurants every once in a while and my kids sit in the high chairs. I wash their hands before and after they eat and I also use a disinfectant wipe on the high chair before they sit down. I use my head and I can just imagine what kind of nasty germs are on the tray! I don&apos;t want my kids to get unnecessarily sick. I do not keep them in a bubble though. When they play t the playground in our neighborhood, they wear shoes and I don&apos;t go around wiping down all the equipment before they touch it. LOL! After the playground, though, they do get a bath but only because they like to play in the dirt. ;P

 Do you remember when Kid&apos;s used to be able to be kids, without all these ridiculous rules and safety measures put in place by uptight mothers associations?

We all survived back then.

 Exactly!!! Parents sue, whine and cry over everything these days- and in the end our lives changes and we end up sheltering our children beyond what is reasonable!!!! Why can&apos;t we just let kids me kids- and understand that **** happens!?!?!!!

 I never take my daughter to those McD&apos;s play places. We have been to Chuck E Cheese a few times, and their equipment seems to be a lot cleaner. And yes, i repsect the rules and take mine and daughter&apos;s shoes off before we go in the tunnels...yeah, i go in them too lol!

Oh and lets talk about the nasty highchairs that fast food restaurants provide! YUCK! They always seem grimy like no one ever cleans them. THAT is worse then the playplace sometimes.

 My kid has played there once in his life, because the first time, I never took him out of the highchair.
I do not glove my child before entering, nope.

 I do not let my children play in the McD&apos;s play place. I think they are filthy and disgusting. I am not a neat freak, nor am I germ-ophobic, but I have my limits.

 I wouldn&apos;t let my children in that establishment for any reason. If you want to eat out go somewhere good - all the crap at McDonald&apos;s can be bought in your grocery store frozen food section for much cheaper.

 If you try to keep your child&apos;s world germ-free you end up doing more harm than good. Limiting their exposure to everyday germs helps them to build their immune systems and without it they would be forever sick.

 If my kids are not in their bubbles, they know that they must wear gloves, boots, hats and face masks at all times. Especially at a play yard.

 Heh...

I am one of those oh so horrible mom&apos;s that take their child to the play places (either McD&apos;s or BK) on a rainy day or a day when I have a lot of homework to get done (free wifi!!!). We maybe go twice a month and *gasp* we even eat the food! We live in FL and there have been plenty of times that my son was wearing flip flops or crocks and we completely spaced bringing socks so I&apos;ve even let him run around in there barefoot. He also runs around in the yard barefoot, at the beach, and anywhere else he just happens to take his shoes off. He gets bathed almost every night (we all have our days lol) so at least at the end of the day he is nice and clean before getting into bed! I have never been one to worry about germs and my son is never sick. I also never put one of those cloth shopping cart things on the cart when we went grocery shopping and always used the high chairs at food places if we went out to eat.

I&apos;ll probably get thumbed down but it&apos;s all good! I have a healthy four year old who actually gets to be a kid!

 On the off chance that we&apos;re at a McDonald&apos;s to begin with, they&apos;re free to play and eat without gloves, shoes, or disinfected bubbles. I&apos;ve had 15 years of kids playing in those things, and no one has died from playing in a fast food restaurant jungle gym. Not one of mine has ever had any weird foot disease either. I&apos;m sure this is just another one of those scares that will turn out to be nothing and a few months from now will be completely forgotten about in favor of some new thing we&apos;re supposed to be afraid of.

 Shoes have to do with safety, not hygiene. When outdoors, there is always the potential for injury by stepping on something hard, or sharp or wet, plus the concrete can shred their socks or their bare feet. If an Employee informed us that we would have to take our shoes off or leave, we would leave. I have only ever been to the one nearest our home, and all the kids were wearing shoes, despite the sign. It doesn&apos;t make sense to me to make them take their shoes off outdoors, sorry, but it just doesn&apos;t. Even at the pool they wear water shoes.

Chuck E Cheese&apos;s...indoors...carpeted. They take their shoes off.

 You guys are all nuts! When I was a kid, i had fun by running around on our farm, through dirt, mud, creeks, and horse ****.... Not only that, but I&apos;d spend all day with the horses and came up, made lunch and ate it all without washing my hands (kids will be kids) And never got sick from it. My son goes to the McD&apos;s play place from time to time, not often, but thats just because i prefer taco bell, lol. When he&apos;s in the play place, he absolutely takes off his shoes. If you&apos;re not gonna follow the rules, dont go in, and own up to it too, let your kids know they aren&apos;t aloud in because mom wont follow the rules. Hes got socks on, hes fine. All you parents who shelter your kids to the extant that they aren&apos;t aloud to run around in the play place are nuts. If you happen to be at McD&apos;s and they happen to have a play place, let your kids run around in it. You give your kids baths right? Then they&apos;re fine. What I do is I carry a little bottle of hand sanitizer in my purse at all times, should I feel that my kid needs it, I give him some. That simple.
