Answer by  Gabriel (2145) 

A fast casual restaurant is one that may offer better service and quality than fast food, but doesn&apos;t offer table service. Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread are two examples of this trend. The phrase started popping up in the early 90&apos;s and seems to be taking off. add a comment

Answer by  rosarobinson (15) 

Fast casual restaurants may provide healthier food selections, which may include: more vegetarian selections, meals that are organic, low or no salt, and low or no fat. Jason&apos;s Deli, Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill are a few examples. Fast casual restaurants serve food quick, the decor is fresh, comtemporary and meals are a little more pricey than usual. add a comment

Answer by  jblo (22) 

A fast casual restaurant is a sit down restaurant with prices that tend to be higher than fast food. It typically takes more time to prepare and is served to you, rather than picked up at the counter. There are many national chain examples such as Ruby Tuesday, TGI Fridays, and Applebees. add a comment

Answer by  becki (229) 

It is a restaurant the you usually order your food from a counter but then they bring it to you. These also usually will not have a drive-thru service. Some examples would be Panera Bread and Faxoli&apos;s. You would be able to spend a little more time in the actual dining area to eat. add a comment

Answer by  Alisha (224) 

A fast casual restaurant is a self-service restaurant (that means it doesn&apos;t offer full table service) but it promises a higher quality of food than a fast food restaurant. A meal typically costs between $8 and $15 for a single person. The term was coined in the 1990s. add a comment

Answer by  Fishtales (373) 

A fast casual restaurant is a restaurant that you do not have to carry your own tray or stay in line to order. You are seated by a host, given a menu and a wait staff member takes your order and delivers your food. Prices should be slightly more than fast food and the place should be well decorated. add a comment
