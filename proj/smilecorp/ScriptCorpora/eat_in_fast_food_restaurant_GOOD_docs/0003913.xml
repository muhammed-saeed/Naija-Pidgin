Who Said Fast Food was Ever Cheap?

 COMMENTARY | Why has it been the assumption that lower-income families and fast food joints seem to go hand in hand? How come many tend to think fast food restaurants are cheap?



Yes, going to McDonald&apos;s, Burger King or Wendy&apos;s is much cheaper than a full-service sit-down at a table establishment. Of course, it is more convenient to go to a drive-thru window at a fast food restaurant to pick up lunch or dinner for a family. Yet, they are not cheap when it comes down to it.



Based on recent reports, studies and articles tying in the lower-income bracket to obesity and fast foods one thinks they frequent their neighborhood fried chicken or burger hangout. Those who are on food stamps cannot use them at fast food restaurants. Instead, it is the convenience store with jacked-up prices that has become a&quot;food desert&quot;for these residents.



Rarely do they find or even sell nutritious, fresh whole foods. The only thing available is snacks and other comfort foods high in fat and sugar.



Conservatively speaking, buying a meal for a family of four at McDonald&apos;s is around $28 . That&apos;s at least $7 apiece. To do this every day would be impractical and costly. A study from the University of California Davis found it was the lower to middle class incomes that frequent fast food establishments with an average income of $60,000 a year.



Whether it is a sit-down restaurant, deli or fast food joint it is expensive to eat out regularly. The best way to combat these high costs would be to make your own meals. Sometimes you can make a big meal, and then freeze what&apos;s left and serve it up for another time. This is a great alternative to fast foods.
