Buy Canadian Whisky through Whisky Marketplace’s New Canadian Whisky Selection
 PRWeb  –  Mon, Apr 2, 2012 
 Whisky Marketplace now has a wide selection of Canadian Whisky for customers looking to try what Canada has to offer. The excellent quality of Canadian Whisky, due to the strict regulation of its distillation process , is serving to give the region a good name among whisky experts .

(PRWEB) April 02, 2012
While not as well known as Irish Whiskey or Scotch, Canadian Whisky is garnering attention within the whisky market in recent years. Due to the ingredients chosen for the distillation process, Canadian Whisky is known as being a smoother and lighter than its variants overseas, and has gained its own market of whisky lovers . Additionally, the rules and regulations that guide the creation of Canadian Whisky are similar in strictness to the whiskey and scotch, leading to a product that is quality ensured and more dependable in flavor. Canadian Whisky has gained the attention of websites such as Whisky Marketplace, which work in tandem with online whisky retailers in order to supply customers with the best selection of whisky at the best price. Those who look to buy Canadian Whisky can now find their favorite brands from Canada on the website’s new Canadian Whisky section.


Whisky Marketplace ’s selection of Canadian Whisky boasts a full variety of brands, such as the popular Canadian Club and Crown Royal. Searching the website for these brands is especially easy, due to the advanced whisky finder feature, which allows customers to search by many different variables, such as region, brand, and other factors. If a customer is looking to find Black Velvet whisky , they will be able to find the brand and search the prices offered by a variety of online whisky retailers listed by the site. The advantage of using this type of browsing method over shopping within one single retailer’s website is quite clear, as it allows the user to compare prices, which will help inform their shopping decisions in the future.


Whisky Marketplace’s growing selections of whisky, ranging from the popular Irish and Scottish whiskies to the developing Japanese, American, Canadian and World Whiskies, will help any whisky shopper find their favorite brand of whisky online .
