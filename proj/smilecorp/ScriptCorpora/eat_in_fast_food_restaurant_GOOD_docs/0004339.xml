MCALLISTARS

Provided by Judy&apos;s Book 

I totally LOVE Mcallistars Deli. This deli is a chain but mostly in the SouthEast US. The food is great..I think a bit overpriced but good.I ususally do a 6 inch french dip with chips and drink and the cost is usally around $8.50 - $9.00.The food is always quick and very good.I eat here about twice a month.....good place to meet with friends and have a lunch get-together or dinner get-together.
