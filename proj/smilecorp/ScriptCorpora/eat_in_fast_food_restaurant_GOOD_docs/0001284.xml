What&apos;s wrong with fast-food restaurants where you can&apos;t ensure your order is accurate in the drive-thru?
 You ever been through a drive-thru that is timed and they rush you through? And then half the time they screw up your order. So, if you want to stop wasting gas and trips, you start double checking your order at the window, but then, in turn, the employees spite you for it because you&apos;re causing their average drive-thru time to go up.

I worked at a fast-food restaurant when I was a teenager and I remember a customer was double-checking his order at the drive-thru window and the manager got pissed off and lost his temper at the customer for taking too long and said&quot;get the f*** out of my drive-thru&quot;.

I am scared to check my order to make sure it&apos;s accurate, because the employees will recognize me as backing them up, and then they&apos;ll spit in my food next time or something.

Are you also uncomfortable double-checking your order because of this? It&apos;s a huge waste of time and gas when you go home and find out they screwed up. What is wrong with this system? I ask this in law&amp;ethics because this is business ethics.

 @Mutt : You shouldn&apos;t have to do that. That&apos;s the whole point. Not to mention the inside may be closed and only the drive-thru is open. Imagine waiting 20 minutes through the really long drive-thru to get your food and the inside is closed. Should you have to pull up to check your food only to wait the 20 minutes all over again while the food you ordered that wasn&apos;t screwed up gets cold? Hell no... If I had to do that, I&apos;d ask for an entire refund. Especially so when you&apos;re picking up food for other people.

 I usually double-check my food. If anyone yells at me, I just explain I wouldn&apos;t have to do it if management instilled some basic competency in their employees. I don&apos;t really care if they spit in my food because it isn&apos;t any worse than what they are already doing to my food.

 If you&apos;re that worried about it, just pull ahead to check it. The car behind you can then pull up to the window and get his order while you check yours. If there is no problem, you just drive on. If there is, you park and go inside to get the problem resolved.

Or just stop using the drive thru and go inside to order. That&apos;s what i do.

 Drive thrus time their throughput from wheel stop to wheel movement, so yes, you&apos;re screwing their time up, but only on YOUR order, not those following you.

In any event, you have a right to take a reasonable time to check your order. If someone complains, go inside and ask to speak to the manager or franchisee. Pissing off the customer is a great way to lose business
