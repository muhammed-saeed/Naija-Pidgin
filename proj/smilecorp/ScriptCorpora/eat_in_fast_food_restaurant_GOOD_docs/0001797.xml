Volunteers clear trash from roadways, waterways

Volunteers rose early Saturday morning to find that a pair of boots, a toothbrush, cigarette butts, old fishing lines and fast food restaurant wrappers littered the Spring Garden Landing boat ramp and parking lot.

But the volunteers from Bethany Christian Church’s youth group were happy to be there on the banks of the Neuse River collecting trash.

“It was so beautiful out there at that time of day, with the sun coming over the water,”said Debbie Kirkman, the wife of the church’s pastor, as she and the youth group finished clearing the boat ramp parking lot of litter.

“It was an opportunity to enjoy God’s creation,”said Wendy Paschal, a youth group leader and an extension agent with the Craven County Cooperative Extension that coordinated the Craven County Big Sweep on Saturday. The clean-up effort was part of the annual statewide N.C. Big Sweep to clear the state’s roadways and waterways of litter.

“It serves as reminder, maybe, to folks about the importance of keeping things cleaned up and discourages the dumping of trash,”said Tom Glasgow, the county extension director.

Glasgow said there are two other annual community clean-up events in the county—Little Sweep in February and the Spring Clean-up. The efforts help the environment, and animals especially, who could be harmed by getting tangled in different types of trash.

Last year, 76 people volunteered in the county’s Big Sweep, collecting 81 bags of trash. This year, Glasgow said he hoped for more than 100 volunteers to help clean up.

“I think the people who are prone to throwing things out the window and dumping in the national forest, perhaps they can’t be reached anyhow,”he said.“But with something like this, you get somebody to second guess a bad habit.”

Isaac Kirkman, a member of one of the Bethany Christian Church’s youth groups, said he found a lot of fishing lines by the water, and he found a lot of glass bottles, too. He also found something“kind of gross”that squirted out a liquid when squeezed. But even so, the clean-up was worth it to Isaac.

“It made me feel kind of good because I’m helping the environment because it’s where we all live and we all have to do our part to keep it clean,”he said.

Ten members of the Town&amp;Country 4-H Saddle Club went to Brinson Memorial Elementary School on Saturday to fulfill a community service requirement so they could participate in horse shows, said Stacey Eubanks, a club co-leader.

Last year the group found broken chairs and a basketball among the trash that filled three to four bags.

Kelsey Eubanks, the club president, said cleaning the school grounds last year was fun,“just being together, and learning how to work with everybody.”

A group of nine volunteers from Pamlico Community College cleaned up an area of Dawson Creek as part of the Pamlico County Big Sweep, said Carol Phillips, the director of the college’s environmental science program.

There were close to 100 volunteers working across Pamlico County on Saturday, said Bill Ellers, extension director for the Pamlico County Cooperative Extension.

The numbers are not final, he said, and several more groups will be picking up trash next weekend. The record participation for the event is about 77 volunteers.

Phillips said the community college group chose to go to Dawson’s Creek because the environmental science classes do studies there.

“We choose the same spot every year because it’s a beautiful place, and it’s a public area,”she said.“We just want to keep it beautiful for everybody.”

Phillips said the area was the cleanest she’s seen it in three years, but the group still found a pair of underwear, and a cell phone with a clam growing in it.

“This year has been the cleanest year yet—so people are starting to maybe pick up after themselves,”she said.“We think it’s important to keep the environment clean.”
