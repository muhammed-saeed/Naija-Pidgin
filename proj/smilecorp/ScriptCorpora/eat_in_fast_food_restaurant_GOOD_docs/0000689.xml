CIAO (Italian fast-food): When everything else is closed...
 
 Helpfulness
 Henrik_rrb   444 reviews 
One of the biggest problems you&apos;ll have as a tourist in Italy is to find somewhere to eat between the lunch hours and the dinner hours.
For some reason the italians seems to believe that the whole world is eating between 12 and 14, and then nothing until 19...
They don&apos;t know me very well, that&apos;s for sure...

There are McDonalds of course, and other american fast food-chains. But after a while even a guy like me gets tired of them. Plus, who can ever stay full on a Big mac for more than 30 minutes...?
Then, when everything seems to be close, and you&apos;re tired of american hamburgers, you&apos;ll always have Ciao. It&apos;s an italian fast food-restaurant, in Milan located, among other places, at the Piazza Duomo.

Here you can find a lunch, with a lot of different kinds of meal. Meat, fish, vegetarian just to mention a few.
Not so cheap anymore as it was some years ago, but normally the food is good, and quite well worth the money. Not a place I would take a girl on a romantic date, or my family for a dinner. But, when everything else is closed it&apos;s a nice alternative to McDonalds...

 Favorite Dish: I usually take a piece of meat, and then pommes frites to that. Goes for around 10-11 euro.

CIAO: Cheap Eats
 
 Helpfulness
 Krystynn   2967 reviews 
There are many Ciao outlets in Milan. A great place for tourists on tight budgets. Hey, even I do lunch at a CIAO outlet on some days. When I&apos;m at Ciao&apos;s, I usually dine on pasta and finish it off with a piece of their delicious cakes and desserts.

My favorite Ciao outlet to go to is at Piazza Duomo.

HOT TIP: Go to the 3rd floor of the Duomo Center (right under the porticoes beside il Duomo) and grab a table (at Sala Terrazza Duomo). The view from up here is AMAZING!

The other Ciao outlet I patronize is located around the vicinity of Piazza San Babila at Via Fabio Filzi 8 (not far from the Central Station).

 Favorite Dish: Pasta and their desserts!

CIAO (Italian fast-food): Cheap and cheerful
 
 Helpfulness
 UKDaisy   241 reviews 
This is a place where you can have inexpensive but good food. Even though it&apos;s a self-service restaurant, the food seems pretty fresh, and varieties available aren&apos;t bad. My favourites from this place are the pastas and the fruit tarte.

I came across 2 Ciao restaurants when I was in Milan, but I would say that the best one is the one across from the Duomo, it&apos;s a lot more spacious, and if you can get a window table, the views are lovely.

CIAO: The REAL Italian fast food!
 
 Helpfulness
 dtosti   5 reviews 
&quot;Ciao&quot; is the name of a chain of self-service restaurants specialized in Italian food cooked at the moment.

The ambient is a classic fast food one, with people coming in during their lunch breaks to eat a good meal at a reasonable price (less than 10 euro).

 Favorite Dish: I have no favourite dish in this restaurant, because the menu changes everyday. Hovewer, a dish that is always present is ravioli or tortellini (pasta filled with meat or vegetables).

This place is a Milan wonder. Right across from the Duomo, relatively inexpensive yet good food. Several different stations have snack foods, pizza, hot foods. Also serves alcohol and of course, espresso. Fill your plate and then pay.

 Favorite Dish: The insalate (salads) are very good.

Ciao is a chain of restaurants throughout Italy that serve great food for a very reasonable price.

 Favorite Dish: It changes every day but watch out for their potatos and pastas. Delicious!
