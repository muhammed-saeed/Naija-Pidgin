Expertly crafted from solid pine and built with a thick plinth base, the Winchester TV Armoire is tough and strong enough to take the knocks of everyday family use for years to come. The superb effect is completed with a coat of delicately warming wax that both protects the wood and brings out the wonderful colouring and delicate natural grain of the solid pine, so that the Winchester TV Armoire ages with grace and beauty. The Winchester TV Armoire is designed to complement the other cool, calming pieces in the Winchester collection, so check out the matching shelves, sideboards and cupboard units and fill your home with the subtle elegance of pine.

 A small town in Germany? 

 Advantages: Compact, cultured, loads to do
 Disadvantages: Limited&quot;old town&quot;, some may find it lacking vitality


...Bonn was the capital of the former West Germany (or Bundesrepublik in German) between1949 and 1990. It is the nineteenth largest (according to Wikipedia) city in Germany which says much about why it was chosen to be the new capital following World War Two; Konrad Adenauer, the post-war chancellor of the Bundesrepublik, was a local lad and he pushed for Bonn to become capital over Frankfurt, a city which was in a much better position to take on the role. Frankfurt already had many suitable buildings and a good infrastructure but Bonn won the day in spite of the added costs involved.

Following World War Two, Germany was divided into four zones; this was done to satisfy the Allies who each had various claims on the territory and wished to protect their individual interests and the other reason was that it was believed that Germany needed...

Review of Bonn ( Germany ) 
 
 Germany Condensed 

 Advantages: Excellent detail; lively texts; covers a range of budgets
 Disadvantages: Latest edition has squeezed out some interesting destinations; too bulky for traveling with


...The world of travel is as likely as any other to be affected by trends; each January we find out the travel writers? tips for the must visit destinations for the forthcoming year, and a hit movie or an unexpected news event can see the popularity of a hitherto unknown location exceed all expectations. The reunification of Berlin has seen that city returned to the status of Germany?s capital and, although it was already a large city with many worthwhile sights, since the fall of the Wall it?s value in touristic terms has become huge. Not surprisingly a large chunk of the Rough Guide to Germany is given over to Berlin but with just over eleven hundred pages, does the book manage to cover the rest of Germany in such detail? 

The answer is: that depends. Should you be interested in seeing the most obviously touristy places and the biggest...

Review of The Rough Guide to Germany - Gordon McLachlan 
 
   A Rat-Infested Town in Germany 

 Advantages: Stunning architecture, lots of history
 Disadvantages: Rats!


...I would imagine that everybody&apos;s heard of Hamelin, or to give it its more correct, German spelling, Hameln. At least, I should think everyone&apos;s familiar with the legend of The Pied Piper of Hameln.

The town lies around 50km south of Hanover in the state of Lower Saxony, northern Germany. It straddles the Weser river and is the cultural and economic capital of the Weser area. In fact the town owes its prosperity through the ages to the Weser river and the trade that passed along it. This led to local merchants building some elaborately decorated houses which have survived to this day and are one of the main attractions of visiting here.

Approaching Hameln you could be forgiven for wondering what the fuss is all about. A series of drab suburbs does nothing to excite the newly arrived. However, at the edge of the inner ring road...
