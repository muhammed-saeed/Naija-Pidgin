Another great installment!!
 9.0 By XooKey ,
 May 20, 2011 I think this was a great episode and that Laurence Fishburne is filling the shoes of William Peterson very well. One scene is an apparent double homicide with a missing victim and a missing murder and the other scene is a homicide that seems to be an easy wrap-up. Things are not always as they appear. Dr. Langston is on  the first scene with Nick Stokes and Catherine is on the second scene with Greg. The first scene is at a fast food restaurant where the manager is found dead of a trauma to the back of the head, but there is evidence of a second body. The team tracks down the second body and it is a worker who was staying there at night in a cooking oil drum. The man in the cooking oil drum was murdered by the manager, who caught him trying to assault a female worker. The manager slipped in oil after killing him and dragging him out to an oil drum and died by accident. 
 
 At the second murder scene a woman is dead handcuffed to the bead and her husband drunk to point of alcohol poisoning in the other room. Autopsy finds the equivalent of two tubes of fluoride toothpaste in her stomach. The husband is accused, but it is found that he was setup by his dead wife and she committed suicide. Their whole marriage had dissolved because of the housing market. 
 
 In the end Dr. Langston finally gets his own office and thrilled to have it. more less

Death ........by tooth paste!
 6.5 By vicky24c ,
 May 20, 2011 In this episode of CSI, the following happens. When a manager of a fast-food restaurant dies in the restaurant, the CSI team are called in to investigate. The team believe they have a suspect in the form of a former employee who had attacked the manager before. But he has an alibi, they team also learn that another employee has  not been seen since her last shift. The body of the homeless employee (who is believed to have killed the manager) is found inside of a drum of oil (which has no oil in it, just a body). During the autopsy, we learn that he died when his face was held under the deep fat fryer, at the restaurant. Catherine also investigates a woman who was killed due to toothpaste. We soon learn, through the evidence, that she killed herself; it had nothing to do with her husband. The missing money from the restaurant is found inside of the manager&apos;s pocket and also most of it is found inside of the deep fat fryer. The money has been fried. The team soon track down the missing employee and we learn that she and her family are in the country illegally. When the prints of the manager are run again, we learn that he killed the homeless employee. The manager (we learn from the female employee) made her strip, whilst he searched her for money, he believed that she stole. She hit the manager of the head with a sign, whilst he was attacking the homeless employee. But the team still don&apos;t know who killed the manager, Bob. When they look over the evidence again, they believe that the room is what killed Bob. Due to him having bad eye sight, after losing his glasses, he fell and died. His death was an accident. In Catherine&apos;s case, we learn that the wife killed herself after clients couldn&apos;t afford to pay their mortgages and she felt guilty. At the end of the episode the M.E. gives the new guy (Grissom&apos;s replacement) a room to use until they can find a better one for him to use. more less

 The team begins to investigate what initially appears to be a murder at a fast food restaurant. It soon becomes  apparent that there is more to the crime than originally thought. Elsewhere, a woman is found dead in her home handcuffed to her bed. more less

 May 20, 2011 It&apos;s good to see that &quot;CSI&quot; continues to deliver well written entertaining episodes in its ninth season. I found this episode to be one of the more entertaining ones of the season. The opening scenes at Choozy&apos;s Chicken are very well done and they keep the viewer guessing as to what the scenes mean and how they will tie into  the investigation. Seeing where the investigation took Brass and the team was also entertaining. The bio-diesel story aspect was pretty clever. The storyline concerning the death of the woman in her home was pretty good also. An episode worth seeing. more less

Death by tooth paste...GREAT!!
 8.5 By jordinajamaica ,
 May 20, 2011 I found this chapter really original! The case of death by toothpaste was really unexpected. Who would have thought that a product we all use daily could be so dangerous! I loved that it wasn&apos;t the predictable, that the husband didn&apos;t have &quot;anything&quot; to do with the seath of his wife...
The fast food restaurant was good too...First the guy being  fried and founding him in a big oil trunk and then all the storyline with the bad boss that ends dead because of faith? GREAT!! 
 Really funny moments between all the characters and really good moment when at the end RAy finds his place in the lab... more less

All you expect..
 7.5 By Parricida ,
 May 20, 2011 CSI is one show I can watch from week to week without having my hopes high or getting disappointed. It follows one same receipt for 9th year and it works - it gets me behind my screen every time every week. Not that I care much about that show.. but it has became habit.

Anyway - this episode. Again, it offers  you everything you expect - mysterious crimes, some really weird case, some horrible autopsy scenes what wish you turn your eyes off the screen.. but in the end - nothing on the cases was as expected and many people who suspected was not involved and the real killer was someone you did not expect.. so.. As I said.. exciting but quite avarage.. more less

 Catherine (Greg is squeezing toothpaste into a cup) : What are you doin&apos;? Greg : I needed to see for myself the volume of 340 grams of toothpaste. You know, unencumbered by a tube, it is an awful lot. You wanna join in? I used to do this as a kid. Catherine : Yeah but now we get paid for doin&apos; it. Greg : You know, even with an antiemetic how could you force this much toothpaste down someone&apos;s throat? Hodges (walks in) : Excuse me for interrupting arts and crafts. Greg : Uh, it&apos;s an experiment. Hodges : Well, maybe for you. The toothpaste that Mrs. Tucker ingested contained a bleaching agent, the tubes you collected didn&apos;t. (walks out) Greg : There were two empty bottles of toothpaste in their room, but it&apos;s not the toothpaste that killed her. Catherine : Arts and crafts are over, we&apos;ve gotta go back to the house.

 Catherine : Is it possible to OD on toothpaste? Henry : Definitely if it&apos;s fluoride toothpaste. Each tube comes with a warning. &apos;If swallowed please contact the poison control center immediately.&apos; Never had a cavity. (smiles) Catherine : No joke, how much fluoride would it take to kill a person? Henry : Depends on the person. Catherine : Female, 110 pounds, with a pre-existing stomach ulcer. Henry : Which means it would get into her system faster. (he rattles off math stuff, and then comes up with the answer) So, she would need 250mg for it to be toxic, and if there&apos;s 450mgs in one tube... Catherine : So one tube would do it? Henry : Assuming that she absorbed it all and didn&apos;t throw it up. Catherine : Well, then for sure, two tubes would get the job done. Henry : She would experience what I would like to call a catastrophic symptom train. Wicked muscle spasms, would give way to decreased heart rate, lowered blood pressure, decreased respiration and eventually death. Catherine : Death by... toothpaste.

 Brass : You know, I missed the whole hippy thing. I was too busy in Southeast Asia keeping my head down and my feet tied. Langston : I&apos;m suprised that you didn&apos;t drop a little acid or smoke a little tea. Brass : Well, things did get a little wild.
