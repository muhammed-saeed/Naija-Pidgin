I&apos;m a fan of this place! the only problem was trying to find parking, we finally found a parking lot up in a small street ($10 flat rate)

The seating on this place is tight, they have people sitting right next to each other. however, cause this place is so loud, it is fine, you still do not hear any one else&apos; conversations.

The food is delicious! and the portions are pretty big. Though I would skip the soup, they are very watery. I want to try everything here!

Clean place, correct food in a modern canteen decoration. Do not expect a high class or quality food, and it is not that cheap neither. Service is fast. Probably better there than in the regular thai green spicy fast food chain.

Had to try it. Done. Have been told it was much better and cheaper in the past...

I used to love Salad King until somewhat recently when their spice levels have gotten rather unpredictable... I&apos;ll order the same dish with the same amount of chillies a week apart and it&apos;ll be bland one week and almost too spicy to eat the next week. It&apos;s made for a few overly painful meals over the past few months.

If you&apos;re eating-in the place is pretty much always packed... if you&apos;re lucky you&apos;ll get a stand alone table, but if you&apos;re not you have to sit elbow to elbow on their cafeteria-style benches. So I tend to order for pick up about 20 minutes before I&apos;m ready to get the food and eat in the comfort of my own home...

The food is delicious all in all however! love the siam noodle, bangkok stir fry, thai basil noodles, and orange chicken dishes.

Don&apos;t forget to try the mango sticky rice for dessert! It&apos;s one of the reasons I keep going back.

If you&apos;re a Ryerson student and haven&apos;t stepped foot here. Shame on you.
Try the islamic noodles (you have to request for it cause its not on the menu).
Very packed and noisy. I wouldn&apos;t recommend for big groups or date cause its hard to hear each other. Great casual dining experience.  Decent prices for thai food in downtown. I would say they have some unique dishes and flavours. Be warned of the chili scale!  If you want to have take out for lunch, I suggest pre-ordering it on the phone before coming in to pick it up. It saves ALOT of time!

Went here on a weekend during the day after being in the area for the NXME music thingymajig.

Firstly I hate waiting for anything longer than 5 minutes, I get agitated and fiddle and break things so it was no surprise that I bumped into a vase and broke it after waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be seated.

The place was busy but the available tables were only for 4+ groups so since it was just me and my friend we had to wait for seats to come free in the communal area. First time I have seen this in Toronto and I was never a big fan of it in the UK and I am still not a big fan of having to share my personal space whilst eating with people I do not know.

The menu at first instance looked good, there are a fair few dishes and you have the option of requesting anything from a 1 chilli to a 20 chilli dish - I think a 20 chilli dish would require waxing of the tongue Home Simpson style so I went for a Beef Dish at level 5.

The food came out super quick, as if the kitchen staff had a precognitive vision of what I would order before I had a chance to break anything, but I would have preferred in this case to wait for something that did not look rushed or not looked like the beef had been cooked in the morning and kept on a low heat till i arrived.

So overall the experience was disappointing, the service was, once seated, quick and the waiter kept the water topped up and was polite and attentive.

Do not see myself going here in a rush any time soon unless I have a group of 20 to seat.

I&apos;m from Vancouver where Thai food is still pretty traditional.  So when in Toronto, I had to try one of their popular Thai Restaurants.  Salad King in downtown Toronto is a happening place. I went there on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  Our party of 4 had to squeeze into one of the communal tables.  Sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers really gave us a chance to see what others were eating.

The food was a little different than what I have become used to.  Instead of shared plates it seemed that everybody was ordering their own meals.  There was also some Asian fusion going on here, so I would not classify this as an authentic Thai restaurant.  As for the taste,  I like it a bit spicier and with more aroma.

Salad King is an interesting experience if you&apos;re ever in downtown Toronto and crave a little Thai food.

Maybe I haven&apos;t sampled enough food here (since I don&apos;t seem to see in it what others do), but the 3 dishes (pad thai, golden curry, and some fried rice-esque dish) I&apos;ve had from here were unfortunately disappointing.

Food did not taste authentic, and toppings were stingy. It was like the Harvey&apos;s of Thai food - you know it&apos;s nothing special, but you feel like it is compared to the other fast food options available. Nevertheless, I wouldn&apos;t compromise. Service is frazzled by the hordes of people sitting at communal tables in a large fancied-up cafeteria, where conversation is lost in the hubbub and the food is not good enough for silent contemplative enjoyment.

It&apos;s not too expensive - standard prices around $10 - but I would advise anyone who is picky about their pad thai (as I admittedly am) to venture elsewhere.

My favorite Thai food in the city. Always busy, cafeteria style eating so don&apos;t expect privacy or quiet, good prices. My go tos are hot Thai noodles, green curry chicken, hot and sour mushroom soup, mango salad, spring rolls but everything I&apos;ve tried I liked. There is a spicy scale, I love my food spicy and I get 3 or 5 chilies depending on my mood. Expect your food to come when it&apos;s ready not everyone&apos;s meals at the same time. Wish they delivered!

A few observations about Salad King.

1. Only 2 &quot;salad&quot; items on the menu. I asked the server for an explanation for the name.

2. Communal tables. 2 8-foot stainless steel tables attached lengthwise. You might be sitting with your friends, but you&apos;re also sitting with complete strangers. If you don&apos;t like people, stay away.

3. &quot;Mild&quot; doesn&apos;t exist. It&apos;s on the menu, but it&apos;s just for comic relief. If you can&apos;t stand minimal spice, don&apos;t eat here. On the other hand, no one will say Salad King is bland.

I went last night on my wife&apos;s recommendation, and it was a really fun experience, aided by some luck. I was seated next to some really fun, outgoing people, and I love that. Laughter ensued. The artwork and overall design of the restaurant is fun, modern, appealing, and edgy. I love that politically correct is not invited for dinner.

Now, about the food... again, HOT!! And I ordered my food &quot;mild&quot;. Imagine &quot;20 chilis?&quot; Just thinking about it makes my stomach, tongue, and throat burn. I ordered lemongrass soup with chicken - a dish I have enjoyed many times in other restaurants, but gave up after 2 half spoonfuls, choking, and tears. I couldn&apos;t. Thankfully, the server put me out of my misery, and my table-mates were very sweet about the incident. For a main, I had their green curry which, while still hot, was definitely edible... definitely tasty. I quite enjoyed it. To give you a taste of how spicy this meal was, my yummy Stewart&apos;s cream soda tasted nothing like what it always does.

So, Salad King, your excellent, tasty food and incredible atmosphere has made me a fan. I don&apos;t often agree with my wife, but she got this one right, and Salad King has a new fan. Yay.

Chicken Siam Noodle, 5 chilli&apos;s!!
I like the new location, much better than the old one (before it burnt down, or the building collapsed, whatever it was)
Tom Yum soup here too is dynamite.
It is fast, and the servings are big. You can get at least dinner, then next day lunch out of it.

I was here with one of my gf&apos;s a little while ago.  I&apos;ve converted her to siam noodles!  I really like that you can choose the chill rating.

I&apos;m not a big fan of spicy things ~ mostly b/c I can&apos;t stomach it.  I&apos;m a no chilis kind of girl.

The decor looks nice, I like the tables, and you totally can meet random people seated near you...since that&apos;s how they roll.

Hardly anything could be made truly vegetarian, i.e. without fish sauce or oyster sauce (even food on their &apos;vegetarian&apos; section of the menu uses fish sauce).

Service was horrible and horribly slow - no one to take orders, they will bring out a large plate but no serving spoon, no one around for water refills, etc.

I&apos;m the kind of girl who likes it fast and cheap.  Yes.  That&apos;s right.
Salad King delivers on both ends.  It&apos;s clean, bright, and busy.  The food is spot on for what you would expect.  My doors are hardly blown off, yet, my expectations are always met.  This is never a bad thing.
Without adding to the echo of multiple reviews on this place, I&apos;ll simply state that it&apos;s a fun place, worth your while if you are in the hood.  The golden curry is s favorite, alongside the chicken satay and various noodle dishes.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy.

I was a bit disappointed. The spicey beef tasted watered down. Other than being spicey it had no flavour. The one chili was very hot... The chicken dish also was one chili but not as spicy as the beef.

First things first, the pictures on the front of this listing are of the old location, so it could be confusing if you&apos;re looking for it.  The new location is across the road and north of the old location.

I used to go to that old location, and missed it during the hiatus following the partial building collapse.

The food is always pretty good, the prices are reasonable, and the portions are large.  I love the Siam noodles and the Golden/Yellow Curry is great too.  There just aren&apos;t enough Thai places in Toronto where you can buy Golden Curry.

A few cons:
- The young ladies who assign tables and call out names can seem clueless at times.  On one occasion, they insisted that we put our name on the list, although there was a table ready.  They turned around momentarily, and called our name 10 seconds later.  Even though we didn&apos;t move in that time, they looked over the crowd behind uswhile calling our name - they obviously had forgotten who we were in the 10 seconds since they greeted us.

- The spice level is inconsistent.  Tonight we had 3 dishes.  One with no chillies, one with 3 chillies, and one with 10 chillies.  The 3 chilly pepper dish was actually hotter than the 10 chilly pepper dish.

- Yes, it&apos;s very loud - and crowded.  It comes with the popularity.

Decent enough reviews on Yelp, combined with a few friends giving this place the thumbs up saw me enticed to try Salad King.

Not authentic Thai...then again I was not expecting it to be. I loved the spicy scale of add 1 - 20 chili&apos;s, I like it hot...but 20 chili&apos;s, hello stomach ulcer!

I tried the shrimp hot and sour soup...it was ok. The beef satay was peanut-y perfection. My friend had chicken won ton soup and spring rolls.

Very filling, cheap and quick. The place is clean, staff were friendly. I actually quite like the sitting at tables with other groups, school dining hall-esque feel. Kind of reminded me of eating at Wvrst.

Yes it is not the quietest of places, if you are looking for something intimate then it&apos;s not really the place to go. I just thought there was something fun about the place.

I come to Salad King once in a blue moon because I know the food isn&apos;t especially healthy, but I am always very happy with what I order and the service that comes with it.

I went in yesterday for vegetarian pad thai (which they list as phud thai; potato, potahto) with extra tofu ($1.50 extra but worth it), and received it in under 5 minutes. The spice level perfectly matched my 1 chili order. It was steaming hot and delicious, and served with a lime, fresh cilantro, chopped peanuts, and enough noodles to serve one and a half of me.

My server was fantastic, and I&apos;ve actually never had bad service here. He stopped a couple of times to make sure I had everything I needed.

I really like the atmosphere but it is definitely not suited for reading alone. It is very loud during the lunch rush because it&apos;s so popular. Even so, I have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a spot to sit. Be prepared to potentially get friendly with strangers, as the long tables mean that you could be seated next to someone you don&apos;t know. This, along with the colourful decor, is all part of the experience.

A couple of tips: If you use the basket under your seat, don&apos;t forget  what you put in there when you leave! And of course, check out the washrooms. They&apos;re pretty great.

I love Salad King!

Being a Ryerson student, I have been here many times, including before the new location opened. We are usually seated promptly- only once did we ever have to wait a long time for service. It&apos;s not fancy of course, but I have yet to order something that is not delicious. Casual atmosphere, GREAT food, especially for the price, and most importantly- fast serving speeds. Very good for lunch hour/study breaks.
Local favourite for sure!
Try the cashew nut chicken.

I have tried many Thai restaurants and find Salad King to have the tastiest food with huge portions.  For take-out, I usually order spring rolls, which are very good (sometimes greasy, but still good) and the Phud Thai with 4 chilis, even though 4 is not on the list of chili heat, but I find it to be the right amount for me.  I haven&apos;t gone to the new location on Yonge St ., but when I do, I will try other dishes that people have recommended here.  If they offered delivery, I&apos;d be ordering once a week for sure!

Not every review needs to be an academic essay.

This is place is fast, cheap, and filling. The food isn&apos;t too shabby but it won&apos;t knock your socks off.  My three friends and I left full and without complains (thats right complains).

Best part of the meal was the customization of spicy level (not unique to this restaurant)

Absolutely great Thai food for the price, very cheap and extremely fast! The Servers are personable and friendly.

The only downfall of this Salad King is the seating and the noise level. You can be seated next to several others and it can become loud and very squishy. It&apos;s very hard to get room for your jackets and coats (especially in the winter time!) There is just no room for winter gear. The cubbies underneath the seats aren&apos;t enough.

Solid steel everything. It&apos;s like eating in the Top Chef kitchen.
Nothing wrong with that, it makes everything look clean and organized which is important for any restaurant. The long communal seating is comfortable and practical, while the booth seating in the gazebo are more intimate and less industrial in nature.

Either one, taste n preference, will make for a pleasant dining experience.
I ordered the green curry. It was good, thin and soupy with the standard beef, chicken or shrimp choices. Standard trimmings.

My gf ordered the Islamic noodles which is discontinued from the current menu but was on the menu before. These are bomb. I think it&apos;s the only dish I will order going forward at Salad King. It&apos;s a curried rice vermicelli with choice of meat and a veggie medley stirred in. It&apos;s delicious.

Overall, salad king is a good casual thai restaurant. The prices are reasonable, drinks are available and it&apos;s clean. Service is also really good, so don&apos;t be afraid to ask questions, they actually answer them.

Went there with a friend who recommended it. Not the best Thai I&apos;ve had, tofu was pretty soggy. I&apos;m not sure if I got food poisoning or what, but I threw it all up the next day...
The decor was fun, but I doubt I will be going back anytime soon.

I went here last weekend first time after they moved to the new location.
I already liked them before and that didn&apos;t change after my last visit.

the place is very nicely decorated.
most of the seating area consists of communal dining tables (as it was in the previous location) but there is also a very cute separate seating area on one end of the floor with smaller tables for smaller groups (2-4ppl)

also extra note - the stools in the communal area have a basket underneat them when you can store a purse/bag/cloths. very very convenient.

the service is super fast so it&apos;s a great location to go to when you&apos;re on the run.

the food is yummy (mmm bean noodles!), the menu has lots of veg options and there are 8 levels of spiciness you can choose from (level 5 is mildly spice so go for it!)

AND they bring separate bills!

While there is a lot of good going on at Salad King I was disappointed by the food. Great atmosphere,fast service, polite staff and cheap prices. But the chicken cashew dish I ordered was drowned in a watery sauce and the chicken was chewy with no flavor. My girlfriend ordered a mango dish that tasted a lot better. This was the second time I had gone here and not enjoyed what I ordered.  I guess its hit or miss. Overall, its alright, but I wont be going back anytime soon.

Salad King&apos;s new location is really cool. It&apos;s the same set-up as before, but now upstairs and bigger. They&apos;ve got pretty awesome restrooms, too.

I&apos;ve heard that it can get really, really busy at this place. I came early with a friend and there were still a handful of people coming constantly. Most of the business probably comes from the Ryerson University students.

The part that annoyed me the most when I was there was the service. It took forever for somebody to come and take our order, or even acknowledge us. At the time I came, the restaurant wasn&apos;t even half-full, so I didn&apos;t understand why it was taking so long. However, after the order was taken, our food came relatively fast. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was delicious. If you don&apos;t have a big appetite, then I suggest sharing entrees with someone. Not-so-great service, but a good place for a tasty meal.

Restaurant: Salad King
Cuisine: Thai/Malaysian
Location: Downtown Toronto
Address: 340 Yonge St
Price Range: ~$10

1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent

Food: 4
Service: 4
Ambiance: 3
Overall: 4

Extra information:

*Big portions
*huge communal tables
*Busy at lunch crowd
*Vegetarian option Avail
*Hidden menu option

They are located close to Dundas Square on the second floor on Yonge Street and it could be easy to miss since they don&apos;t have a huge sign outside. But keep your eyes open and you will see the menu outside the door where the elevator is located.

As I am writing this review, I&apos;ve been back 3 times (at least) so far but the first time I went, it was for lunch on a Saturday. Thanksfully I went early enough so there was no wait and we got one of the few booths avail.

Ordered: PAPAYA SALAD 1/5
*Green papaya with Thai dressing for $5
*Had the best papaya salad in Thailand last summer so I was excited to see this on the menu
*When this first arrived, I was confused for a second and thought maybe they took my order wrong
*This had strips of papaya with tomato, peanut bits, dried shrimp and lime juice
*This was basically pieces of papaya drenched in lime juice
*It was just very sour with the lime juice and I couldn&apos;t taste any garlic or peanuts
*Original papaya salad should be bursting with different flavors of garlic, peanuts, fish sauce and cilantro
*They were just doing it completely wrong and I don&apos;t know if people actually enjoy this cause it was horrible
*I would never ever get this again and even if they gave it to me for free, I wouldn&apos;t eat it

Ordered: BEEF SATAY SKEWERS 3/5
*4 skewers for $5
*These are made with thin beef slices instead of beef cubes
*served with thick peanut sauce which was good but it had this weird color
*Peanut sauce was more so mustardy-mayoy than peanut butter
*Meat had good flavor but it was so thin I feel like this dish could be cheaper

Ordered: GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN 3.5/5
*Served with jasmine rice for $8.75
*Green curry had chicken, green bean, broccoli and basil
*Curry itself wasn&apos;t too creamy but it had good coconut flavor
*As I was scooping some up to have it with my rice, I found the curry to be too runny
*It came with lots of chicken pieces but near the end, I had too much curry compared to the rice

Ordered: ISLAMIC NOODLES 5/5
*This is their not so secret &apos;secret menu&apos; that was super popular when they were open at last location
*It&apos;s not on the menu, but if you ask they will make it for you (and you def want to ask for this!)
*Pad Thai noodles drenched in coconut curry for $10.50
*Came with 4-5 shrimp and chicken pieces on top
*The sauce is creamy with a bit of kick which was perfect with the noodles
*Lots of veggies (green pepper and red pepper) were on top
*I could def taste lots of spice in this particular dish
*I really enjoyed this and understand why it&apos;s one of their most popular dish

Overall there was a good service, our server was Rob who wasn&apos;t over the top friendly, but was attentive and filled up our water when needed. That&apos;s more than good enough at busy restaurants like this especially at usy lunch hour.

After my first visit, I went back couple more times and I will just include my comments about the dishes within this posting.

Ordered: MINIATURE SHRIMP ROLLS 4/5
*10 mini shrimp spring rolls for $4.50
*This is perfect as an appetizer in terms of taste, portion and price
*They are nothing special and you coulod probably get them anywhere but for $4.50, it&apos;s perfect for sharing
*It&apos;s filled with shrimp inside and goes very well with the sweet plum sauce

Ordered: THAI FRIED RICE 3/5
*Fried rice with eggs, shrimp, chicken, carrots, onions and curry sauce
*Tasted just like any other Chinese fried rice but with hint of curry
*I needed hot sauce for this dish cause it was kind of bland and dry
*It was nothing special and I probably won&apos;t get this again

Ordered: THAI BASIL NOODLE 3.5/5
*Rice noodles stir fried with veggies and shrimp with garlic, chili, shallows and dried shrimp sauce
*This was just another version of Pad Thai for me, except with the tomato-ey ketchupy taste
*Again, some basil leaf thrown on top...is it suppose to work as garnish?
*Thai food is usually known for dishes with lots of complex flavors altogether but this was very bland
*It was decent, but I much prefer the Islamic noodles I had last time

Summary: I&apos;ve been to Salad King about 3 times so far and I really do like it. Now I know what to order and what&apos;s good here. I recommend going early if you are dropping by for lunch and don&apos;t expect to have a important conversation here because it gets super loud due to their low ceiling. I recommend, Mini Shrimp Spring rolls, Beef/Chicken skewers and Islamic Noodles(yum!)

I missed this place especially when they were closed since the building collapsing/fire incident.  I find if you want cheap and good food this is the place to go.  I have brought people from out of town at this place and they are love it.

The only complaint I have is there spice-level. It seems to vary from time to time I go there and I always order a 3. The heat can reach up to a 5 at times (I know this because I used to order a 5) whenever I order a 3 and it just ruins the experience.

I usually order Golden Chicken curry and its damn good. Other Thai places doesn&apos;t do justice to this place especially for prices and portion.

It does get insanely busy and the service isn&apos;t consistent. That still doesn&apos;t deter me from going here.

I loved the Pad Thai. But I&apos;m a bit biased with that food. I like it pretty much everywhere.

The mango chicken dish was disappointing though. Cooking mango does not taste good. You&apos;re better off consuming it cold in a drink, or straight from the fridge.

The service was okay. My server had a funny tone to her voice, and walked away after I inquired about the unlisted Islamic Noodles (Pad Thai with curry sauce drenched over it, according to her). She brought the food out fast though, so props for that.

In summary, this place isn&apos;t that great, but it isn&apos;t bad. Good to go to if you&apos;re in the area, but not worth travelling a far distance just to get there.

The last time I&apos;d been to Salad King was at its old location across the street. This was a few years ago, so I was excited to check it out at its new location. It was just as packed as ever, and the service was efficient and pleasant. I also liked the communal dining style.

However, the dish I&apos;d ordered was not that good at all - I had ordered the Khao Soi which is one of my favourite Thai dishes. It had such a strong fishy taste that it totally detracted from the other flavours. I probably wouldn&apos;t go again on my own accord but tag along if someone else wanted to check it out. I&apos;d also definitely order something different - maybe the green curry because who would screw up a green curry, right?

My first time back to this restaurant after their move across the street.

Other than the new renovations, the experience was essentially the same - cafeteria style sitting, elbow to elbow with strange neighbours, a level of loudness that makes conversations largely inaudible.  I did notice an expanded seating area to better handle the crowd capacity&amp;private booths and tables in one section (so you can wait for these if you prefer this option). I have to say that for small groups of 2-4, you get seated&amp;served pretty quickly.

In terms of food, I think salad king does a pretty good job with its core dishes- by this I mean its curries, satays and pad thais. The food is well seasoned&amp;quite tasty.  I&apos;m not sure if i would call the food authentic Thai, but I think they do a good job regardless.   My only comment with regards to core dishes is that the restaurant seems to be cutting back on ingredients. I ordered the panang chicken curry and noticed that it seemed to have a lot of sauce but lacking in chicken.... Likewise, I checked out my neighbour&apos;s shrimp pad Thai and noted the obvious lack of shrimp.

As for appetizers, I think they are average at best. I didn&apos;t love the mango salad or mini shrimp rolls- mango salad was pretty dry&amp;shrimp rolls overfried.

Everything said, however, I would go back to salad king although it wouldn&apos;t be at the top of my list. Service is decent, but don&apos;t go if you expect to have an intimate conversation with your buddy. And forego ordering appetizers- its really not worth it.

I never had a chance to go to the old location, and then it burned down. It was a sad day as soooo many of my friends would rave about the mighty Salad King and how amazing their Pad Thai was.

Finally had a chance to hit up their new location the other night... There&apos;s a long trek up some flights of stairs, which makes you feel like you&apos;re hitting a night club as the crowd gets increasingly louder. We were greeted by a pleasant woman who sat us down in a nice booth location. The place was quickly filling up and everyone who arrived after us were crammed at communal tables, where couples had to sit rather close to other couples. Would not be my ideal choice of seating.

A girl dropped of some cups of water and seconds later our waiter arrived. He was super nice and ordering was a snap. Our appetizers seemed to magically appear minutes later, and our main dishes shortly followed. I had the Golden Tofu Curry and it was pretty good -- about as good as any other I&apos;ve had at Thai restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our food and the final bill was rather cheap in my mind, but the portion sizes seemed about right for that figure.

I liked the washrooms: individual unisex stalls with your own sink. Everything was automated so I didn&apos;t touch a thing really. And on this occasion they seemed to smell kind of nice.

I like Salad King. The location is not really an area I am around very often, but I think it would definitely be a top choice if I am ever in that hood and want to take someone out for a nice meal.

It&apos;s a little tricky to find but its quite nice inside. It seats a lot of people and is cafeteria style-looking. Super busy, and super fast - the energy inside is almost overwhleming.

The food is okay. I was disapointed with the tastes, flavours and quality of food because the prices aren&apos;t cheap. The entrees are priced just like any other higher end Thai place which makes it really frustrating to eat poorer quality of food here and pay their prices.

If i had nowhere else to go and was craving food - i think i would make it myself before returning here.

Went here last night with a few people.  While looking for the place, i walked by it maybe 3 times because it was a tiny location.

Once i got there, i noticed it was like a giant upscale school cafeteria.  It was very loud and the people sitting beside me were obnoxious,

We were a group of six and everyone ordered something different.

I had the spring rolls first:  these were good with the dipping sauce
my main was the Siam noodles: first off my order got lost, so while everyone else at the table had their food and were eating, i still had to wait.  My order didn&apos;t arrive until most of my party were half way done.
The food itself was really good.  It was a mix of peanut and coconut sauce-yummy.  The portion was a good size too. (i ended packing up some of it as i was the last one eating)

would i go here again, maybe.

I haven&apos;t been here in a couple years but the food is just as delicious as I remember! I ordered Siam noodles and coconut chicken soup, and my boyfriend got a chicken curry (can&apos;t remember which one).

The soup was delicious and perfectly spicy, best coconut chicken soup I&apos;ve had so far! The noodles were also amazing, though next time I will get them even spicier. The curry was also divine, just the right amount of coconut and spice. mmmm!

The service was also fast and incredibly friendly despite the place being crowded with holiday shoppers.

Definitely going back again and again!

I&apos;ve been here many times and hands down my favourite dish is the Thai Islamic noodles. It&apos;s just so good! I&apos;ve also had Pad Thai here as well as some of their curry dishes (that comes with rice). Everything they make here is delicious so you really can&apos;t go wrong.

I haven&apos;t been here in months but if not much has changed, their prices are very decent and their portions are a good size. I&apos;m sure the seating is still uncomfortable but since I&apos;m guaranteed a delicious meal, I don&apos;t mind the seating at all.

Quick note: there&apos;s storage space under the seats!

Make sure you check out this restaurant but if you want to avoid lineups, go slightly before/after the lunch/dinner rush.

Either you dislike Salad King, or you love Salad King.

The place is fairly busy, loud and usually you&apos;ll find a lot of repeat customers who will swear by this place.  There is a wide selection of food, it all tastes great.  You get to choose how spicy you want your dishes (There is even a scale meter which is always a good laugh.)

At the end of the meal, everyone is full, you don&apos;t spend a lot here to get good food.  Afterwards you can go across street to many desert restaurants near Dundas and Yonge.
