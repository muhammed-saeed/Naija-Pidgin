Tasty Thai Franchising Thai Food


After three years of incredibly detailed planning, Swedish businessman Gunnar Sjbeck and his wife Pranee are now ready to launch Tasty Thai, a unique franchise based Thai fast food concept that will compete head on with the world market players in this industry.
 01 July 2005 | news Newsdesk Gunnar Sjbeck, genial boss and brains behind Tasty Thai Restaurants Co., Ltd has spent the past three years researching and planning the launch of a new Thai restaurant chain, which will not only set new standards for Thai food world wide, but also introduce Thai food in a market segment in which Thai restaurants are today practically non-existing: the fast food market.     We are launching a global franchise with perhaps the highest standards ever set in the fast food restaurant business, Gunnar Sjbeck explains.     You can order a dish to your specific nutritional and calorific requirements and it will still come to your table in less than five minutes at any Tasty Thai outlet anywhere in the world.     Nothing has been left to chance. For three years or more we have been working on the Tasty Thai concept, with the development of food, menus, recipes, working with dieticians to get the specifications exactly right for the American and European markets.     We have been in detailed consultations with an interior designer to conceive and produce the tableware and furniture. Weve spent long hours on the signage and photography and thousands of hours with franchise experts, marketing consultants, lawyers, financial analysts both in the US and in Europe.     Along the way, Gunnar has been encouraged by the fact that his daughter in the USA is a successful franchisee of a well-known food chain there.     It was there the idea with Tasty Thai started, to do a franchise chain with a healthy and popular Thai Food, he says.     Then I had the ideal partner in my wife Pranee, who has been instrumental in the development of the menu, the selection of dishes and the recipes and she has been a tower of strength in keeping everything on target and supporting my work to conquer the world.     Like many good ideas, it sounds simple and there will be those who think that all you have to do is think of an idea and a concept, open a restaurant and go for it. I wish it was that easy, he smiles.     Tasty Thai aims to be an alternative choice for people who are looking for genuine Thai food during the rush hour. But unlike other Thai restaurants overseas, Tasty Thai will provide a variety of quality Thai dishes, at reasonable prices, in a casual dining area, in a modern Thai interior style.     To be frank, most overseas Thai restaurants offer full-table services at very high prices. Our policy is to provide genuine Thai food in a casual dining area, as an affordable and quick alternative to the huge and unpredictable variety of Thai restaurants overseas. We will do take away food too, Sjbeck adds.     We are going to be a franchise that the world will know and love, and this can not be done without real investment and genuine standards of care and attention in building the brand.     We have designed the dishes we offer using nutritional and calorie pecifications supplied by the food authorities in America and Europe because we believe todays customer just cant find healthy and fresh Oriental/Thai food with the quality, service, value, cleanliness that they have to come expect from other quick service providers.     People want more variety now, and the trend in the Western world is clearly towards more healthy food. Tasty Thai&apos;s meals are developed to match those increasing demands and all meals will have their nutritional components declared.     Tasty Thai has even developed a computer and cash register system which allows the customer to view, and print nutritional data before ordering, as well as providing the data on receipts. The system will also recommend suitable meal combinations for customers on programs such as Atkins and Weight Watchers.     Thai food has become the biggest food trend in decades. Influenced by the cuisine of neighboring India and China, Thai food combines flavors and ingredients in a way that gives it a distinct personality all of its own.     Like other Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines where meat is scarce and expensive, Thai cuisine is rice-and noodle-based. But there are still plenty of choices. Since Thailand is formed around a gulf, there are a large variety of fish dishes on our menu, he reveals.     Thai food is set apart from other Asian cuisines by the spices that supply the heat, sweetness or saltiness to the food: hot Thai peppers, Asian green basil, palm sugar, kaffir lime leaves, creamy coconut milk and galangal. Most dishes incorporate four elements: sweet, sour, salty and hot flavors.     We supply all of these key ingredients and the franchisee simply buys meat, vegetables and fish locally, Gunnar says.     Tasty Thai&apos;s head chef and key staff are certified and our master chef carries a degree from the Royal Thai School of Culinary Arts, founded in 1997, where all franchisees will be trained. By the end of 1998, this school received accreditation from the Ministry of Education.     In conjunction with the Chefs Association of Thailand and the Ministry of Labour, the school located in Bang Saen also offers a certification programme for professionals. This certification is necessary for any Thai chef wishing to work in the EC countries.     The Tasty Thais operation is simple and easy to learn because we have done all the hard work. Our Training Manager will use the Companys Successful Training Program to fully empower franchisees and their staff to run any restaurant smoothly and efficiently. And this training continues on an ongoing basis, Sjbeck explains.     We understand that the success of each single franchise is crucial to our success and we will bend over backwards to support new starts from the moment they sign a Franchise Agreement. We help select locations, negotiate a lease and open a store as well as setting up food supply-lines and executing marketing plans. We are very hands on!     I have done the research. I have visited the target countries. And we have worked very hard developing the concept leaving nothing whatsoever to chance. The menu is right, the look and the feel of the outlet is right and we honestly believe that the world needs a franchise where you can experience the food of another country, properly prepared and equally delicious wherever you are in the world.     You may call me biased but Thailand does have some of the most delicious food ever conceived and prepared. Our test runs in the US and the EU have proven that consumers there are really happy to try Thai food and most of the people we tested were immediately converted to the cause!     To inform about the concept, a website www.tasty-thai.com has been set up, where Gunnar Sjbeck is currently looking for a Master Franchise Licensees for Europe.     Gunnar Sjbeck is not bothered by the recent news in local Thai newspapers, that the government - under its Kitchen of the World project - is determined to put Thai cuisine at the forefront of world cuisines by sponsoring the development of restaurants around the world and training chefs to staff this growing empire.     The idea is that the mighty new chain of government-sponsored restaurants will generate valuable foreign currency as they buy their ingredients from Thailand and repatriate their accumulated profits to banks in Bangkok.     Whether or not this latest initiative will ever fly, Gunnar Sjbeck does not care. He knows how big a job this is and so far he is the only person who has actually put his money where everyone elses mouths are and put a plan into action which will almost certainly put Thai food on the lips and in the mouths of the world within the next five years beginning this year! Pranee,Gunnar Sjbecks wife, worked hard on the menu development. Pranee has been selecting dishes and recipes to guarantee the genuine Thai taste. Tom Yam Kung (top) and SomTum (down) are some of dishes onTasty Thais menu available at a reasonable price and served fast.
