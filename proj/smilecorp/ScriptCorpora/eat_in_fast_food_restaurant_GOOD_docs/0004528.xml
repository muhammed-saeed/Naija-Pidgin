Great Quesadillas.  My friend Mary works here, so if you stop in tell her Carrie says howdy!

Their mexican gumbo is also really good and they are located right off I-70 at exit 116, the closest fast food restaurant - you&apos;ll have to drive into town about 2 miles or so for anthing fast.

If you&apos;re like me and love burritos like those offered at Chipotle and Illegal Pete&apos;s, but you haven&apos;t found that delicious Queso or Ancho Chile BBQ burrito you&apos;ve always known in your dreams you&apos;d like to have, then you must stop in here at Qdoba Mexican Grill.  It&apos;s not far off I-70 at all and you&apos;ll leave very full and satisfied for an average price of only around $8!  This is always where I stop when heading to the western slope, it&apos;s my staple long-haul stop!

Qdoba is the biggest overpriced crap hole you will ever eat at. If you grew up in soCal eating actual Mex run from this place or expect to pay 6$ for a bean and cheese burrito.
