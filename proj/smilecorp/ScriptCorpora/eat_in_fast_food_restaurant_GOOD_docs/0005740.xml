 Barbados 
 restaurants and dining 
 You 
 can imagine that even on an island the size of Barbados 
 there is a wide variety of places to dine and prices vary 
 enormously - from the infamous and pricey restaurant &apos;The 
 Cliff&apos; on the West Coast of Barbados to the cheap dining 
 venue (and an authentic Bajan experience not to be missed 
 on a Friday night!) - the Fish Fry at Oistins!

 Barbados site!

 Prices 
 
 As with anywhere its up to you how inexpensively (or expensively 
 !) you wish to dine. Barbados has something for everyone. 
 Prices will be given in Barbados Dollars (BD$1.98 
 is always US$1) They are usually subject to 15% VAT 
 although this is often included in listed prices. 

 Some establishments have a no smoking policy so please inquire before you 
 dine (you will find that there is a very low percentage 
 of Bajans who smoke tobacco). Most Barbados restaurants 
 will accept travellers cheques but take your passport. 
 You may need to make reservations during the Winter 
 months (this is High Season) 
 
 
 
     
 
 Fast Food 

 

 Barbados is apparently one of the only places in the world where 
 McDonalds were not successful! 

 Chefette / Barbeque Barn and KFC are the most popular fast food joints 
 on the island. 

 There are a variety of pizza places although Chefette also offers excellent 
 value for money!
Most offer free delivery - including KFC.

 twelve restaurant locations island-wide. In essence, 
 these drive-thrus are strategically located on the 
 island and within easy reach of our customers. Today, 
 the drive-thru concept is mainly utilised for convenience 
 - the convenience of being served in record time. 
Late night movers and partygoers can eat late on weekends 
 at our Rockley and Warrens drive-thrus, which are 
 open until 3 a.m. 

 Chefette 
 always strives to ensure that customers get a perfect 
 product in a timely manner every time a drive-thru 
 facility is used, and thus achieve the goal of total 
 customer satisfaction. 

 

 
 
 Barbecue 
 Barn 

 

 Chefette 
 Barbecue Barn offers fast casual dining at affordable

 This

 special occasion. Chefette boasts three (3) Barbecue 
 Barns - Rockley is located opposite 
 the popular Accra Beach , on the South 
 Coast in Christ Church. Holetown is located on the West Coast facing the beautiful 
 Caribbean Sea, and Warrens is located 
 just outside the City, on the busy Highway 2A, in 
 St. Michael.
 Each Barbecue Barn has its own unique ambiance.

 

 The 
 Barns are ideally the perfect place for healthy lifestyle 
 living. They are equipped with Self-Service Deluxe 
 Salad Bars, offering crisp, fresh vegetables, soups 
 and pasta salads, and much more, for those who prefer 
 a lighter meal. Definitely a vegetarian&apos;s haven. All 
 of our mouthwatering super cuts of Steak, Chicken,

 Bombas 
 Beach Bar
Paynes Bay St James Barbados 

 
 
 Situated 
 midway between Sandy Lane and Tamarind Cove Hotels on 
 the West Coast of Barbados is one of the most beautiful 
 beaches on the island, Paynes Bay - a long stretch of 
 wide golden sand with clear calm turquoise water perfect 
 for swimming. The beach is quiet and unspoiled where 
 you can truly get away from the crowds. There is a safe 
 swim area with beach loungers and sun umbrellas for 
 rent. 

 Nestled 
 at the centre of this tranquil bay is Bombas - a rustic 
 little Beach Bar and Restaurant with wooden decking 
 out on to the sand under the shade of majestic palm 
 trees. Owner operated by Gay, a Scottish chef from Dundee, 
 and Wayne, a local Barbadian, Bombas is a popular al 
 fresco eating spot for both Bajans and tourists.

Gay is normally hidden away in the kitchen creating 
 her exciting daily specials which include SE Asian curries 
 (inspired by her travels), tasty pasta sauces using 
 fresh herbs from her own garden, and exciting vegetarian 
 dishes which tempt even&quot;carnivores&quot;!!! Bombas&apos; 
 menu also includes local chicken&amp;fish dishes, 
 beach style grilled snacks like the&quot;Bombaburger&quot;and a special menu for children.


Bombas is the perfect place to spend the day either 
 lazing on the beach or taking part in a variety of available 
 watersports. Sunsets are spectacular and Bombas is a 
 favourite spot to sit and observe the perfect day slip 
 away while sipping a romantic cocktail. Evening relaxes 
 into candlelit dining under the spotlit splendour of 
 the palm trees.

 The 
 buffets offer the widest array of Bajan food you will 
 find anywhere in Barbados, and their daily menus are 
 a wonderful blend of traditional dishes prepared with 
 contemporary style and new Bajan cuisine. 

 The 
 120-seat restaurant is an institution in Barbados, where, 
 particularly on Sundays, many Bajans, from Prime Ministers 
 to office workers, have made the journey to this one 
 place which has remained faithful to the island&apos;s culinary 
 heritage. 

 
This also provides a rather unique opportunity for the 
 visitor to interact with the local community.
