Review is for the food only -
I was extremely pleased with my choice to get a personal sized salad here. Choosing between &quot;Personal&quot; v. &quot;Classic&quot; sizes had me a little worried if I would be full but personal was more than enough. I got the sweet potato lentil salad with smoked salmon added and it was super delicious. A little pricey but I thought the quality was worth it.
Dined with some friends and they all ordered sandwiches and seemed to enjoy as well. Personal means you just get half a sandwich though so I&apos;m not sure how great of a deal that is.

I&apos;m a coffee snob and the lattes and espresso are very good here. They also sell all sorts of baked goods, sandwiches and breakfast stuffs. Classy place with plenty of seating areas, including a second floor and rooftop patio.

Very chill location with comfy couches. I could have stayed here for several hours. It&apos;s close to all the action of the upper west as well.

Friendly staff.

Good:
There is a lot of comfortable seating (comfy couches, sofas, chairs) and there is also outside seating.
The prices are reasonable.

Bad:
The service isn&apos;t great (not friendly and things move pretty slow).
Wasn&apos;t a fan of the espresso; it tasted like milk with a tiny hint of espresso (possibly a hint of burnt beans?). Maybe the coffee is better?

All in all, not a place I see myself coming back to...

I have only had the chai latte and an iced coffee here. The chai was unique, but I didn&apos;t like the hint of what tasted almost like baby powder.. I am clearly not a spice expert so take that as you will. Iced coffee was fine. I like this place for having wifi an plenty of seats. Nice place to sit down and study, especially upstairs if you can nab a seat.

At $3.25, for a large size, their Iced Americano was not too shabby.

Ordering sucks, especially if you get behind people ordering food.

Drinks came out quickly and topped with a mini aroma chocolate bar.

There is tons of seating and they offer free WiFi. I didn&apos;t see any outlets though in the downstairs area. We sat at the bar counter which was lacking purse hooks but  I&apos;ll let that slide as they didn&apos;t mind that we were snacking on our Levain Bakery cookies at their counter.

It&apos;s a chain coffee place. It&apos;s brighter and has much more seating than any Starbucks i&apos;ve ever been to and they also have free wifi.

The coffee is bland and the food is expensive but comes in large portions.

If you&apos;re in the UWS it&apos;s a good place to come in and relax for a bit and maybe grab a bite to eat.

Just came back from lunch in that place.
Nice clean and quite place.This is a place you can just sit down with your cup of Aroma Coffee and relax from the your crazy New Yorker routine.
I highly recommend the chicken salad- fresh tasty vegetables with slices of chicken breasts although i wont mind getting some more chicken and less veggies.

I needed a place to study. These days it seems like all I do is read article after article on tuberculosis. Sigh. FML.

I came here to finish up some work and to just relax a bit before going to yoga class. The place is very clean and sleek. Nice red chairs that look great against white tables and white walls.

I knew this coffee shop wasn&apos;t an American creation, so I went to their website and learnt that this is a chain in Israel. Aha! I was right!

It was extremely warm out so I opted for an iced coffee, which came to less than $3. Not too bad, as Starbucks would charge you an arm and a leg for burnt coffee.

I sat a communal table and happily drank my iced coffee and read my articles. It was a fun place to just unwind. A great spot to meet up with friends and just catch up over a cup of joe.

This is a great place to get work done:
- Free Wifi
- Lots of seating

Seating  includes long tables with comfy chairs, a bar to sit at, a second floor including couches AND a cute outdoor space with tables with umbrellas.

I give them three stars because the coffee is not worth the price. I got a soy latte, and it was pretty bitter and almost five bucks.

They do get bonus points for using real mugs and including a &quot;complimentary&quot; piece of chocolate.

If you are in the UWS and are looking for a place to relax and use Wifi but are trying to avoid Starbucks, I recommend this place.

Aroma.. It looks like a different option from Starbucks... Ordered the mocha... blended with real chocolate and steam milk.. Unlike local coffee shop.. It doesn&apos;t have the &quot;art&quot; that comes with it.. well.. it&apos;s ok.. The mocha is a little too sweet...

The staff was friendly and the service was ok... This is a great place if you wanna do your work.. Free wifi and lots of place for you to sit.. You can have some snack, lunch, or breakfast since they open till pretty late...

The coffee is not that bad... I will give 3.5 stars... I really like the environment here... the chocolate is a little too sweet.. overall.. I will definitely return here if I want free wifi.. it&apos;s definitely better than starbucks since it&apos;s not so crowded...

Went for breakfast with two other people and was warned by one (a regular) that while the food is good, the menu and staff are often unorganized.

Well, we found just that to be true.  The little placards indicating what was what in the case were actually incorrect.  After selling out of certain pastries, apparently a staff person had just stuck the placards into something else.

The food and drinks were good, however.  We enjoyed an almond croissant and I had a latte.  We would probably go back thanks to its proximity to our friends.

I was initially going to give this place 3 stars but I woke up this morning really craving the lemon seed poppy muffin I got here.  And so with that craving, I definitely had to bump it up to four stars.

Frankly, my review probably won&apos;t help much except to just suggest the lemon seed poppy muffin and that muffin was the only thing I got here.

The reason why I was going to give it 3 stars is because, as a friend mentioned, this place had a quick paced atmosphere.  Too sterile and not homey looking.  Looked more like something that should be located around Penn Station than the Upper West Side.

But that lemon seed poppy muffin, Mhmm, Mhmm, Mhmm.

The salads are always fresh here but it&apos;s pricey. The staff is terrible, depending on what time you go. The other night the cashier was so obnoxious I almost told him to &quot;shut up and just put in my order&quot;. The cashiers were behaving like disobedient high schoolers, shouting and literally throwing things at each other (in front of customers!!). I come here for the salads and iced coffee, but most of the time I dread dealing with the staff. They are extremely incompetent.

Free WiFi, good coffee, and ample space = great study spot! Not exactly a quiet place, with the servers constantly announcing orders over a PA system, but if you can just tuck that into the background noise you&apos;re golden! It&apos;s got a buzzing atmosphere that isn&apos;t loud or overwhelming, and you can definitely still get lost in your own world in a book, doing work, etc. Upstairs seating is a little harder to find, but people are moving in and out constantly, so the hunt is never long.

My chai was too sweet--I ended up drinking some and adding milk twice. This wasn&apos;t actually a problem, though, because they serve their drinks so hot my chai was just the right temp after adding some milk! They have yummy looking soups and sandwiches, and give each person a small chocolate piece with each drink!

Will definitely be back to catch up with friends or on some good reading.

Coffee and a bar? People are getting so crafty these days. Anyway, I came here to study so I didn&apos;t even look at the beer selection. Because we all know beer and studying don&apos;t go well together. Trust me.

I ordered their fagioli soup. It came with free bread + butter. Their soup was a bit salty, but I loved their multi-grain bread. So fresh.

Aroma gets brownie points for giving out samples. They gave me chocolate and my friend freshly baked gingerbread cookies. :)

They have plenty of seats and outlets for the studious students. But with their music and people talking in the evening, I&apos;d only come here if I just had to do low-concentration work. Not ideal if you have a comprehensive 21 chapter final to study for.

For coffee this is a good as it gets for UWS.  Pity.  They have a hard time keeping the awesome baristas and the bad baristas just don&apos;t have a clue.  They may need to take better care of them.

Try the frozen coffee drinks, awesome.  And the rugelach is divine when you get it fresh from the oven.

Coffee was average. Croissant wasn&apos;t that special. Decor was good. Service was shit. It doesn&apos;t hurt to smile.

There is plenty of space to sit but it is a bit of a depressing mood as people generally come here to study or work on their own so there is not even light-hearted chit chat. It wouldn&apos;t have been too bad if the free tables has actually been cleaned up also.

Spent a very productive Saturday afternoon here recently. I had a mug of the mocha coffee -- very delicious, perfect for people who love chocolate and/or need their coffee diluted with lots of sugar for about $4.50. Comes with a small piece of chocolate candy.

Pretty full with people, but didn&apos;t have a problem finding seating. On the ground floor, there are multiple sets of long tables where people were eating food or had their laptops set up. Upstairs, there were couches and small tables as well as an outdoor area with tables and umbrellas. The guy has a microphone that projects upstairs when he calls out orders.

The other coffee shops (like Starbucks) in the immediate area are pretty small, so I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be back again soon!

This is my favorite expresso bar! The food is ridiculously good, healthy, and fresh! I&apos;ve had the following....

Warm chicken salad topped with chopped peanuts
Mozzarella beet salad
Garbanzo salad

I&apos;ve also tried their soups and sandwiches. I try to stay away from their pastries but I have to admit that they look quite delicious. One of these days I may just give in! The coffee is also quite good. I also recently tried the sunny side eggs nestled right on top of a rich red pepper sauce which is served with fresh baked bread and tahini sauce. It was delicious! I have never been disappointed with the food here.

Besides the great food its a great place to study or get work done. You can bring your laptop which they seem to have plenty of outlets for. You can sit there for hours and no one will tell you anything. They have a mini outdoor area which is quite nice when the weather is right.

This place has hands down one of the best salads in NYC. The service is a little spotty and the food takes a while but you its fresh and their actually taking the time make it so its all good with me. Overall, great place! You MUST try their salad! You WILL not be disappointed!

I love this place. Great service, great coffee and the food is healthy and delicious. I personally like the chicken salad/sandwich, warm garbanzo salad or the shakshuka. Pastries here are great too (half off after 9 pm) especially the rugelach and chocolate almond croissant.
They just made their wifi free so it&apos;s great to work there, too (they have a lot of outlets upstairs) if you can get a table, it gets crowded on the weekends.

I went here last week to quickly meet a colleague over coffee, and wasn&apos;t expecting much.  I ordered the latte and it was literally the BEST cup of coffee I&apos;ve ever tasted in my life - it was creamy, sweet&amp;perfect. I don&apos;t get to NYC much and have literally been thinking about that latte every day since!

This chain, with the closest one to me in Harlem is at 72nd Street, is a nice little area for simply escaping the summer heat and getting a nice read in while you&apos;re waiting for an hour or two to pass.

Pros:
-They have nice, big couches to st on with great arm rests for their drinks!
-They actually have a nice, hidden outdoor space on the top floor, which is very relaxing!
-They give you a piece of their signature chocolate with everything they over (which is pretty darn good).

Cons:
-Not a lot of scrumptious baked goods here, so it&apos;s not for the bakery-lovers like myself.
-Staff service is only so-so, bordering on not-good. Wouldn&apos;t tip them.
-The coffee is good, but not great. The Chai is the same.

Really, the space makes up for the lacklusterness in everything else, but it&apos;s not enough to make me travel 40ish blocks to go to.

This is the first time in a very long while I&apos;ve experienced anything close to this, and I&apos;ll just say I will be very careful in selecting my words for this review.

It was about 10am, not so busy on a Monday morning, post-commuter rush time.   A girlfriend and I popped in for breakfast after a run.  From beginning to end, to my shell-shocked surprise there was just a stark difference in the manner in which my friend and I were treated.

I ordered first to a flat-affected cashier who made zero eye contact, and whose only interest was to expedite my order.  Even asking politely a question about the menu, I was answered brusquely as if I were a nuisance.  I received my food, not after being called but being told flatly, &apos;here, you can take that.&apos;  the other staff then haphazardly pushed the corner of the tray towards me.

my girl friend, on the other hand was treated with the same respect and normal service anyone might expect at any other establishment in civilized north america.

I&apos;d like to be slow to jump to any conclusions, but I sincerely hope this very large discrepancy in treatment was just because shes hotter than i am.

Needless to say, if I could give this place zero stars, it would be so.

This is the perfect spot to meet up with some friends if you all are going to be trickling at at different times. You order at the counter, take a seat in one of the many different seating options (bar stools, communal tables, patio seating upstairs, or indoor couch/lounge area upstairs)

The menu looks fantastic, though some items are a bit pricey. There are tons of options, from breakfast eggs or oatmeal to sandwich/soup/salad lunches. I did not order food, but my friend loved his $10 Caesar salad. I had an iced Chai latte, which was heavy on the latte part (a lot like spiced milk), but I enjoyed it.

They offer internet with purchase, so be sure to ask for an internet receipt if you want to enjoy wifi with your food or drink.

This is the most spacious location I have found for any cafe in my neighborhood, so it&apos;s advantageous when you need to just sit down for a while.

Worst service I&apos;ve experienced in quite a while. It took 20 minutes for them to make a small sized Grilled Chicken Salad, and about 4 orders came up that were placed after me.
The only reason I&apos;m giving them two stars is because the salad was fine, and the outdoor space is great....although beware of the dangerous ledge if you do go on the patio....quite hazardous if you ask me.
I still won&apos;t be rushing back anytime soon because of the staff. Horrible.

In a never ending search for the &quot;perfect&quot; study spot in the city, I decided to give Aroma a try. Just when I thought I&apos;d found it - delicious foamy cappuccinos, lots of study space, natural light, free wifi - I realized that their &quot;free wifi&quot; didn&apos;t work. After reading yelp reviews AND asking the cashier before ordering, I turned on my computer and couldn&apos;t connect ... and was then met with shrugs by the staff who all told me that the Internet hadn&apos;t been working all morning (despite telling me otherwise when I ordered) / they&apos;d been having problems the past few days. I completely understand internet woes, but why not tell me first?!? I spent a considerable amount of time restarting my computer / trying all other options per the recommendations of the only barista who seemed to care, but no luck. At this point, I had wasted an hour - and $5 for a small cappuccino - and didn&apos;t have any work to show for it. When I thanked the staff for their help in trying to fix my computer and said that  I was incredibly disappointed in the experience, they didn&apos;t offer any incentive to return nor did they even apologize. Just more shrugs. Such a shame because otherwise I loved Aroma. But without internet, I have no reason to return.

.... but sadly still thinking about that cappuccino and the perfect ratio of espresso to cloud-like soy foam ...

Starbucks this place is not.  In a way, that&apos;s good.  Prices are certainly higher here, but you are getting better quality food and beverages too.  Plus this place is super cute and uber-trendy.  The music selection is awesome (I walked up to the counter listening to &quot;Safety Dance&quot; by Men W/o Hats).

But in a way it&apos;s bad.  Don&apos;t come in here expecting to get free bandwidth.  Sure, it keeps the &quot;let&apos;s hang out all day and not buy a damn thing&quot; element out.  And I&apos;ve said before, I&apos;ll gladly buy an overpriced cup of coffee for WiFi.  And you get a login/password for an hour.  I think that&apos;s fair.

I bought my mocha coffee...Wow, is that PURE CHOCOLATE (it is) mixed in with steamed milk and espresso?  Why, yes.  Yes it is.  And it&apos;s beautiful.  Imagine melting down pure Hershey kisses...that&apos;s what it&apos;s like drinking this thing.

I&apos;ve been here for a breakfast meeting in the past too.  I had a lovely chocolate croissant this one time.  Now it&apos;s not Pain Quotidien quality...but they heat it up for you AND give you a free piece of their Aroma chocolate.  Oh.  Yes.  That is the stuff there.

My gripe?  Don&apos;t offer &quot;Free&quot; WiFi(which let&apos;s face it, you are purchasing something for that &quot;free&quot; thing) for an hour when you get a good EIGHT MINUTES USAGE.  Yes, that&apos;s right I COUNTED!!!  I don&apos;t expect the schmoes behind the counter to be able to help me, except give me another user name and password but by then, I was simply aggravated.

I had to deal with the &quot;S&quot; word that day: &quot;Starbucks,&quot; and I was none too happy.  But I like Aroma, I like their establishment, I like their products.  But I know that if I want to get out of the house and do some writing or job searches, it won&apos;t be here.  Pity. You would have gotten some business from me.

Um, outdoor back patio thing with tons of chairs and tables featuring umbrellas on those reeeally hot days? Awesome.

Tons of chairs and seating both upstairs and downstairs? Also awesome.

A well made latte + complimentary espresso chocolate bar? Truly awesome.

The only reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star review is because it is more expensive here than other places. I would never order food when I can find a slice of pizza for $2.50 anywhere else on the block. But, in the case of atmosphere, seating, and good coffee, you get what you pay for and it is worth it here! (at least, at this location...I don&apos;t think I&apos;d even try to brave the SoHo location because, well, it&apos;s SoHo and who wants to go there?)

Misleading in the heading section of Yelp to have that the internet here is free.  Internet is NOT free.

Got a drink, sat down, and then found our I needed to pay for the internet.

I really want to like this place but every time I come, something new manages to irritate me. They&apos;re going for the chic retro look with cute red leather seats, a fashionable interior, which I originally loved but I now find super annoying. The staff is very loud- and whatever they&apos;re doing- it shouldn&apos;t require that much noise. Why does it feel like they&apos;re always grinding beans? You should have them pre-ground so we don&apos;t have to endure the hellish sound. Next- it&apos;s becoming more and more touristy. And the music choice is tasteless milquetoast pop techno anthems- Maroon 5, Kings of Leon, Madonna remixes...etc. At least have some jazz on. It&apos;s a coffee bar for God&apos;s sake. Vary it up a little.

Vegan Review (kind of)

This place looks like a Greek Diner and an Urban Burger King adopted a Coffee Shop and it has just begun growing into a young adult coffee shop. Something about this place just doesn&apos;t totally fit or make sense, but it works. Are you a coffee shop or restaurant? Not sure, Manhattan needs you as there just aren&apos;t enough coffee shop internet places with tons of space (this place has TONS!)

That being said I&apos;ve been here for 2 hours, sipping on a delicious iced coffee, cruising the internet, catching up on Yelp Reviews and Fantasy Baseball, and done so without hassle to get up and buy something or move along.

The coffee has been very satisfying (would have liked to seen if it was fair trade or not), the internet is strong even outside.

They have a Vegan Portobello Sandwich with Vegan Pesto, which is exciting.

3 Stars for space, outside seating, internet, good coffee, and at least one vegan option. -2 stars for odd decor and fast food feel.

(I&apos;ve decided to include whether or not I notice bathrooms have the XCELERATOR, you know the turbo air hand drying device, because I freakin love those things. They make my hands feel like a dog with it&apos;s head outside the window just loving life).

Has XCELERATOR

Apparently does beer and wine at night

Yes, totally overpriced for what it is (welcome to Manhattan!), but how many coffee shops have this kind of ambiance, two floors, booze, and a roof deck?

Fantastic spot to meet with friends and grab a java - bring a coat when it&apos;s cold, get a hot cup of coffee, and chat out on the roof for hours.  Plenty of couches on the second floor - perfect for hanging out or getting some work done (+ free wifi).

The ice aroma is delish and all the drinks come with a complimentary chocolate piece.  Sandwiches are consistently pretty good and you can order a half-sandwich size if you&apos;re not that hungry.

After hearing rave reviews from my co-workers I decided to order some lunch from here. Was told an hour wait for delivery, which after the reviews, I was willing to do. An hour and 20 min. go by, call to see if order had left yet, the man I spoke with had no clue which orders the delivery guy had taken out yet, proceeded to tell me it would be about 10 min. Ok. Now an hour and 45min. call back again, where&apos;s my order? Spoke with a woman, not sure, will resend a 2nd order now. Done. Got the order 10 min later. Finally! Open bag, wrong cookies. No dressing for salad. No napkins. No utensils. Sandwich soggy, 2 coffees instead of 1 cappucino. AHH! Call back, express my frustration. &quot;We will send you some Money back as well as dressing + correct cookies&quot;. Delivery guy comes- no $$. Just stale cookies + 1 small cup of dressing. On the brightside, the Delivery guy was nice :)

Well, the staff was friendly...
EXTREMELY LONG wait for a simple cappuccino, which ended up being the worst cappuccino I&apos;ve ever had. I have no intentions to return.
