Situation Analysis
 
The Sub Shop is a QSR, that resides somewhere between a fast food restaurant (FFR) and a sit down restaurant. This category is growing quickly, as people adjust to paying a little more than they would for typical fast food. While the differentiation between QSR&apos;s and traditional fast food may be transparent to most consumers, there has been a conscious shift in purchasing towards FFRs and QSRs that provide innovative menus and a selection of custom, or customizable menu items.

McDonald&apos;s new &quot;All American Burger TM &quot; is an example of the shift towards traditional, homemade-style menu items. The burger is much like what you would find at a traditional sit-down restaurant, yet for half the price. All FFRs and QSRs offer some level of food customization as well. Burger King promises to make you lunch &quot;Your Way. TM &quot; This has been a point of differentiation for Burger King in the past, yet has become less advantageous to them as other FFRs have promised product customization.

Ashland is a young market for QSRs. FFRs have left their mark on the town, yet the choices remain limited to the major national chains. The Sub Shop will will bring new lunch choices to the Ashland market.

Market Summary

The market consists of tourists, downtown workers, and students from Southern Oregon University. Over 362,000 tourists visit Ashland each year - 100,000 for the Shakespearean Festival and 262,000 for other recreational/shopping activities. Tourists make up the largest segment of our target market, at about 85% of the total market for our products.

There are about 18,000 people living and working in Ashland. If just 15% of those people buy The Sub Shop sandwiches twice a month, the company will sell 65,000 sandwiches to that market alone in 2001. Add that amount to 20% of all tourists to the Ashland area, and those two segments alone will buy 138,000 meals.

In addition, demographics have shifted in recent years from traditional households (two parents with children) to more non-traditional households; as a result, many adults feel they have less free time. Consumers report that they are eating out more often in order to free up time normally spent cooking, and use that time to enjoy their families and to take advantage of other leisure activities.

 From the Ashland Chamber of Commerce: 

Ashland (pop. 18,560) has built its economy on a resource base of timber, favorable climate, attractive landscape, cultural attractions, a well educated labor force and education. In addition, Ashland&apos;s location off Interstate 5 and the Southern Pacific Railroad, and its proximity to the Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport, give it market access that is more favorable than usual for a rural town.

To offset the risk that comes with dependence on one economic sector, the City of Ashland and the Chamber of Commerce encourage the diversification of markets. Establishment of light manufacturing firms with value-added components, sophisticated services catering to a geographically dispersed clientele, and retailing targeted to local residents are especially encouraged. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival attracts more than 100,000 visitors annually. And because Ashland is considered a &quot;destination&quot; city, an additional 258,427 people visit here for its other attractions such as recreation, shopping and sightseeing.

Ashland, while widely known for the nine-month Shakespeare Festival, is also the location of the only federally funded wildlife forensics lab and research facility in the country. Southern Oregon University plays a large part in Ashland&apos;s economic health, with approximately 5,130 students, 576 faculty, 207 staff, 26 temps and 691 student employees.

The City of Ashland&apos;s population over the last four years has averaged 1.4% growth and is not expected to deviate from that rate. The City of Ashland&apos;s &quot;official population projections&quot; show a 19,995 population projection for the year 2,005. Over the 10-year period 1995-2005, a total of 2,010 new residents to Ashland are expected. The City of Ashland&apos;s average household size is 2.22 (1990) persons per unit compared to the average household size of 2.34 in 1980.
