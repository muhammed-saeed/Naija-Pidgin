Toddler finds cannabis in fast food restaurant nappy changing area

 : 87-year-old man nabbed with $2.9 million worth of cocaine : Police arrest man who burned more then 100 cars 
 

A mother is furious after she realised her toddler was eating a piece of cannabis found in a KFC nappy changing area in Newbury, UK.

Stacey Rush was changing her daughter Lily&apos;s nappy when she noticed the baby was eating something.

The 17-month-old had found a piece of cannabis mixed with tobacco that someone had left on the baby changing platform.

Stacey told the Daily Mail : &quot;I didn&apos;t spot it but then I saw Lily had something in her mouth. When I realised it was cannabis I felt sick.

&quot;It was all over the floor mixed with tobacco. What if she had swallowed it?&quot;

Public toilets are reportedly popular places for users to prepare their cannabis away from other people.

&quot;Goodness knows who left it there - it&apos;s horrifying and sickening to think a mum had been in there rolling a joint while they changed their baby&apos;s nappy.&quot;

The 24-year-old mother of two complained to the KFC manager but wasn&apos;t happy with his response.

&quot;He said it happens all the time and there was nothing he could do,&quot; she said.

&quot;But if you knew someone was taking drugs in your toilet, you&apos;d do something about it.

&quot;There was no apology. All they did is offer a Fruit Shoot to wash the cannabis out of her mouth.&quot;

Since the incident, KFC management have issued a statement about the incident.

They said: &quot;We were shocked to hear of this incident, and have spoken with Miss Rush to apologise for her experience.

&quot;We take hygiene very seriously in all of our stores, and our toilets are cleaned every half an hour.

&quot;We are currently investigating the substance to determine what it was, and have reminded staff at our Newbury restaurant to be extra-vigilant in the future.&quot;

Regardless, Stacey&apos;s visits to KFC are over.

&quot;It doesn&apos;t say much for their standards if someone can wander into a baby changing area and smoke a joint without any of the staff noticing.
&quot;I won&apos;t go there again.&quot;
