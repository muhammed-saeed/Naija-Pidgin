Disposable Coffee Cups
 
Everyone is trying to save the planet, which is a very good thing. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll all look back at some point and say, &quot;Wow, and we thought that was enough?&quot; but for now it&apos;s just good to see that &quot;going green&quot; has become a commonly accepted goal of both individual people and businesses. Because of this, some of the most basic items in every business are being reconsidered. Even those that are only interested in saving money are now looking at things differently now that the greener option may also be the cheaper one. Let&apos;s take a look at disposable coffee cups, and see why people even still consider them.

Why Do Fast Food Restaurants Still Use Disposable Coffee Cups?
 
Disposable coffee cups, for the most part, are purchased by only a few types of businesses: restaurants and, in some cases, offices. When it comes to a fast food restaurant, there&apos;s not much of a choice. Since they can&apos;t expect customers to return coffee cups, they have to give them the product in a container that is expected to be tossed. Unless someone develops a really innovative solution, fast food restaurants will have to continue to operate this way, creating a constant demand for the disposable coffee cup.

 
Sit-Down Restaurants Could Go Greener
 
In sit-down restaurants, however, the main reason they are still used is due to cost. In many ways, this may be a false savings. The price may be cheaper up front, but you&apos;re paying for those disposable coffee cups over and over again where you could, instead, be washing and re-using. However, this would also involve paying someone to wash those coffee cups. Would it be worth it in the end? I suppose that depends on a lot of factors, such as how much you pay your dishwasher, if you use a dish washing machine, and just how much those disposable coffee cups cost you. There&apos;s no doubt, however, that doing away with the disposable cups would be better for the environment.

Offices That Can Expect Visitors Have Few Choices
 
Many offices offer free coffee as a courtesy to their customers. The issue here isn&apos;t unlike the issues with fast food restaurants. Can clients truly be expected to provide cups of their own? With a lobby, though, there is a very simple solution, though some people won&apos;t like it. This coffee is free, after all, so there really is no financial reason to provide coffee anyway, which means clients should be happy to bring their own cups. More than likely, though, people would get offended, even if you did advise them that you were removing disposable cups to cut down on waste.

 
No Excuse For Offices That Have No Visitors
 
Some offices who don&apos;t see many, or any visitors, still provide disposable coffee cups. This is not only expensive, but it&apos;s also wasteful. Modern offices, especially those where employees have their own desks, can certainly expect employees to have cups of their own and, if the company is feeling generous, they can always hand out coffee cups with a company logo, or something else of interest to their employees. In this case, the cost savings would come quite quickly as disposable coffee cups are never ordered again.
