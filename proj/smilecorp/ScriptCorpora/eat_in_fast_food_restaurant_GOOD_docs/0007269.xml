How to Get and Use IHOP Coupons?
 
People who like to eat out and have a breakfast on the go will appreciate an IHOP. This fast food restaurant chain specializes in breakfast items but is reaching for other areas as well.

If you&apos;re one of those people who likes to have a breakfast before work then I think you&apos;ll make good use of some of this information.







A fast food restaurant is a really comfortable and quick way of having something to eat on the go. Some people choose McDonalds , others prefer Subway for some supposedly more healthy sandwiches, but there are many other chains catering for specific areas.




IHOP is an USA based fast food franchise chain mainly dealing with breakfast items and pancakes in particular, but lately they&apos;ve been trying to find other markets and started to offer dinner and lunch.

IHOP is short for International House of Pancakes, and has been in business since 1958. Most of its restaurants are franchised, but there are eleven company owned sites to date. Total count is near 1400. While the company uses IHOP as a main name, the longer version is in use as a secondary option as well.




The international is derived from the selection of pancakes and waffles they offer. There are German, Swedish and French style crepes and Belgian style waffles. Other than its menu the company doesn&apos;t open many restaurants abroad. There are a few places in Canada and in bigger Mexican cities.




Coupons and vouchers are a popular way for restaurant and fast food chains to promote their offers and to achieve better brand recognition in general. These coupons are usually tied to a particular offer or there is a minimum purchase required. There are special offers unique to a particular restaurant.






 
Since 99% of all restaurants are owned by individuals under franchise license participation in an offer or promotion is up to the management, it&apos;s advised to check with the IHOP in your area before trying to redeem a coupon.




According to the company their vouchers are most often distributed through glossy additions in the Sunday paper. These coupons are ready for use, refer to the expiry date and terms of use found on the face or back side of the coupon before use though.




Other ways of getting a coupon to save a few dollars in these restaurants are coupons given with special offers on site, or printable coupons downloadable from the net. The bigger voucher sites usually hold these coupons, but like with paper coupons, always verify date of expiration and terms of use.




If you have your pancakes or ice cream at your local IHOP, saving a few dollars using these printable vouchers can add up quickly. A free ice cream with a purchase over $20 or a particular percentage off the final bill is a nice way to save up to hundreds of dollars in the course of months.

What a waste of time! There was absolutely no valuable information in this write up! Free ice cream with $20 purchase? BFD! Hundreds of dollars a month? You&apos;d have to eat at IHOP four or five times a day to see that. Just my 1.5 cents.

@I&apos;m Hungry&amp;I Agree:

At least Esmein is adding anything at all - I don&apos;t see you both adding anything constructive besides snide comments that should be kept to yourself. Go back to the hole you crawled out of.

Thanks Esmein for your IHOP information. Great post and great restaurant! :) :)
