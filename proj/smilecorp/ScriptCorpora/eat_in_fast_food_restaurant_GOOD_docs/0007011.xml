We had Christmas lunch here and it was perfect. We were staying a few minutes away at the dog-friendly Kedron Valley Inn. So, after tuckering the pooches out with a chilly hike, we left them snoozing in the room and headed into town.

I loved everything about our lunch here. For starters, it was a quiet, romantic Christmas away from the frenzy of family (don&apos;t get me wrong, we love them). The atmosphere was beautiful in this restaurant and the menu was creative and full of local fare. And most importantly, the food was incredible. We ate here several months ago and I still remember exactly what we had: Oysters Rockefeller (some of the best I&apos;ve ever had). The Cabot Cheddar Fondue Plate (can you think of anything better on a freezing day), which came with green apples, cornichon pickles, grapes, summer sausage and chunks of sourdough bread. And, the Roasted Heirloom Beet Salad which was truly perfect. And, most importantly, champagne! The Woodstock Inn, and in particular the Red Rooster, contributed to this past Christmas being the best one we&apos;ve ever had together.

Pretty freaking solid food choices at the bar for what they call &quot;lighter fare&quot;. I had the poached pear which was awesome. I also had a burger which was just ok. A little over cooked IMHO. That being said, you might want to order your burger medium rare if you like it medium. The fries were really good too. I noticed someone ordered the mac&amp;cheese...it&apos;s a lot of food, that&apos;s all I&apos;m gonna say!

It was excellent! Granted it was Valentines day and I was with the guy I love.. but nonetheless I think this place really was superb! The food was really tasty, and the decor was interesting. There is a fountain right in the middle of the restaurant, and though we were there at night, I could tell it must have had a really beautiful view of the lawn during the day, with the floor to ceiling windows. They matched the bread plates to the pictures on the wall, which was an interesting little conversation topic. My boyfriend got one that had a giant month on it, appetizing.

All in all it is a nice place for a romantic dinner with really great food, will go back again!

Woodstock seems to not have a lot of dining destinations that are open at lunch or that do not have bus loads of tourists crowding them.  On a day trip to Vermont, we stopped in Woodstock and asked one of the visitors&apos; center employees where to eat.  We were pointed in the direction of the Woodstock Inn and Resort.

Now I must say I really enjoy walking into a resort and feeling like I am on vacation, even if it is a day trip.  The Inn does not disappoint.  Sleek, contemporary, yet still cozy, I was almost sad to not be staying in the place.

We went into the restaurant at about 2 for a late lunch, to find that it was still pleasantly busy.  One star ding on the review is due to the noise level - the acoustics were not great and even subdued chatter was a bit noisy.

Our waitress was predictably laid back, just as you would expect in a Vermont location.  We were given time to lazily look over the menu, while our beverages were promptly served.  I chose the turkey club wrap that had an apple compote in it - a nice change from the predictable - and a slab of what else - Vermont cheese!  The BF ordered a crab cake sandwich, with a heaping serving of cole slaw slathered on top.  We both thought we would be somewhat good and ordered the salad instead of fries on the side.  Great choice - nice light vinagrette dressing.  All in all a good experience.

My girlfriends and I recently stayed at the Woodstock Inn for a weekend and had several meals (twice for breakfast and once for dinner) at Red Rooster, the Inn&apos;s premiere restaurant. While the food on all three occasions was excellent overall, the service during our dinner fell well below our expectations.

But first, the food.  Breakfast on both days consisted of a well executed buffet.  The blueberry pancakes were excellent as well the eggs benedict and corn beef hash.  A great assortment of fresh fruit was offered and there were sufficient options for both carnivores and vegetarians.

Dinner was quite filling and of excellent quality. The menus consisted of entrees using local ingredients. I had a perfectly cooked duck dish as well as some Cabot Clothbound cheese for dessert. The wine selection was also well chosen and had many appropriate matches for our various meals.

My one (big) criticism of Red Rooster was the treatment by the hostess upon arriving at the restaurant. We were staying in the hotel and had been told by the concierge that at 6:15 pm, the restaurant would easily be able to accommodate our party and that a reservation would not be necessary. Upon his advice, we went immediately to Red Rooster and asked for our table. The hostess&apos;s first response was jot &quot;it will be a few minutes&quot; but rather &quot;did you call earlier? I already told you we are booked.&quot; I found this to be quite rude.after I explained to her what the concierge told us, she left in a huff and went about trying to &quot;find&quot; us a table.  I found this attitude pretty outrageous since the restaurant was at most at one-third capacity. It was unnecessary fot her to treat us like WE were in the wrong and that she didn&apos;t have any need to try and seat our party.

Other than this rude reception, I think that our multiple meals at Red Rooster were worthwhile. I would have given a four star rating if it had not been for the way we were initially treated. I do hope in the future their staff will be better equipped on how to handle such situations so that every guest can have a positive experience.

I should first note that I&apos;m writing this review over a year AFTER my dinner at the Red Rooster, but it&apos;s telling that I&apos;m still dreaming about that meal... And planning on going back.

The then-BF made reservations for V-Day 2010, we dressed in our best (unnecessary, but fun), and started with drinks at the bar.  I had a martini with lavender-infused gin&amp;a lavender-sugared rim that was unusual&amp;delightful. Again, still thinking about that drink... When we moved to our table, the decor struck me as beautifully minimalist.  The dining room has a very open space, and could feel like an airport hangar, but somehow manages to remain cozy.  In fact, the booth for two that we were placed at was HUGE, but with a little wine and conversation we inched closer&amp;closer over the night.  The decor definitely won me over, much more modern than other local restaurants (ahem, The Prince and the Pauper...).

As for the food, the stand-out dish was an appetizer - the slow-poached pear with blue cheese and short rib.  Oh my god.  The combination of flavors was wonderful.  I will definitely order this again!  The BF ordered a pasta dish as an appetizer (they did a half portion - very accommodating chefs!), I believe it was an oxtail ragout with... cavetelli?  And our mains were also great - I had a special (surf&amp;turf) and he had the duck, I believe.  Every dish was perfectly cooked, service was impeccable, perfectly paced.

All in all, this was a magical night.  The Red Rooster has become my favorite dining destination in the Upper Valley.  I would give four and a half stars, but reserve five for truly unbelievable, once-in-a-lifetime experiences.  Skip Simon Pearce&amp;go to the Red Rooster!

I probably eat here more than any other place in town just because I live across The Green.  And I am therefore grateful that they have really good burgers.

Yes, yes, the other food is pretty good.  I had an excellent seafood stew here, and the fried chicken is not bad (but I prefer KFC, what can I say?).  I love the pasta dish with oxtail marmalade and roasted mushrooms (with a side of roasted mushrooms).  In fact, I&apos;ve never had a bad, or even mediocre, meal here.

But what I really love at the Inn are the burgers.  And the fries.  And the house-made mayo that I dip my fries in.  Love. The.  Mayo.

The service is always friendly and usually prompt.  (Of course, they know us by sight, now.  They ay even recognize my voice on the phone, since I order for takeout so often.)  (I can cook, BTW.  I just don&apos;t like to have to.)

I love that this place has the right atmosphere for just about anything.  I have come here dressed up, I have come here after the gym.  I have come here for a romantic dinner for two, I have come here with half of my relatives in tow.  And even though it is not a totally casual atmosphere, they always welcome children, who are inevitably enchanted by whatever water-fountain-and-plant arrangement they have going on in the middle of the room.

Do, however, be warned of the butter.  You will want to grab the ramekin, clutch it to your chest, and greedily eat it all by yourself with a spoon.  Try not to do that.  It is bad form.  (Not that anybody tried to pry it out of my greasy little hands, but I did get odd looks from neighboring tables.)

(And do make reservations, especially on the weekends, and always during leaf-peeping season.)

Came here for Valentine&apos;s Day, although we had a pleasant experience overall, I had to duck a couple stars for a variety of things.

Decor: probably my favorite part of the restaurant. It&apos;s what my bf would call &quot;rustic modern&quot;. Large dining room, cool looking lamps, fountains in the middle, tables were spaced out enough to provide conversation privacy.

Food: First, was a bit disappointed that they did not have a special menu for V-day which I feel like most places do nowadays...

Wine: Not a large selection but they did have our favorite Cline Ancient Vines Zins at a decent price.

Appetizers: Half dozen oysters on the half shell, very fresh and big, no complaints but obviously no credit to the chef either. Smoked salmon was way overpowered by the avocado mouse and pickled cucumbers.

Entrees: My bf really liked his cod/mussels in chowder, I unfortunately did not taste it, so can&apos;t comment. I got the duck confit: skin was plenty crispy but the meat was a bit on the dry side. I really did not enjoy the spaetzle which just tasted like little pieces of fried dough. The stone fruit and other accompaniments were just too tart to go well with the duck IMO.

Sides: Ordered whipped sweet potatoes with candied pecans which was tasty. The fries were definitely nothing to write home about - honestly I enjoyed the fries I had at Chili&apos;s the day before better. Both also came out in these red ceramic baking dishes which totally clashes with everything else.

Service: Waitress was attentive but did not smile once... Granted I wouldn&apos;t want to be working on Valentine&apos;s Day either but come on!!

Overall: Fine but definitely would not jump at a return opportunity.

I continue to be impressed by the quality of the dining experience at While we often drop in for burgers (beef or chicken--both are very good), we&apos;ve started dining there, too. On our most recent visit, we had terrific salads (baby bibb and simple green salad) followed by salmon (ordered med rare and, while slightly overcooked, still very good) and house-made cavatelli with roasted mushrooms, cheese (from Consider Bardwell Farms in Vermont), and excellent duck confit. Nice mix of wines by the the glass and bottle to complement the food. Be sure to make a reservation, though: the walk-ins in front of us were turned away because even the bar was full.

In August, we had dinner there with a group that included a 10 year-old. There were good menu choices for her and she felt very comfortable in the room.

When you&apos;re visiting Woodstock - no matter where you stay - this is a great place for dinner. The vibe is that of a relaxed upscale restaurant. That is, feel free to dress up or stroll in wearing a nice shirt and jeans. Either seems to be acceptable.

Our server, Jordan, was great. He helped up pick out a magnificent Italian wine to start us off. We paired that nicely with the hen they had as an entree. With the skin still on, that bird was good! It came with 3 carrots - each of which were not quite cooked all the way. The side of asparagus we ordered hit the spot, though.

We also, to start the night, ordered 1/2 dozen oysters and their cheddar fondue. The latter was so divine, it should be illegal! The local cheddar came with bread, pickles, grapes and sausage to dip into the cheese.

Delicious!

Don&apos;t be fooled by this place&apos;s &quot;down-home&quot; name--The Red Rooster is an absolutely terrific spot to have a relaxed and indulgent meal when you&apos;re looking to treat yourself.

Pretty much anytime a restaurant has a cheese plate, you can guarantee I&apos;ll order it. My husband and I decided to start out the night with the plate of five cheeses--absolute heaven! From there we split the oysters rockefeller and the pork belly--both deliciously flavorful and perfectly cooked. After that we shared the fried chicken entree (with real Vermont maple syrup for dipping, no less!) that came with plentiful sides of veggies and starches. After splitting these 4 dishes, we had just enough room to stuff ourselves with the chocolate bruno dessert--a flourless chocolate cake that, while delicious, sent us both into serious food comas.

The service was just as perfect as the food. Our waitress and the rest of the staff were incredibly attentive but not over the top. Just a wonderful, unexpectedly delicious meal!

In a town that left me cold with an over abundance of New Yorkers, tour bus refugees, and inflated prices, the Red Rooster was a pleasant surprise.

I did not have high hopes for this late lunch visit for several reasons: it was about the only place open for lunch at 2 PM other than a poorly rated sports bar, it was in a large inn, but not the &quot;featured&quot; dining room, and unlike the rest of the lovely New England hideaway cum roaring fireplace decor, this restaurant looked like it was the 24 hour commissary at a New England teaching hospital. A not unpleasant to me - but quite disturbingly out of place - stream of pop songs from the 1950&apos;s and 60&apos;s played in the background (Little Darlin&apos;, She&apos;s Not There...). And here my bitching stops.

We were greeted and seated promptly and with good cheer. Our menus were &quot;presented,&quot; and I do mean &quot;presented,&quot; by our waitress who graciously stood by as we fussed with our coats and got ourselves seated, and then handed a menu, right side up, first to my GF and then to me. I know, a small touch, but one so rarely seen in most &quot;lunch places,&quot; with that &quot;whaccanIgetchyas&quot; mentality. Clearly, the looks of this place were deceiving.

I couldn&apos;t choose between a pulled short rib sandwich and the crab cake po&apos; boy. Our waitress recommended the po&apos; boy, and so it was my choice. Good choice! Lightly fried, and heavy on the crab, not the breading, served open faced on a fresh, toasted bun with a large load of remoulade and dressing, lettuce and tomato. Doing my best to keep it neat, I assembled the meal, sliced the po&apos; boy in half, and Oh Boy!... To Hell with neat. This is good! My GF&apos;s turkey club wrap was of equally high quality and, for what it was, tasted good. But it was not a crab cake po&apos; boy!

Service continued to be that perfect blend of &quot;invisible/attentive:&quot; pleasant and conversant when addressed, disappearing discretely soon after. The kind of service where you don&apos;t feel like they&apos;re hovering over you, and you might start to wonder where they are, except that the instant you don&apos;t have something or start to look away from your companion or plate, someone is there to pour more water, offer a refill on the soda, to ask if you need anything, or whisk away an empty plate.

If I were to return to Woodstock (not likely) I would be pleased to return to the Red Rooster... for lunch. But - weirdly, troublingly - I can&apos;t think of another place that I have been where the decor and ambiance - although quite &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;clean&quot; and... je ne sais quoi - detract so strangely from the experience. My mind kept saying &quot;this place can&apos;t be too good.&quot; The service and the food were a happy contradiction.

I have to admit I was a little skeptical about this place at first.  A few of the locals seemed not too thrilled with it&apos;s modern &quot;airport restaurant&quot; feel, but I was completely blown away by the food and actually found the decor to be quite appealing (no, it is not that kitchy down home kind of place that you might expect to find in the quaint little town of Woodstock).  Be sure to check out their modern light fixtures from Italy.

We had a large party and they have the perfect little alcoves that made the experience seem almost like a private event for our group.  Everyone at the table devoured their plates and kept talking about how delicious they were.  I had the vegetable cous cous (which may sound kind of boring, but I was sticking to vegetarian that night) and it was one of the best vegetarian entrees I&apos;ve ever had.  It was perfectly spiced with saffron and surrounded by a bit of yogurt sauce that just melded all the flavors together.  They used unique vegetables like fennel and radishes, all which were in season and a welcome change from what most restaurants try to bore the vegetarians with.

Fear not...this hotel restaurant is packed with people during the peak season (be sure to make reservations) and filled with tasty bites.

My wife and I went with friends and loved it.  I had the oysters rockefeller and pork three ways.  Both were excellent.  My wife had a cod dish that disappeared before I could even taste it.  The decore is beautiful and the service perfect.

I would have given 5 stars but reserve that for something spectacular.  I&apos;d love to give the Red Rooster 4.5 stars, it&apos;s so close to perfection.  I&apos;d have to detract for a lack of a tasting menu or the slight dryness of the pork shank, but I&apos;m nit picking in the extreme!

As other reviewers have mentioned, although the restaurant name brings to mind some sort of mediocre breakfast chain, this place delivers across the board.

In a state that is rather short on fine dining options, or modern styled dining rooms, the Red Rooster&apos;s main dining room delivers a setting that lets the diner feel like they&apos;ve left the woods of Vermont.

The food has been excellent all three times I dined there. The wine list covers enough ground to match up well with the menu, and is priced appropriately relative to the price point of the food. The service has been solid as well, not exactly on par with big city fine dining, but close enough.

Overall, one of the best places to eat in Vermont, and definitely worth a stop in if you are ever in Woodstock.

This place was packed with grandparents! Honestly, there may have been a shuffleboard convention at the Inn, there were so many folks over 70. But that&apos;s not really what this review is about. Just know that this is the kind of place that is comfortable for families and older relatives, and isn&apos;t some hip, chic little spot. They serve good American food with a pretty hefty price tag. It felt like the kind of place one should order a Manhattan or Old-fashioned, so I ordered a whiskey drink from their cocktail menu. It was strong, but I like whiskey so it worked out fine. The penne with tiger shrimp was outstanding and flavorful, and the filet mignon was served precisely as requested. But even more outstanding than the entrees was the dessert. Do it! Get the seasonal sampler if you can, you will not regret it. We had an early autumn one with apple cider, gingersnap cream cookie, and some other yummies I can&apos;t remember. The service at these places always creeps me out a little, but apart from the host, I didn&apos;t get any sideways glances from the staff. Definitely a solid place to go for a good meal, with or without your elders.

Overwhelmingly disappointing.  Mediocre food, unfriendly service, average ingredients, in a nice atmosphere.
Food-Not a good sign when the best part of your meal is the salted butter.  But that was some great butter.
Apps: asparagus and beet salad that was ehh.  Bland beets and standard asparagus.
Mains: Salmon that was very tender, but substandard sides and sauces.  Good portion size of an average dish.  Truffle risotto with okay flavor but nothing special.  Too much vegetable &quot;stuff&quot; overwhelmed the flavor without adding anything besides mass to the dish.
Wine-Bad.  Not a good sign when you receive a glass and question if the waitress brought house wine instead of what you ordered.
Decor-Very open airy room with a water feature in the middle.  Many families and older couples.  Even with open space it was not overly loud and the modern feel brings the restaurant up to a two star.
Service-Attentive by the support staff(i.e. water glasses always filled, plates removed, etc) but very rude and disinterested waitress.  She may have just been having a bad night, but we were one of the first tables she had and it was not until after entrees that we saw a smile or any sense of warmth or pleasure that we came in.
Overall-Great meal if this was at your local weeknight place for half the price.  For the price, location, and ambiance it was greatly disappointing.
