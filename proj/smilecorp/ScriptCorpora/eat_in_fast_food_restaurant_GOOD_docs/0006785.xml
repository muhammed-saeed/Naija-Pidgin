00:39:18 Oh, it was a good knifewhen you first got it. 00:39:20 Maybe six monthslater it got dull. 00:39:23 Did you ever try to cut atomato withone of these babies? 00:39:26 Oh boy. 00:39:26 You poke it; you stab it;you jab it; you give the,oh my goodness gracious thepoor tomato has a hemorrhage. 00:39:33 Well, ladies and gentlemenlet me tell you something. 00:39:35 My cousin Ron has come up withone of the most unbelievableknives that I&apos;ve everlaid my hands on. 00:39:42 And one of the things thatmakes it so important is howit&apos;s made and what&apos;s made of. 00:39:47 t of all, let medescribe this knife. 00:39:49 It&apos;s called the Showtime knife. 00:39:51 It is made out offine surgical steel. 00:39:55 It is a full tang. 00:39:56 In other words, the tang meansthe blade goes from here to theopposite end. 00:40:01 It&apos;s one solid piece of steel. 00:40:03 And the handle. 00:40:05 Oh. the same guarantee. 00:40:07 Will not crack,chip, or break, ever. 00:40:09 And if anything everhappens to that knife,this is the strangest part, letme show you this guarantee. 00:40:15 This is unreal. 00:40:16 Unbelievable in thecutlery business. 00:40:18 If it ever getsbroken, dull, damaged,even if it&apos;s your fault, mycousin Ron is going to replacethis absolutely free. 00:40:27 Let me show you somethingabout this knife over here. 00:40:29 Have you ever seen a knifethis sharp in your whole life? 00:40:35 Let me tell you something. 00:40:37 When it comes toslicing a tomato,you don&apos;t have toslice a tomato. 00:40:41 The weht of theknife alone slices it. 00:40:44 You don&apos;t slice thetomato you caress it. 00:40:46 Look at this. 00:40:47 With this knife one tomatowill last you a week. Ever gointo a Don&apos;t laugh. 00:40:51 You go into a fast foodrestaurant they&apos;ve been usingour knife and the sametomato for six weeks. 00:40:56 Here, pick up thebun, look underneath. 00:40:58 Does that look familiar? 00:40:59 That&apos;s why you go in hungryand you come out starved. 00:41:02 Look, you use this knifeyou save yourself money. 00:41:04 If you&apos;re going to the discountstores buy loaves of meat andyou&apos;ll never have dried upmeat in the refrigerator. 00:41:11 You only slice off whatyou need when you need it. 00:41:14 I don&apos;t care whether it&apos;s ham,roast beef, lamb, turkey. 00:41:18 This knife is like a hot knifegoing right through butter. 00:41:21 It has a fork on the end so youpick up the meat dip it intothe gravy. 00:41:25 Remember, that&apos;s a grape fruit. 00:41:27 Look at this. 00:41:28 Not a seed, not a drop ofjuice comes out because this israzor sharp and thebest part of it is;it&apos;s guaranteed to staythat way forever. 00:41:37 Now, I&apos;ve proved to you howsharp the knife is haven&apos;t I. 00:41:41 Huh?
