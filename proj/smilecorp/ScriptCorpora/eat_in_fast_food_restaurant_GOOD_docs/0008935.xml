Diddy Riese (opened in 1983 and often called &quot;Diddy&apos;s&quot;) is a popular restaurant in Westwood Village, a shopping area in Los Angeles, CA. Diddy&apos;s sells cookies, ice cream, Hawaiian shave ice, coffee, and milk.
The restaurant is something of a local legend for its made-to-order ice cream sandwiches. Customers pick out the types of cookies from a dozen made fresh in-house, as well as a scoop of ice cream from two dozen Dreyer&apos;s flavors. The signature sandwich originally cost $1, but the price has since increased to $1.75.
Due to this low-cost mainstay, Diddy&apos;s attracts long lines on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, when UCLA&apos;s classes are in session. However, the lines are much shorter during the day and on other nights.
Weekly trips to Diddy Riese are common among UCLA students, but also students from nearby colleges like USC, Occidental College, or Loyola Marymount University.
