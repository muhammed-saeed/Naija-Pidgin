Da Bomb
 
This place is great. The food is excellent, people are sexy and friendly. I&apos;ve been there over a dozen times and it keeps getting better. The people that complained don&apos;t know anything about dining out. You cant go wrong here, trust me!! BTW Ask for JR tell them the Godfather sent you then smack him on his cheek.

Underwhelmed
 
Great if you like stuffy, overly crowded, noisy spots with pedestrian food and indifferent service. We were elated to get out of there.

Probably go back to Sofrito but...
 
Place feels good, has great energy and food is excellent!! I have been there three times now and would probably go back but need to mention 2 things. It is a very loud place. The lounge area can be loud but the dinner area needs to be toned down just a bit. You can hardly converse without shouting - it takes a lot of energy and does take away from the dinning experience. The birthday celebration moments - way too many and THE SINGING AND CELEBRATION IS LOUD. Why do we have to be subjected to that? It is a great gesture and makes the bday person feel good - but you are discounting other patrons. Do celebrate but do not make a production out of it.( it gets too loud) The hostess told us 45 min to be seated and so we grabbed drinks at the bar and 1hr went by. When we went to inquire, we were told will seat you shortly. Hostess came to seat get us 2hrs later!! We refused the table and got a quick bite at the lounge and left. My point, if tables are taking longer than what was promised, at least come and communicate with us so we can do what we need to do. Regardless of how well the place is doing, it is very important to validate and appreciate everyone that comes through your doors. Above and beyond the success of your restaurant, it is touches like this that leave a huge impression. Other than that – your place rocks and wish you continuous success….. .

Disappointed
 
We went to celebrate my friends birthday today. I have been there a few times and the food is great. Although today had been a disappointment overall. I called to make the reservations a while back for a party of 15. Tried to call to confirm a couple a days in a row and no one called me back. Finally go thru to confirm. Still the day of , they called me to make sure we were going because they had overbooked. The reservations were for 10:15. Four of us including the birthday person got there around 9:00 and we told everyone else to make sure they got there around 9:30 so that we would not lose our reservations. We were not seated till well after 11:00. The whole time we were there the air conditioning was not working. One of the women&apos;s bathroom stall did not work properly. They only have two. We finally sat down and placed our order. They came back to tell us that they no longer had the pernil (roast pork). Maybe if they sat us at the reserved time we would have had the roast pork. Then for dessert a few of us asked for coffee. The dessert came out and we are waiting for the coffee and waiting till we finally ask a waiter and he went to the back only to come back to tell us that the coffee machine was broken. No one bothered to inform us before hand. Their food is really great, although I did not have any today because what I wanted they no longer had (the pernil). But their service today was poor. I have been cured from Sofrito for a long time. I could have my mother cook for me or cook it myself before I go back there any time soon.

poor food/ok service/ great atmosphere
 
the atmosphere was great and my first drink and appetizers were good. My husband got the seafood paella which was so fishy and the lobster was black. The waiters do not speak or understand english well. The entrees were brought out before we even finished the appetizers. Would not return.

Incredible Experience
 
I went to Sofrito for a friend&apos;s birthday and could not have been more impressed with it. Our waiter was incredible, created an appetizer sampler based on how much we wanted to spend, and was a great server overall. I had the pork for dinner, and it was honestly one of the best meals I have ever had. It was huge and under $20 too, which made it taste even better. Drinks were a little pricy, but bottled beer was pretty reasonable. If you go, get the pork. You won&apos;t regret it. A great dining experience overall.

Good Food, Service, but Noisy
 
I was happy to find this restaurant and enjoyed the food and service. What I found most annoying is the noise. I understand that it&apos;s kind of loungy but the eating area should be fixed so that people can converse with others at their table without shouting.
