Ordered take out (Sunday). Ordering was easy ~ the man taking my order was very friendly. We had it delivered in a very reasonable time - 30mins. Delivery was extra $$ but a fair rate. Food was hot, ingredients were fresh and delicious! Every dish was cooked perfectly. Excellent meal.
 Order: Moo Goo Gai Pan, Tai Dop Voy, BeanSprout Lo Mein, S&amp;S Chicken Balls, Steamed Rice

We came here to just try it out because our neighbors highly recommended it. We were surprised to see the variety of foods on the menu! It ranges from awesome chinese food to great thai food! My family and I really enjoyed the thai curry! It has a nice kick to it where the dish is sweet, yet salty. My husband really likes spicy foods, so they suggested the lemon grass and he loved it!
 Order: thai curry, lemon grass, steamed rice and more

I was going to go to the Chinese restaurant near downtown Kitchener but they were full, so I decided to try here because my friend highly suggested it. Making that change was a really good decision! You can tell the restaurant is family owned and has a really warm feeling when entering. The food is scrumptious, definitely comparable to the one restaurant downtown! Maybe even better! Highly recommend to others!
 Order: Pad Thai, Spring Roll, Kungpo Chicken

I felt that I should write a review based on my experience from Sat dinner. After having their food I was awake whole night from loose motion and whole day Sunday.
Looks like I got served old foods that made me sick. Pls be careful with this restaurant. I&apos;m not recommending and I&apos;m not visiting again to their restaurant.
Price is resonable, and the food taste like typical Mall Chinese food.
 Order: dinner for 2 , soup, chicken fried rice, beef brocoli, garlic chicken.

Best Chinese Canadian food in town. It beats the crap @UWaterloo hands down. Do try their pad Thai and chicken fried rice, as well as the egg rolls. Worth the $$$ I make as prof!
 Order: Chicken fried rice, general tso chicken

By far this is the best restaurant for Thai food, and I am a very picky eater myself. If you like spicy food order the Lemon Grass its got a nice kick to it. The place is small but warm feeling.

I am from Toronto and I was dropping off my kids that just recently moved into the campus of Wilfred Laurier. The food is absolutely delicious, I would prefer my kids eating here than any fast food restaurant. The staff was very kind and helped me get to know around town better too!
