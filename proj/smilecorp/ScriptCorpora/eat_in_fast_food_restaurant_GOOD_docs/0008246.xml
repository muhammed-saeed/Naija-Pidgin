Shelby County Schools grading change means fewer tests

Now pupil&apos;s TCAP score will make up difference

 By Victoria Wright Memphis Commercial Appeal Posted July 1, 2011 at midnight 

 Discuss Print A A A 
 

 
Shelby County&apos;s middle and high school students will have fewer graded assignments, but more time working with teachers starting this fall.

The new policy, approved at the Shelby County Schools business meeting Thursday, will change the current number of graded assignments in a nine-week period from 18 to 12.

&quot;We are putting more of an emphasis on quality over quantity,&quot; said Shelby County School Board chairman David Pickler.

Teachers will continue to choose what composes the grades, whether it be tests, quizzes or papers, said Pickler.

The policy change came from directors in the secondary Tennessee Department of Education.

County schools Supt. John Aitken said the changes will cover all subjects and allow for more &quot;formative assessment&quot; or the enhanced learning of the student.

Pickler said the grade adjustments will give a student the ability to &quot;master each subject material.&quot;

&quot;A teacher in a nine-week period would have two assignments per week with 18 grades,&quot; Pickler said. &quot;That&apos;s a lot of material and a lot to process.&quot;

In addition to the reduced number of grades given in the fall, the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program, or TCAP, will account for 15 percent of the final marks in the spring semester for students in grades 6-8.

The percentage will fill in the gap created by the change in the amount of grades given in a nine-week period.

In other business, the board also proposed on first reading a cellphone policy that will affect teachers.

The policy requires school employees to turn off their phones during teaching time. The policy exempts employees whose jobs require them to use cellphones.

&quot;We don&apos;t want the teachers&apos; phones ringing and we don&apos;t want them being distracted,&quot; said Pickler.

However, in emergencies, teachers would be able to use their cellphones, Pickler said.

If the policy is approved on final reading, Pickler says that teachers will be briefed on the changes, so that teachers will know how to react in emergencies.

&quot;What we don&apos;t want to have happen is a disaster or some form of a crisis and all the sudden everybody is hitting their cellphones at the same time and jamming the system,&quot; said Pickler.

Too few assessments in my opinion. I think lots of quizzes are good to assess smaller amounts of material so as to get a better idea on pin-pointing students´ progress. Tests kind of bring it all together with larger amounts of material. Then there are presentations, projects, groupwork, homework, etc.
I wonder how many teachers in the classroom had a real say in this decision.

I think this is a bad idea. I think more graded assignments actually are good because if the student is failing, the more good grades they can sneak into the semester the higher their average will be.

Sounds to me like they don&apos;t want to work the teachers too hard. Let&apos;s not find out what the student&apos;s don&apos;t know (i.e. from tests) until it is too late to remedy the teaching.&quot;If no one learns, no one has taught&quot;

Tests ? Who needs them when you cannot receive a failing grade anyway....give them all A&apos;s so that no student&apos;s fragile self esteem is bruised...then build a fast food restaurant on every corner so that the coming&quot;tsunami&quot;of uneducated graduates will all be able to obtain gainful employment.

Common now, what is wrong with you people....are you just preparing for the merger and insuring that the playing field will be level for all?

Memphis and Shelby County are now obviously past the tipping point.

One advantage is that the teacher can pick out the two highest grades out of the week to be averaged for the nine week final grade. In that way, a student is able to improve his or her average.

Everyday my students read a topical article to create a relation between the lesson and real world application. Again, please allow me to teach my children. If you in administration are that concerned about the classroom resign your post and come on back to the trenches. Otherwise a simple thank you will suffice.

&quot;The policy change came from directors in the secondary Tennessee Department of Education.&quot;

It would appear that this change was not initiated by SCS but rather the Potentates (aka, Directors) in Nashville. The SCS Board simply formally approved the change. Since it came from Nashville it would be doubtful that teachers were consulted, however, why not give it a year and see how it works out? Besides once the nutcases in Memphis get control of the SCS Board it&apos;s not going to matter anyway -- TCAP scores and the educational level will come crashing down.

The number of recorded grades has little correlation to the level of student mastery. An effective teacher continuously&quot;monitors and adjusts&quot;throughout every lesson. Recorded grades serve as feedback for students and parents.

It is all about looking good on paper folks. Fewer grades is the latest attempt to maintain graduation rates and look good on paper. So many kids expect to be passed just by showing up. The school is forced to pass the child because the graduation rate must be inflated to give the appearance of a being a good school. The state must micromanage the schools and how the teachers teach so we don&apos;t have too many teachers in the class room with high standards.

I have an idea - just pass everyone. The students who will qualify for Affirmative Action get all A+ grades. The other students get C grades. That way, no one is offended. Well, the non-affirmative action students might be offended but who cares about them.

I agree! My daughter will start middle school next month at a Shelby County school and I want to be sure that she is learning! I want to see her work and I want it to be graded so I know if she is having trouble with something or if she is learning fast and getting bored.

I am not a teacher and have never felt the need to second guess how she has been taught (we&apos;ve been very lucky that she&apos;s had some amazing teachers!). Her father&apos;s girlfriend, who, I might add, is less than intelligent, seems to always find something to complain about. My daughter made the honor roll every 9 weeks and that was inspite of the fact that her regular teacher left early because of pregnancy complications. Her interim teacher must have been doing something right. But, her dad&apos;s girlfriend still complained, though, luckily, it was only to me and not to the teacher.

It takes a special person to teach and if not for teachers, no one in administration would be where they are. So, thank you.

I have to agree with the change for 2 reasons:

1) Many of the graded assignments are nothing more than busy work or quizzes testing very small portions of material. By allowing for less assignments/tests/quizzes, teachers can test over wider ranges of materials and allow for more in depth assessments, instead of just quick recall or memorization. I think we&apos;ve figured out from NCLB and other testing mandates that testing more is not always better. If all you&apos;re doing is testing, when do you have time to actually learn? In addition, how can kids be prepared for college...where a student may have as little as 2 or 3 tests for an entire semester...if they&apos;ve never had to study for more than a week&apos;s material at a time?!

2) I LOVE that the TCAP scores can now be considered part of the students&apos; grades. One of the reason, I believe, for low TCAP scores is that students really don&apos;t have a stake in the game. Your better students will do well because they like to do well on tests, but the vast majority of kids don&apos;t put much effort into the exams because they don&apos;t see the results of tests affect them personally. What better way to encourage students to study for and try harder on TCAP tests than to make them part of their grades?!

I don&apos;t think it is much of a big deal. A student will know when they are behind, if they are not putting in the work to begin with. I never needed a test or a grade to show me I was behind. There are many sample tests in books or even online now that students can do outside of the class. If they can&apos;t pass those, then should know they are behind. If they don&apos;t bother taking them then they probably don&apos;t care if they are behind. In college, most of my undergraduate classes only had 2 grades. The midterm and final. So fewer graded tests and or assignments will also help prepare them for that. Point is, it&apos;s the responsibility of the student to know the material. And 18 or 12 assignments is not going to change if they know it or not.

One thing I don&apos;t agree with is having TCAP scores as part of your grade. When I was in junior high, we had the CAT (California Achievement Tests). An all day testing event across multiple days and subjects is not a true reflection of a single test for a single subject. I know I was bored beyond tears when taking those tests. And your attention would start to wane in the 3rd hour or so. I always did well because they were always pretty simple.....but to make that part of your grade does seem like the state trying to improve their status to the feds by enticing kids to take it more seriously and perform better. I just think it&apos;s unfair to the kids.

Are you telling me that the kids in SCS aren&apos;t inherently more intelligent than the MCS school children? WOW!! After all the hostile rhetoric who would have ever thunk that the kids are&lt;gasp&gt;more equal than the adults like to think.

Next comment: Someone mentioned that the larger number of graded assignments allow the teachers to cherry pick the higher grades. WOW!! What a concept.... throw out the garbage grades and only reward the student with what is designed to be an inflated grading system? What a concept!! Let&apos;s show that our kids are smarter by throwing away their bad grades and only use the best scores. To badly misquote Col Kurtz,&quot;Oh, the genius...the genius of it all....&quot;

Finally, blame the change on Nashville... mock the administration of MCS for doing something eeriely similar...but MCS did it first. Does that mean that the absolutely superior SCS Bd is behind the curve in doing what everyone else is doing? Suddenly it dawns on me...to be considered smart and superior...don&apos;t do anything until someone higher up shows you what to do and when to do it. Maybe it is time for the citizens of MCS to bring SCS into the 21st century rather than living in the 19th.

I may be able to sit down and do a few minor league algebraic calculations. Everyday I must try to remember what was taught to me in 9th grade English grammar class. If I&apos;m sitting in a bar and someone mentions a poem by Browning I&apos;m able to lean back, grab another pretzel, and say,&quot;Which one?&quot;

But the discussions in my senior English Lit class always went a little beyond Chaucer or Shakespeare.

When I look back, I remember those days and those discussions more than all others.

So, to mkuhn, Congratulations!! It was during such classroom settings that I was introduced to the idea that my ideas are just as important as the person sitting two rows over and always makes 99s on her tests...or the kid over there whose dad could fire my dad just because he wanted to.

It took me 40 years to meet my English teacher and tell her how much I appreciated her discussions. Believe it or not, she was visibly moved by a reference to those discussions. Wish more teachers had been like Gail Corr.

And let me clarify: you think it&apos;s unfair to the kids to entice them to prepare more and try harder on a comprehensive test over material they learned all year?! What exactly do you think is the purpose of education - babysitting and self-esteem building?!

No. I think a normal test should cover all the material you have learned from the last test. And a midterm or final should be all the material you have learned from the beginning of the year or the last midterm.
If you are going to use TCAP, then get rid of the midterm and final grades and just use TCAP. You can&apos;t have both. It&apos;s redundant and a waste of the kids time. The TCAP tests is not for the student. It&apos;s for the school system and state to show the federal government. You are making a part of the students grade something that is only given to them for the states benefit.
Might as well make the ACT / SAT a part of the junior and seniors overal grade too in that case.
If you are a seventh grader, which is better for you? To take a math test and use that grade. Or use the math component of TCAP which happens to be on the second day during the 3rd hour of testing when you are tired and bored from all the testing? That is my point. TCAPs are boring and long and take days to complete. How is that equivalant to taking one math test when you are more focused?
You mention a comprehensive test that challenges the student with material over the course of a year? Isn&apos;t that the definition of a midterm and final?

LOL I still have nightmares about those little blue books from college that were used in essay exams.
College is so different from highschool. I graduated MCS and it didn&apos;t prepare me for college at all...lol Nothing against MCS...I&apos;m sure it would have been the same at any high school system. College and high school are two totally different beasts.
People are complaining we are cutting education standards by reducing grades from 18 to 12 events. In college, as we stated, you had two tests. And in your case one. :-) In most of those two tests, the tests would be divided 50% from class lectures. And 50% from books. Which were never ever opened in class. It was the students responsibility to read and not fall behind. So when preparing for a test, you had to study two and half months of lecture notes and chapters in the book. If they taught high school like that, imagine the uproar...lol So I chuckle when we always complain about lowering our education standards in our school systems. High school is the easiest achievement you will have in life and it&apos;s nothing like college. Which I imagine is the reason they college dropout rate is so high (not counting the costs).

I am soooo glad I went to school when and where the emphasis was on quality education, and the teachers made the decisions about how many tests and what subject matter should be stressed, and when a student failed he/she was held back.

A school then was comprised of teachers, one principal, one admin/secretary, and one janitor...gee I wonder why that worked so much better than now?

How do you&quot;monitor and adjust&quot;? By assessing. You say,&quot;recorded grades serve as feedback for students and parents&quot;. Well I think the more feedback, the better. That way we can pinpoint areas of mastery and those that need improvement.
I have been a teacher for over ten years. My class is rigorous. Standards are high. Students have to work to do well. In the end, many have come back and said my class was a bear, but they were very ready for college.
You have to know something about students, especially teenagers. If it doesn´t&quot;count&quot;, they don´t give the effort they would if it does count.
We need to set the bar high for kids. Usually, they will rise to meet the occasion.
And, no, it´s not just about memorization. Quiz doesn´t necessarily mean recalling. It can be a written response to a question. It can require students to explain something in their own words or how to respond to a certain situation.
If we, as Memphis, as the Mid-South, don´t raise our educational standards, we will continue to fall behind. Notice how many factory/distibution jobs move to this area and how many engineering/science, etc. skilled jobs move away. It comes down to education.

That&apos;s why I liked highschool because I had more oppurtunities to raise my grade.

College stinks when you only have a test once a month that covers 5 chapters.

Someone said:&quot;Besides once the nutcases in Memphis get control of the SCS Board it&apos;s not going to matter anyway -- TCAP scores and the educational level will come crashing down.&quot;

Are you telling me that the kids in SCS aren&apos;t inherently more intelligent than the MCS school children? WOW!! After all the hostile rhetoric who would have ever thunk that the kids are&lt;gasp&gt;more equal than the adults like to think.

Next comment: Someone mentioned that the larger number of graded assignments allow the teachers to cherry pick the higher grades. WOW!! What a concept.... throw out the garbage grades and only reward the student with what is designed to be an inflated grading system? What a concept!! Let&apos;s show that our kids are smarter by throwing away their bad grades and only use the best scores. To badly misquote Col Kurtz,&quot;Oh, the genius...the genius of it all....&quot;

Finally, blame the change on Nashville... mock the administration of MCS for doing something eeriely similar...but MCS did it first. Does that mean that the absolutely superior SCS Bd is behind the curve in doing what everyone else is doing? Suddenly it dawns on me...to be considered smart and superior...don&apos;t do anything until someone higher up shows you what to do and when to do it. Maybe it is time for the citizens of MCS to bring SCS into the 21st century rather than living in the 19th.

Throughout the discussion and debate of the school merger debacle not once did I read where anyone stated that the county students were&quot;inherently more intelligent&quot;than city school students. (As a lawyer you should know better than to present something as&quot;fact&quot;without evidence.) Would you object to pointing me in the direction of the evidence for your aforementioned statement? Thanks in advance.

Why is the Shelby County School Board trying to micro-manage how teachers assess? There are National/State Standards. The goal should be, at least, that these are met. Each subject area is different and therefore may require more or less assessments. These decisions should be made by teachers of each department, not by a board made up of people who are not in the classroom.

Teachers will be required to record 12 grades according to board policy, but they will be able to exceed this number if desired.

Formative assessments are not graded. They are used for mastery. Grades should be taken when kids have a thorough understanding of an objective. Formative assessments allow the teacher to see how much more needs to be taught for mastery.

As a teacher, there are several posted concerns that I will try to clarify. First, twelve is the minimum number of grades that must be recorded; however, teachers will not be restricted to that number. In the past, many teachers had 20+ recorded grades when the required number was 18.

Secondly, formative assessment is the primary reason that the minimum number of grades has been reduced this year. In the past, teachers could use any assessment to assess their students;however, six teachers in the same subject or grade level at the same school might be using six different assessments to evaluate the same skill/concept. While some of the assessments might be truly authentic, others unfortunately do not have as much rigor to them. Through formative assessment, teachers will work together to develop common assessments for students in order to equally assess all students across all subjects or grade levels with the necessary rigor.

Lastly, accountability by the state has been increased for both teachers and students. On their 2011-12 evaluations, teachers will be held responsible for student scores on the TCAP; therefore, students are also being held accountable for the scores as well. The entire issue may be debated; however, there is equity since both stakeholders are held responsible for the results.

In all honesty, this change should not negatively impact the classroom. Effective teachers will continue to teach and assess with the rigor that they have always demanded from themselves and their students. On the flip side, the development of common formative assessments may actually force marginal or below teachers to step up their work level as they plan with better teachers who will continue to demand excellence.

Let me clarify something...

Just because you have only have 12&quot;graded&quot;assignments, doesn&apos;t mean you are only giving 12 assignments during a nine weeks period.

The point is to actually give students the opportunity to learn the material and then be graded on what they know. Teachers will give on-going assignments and reviews that will be used to measure how well students are learning the material but, the students will not necessarily be given a grade towards their report card.

As far as the TCAP scores go, this actually give the students accountability for the test and will hopefully weed out teachers who are not doing their job.

Some of you need to stop making rapid conclusions about topics that you obviously don&apos;t have any knowledge about (by reading your comments). This decision is based on research and what is working for other school systems.

Exactly. As a teacher in SCS, I can say that what this article did not truly address is the district&apos;s emphasis on formative assessment.
Formative assessment is everything in the classroom that is NOT graded. It is a practice quiz that isn&apos;t for a grade that the students immediately receive feedback on so they know what they need to study more. It is a teacher using green and red cards that the students can use to demonstrate their understanding of a concept. It is an activity in class that each student must participate in to show understanding. It is everything that a teacher does to assess student understanding. Before you get to a test, the teacher should know what the grades will likely be. A teacher knows which students are struggling, and a good teacher has methods to demonstrate that to the student. In my classroom, we have at least 2 practice quizzes before each&quot;real&quot;quiz (the one that goes in my gradebook). The students self-grade their practice quizzes. Immediately, all students knows exactly where they stand. Those that struggle on a practice quiz receive immediate intervention from me (whether it be an individual assignment or additional homework or whatever). Those that show advancement on the practice quiz are given an assignment to take their knowledge further. My point? Every single part of this happens BEFORE a grade goes in my gradebook. It&apos;s called TEACHING.
Furthermore, as many have said on this board before me, most teachers exceed the number of required grades.

Thank you commenters for assuming that we, as teachers, will only do enough to get the 12 required grades. If that was all I had to do, I wouldn&apos;t be exhausted at the end of the day. There are so many times in the regular school week where I have to step back, reteach, re-evaluate, and retool my lesson due to students not understanding that sometimes it is completely impossible to get 2 grades a week. Why don&apos;t you wait to see how this might actually affect your children before you scream foul?

You people who are not in the education field need to stop acting like you are experts. You do not know what is going on in the classroom. Teaching is the hardest thing I have ever done! This will allow so much more time for planning and teaching, which are WAY more important than grades. Grades are not a measure of what a kid has learned all the time. It is so much more than that. Often I find that I am cramming grades in at the end of the 9 weeks rather than teaching because I have been TEACHING the rest of the 9 weeks. There are other ways to measure if your kids are&quot;getting it.&quot;Short bellwork assignments and having them simply repeat information back out to you or a peer for example. This is what is wrong with education. TOO MANY COOKS and the cooks are not educators they are politicians and others who have no clue what its like to be in a classroom.

Don&apos;t pat yourself on the back yet. The entire school&quot;debate&quot;was about the inferior children (referred to by one jacka$$ as&quot;mud&quot;) being mixed in with the county&apos;s&quot;ice cream&quot;There was post after post of people from the county denigrating everything about the children of Memphis. From their clothing to their intellect... it was an all-out bashing of the children who attend MCS.

As for the&quot;evidence&quot;not being based on fact. Just because you don&apos;t remember it doesn&apos;t mean it didn&apos;t happen. Next time you want to make a factual statement on this blog, it would be greatly appreciated if you would footnote and brief your&quot;facts&quot;to back up your beliefs. If you choose not to do so then your belief is as faulty as you say mine was.

Look, in the beginning, I disliked the MCS school board...the city gov&apos;t... pretty near everything about the city and it&apos;s leadership was, and still is, questionable. But the citizenry of the County in their zeal to trash anything and everything to do with the leadershsip of the school board went off on a tear ripping the kids of the city of Memphis to shreds.

So don&apos;t tell me how no one slammed the intellect of the kids from Memphis. Can&apos;t you remember how they said the kids from the city will trash the County&apos;s high, holy TCAP scores. Ya&apos;ll stooped so low that each and every child, and citizen of Memphis, was reduce to a drooling idiot. Now y&apos;all are afraid that it might come out that your kids aren&apos;t near as bright as ya&apos;ll want to believe. TSK...tsk... how sad it is to sire and raise kids who have to artificially raise the test scores their parents love to brag about.

in response to SchoolThoughts :

One thing I don&apos;t agree with is having TCAP scores as part of your grade. When I was in junior high, we had the CAT (California Achievement Tests). An all day testing event across multiple days and subjects is not a true reflection of a single test for a single subject. I know I was bored beyond tears when taking those tests. And your attention would start to wane in the 3rd hour or so. I always did well because they were always pretty simple.....but to make that part of your grade does seem like the state trying to improve their status to the feds by enticing kids to take it more seriously and perform better. I just think it&apos;s unfair to the kids.
 
TCAP testing is structured over four days with each subject having its own day. The testing doesn&apos;t exceed 2-1/2 hours on any given day. Teachers do a great job of giving the kids breaks and extra treats and snacks that week to make it more enjoyable. I hate that your standardized testing experience was so horrible! Thankfully that has not been my experience (I work in a Shelby County School) nor my children&apos;s.

Interesting facts about the chinese school system:

 http://www.teachingtips.com/blog/2009... 

My favorite, everyone must attend 9 years of school. In order to attend high school or vocational school, the student must pass a test. If the test is not passed, then that student no longer goes to school.
So you really can&apos;t compare our high school vs their high school. Their high school students are only the best of the best. The lower performers go to vocational school. And the worst performers don&apos;t even get in. Plus the fact they have 250 million students currently and we as a nation only have 300 million residents total.

It doesn&apos;t really matter to me if they are educators or not...although it would be better if they were.
I&apos;ve always wanted there to be a law or rule that stated you would at least have to be a parent of a school aged child. I would trust parents to have a better interest in the schools than someone without children who is just using the position as a political step up the ladder.
