hello!


I&apos;m Nigel Witham and I designed my first restaurant in Richmond, UK in 1990. It is still thriving now.

Today, my team and I love to provide bar, coffee shop and restaurant interior design, branding, financial modelling and strategic insights with acumen. We get hired by all sizes of business, from tiny start-ups to multinational corporations.

I&apos;d love you to hire us too, although I know that you may just want some initial friendly advice. So, I have written a series of in-depth help sheets and I write about the strategic use of design in international catering magazines.

There are links to these free resources below. You are welcome to download and share them without registration.

Although I work mainly in the UK, I have production offices in India and New Zealand and representation in New York. Currently, I am working in London and Abu Dhabi. I have a second home in Australia but will consider work anywhere. I am happy to work locally but like to travel.

I am here to help and always happy to talk so why not give me a call or send me an email? I&apos;d love to hear from you.

my team


My team and I work separately but together using the internet for meetings and filing. In this way we can find the right people for the work and not the other way around.


If you are an experienced, professional designer or catering business consultant and you think you&apos;d like to join us please send us an email to tell us why.

writing

Currently I am a regular columnist on Pub and Bar magazine in the UK and occassional writer and awards judge on Caterer Middle East magazine, which is based in Dubai, UAE.

My articles cover subjects such as costs of design and fitting out, effective branding and space planning, restaurant interior design tips and how to manage and brief designers. I aim to be controversial and thought provoking.

Please download as many articles as you want - I&apos;d welcome your feedback and any ideas for more.

a polite note about our charges

Designing a restaurant, cafe or bar properly, with your business&apos;s best interests at heart, is a time-consuming process that requires: care, training, knowledge, skill and experience. For this reason I am not able to prepare pitches, initial concept proposals or make site visits without charge.

This way of working enables me to give you impartial best advice and keeps overheads low so that my charges are reasonable for everyone and the high quality of my work is maintained.

I always set out all charges and terms in writing as soon as I have a full understanding of your needs and will commit to a clear agreement with you before any work is done.
