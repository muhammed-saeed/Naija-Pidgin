 No. If you leave cash on the table then you should write&quot;Cash&quot;on the tip section of the receipt so that the waiter will be aware that there is cash on the table. Plus it fills in the blank to prevent someone else writing something in and later claiming you wrote it.

If no cash left, then use that section on the receipt to write in your tip amount that will be charged to your credit card.

 No, it shows how much will be added to your credit card. If you left $5 on the table and wrote $5 on the receipt, you&apos;ve just tipped the server $10.

 No, it&apos;s how much you are paying by credit/debit card, or cash in addition to the cost of the meal.
