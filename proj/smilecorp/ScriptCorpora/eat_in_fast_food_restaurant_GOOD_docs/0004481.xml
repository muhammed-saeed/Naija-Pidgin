Solid Valley takeout
 
For what it is, it&apos;s about as good as it gets around here. It&apos;s not overly&quot;Americanized&quot;like many takeout restaurants in the area and provides much better value than places like chin chin or pf chang&apos;s. If you&apos;re craving authentic Chinese food, make the trip to the SG Valley. If you want solid, super fast takeout from a very friendly staff, Rice Wok is for you.

Great food
 
I can&apos;t complain- a co-worker and I got the black pepper chicken and brocolli chicken - fresh, spiced well, vegetables not overcooked, all in all good cheap great quality food... the driver asked for his tip... I&apos;d forgotten - can&apos;t be mad at that. they deliver quickly as well.

Good food, great value
 
This is the first really good&quot;strip-mall-chinese&quot;food I have found in LA. The food is very good (tender, fresh and spiced well). The prices are excellent and the service is always friendly.
