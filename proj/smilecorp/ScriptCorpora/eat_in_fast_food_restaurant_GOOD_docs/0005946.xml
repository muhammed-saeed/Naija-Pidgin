Mini Cafe–Santa Ana (Review #2)

Mrs. DanGarion and I visited Mini Cafe in Santa Ana last night for dinner and it was once again a great experience.  I don’t know any other place where one can order a combination of chicken and steak fajitas for only $6.25!
 
Mini Cafe - Combo Fajitas
 
I raved about Mini Cafe a couple a weeks ago when I tried them for breakfast and since then I’ve gone there on a couple other occasions, each time my experience has been as enjoyable as the first.  I can’t understand how chef Mario can afford to keep his restaurant open with the prices he charges his customers.  I had the combination fajitas which included beans, rice, and salsa ($6.25);

no guacamole, cheese, or sour cream but trust me you don’t need them! Mrs. DanGarion ordered a cheeseburger ($3.50) and onion rings ( extra $1.00 to replace french fries).  For our food and two sodas our total bill was just over $13.  Other then at a fast food restaurant, I don’t know any other place where you can get two meals for such little damage.  Not to mention this food is great!  I saw the fresh chicken and steak tossed on the grill, along with the included veggies.  The cheeseburger wasn’t anything to praise to the gods about, but it was just standard no frills flair which hit the spot perfectly for the Mrs.  In addition to the food we ordered we even got a free appetizer as we waited for our meal; chips covered with some beans and salsa! (side note I usually catch up on my OC Weekly reading while I’m there, but I couldn’t because I had to savor our chips!)

Service was great as always, from my observation it’s a full on family run business, Mario, his wife, and their children are there at various times cooking, running the register, and serving food, and they always have a smile.  Mini Cafe is the best bang for your buck that you can get in Orange County.
