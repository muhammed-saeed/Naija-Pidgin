 tell me your experiences of homelessness Hi, I am a student doing a Master of Community Mental Health at the University of Queensland, Australia, and would like to explore the psychosocial meanings of homelessness and mental illness. Starting with your personal background (such as which country you are in, age, gender, etc)

1) Tell me about your experiences of homelessness.
2)What do you think that contributed to your homelessness?
3)How did you first become aware of symptoms of mental illness?
4)When did you first seek treatment or were recommended for treatment?

This project has been approved by the university ethic committee. Please write as much as you can. You can email me using my address below

 removed, please keep all communication in-house 

Your contribution to my study will be most appreciated.

 Sorry for your misunderstanding. I come onto this board with respect, not insults. I get no grant to support my studies. I only try to understand homelessness for my studies, and see if there is anything I can help.

 Your questions seem to be&quot;pre loaded&quot;to assume that anyone who&apos;s homeless is mentally ill. I don&apos;t know if you wrote them or they were handed to you, but they&apos;re very demeaning because of this. A lot of middle-class people are becoming homeless now. It&apos;s not at all impossible that by the time you are done with your schooling, you&apos;ll meet one of your professors in a homeless shelter or on the street.

You need to look at the assumptions built into your questions.

 If my brain were not in healthy working order, I likely would not have chosen this lifestyle. I don&apos;t know whether you see mental illness as the cause of homeless, or homelessness as a cause of mental illness, but one does not create or nurture the other.

 I second that. I found it somewhat unusual and even offensive that the opening post was written in a way that gave me the impression that it was assumed that all homeless people had mental illness. I think it could have been worded a lot better. I realise hough this is all a learning experience. Big Heart I wish you better luck in asking such questions elsewhere, or new questions here, and hope that you learn from this experience. I hope you can understand why i chose to decline to answer your questions. Last edited by RomanaS; 08-03-2010 at 08:27 PM .

 Reply: Homeless experiences from Big Heart I am grateful to all your replies. I didn&apos;t intend to make assumption or offend anyone that homeless people have mental illness. According to some readings, there is an association between homeless and mental illness. I interviewed a few homeless people recently in Australia and got great support from them. They told me they came across many people who had mental health problem. I understand it is a great challenge to interview through online about the experiences of homelessness when people really don&apos;t know me.
I have a humanistic approach, showing respect and non-judgemental attitude toward the disadvantaged. I have done lots of voluntary work in various communities for the disadvantaged, including the sick, the old, the mentally ill, and children. By the way, I am a Chinese little woman, not a man. The homeless people often identify with me as their mother or sister. I have &apos;a thirst for knowledge&apos; (from a homeless person), and would like to help the homelss people.

 Many DO have a mental health problem, the most common being depression due to being HOMELESS.

I will not cooperate with your survey.

 The association between homelessness and mental illness has to do with services. The services are structured for drug addiction and mental illness, or family. If you are not one, then you are one of the others depending on what they design your profile to be. There are no services for people with strong minds, and formed careers, or your run of the mill illnesses. If you have pneumonia, or cancer. There is no cancer hospice. There is no place where a person with a short term or long term illness, other than mental, can gain shelter. And if you don&apos;t know what is wrong with you, think that there is something wrong with you, get refused testing to determine what is wrong with you because the state absolutely flat out refuses to recognize many illnesses to prevent having to spend money on an indigent person, than I guess you have to be mentally ill. But strictly speaking. If the government who takes your taxes out of your paycheck cannot find it to provide within the law a bailout for individuals, and can only provide tiers of a social service ladder that are labled and branded. Then if you want help, then you have to go in and fill out the questionnaire and answer it in exactly the way that the funding guidelines are established. If you don&apos;t, you won&apos;t be enrolled and they won&apos;t get paid. If you do, you are labeled and branded in your&quot;coordinated case management system&quot;.

 My post might be a bit outside the topic of this thread, but let me step in here for a moment regarding health care for people. And I mean ALL people.. It is my opinion and that of many others that every citizen of a country should have access to good quality, but very cheap (or in most cases - FREE) health care. This is of utmost importance to not only the homeless community, but all U.S. citizens.

 Single Payer Health Care: 
You might hear it referred to as&quot;Universal Health Care&quot;or&quot;Medicare For All,&quot;but what it amounts to is a&quot;Cradle-to-Grave, Everybody In / Nobody Out&quot;health care plan for all citizens of a nation. A person receives a health care ID card when they&apos;re born and it stays with them until they die. The card allows them access to receiving medical care anywhere throughout the country. No matter who they are, no matter if they have a million dollars or no dollars and whatever medical treatment they need, they can get medical treatment free or very cheaply. The penniless elderly woman living in a tent with a severe case of pneumonia can get the same care as that of the person living in the big house on the hill.

And this is without the need of emergency room visits, which now often happens. Someone who has been severely injured or amid a crisis stage of a severe illness, but lacking the insurance coverage or the money needed to pay for proper care gets rushed to the emergency room. Ethically, the hospital cannot turn the patient away and so treats the person even though the person will not be able to pay the bill. The bad thing about that is it just drives up the costs of medical treatment for everyone else because that hospital had to raise its rates to make up for the loss.

True, Single Payer might not be perfect, but it would be far far superior than what America has now.

75% of all nurses surveyed are in favor of Single Payer and about the same amount of doctors would prefer to go to some form of a Single Payer plan. Because it&apos;s the most humane and cost effective form of health care, most people surveyed in America were found to be in favor of it.

The recent Health Care Reform Bill that just passed is a F-ing joke. The insurance companies are already raising their rates. I followed much of that fiasco last year and earlier this year that they called a debate. It was ridiculous. They would not even put Single Payer Health Care on the table for simple discussion and arrested those who even mentioned it within the room.

They would not even put a&quot;Public Option&quot;into the Health Care Reform, which would have at least given the insurance companies competition and as a result, helped drive down some of the absurd costs of health insurance.

They called it&quot;Health Care Reform.&quot;A more apt name would be:&quot;A Christmas Present for the Insurance Companies.&quot;

Probably the single biggest contributing factor that makes health care in America, which is provided by these big insurance companies, so astronomically expensive is that it is loaded down with massively excessive and expensive administrative costs.

Get this: One way the insurance companies have found to increase their profits is to deny care !!! Nice, huh !!??? Pay the huge insurance premium, but get nothing for it.

All is not lost though.......
There are and have been several grassroots movements working hard to pass legislation in America to convert to some form of Single Payer Health Care. It&apos;s a big boulder to roll up a big hill, but it can be done if enough people get behind it.

I strongly urge you to at least check out the following two links. And if you have the free time and are able, get behind them and help roll that boulder.

 Jor-El I agree.

Have it like being in the Army. You get hurt, sick, etc you go to the doctor. You don&apos;t limp around on a bad foot until it&apos;s worse and worse and worse and you&apos;re lamed for life. You don&apos;t let a cold turn into pneumonia and let that go until you fall down and someone scraped you up and you&apos;re in the hospital for a bit and then have weak lungs and body for a while and maybe for life.

Just access to simple, preventative care would stop a LOT of ER visits.

As our Empire crashes, what we&apos;re more likely to see are&quot;underground&quot;doctors. Doctors who may or may not hold MD licenses, but will fix ya up, for cash. Quacks will abound, too. Just like in an old Dickens novel. Dickens wrote before the acceptance of the germ theory of disease, antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or coal-tar derivatives. Our going back to Dickensian medicine will not mean the loss of these things, thank God. But it will mean a cash-and-carry, let the buyer beware, type of medicine for most of us.

 Yes, preventative care is one thing. Another is care from situations that we cannot ourselves control, or change. And as much as society would prefer us to just blame ourselves or empower us to think we have control over our bodies. And I know you guys are there on that. I hope that those types of initiatives would address a larger problem.

But its hard for me to take the preventative approach or even the approach of when I&apos;m sick go to the doctor. But I&apos;d have to say I&apos;m jaded from my own experience in going door to door with illness, and having them shut on me. Calling me every diagnosis you could think of till the day I tested blood positive for Lead. It took me 5 years to get that test and I still had lead in my blood. So what was preventative in the 5 years I went door to door seeking help for illness that was refused a recognition? I imagine that isn&apos;t the point of the forum here though.

My thought of course, is how relative my experience is with most homeless people. I see people on the street as having susceptibility to toxic exposure on a 24 hour basis. And I believe a lot of behavioral problems and&quot;mental&quot;illnesses as well as valid physical ones stem from exposure to toxic chemicals while living on the street, as well as nutritional starvation. You can eat all the bulk phlegm in distribution, but all you guys have mentioned the differences in having nutrition access.

 In America, it should not be called&quot;Health Care,&quot;because in reality, it is actually&quot;Sick Care.&quot;

Too many people messing up their own health with years of eating tons of junk food made from genetically modified products, drinking oceans of soda (sugar water), bad habits (smoking, heavy drinking), no exercise, overly stressful lifestyles, not enough sleep,......and all the rest.

Then they&apos;ll waddle into a physician&apos;s office, 100-200-300 or more pounds over-weight, with a pickled liver and breathing problems and expect the doctor to make it all go away with a pill. And 99.99% of the doctors, having been trained in traditional western medicine will prescribe a pill or maybe two pills. Perhaps even 3 or 4 pills. Doctors are not able to follow their patients around all day, every day, making sure they all live healthful lifestyles. True, they will often recommend that the patient lose weight, quit bad habits, get more sleep and manage the stress, but that is usually the end of it. Prescribing medication is easy. Adapting and maintaining a truly healthful lifestyle after decades of a bad one requires work. Most people, when given the choice between work and a pill, will reach for the pill. Doctors are well aware of this. That&apos;s why pills rule the day in the land of our so-called&quot;Health Care System.&quot;

So as a result, it&apos;s assembly line management of sickness after the fact. Kind of like waiting until there is a car accident at an intersection before the town puts up a traffic light.

Wreck your health. Go on medication. Stay on that same medication for the rest of your life. Forget about addressing the root cause of the illness. Cure in a bottle.

Food:
Unfortunately, when a person is homeless, eating a truly healthful diet on a daily basis can be very difficult and in many cases, totally out of the question. If you are homeless and are able to do a little shopping at the supermarket, most of the fruits and vegetables that are found at most grocery stores these days is&quot;suspect.&quot;Heavily sprayed with chemical fertilizers, genetically modified, much of it grown on huge&quot;industrialized factory farms&quot;. Fake food. Dangerous food. Eat at your own risk.

Another factor is that soils on many of these farms are becoming deplete in certain minerals in the soil (Selenium being one of them) due to over-farming, which results in food that lacks proper nutritional quality.

Livestock on these massive industrialized ranches are pumped with steroids and antibiotics and fed a diet that is not natural for the animal (cows being fed corn, when cows are actually grass consuming creatures). Some of this unnatural animal food even contains their own feces. Chickens being confined and packed into tiny areas and fed diets that make them grow big and fat quickly. Many chickens developing breathing problems and dieing under their own unnatural weight because their legs cannot support them.

This is to say nothing of the miles of shelves at supermarkets lined with heavily processed and sugar-based food and beverages.

The food supply that most people are confronted with has become an ugly scene. But most of this goes unnoticed because it is all done&quot;behind the scenes.&quot;Place a pretty picture of farmer Joe standing on his pristine bucolic farm on the package, but peek behind the curtain and see a laboratory of test tubes and chemical vats.

So what does one do? Buy fresh produce and meat at small markets where the fruits and vegetables are all organically grown on small local farms without chemical fertilizers and the meat is from animals that graze on natural diets and not injected with chemicals ?

That can be very expensive. Most people I know who are employed full time, married and raising families would have a hard time affording this kind of grocery shopping on a week-to-week basis. Food at the regular supermarkets has become relatively cheap. Most of it not very good, but it is affordable for the average family. So it is the preferred option for most working people whether they are raising families or not . But if a person is homeless, that might not even be an option, since you do need to store the food, refrigerate some of it and eventually cook some of it. So in most cases, a person living on the streets, having no means of storing, refrigerating or cooking food, relies instead on processed and packaged food, food that requires no cooking or if it is cooked, it has been cooked by someone else (fast food restaurant). Or they might rely on food at shelters in which case that food is most likely standard supermarket food from industrialized factory farms. Over the long term, this is a lifestyle that can severely compromise one&apos;s health.

This is a dilemma.

Some bright lights on the horizon:
I do see a small but growing public awareness to the poor quality of the food supply in America and an increasing shift away from food grown and raised on Industrial factory farms. More and more small&quot;Farmers Markets&quot;are appearing in towns and cities selling locally grown produce. Detroit, Michigan seems to be leading the charge for going back to small local farms (a Google search or two will give you a great many links to these types of organizations in that area), and I even see expanding organic produce sections at local supermarkets. So, even though it is hopeful to see these things happening, I also hope it translates into lower and lower prices for it. Time will tell.

Who knows, you might even see a day when there is a 180 degree flip to this situation - where heavily processed junk food will be very expensive and better quality organically raised produce and meat from grass fed cattle and free range chickens from small local farms will be the cheaper of the two. It will certainly take a while, but I think it could eventually happen.

We all need to eat, so let the food we eat be life-giving and not life-taking. Last edited by Jor-EL; 08-18-2010 at 02:41 AM .

 A thought about the foods of the homelessness Thanks for the recent discussion on homelessness regarding to health care or sick care. I am too very concerned with the foods that the homeless people eat. From my interactions with a few homeless people, they don&apos;t have a balanced diet. Some can hardly have a properly meal if they don&apos;t bother to the food vans, all they have may be cheap junk foods, alcohol (is like the main diet), and they often have stomach problems or pain. I try to cook a healthy homemade meal for them when i meet them, as an expression of my care.

 I am a recovering crack addict of 14 years and have been homeless because of my addiction for a considerable length of time. I am mainstream now. I am not mentally Ill (are any of us mentally well).

I personally do not consider your request as an affront. I see it as seeking by an acquiring mind. Yes, your questions could have been phrased more tactfully but if I was mired in the condition you are speaking of I would take your survey.

Do not become disheartened by the comments or lack of participation you have received here keep on seeking just attempt to be sensitive and mindful of those that have been there.

 I&quot;m sure he meant&quot;inquiring mind&quot;but&quot;acquiring mind&quot;is probably more often the case with so-called charities that make huge profits off of poor people.

 Thanks for the messages Hi, sorry I haven&apos;t join in the chat recently and missed out some of the encouraging messages. Thanks Ron for your kind words, hope you can share with us more of your homeless experiences, and thanks Garlic Breathe.
Can you give me some ideas of how to frame the questions to be more acceptable online here? Face to face is different, people can see me and know that I show respect, non-judgemental attitude, and are interested in their stories, with an &apos;inquiring mind&apos;.

I also agree with the concern about the toxics the homeless people may have in the street. Recently I interviewed a homeless person in the street, he told me he picked up the throw away foods in the rubbish tip. I am also concerned with the huge amount of alcohol consumption that would damage their health physically and mentally.

 One dietary problem is, a lot of homeless people tend to have dental problems.

Due to a fairly high level of public health in the US and widespread vaccinations etc., I told myself there was little to fear from leftovers from people&apos;s plates. I was at times given leftovers that were half-eaten etc but, frankly, my chances of acquiring a &apos;bug&quot;was already there from the kitchen staff, rather than from the nice middle-class people who gave them to me.

Along with the dental problems, a lot of homeless people come from a social class where it&apos;s not the norm to eat a lot of vegetables. Hence you have food preferences working against you.

I&apos;m not sure about a&quot;huge&quot;amount of alcohol consumption. To give an idea, I paid, with panhandling money, to sleep on the couch of an alcoholic who had an apartment. One Thanksgiving, we went to a restaurant in downtown Mountain View, California, which serves a free meal to all comers. It&apos;s their way of saying Thanks for their success over the years. So, we went. Then, he suggested we go to The Eagles, a fraternal organization he&apos;s a member of, and I said, Sure. I discovered that Boddington Pub Ale pints were $2, very cheap for drinking in a bar. Since I&apos;d allocated $10 to drink on, I was put right into happy territory and commenced. I drank up my $10, plus my friend bought me a couple. A 2nd Thanksgiving meal occurred, due to the fine people at Eagles, a sort of pot-luck, but not strictly so, and in fine American style there was plenty for all. So I ate well and just has to wash that down ....

The end result was, I was three sheets to the wind as they say, I got REALLY drunk, it was glorious. I know I had something like 7 pints. Now my friend, whom I watched, had either 3 or 4 vodka and cranberries. Each one equivalent to one of my pints. Vodka and cran is his drink of choice, as a career alcoholic, they&apos;re a good drink. Not too expensive, hit hard, and the cran makes it taste OK. I got grandly and gloriously drunk, he got blotto. I had to watch him walking home, keep him from stepping out into traffic, tell him which streets to turn on. The next morning, as I was eating leftovers I&apos;d taken home for breakfast, he tottered into the living room and had no memory of what&apos;d happened. I had to fill him in.

Thus is the difference between a fairly healthy constitution and liver, and one that&apos;s not. The career alkies just don&apos;t drink that much. Only a little sends them reeling. It takes good food and fairly clean living to be able to go on a really epic drunk. I&apos;d gone through $20 worth of beer at supermarket prices. My friend&apos;s vodka and crans could have been bought for under $8, a hip-flask of cheap vodka and a bottle of cran juice. Well under.

So when you get to the economics of the drinking of homeless people, when you really do some field research, you find that it actually costs very little. They&apos;re generally weak and tired, feeble enough constitutionally, that the alcohol they live for is only enough to give a normal person a healthy buzz. They&apos;re not your fairly healthy and well-fed Uncle who&apos;s on a pension going through a 5th of Maker&apos;s Mark a night. They&apos;re getting shite-faced on $4 or $5 worth of booze a day, if that. That&apos;s a pack of cigs, or a Starbucks concoction.

The biggest problem with homeless alcoholism is, they forget to eat and otherwise maintain themselves. They&apos;re not panhandling and making $100 a day and staying drunk on that, they&apos;re panhandling and making $10 a day and staying drunk on that, and not eating.

 I agree with the dental problems. It is quite amazing to me that society allows the separation of health coverage to disclude your mouth and teeth. First, lack of teeth is a primary turnkey for a person&apos;s acceptability back into mainstream society. Without teeth you aren&apos;t trusted, you are turned down for at least a counter or work with the public job, you certainly aren&apos;t going to get a job in the film industry, unless its a part for being on the street. And more seriously, it is a breeding ground for bacteria and infection. Once your teeth start going, you can guarantee that your immune system is now completely compromised. I believe some body infections are caused by tooth infections unchecked or gum disease. The enormous costs associated with maintaining and fixing your teeth, coupled with the mandatory $500 check in and look at the teeth, get the xrays and schedule the next visit, is a guarantee that someone on the street will not be getting off the street any time soon.

As far as the alcohol, I pretty much agree with the g-man. Especially the part, that alcoholics only panhandle when they are out of alcohol. It is only a very small population of high functioning alcoholics that will panhandle with a beer in their hands. Unless they are high on something else, to which they will nurse the bigger addiction with a beer till the addiction is fed.

One look at the reservations in the United States, or any other area, where alcohol is strictly regulated, and it is obvious, that when alcohol is restricted or banned from a person, that person will only go and get &apos;oceans&apos; which is lysol, or mouthwash, or hairspray, or after shave.

One would think that would help someone clean up, but when any chemical is consumed it is a toxic transfer.

In terms of Euthenasia, and social cleansing, one would have thought society would agree that beer and liquor were kinder gentler forms of alcohol assisted suicides.

 Thanks. I also notice that the homeless people that I met have the same dental issue. I am very sensitive to oral health as my first 2 jobs were dental nurse. Access to public dental health care isn&apos;t easy, and the waiting list is very discouraging.

I notice too that taking &apos;port&apos; is very popular as they are affordable. Another point is drinking serves as a means of social interaction (my perspective is humanistic social science), there is a drinking culture in the street, especially on Friday night and at the weekends.
