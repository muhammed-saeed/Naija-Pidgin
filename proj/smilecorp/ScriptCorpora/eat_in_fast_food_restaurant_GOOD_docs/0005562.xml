Best Disneyland Restaurants
 AOL PICK from our Editors 
Disneyland restaurants aren&apos;t generally known for earthshattering cuisine, but you&apos;ll find plenty of hearty options—even a few standouts—to tide you over. Dining at Disney isn’t cheap, however. While the restaurants offer a wide range of prices, plan on dropping at least $30 a day on food per adult and $20 a day per child. To save money, pack your own lunch and have a picnic at the park. (No glass bottles or alcohol allowed, though.) There are lockers available for your small cooler ($7 - $15 per day depending on locker size, located on Main Street, in Sunshine Plaza and in the Esplanade between the parks). And be sure to pack plenty of water and snacks to keep the gang going throughout the day. Here are our top picks for the best restaurants in Disneyland Resort.

 
 Napa Rose 
 Neighborhood: Disneyland Park
 Price: Expensive Named after California&apos;s famous wine valley, this award-winning restaurant at Disney&apos;s Grand Californian Hotel&amp;Spa was named Most Popular Restaurant in the 2008 and 2009 Zagat Surveys for Orange County. A reflection of its home state, the restaurant features a creative menu of wine country-inspired dishes, with a heavy emphasis on seafood. Try the hand-harvested diver scallops or the popular $45 appetizer, Seven Sparkling Sins, which offers seven mouth-watering creations including curried crab taco, tangerine grilled scallop and shrimp in a cucumber wrap. (With a price tag like that, you&apos;ll want to savor every bite!) Expert sommeliers are on hand to pair that perfect wine with your meal. The restaurant dining room continues the Arts and Crafts design of the hotel and some seats offer views of the open kitchen so you can watch all the action. Another section of the restaurant features a picture window with views of Disney California Adventure. Reservations are a must.

 Steakhouse 55 
 Neighborhood: Disneyland Park
 Price: Expensive This upscale restaurant at Disneyland Hotel is an obvious draw for steak lovers (think New York steak, filet mignon and roasted prime rib), but offers tasty seafood dishes as well. The prix fixe menu is the best value: For $35, you get the Caesar salad, Petite New York Steak and Seasonal Tart a La Mode. Other popular dishes include the Seven Onion Soup appetizer and the Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb. Be sure to try the Bonita Velvet Chocolate Bar for dessert, a flourless cake with a port wine reduction. Reservations can be made through the Disney reservations line at (714) 781-DINE.

 Naples Ristorante e Pizzeria 
 Neighborhood: Downtown Disney
 Price: Moderate If the weather is nice, head to this popular Downtown Disney eatery. Their large outdoor patio is a good place to people watch and enjoy classic Neapolitan cuisine. Even if you eat inside, the food here is tasty, with favorites that include wood-fired pizzas, Caprese salad and fresh herb pastas. Naples has some 20 wines by the glass, including Italian and California vintages. Reservations are strongly recommended. If you&apos;re in a hurry, you can buy pizza by the slice at Napolini, their quick-service location.

 Blue Bayou 
 Neighborhood: Disneyland Park
 Price: Moderate Since opening in 1967, this Cajun-style eatery has become a favorite with several generations of visitors. Located inside the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction, the restaurant is something of an attraction itself. Guests—and especially kids—like sitting &quot;outdoors&quot; under the lantern-lit skies, surrounded by twinkling fireflies and the sounds of frogs and crickets, watching boats filled with guests drift by. The lunch and dinner menus feature Louisiana favorites including jambalaya, Monte Cristo sandwiches and fresh-baked pecan pie. Blue Bayou is very popular, so make reservations as far in advance as possible (up to 60 days ahead are accepted).

 Goofy&apos;s Kitchen 
 Neighborhood: Disneyland Park
 Price: Moderate If you want to take in one of Disney&apos;s famous &quot;character meals&quot; this is the one. Located in the Disneyland Hotel, this all-you-can-eat buffet is hosted by Goofy himself (with a little help from his friends). The kid-friendly food includes favorites such as peanut butter pizza (which is surprisingly good), pizza, pasta and prime rib. The breakfast buffet has made-to-order omelets, Mickey Mouse-shaped waffles and fresh baked pastries. Be sure to bring your camera to take advantages of the photo ops. You&apos;ll need reservations for Goofy&apos;s Kitchen so be sure to make them on the Disney reservations hotline. Same day reservations aren&apos;t accepted, but they will put you on the standby list.

 Carnation Cafe 
 Neighborhood: Disneyland Park
 Price: Budget If you want kid-pleasing staples at more affordable prices, this no-frills fast food restaurant on Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland will do the trick. The old fashioned, outdoor café is especially nice during the spring, when the nearby flower planters are filled with colorful blooms. Breakfast items include Mickey Mouse waffles and sticky buns, while sandwich plates, such as the Café Steak Melt and croissant chicken club are the big draw at lunch and dinner. Our favorite desserts are the fresh apple pie and the banana split.

 Pacific Wharf Cafe 
 Neighborhood: California Adventure
 Price: Budget The Boudin Bakery is an icon in San Francisco, and you can sample some of this artisanal bakery&apos;s handiwork at the Pacific Wharf Café in Disney California Adventure. The counter service eatery is located next to Paradise Bay, and is best known for hearty soups—Monterey clam chowder, Bakersfield broccoli and cheese and Santa Rosa corn chowder—served in a sourdough bread bowl. Kids may prefer the Kid&apos;s Turkey Qrap or Kid&apos;s Power Pack, with string cheese, yogurt, apples and fish crackers.
