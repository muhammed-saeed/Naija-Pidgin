 Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster Review: A Must Have Toaster. 

by admin on October 15, 2010 
 
 If you like egg and muffin sandwiches you are going to need the Back to Basics egg and muffin toaster. The toaster can make delicious egg and muffin sandwiches that are far better than your local fast food restaurant in only four minutes. That&apos;s faster than you can get in the car and have it backed out of the driveway.

Versatility is the key to this egg and muffin toaster. When it comes to breakfast, this handy appliance can steam-poach eggs and warm your meat of choice while toasting four pieces of bread, croissants, bagels or English muffins. Breakfast is ready in no time with the help of this Back to Basics toaster.

The Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster is currently on sale on Amazon for 37% off with free shipping through this link right here .

Included is an egg basket that will allow soft boiling or hard boiling eggs as well. The basket will handle eight at a time. If you are not having meat for breakfast or even if you are, use the meat trays for heating fruit, such as sliced pineapple or a tomato slice and add to your sandwich. The ideas for breakfast just keep coming when using this handy 4 slot egg and muffin toaster.

A dual control will allow you to choose the functions you are going to use. The egg/toast or plain toast, just eggs, bagels, defrost your English muffins and select from lightly toasted to a darker shade are all part of the selection you will have using this egg and muffin toaster. This appliance has a lift function for getting smaller pieces of bread out of the toaster. This is a great feature to keep from burning your fingers.

 Let&apos;s take a look at features of the Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster: 

 4-slice toaster makes egg-and-muffin sandwiches in about 4 minutes Toasts while steam-poaching eggs and warming pre-cooked meat Egg/toast, toast, and egg functions; hard- or soft-boil up to 8 eggs Dual control panel; bagel and defrost settings; shade control; cord storage Measures approximately 16 by 11 by 8 inches; 1-year warranty 

In addition, the outside of the egg and muffin baker stays cool to the touch thus lessening the risk of getting burned. Safety wise these are both good features that all toasters should have especially when used by children. Since it is rather large to accommodate all the features, it is not suitable for a small kitchen unless you have some where to store it when it is not in use. It will fit much more naturally in a larger kitchen. At about 16 inches by 11 inches by 8 inches the egg and muffin toaster is great for families.

If you want to buy this toaster, I highly recommend you buy them through Amazon here . You won’t find them cheaper anywhere else.

A benefit if you are making toast and eggs at the same time is if the toast is done before the egg, this toaster will hold the toast and keep it warm until the egg finished cooking. When the egg is finished cooking, the toast pops up and the cooker turns off simultaneously and breakfast is ready. How much simpler could breakfast be?

Let me show you what current owners have to say about it.

Craig Balson,
 
So here I am with a toaster that I am tired of, because I have had it for 6 years and I can not get it to toast anything right, especially english muffins. As I am looking around the internet to see what my options may be at my local everything stores, I come across this silly looking toaster I am reviewing. As I read what it does I am interested, but the sight I am at only has a few reviews, so I look for more and find them at Amazon. I read them all, because even though I am interested, I am worried its a gimmick. You see, I make a home cooked breakfast, as opposed to cereal or poptarts or some other packed thing, every Sunday. A very frequent request from the wife and kids is to make egg and muffin sandwiches. It is not the hardest thing in the world to make but takes time when you have to cook and toast and heat everything seperately. So here I am looking at a toaster that cooks everything at once and finishes at the same time. Well, the positive reviews far out number the negative so I go for it and order it from Amazon.

This thing is wonderful. It does what it says and does it well. I have made egg and muffin sandwiches in the morning for the kids, and myself, before school and have not had a single problem. I do truely love this toaster. To address a couple of the negative comments I read that gave me the most pause, the new appliance smell does exist when you turn it on. That is why the manual tells you to dry run the toaster. I did mine twice and did not have any unusal smells when I cooked with it. As far as making soft eggs, who wants a soft egg on a eat as you run sandwich? I use the medium setting and have no problem.

 Review Paraphrased for size – view original full review here. 
 
At just under $60, depending on where you buy it, this is a good price for what the appliance does. Because it is not just a toaster, you can make your entire breakfast with this handy muffin and egg toaster. The egg and muffin toaster comes with a one year warranty. There is also a two slice model available but for two or more people, the Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster certainly fulfills the job it promises.

 T-Fal TT7461002 Avante Deluxe 4-Slice Toaster Review 

by admin on October 15, 2010 
 
 The Avante Deluxe 4-slice toaster is 1800 watts of power for toasting. The choice of 2 or 4 slices to be toasted is an option and the slots are extra wide so you can toast wider bread as well as other breakfast items that require more space. The slots self adjust to accommodate the items put into the toaster.

In addition, the toaster has 7 levels and a reheat as well as a bagel function. The toaster also contains a cancel button in case you change your mind. The typical bottom tray removal for crumbs is present.

Not too large, it will fit in most kitchen space nicely. The toaster is 12 inches tall, 14 inches long and 13 inches wide and weighs about 9 pounds. The Avante is designed to look quite attractive in virtually any kitchen; it has a stainless steel front and it is angled so that toasting can be easier than ever before. It may seem a bit larger than the average 4 slice toasters but it is really just the shape of the
toaster that gives that impression.

The T-Fal TT7461002 Avante Deluxe 4-Slice Toaster is currently on sale on Amazon for 20% off with free shipping through this link right here .

In addition, this toaster is a good choice for kids to make their own toast. Since the front is angled they can reach the toast or bagel or English muffin much easier. Remaining cool to the touch during operation is a plus for the Avante Deluxe as this increases safety for adults and children.

The high-speed heating method allows you to have toast much faster (40% faster than regular toasters). The technology that allows for toasting bagels toasts it from the inside, warming the outside. A lever that allows for higher lifting makes removing smaller items from the toaster easier and safer.

The reheat is great for reheating toast that may have gotten cold before it was eaten and the toasting levels will lightly toast or go to a full brown depending upon which one of the seven levels you prefer. The features that people seem to prefer this toaster for are the middle controls that allow lifting smaller bread up so it is easier to get out of the toaster.

When it comes to the features T-Fal would have scored more points had they included the reheat and the bagel buttons on both sides of the toaster. They only work on the left two slots so making more than 2 bagels or re-heating more than 2 pieces of toast at a time is not possible. This would have been a handy feature for making bagels for more than one person at a time. As it stands, it does very well on bagels from the side that does heat them.

If you want to buy this toaster, I highly recommend you buy them through Amazon here . You won’t find them cheaper anywhere else.

The Avante Deluxe 4-slice toaster is not going to be a good idea for those who have smaller kitchens because it will take up some space as would a regular 4 slice toaster. The space for this toaster ideally is in a larger kitchen. Overall, the Avante Deluxe made by T-Fal is a good toaster especially if you have a larger family and if you like bagels or English muffins as well as toast. Ranging in price from $55 to $69, the toaster is a bit pricey but has more options than most.
