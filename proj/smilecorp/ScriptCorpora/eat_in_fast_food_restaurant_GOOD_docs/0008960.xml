 Car crashes into a fast-food restaurant caught on security cam 
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA
A Plantation man has been charged in connection with a crash that sent a car into a fast-food restaurant, injuring three people.

Derek H. Korfel was charged with failure to use due care and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries after the incident in the Popeyes Chicken&amp;Biscuits parking lot in the 1300 block of West Sunrise Boulevard at about noon Thursday.

Korfel&apos;s green 2003 Jaguar rear-ended a gold 2005 Honda turning to enter the restaurant&apos;s parking lot, sending the Honda, and the driver Joyce H. Monroe of Fort Lauderdale, into the east side of the restaurant.

Korfel, 47, continued driving west on Sunrise Boulevard until his vehicle broke down in a parking lot in the 1700 block, behind a Burger King.

A witness who followed Korfel called police.

The crash caused significant damage to the restaurant and minor injuries to a customer and two employees.

The Honda driver, Joyce H. Monroe of Fort Lauderdale, was not hurt.
