Not all fast food is unhealthy and bad. The biggest fast food chains tend to sell a range of merchandise that seem to be designed to damage their patrons&apos; health. But even some of the most notoriously unhealthy fast food chains have introduced healthier options onto their menus.

The widely held perception that fast food is synonymous with junk food is overturned by many fast food restaurants that serve fast, healthy and tasty meals. The Far East has many restaurants that serve healthy, wholesome and tasty fast foods, ranging from sushi bars to noodle or rice based meals. There are Mediterranean chains serving kebabs and tasty dips.
 
Nando&apos;s is one example of a fast food restaurant chain that stands out by providing high quality, healthy fast food. Nando&apos;s originated in South Africa selling Portuguese style flame-grilled chicken. With humble origins as a tiny restaurant in Johannesburg&apos;s southern suburbs, Nando&apos;s acquired an almost legendary reputation. Branches were opened all over South Africa .

Nando&apos;s developed its brand by maintaining the high standard in its branches supported by a string of zany and often controversial advertising campaigns. The brand has been extended to many countries around the world.

The chain uses premium chickens. Excess fat is trimmed away and the chickens are marinated for 24 hours before being grilled to order.

While cooking, Nando&apos;s chickens are basted with a choice of sauces including lemon and herb, mild peri-peri to extra hot peri-peri. In stark contrast to many of the fast food chains found in every shopping centre and high street, these chickens are low in fat and high in protein. No chemicals are used in the cooking process and Nando&apos;s products contain only natural ingredients. No preservatives, MSG, artificial flavourings or colorants are added to any of the products.

Nando&apos;s chickens and chicken burgers are flame grilled and never fried. The grilling process reduces the fat content further.

Nando&apos;s chips are deep fried, but may be substituted with rice and other alternatives. A variety of fresh salads are always available to supplement a Nando&apos;s meal.

Since its inception, Nando&apos;s have introduced a range of products that are available world-wide. These include a range of quality sauces used in their cooking.

Nando&apos;s have opened a number of Kosher and Halaal outlets around the world to cater for Jewish and Muslim dietary requirements.

Rather than following the traditional route of making each restaurant look identical, Nando&apos;s prides itself on the fact that restaurant is unique. The food is always of the same high standard, but each venue has its own distinct look and feel.

An Israeli fast food restaurant based in Johannesburg, South Africa - Schuwarma Co. - serves authentic Israeli and Mediterranean food. Most of the items on the menu are traditional Middle Eastern dishes. The food is good and the restaurant has earned good reviews by top food critics.

The menu offers a choice of pita filled with falafel, humus and techina, shuwarmas (ground beef, lamb or chicken), lamb or chicken kebabs or an excellent fillet or rump steak. Large portions are served on a plate, and all meals include a choice of salads - you may choose six to accompany the food. Side orders include chips or rice and most of the dishes are flame grilled.

Fast food is not always junk food. There are many examples around the world of real foods being offered by fast food restaurants. Not all fast food is full of fat, sugar and MSG. Look for those that offer real food and you are in for a good healthy meal.
