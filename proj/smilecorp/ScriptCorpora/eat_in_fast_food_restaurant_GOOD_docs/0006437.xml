Crazy But Effective Dating Tips On How To Win A Girl&apos;s Heart
 
 How To Win A Girl Over 
 
 If you are looking for some killer dating, love and seduction techniques and tips on how to win a girl over then you are at the right place. The truth is that it is pretty easy to win over a girl’s heart, provided you know what you are doing, of course. The problem is that there is just too much nonsense when it comes to dating and seduction advice–much of which are given out by slimy“relationship gurus”who are out to make a quick buck out of poor guys who have problems in their relationships.

 Who can they blame? 

If you are looking for some good advice and techniques on how to get a girl to like you and quickly win her over, then you will find plenty of help here. Read on to discover how you can win a girl’s heart and some guaranteed methods to win her over–even though she has rejected you.

How To Win A Girl’s Heart–Proven Strategies To Win A Girl Over

 First, learn some hypnosis. It is proven that such techniques (and those which are based on human psychology and persuasion) tend to work effectively well when it comes to dating and seducing women. It’s no surprise that much of the current seduction knowledge base is entirely built upon the hypnosis and neuro linguistic programming (NLP) body of knowledge. Therefore, if you want to learn how to win a girl over using seduction techniques then it will be useful for you to get an understanding of how love and relationships based on hypnosis work. Go for it–it is worthwhile in the long run. I don’t mean that you should go and enroll yourself in a weekend hypnosis course at your local college, but start by reading up on books on female psychology and persuasion such as those by Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Derek Rake. Practice with women you meet everywhere. Now it’s relatively easy to just read up on some books giving out relationship advice. The harder thing is to go out there and practice what you have learned. Start by going to the local bookstore or coffee shop. Then, approach the first girl that you see (does not matter whether the girl is hot or not). Then, use the seduction techniques you learned here at this website (or at JamTank.com or elsewhere). You may fail to impress a girl the first time, but keep on going. With enough practice, you will be able to know how to win a girl’s heart quickly and effectively using these love tactics. Groom like a pro. Let’s face it–girls won’t date guys who look sloppy. It’s even worse if you spot a 35-inch belly. Lose the fat by hitting the gym. Whoever who tells you that looks are not important is pulling your leg. Go work out and start lifting weights. 

Now what happens when the girl you like has already rejected you? Fret not, my friend, for I have got you covered as well. Read on to discover the killer relationship tricks that you can use to get your ex-girlfriend back and get her to love you more than ever…

How To Win A Girl’s Heart Back–Even Though She Has Already Rejected You

 We all know that rejection hurts like hell. There is, however, a method that you can use to win a girl if you don’t mind using some killer psychology and persuasion techniques. Here are a couple of these“female psychology loophole”techniques and tricks that will make a woman come running into your arms even though she may have broken your heart before…

 Firstly, gain some composure. Remember that confidence is the number one factor on how girls would rate their boyfriends. Don’t be desperate. Instead, think of what you can offer a girl in a relationship and focus on that. Be the best boyfriend you can be. Always be there for her, and care for her even though she has rejected you. Act as if you are her boyfriend already. Call her everyday and every night before she goes to sleep. This way she will fall asleep thinking about you. She might just dream about you and her being together, and in love! Ask her reasons why she rejected you. She might think that you are a fat slob (easy fix–just hit the gym!), or if she is already attached to another guy. If this is the reason, then continue reading and I will show you how to win a girl’s heart who has a boyfriend . Go on… 

How To Win A Girl Over Even Though She Is Already Attached

You must use Boyfriend Destroyer techniques–plain and simple. If you are not already using these dating and advanced seduction techniques then you are losing out–plain and simple. Go Google it and then buy whatever you see. These are not conventional techniques, but if you use them you will be able to upgrade your relationships and date whatever women you wish. It’s really that powerful. Otherwise, go read the complete SeductionFAQ website ( http://www.seductionfaq.com/blog ) and you will be able to upgrade your seduction skills and be the ultimate pickup artist that you ever wanted to be.
