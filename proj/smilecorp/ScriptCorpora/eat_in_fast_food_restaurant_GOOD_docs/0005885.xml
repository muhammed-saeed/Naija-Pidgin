 Join the Team 

High Tech Burrito is not just another fast food restaurant. We’re much better. Our success stems from our commitment to our food, our people and our service. We know continued success is based on maintaining this at a higher level than anyone else; that’s why we’re fully committed to:
 
Our People 

While many restaurants hire just about anyone, we specifically look for only the most promising and energetic people. We want friendly, helpful, quick-thinking, resourceful, honest, imaginative and dedicated team players. We’re all equally important parts of the family; we expect a lot from our people and we pay higher-than-standard wages in return. The result is a quality team that makes things smoother, better, and more fun for everyone involved.

 Our Service 

Most casual dining restaurants prioritize speed over service–but not at High Tech Burrito. Quality is job #1; our food is prepared as fast as possible but never in sacrifice of accuracy or customer service. We answer every customer question in helpful, professional manner, and our staff is always friendly, even when the pressure’s on. When customers have questions, we answer them in a helpful manner. We know that the best way to build a relationship with a customer is to make them feel welcomed and valued every visit; in return, our customers keep coming back for food and service they love.

 Our Food 

Casual dining can be tasty and nutritious thanks to High Tech Burrito. Our food is delicious and chock full of the things that promote a healthy body, all at a great price. We use only the highest quality ingredients so that our customers can feel good about the food they love–something we’re very proud of.

At High Tech Burrito, we believe employee happiness is critical to company success. Our company policy is a total commitment to the personal growth and development of every employee. Our full-production kitchen creates gourmet food far beyond what you’ll find at fast-food restaurants; we take pride in being part of the restaurant industry and nothing is more important than delivering customer satisfaction. To ensure this, we provide extensive training that guarantees quality service and food for our customers. Sure, our employees are making burritos, but our employees also contribute energy and enthusiasm to the High Tech Burrito team and deliver on our promise to make the best burrito any where. Maybe that&apos;s why High Tech Burrito has some of the best employee retention rates in the industry! 

If you&apos;re looking for an opportunity to learn about the restaurant industry, make great food, work with wonderful people, and make a difference in a company&apos;s future, then High Tech Burrito wants to talk to you. We offer:

 Excellent training Competitive pay and benefits Livable, flexible hours and vacation/paid personal days Management training programs and opportunities for advancement A true teamwork environment and, of course, good eatin&apos;!
