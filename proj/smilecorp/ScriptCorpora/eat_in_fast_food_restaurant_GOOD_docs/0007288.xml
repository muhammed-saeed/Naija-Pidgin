Set Up A Chili Bar + All-Purpose Chili Recipe!
 January 31, 2012 By Chris 30 Comments 
 

Today I’m sharing an idea that you can use for Fall or Winter entertaining , as well as a timely idea for Super Bowl&amp;other Football gatherings . I thought,‘what could be more hearty, manly, and versatile than a chili bar?’I didn’t want to do a chili tasting or cook-off because I think most people have seen that already. Instead I thought about the many ways you can serve chili using one all-purpose recipe. This is how it usually goes at my house: First round is chili&amp;tortillas, next day leftovers are served over pasta, at a fast food restaurant we order chili&amp;baked potato, or chili cheese fries, etc.

This is a fun way to set up a buffet for friends and even the kids loved making their own variations. Using some printable tags from Party Box Designs I set up and labeled lots of chili toppers + root beer. You can see my list of options below, plus the delicious recipe I used that goes with everything !

 

 Base items available for topping with the chili :

 Pasta Tortillas Hot Dogs Crinkle cut french fries Small bags of Fritos corn chips Baked Potatoes 

 Toppings: 

 Shredded cheese Sour Cream Diced Onion Sliced Jalapenos Diced Tomatoes other condiments like ketchup&amp;mustard for the hot dogs 

Combine the base items with the chili and select toppings and you have a great meal.  I suggest small servings so you can have more than one combo–you may even want to cut the hot dogs in half.  One of my personal favorites is the Fritos bags that you can just grab and go .  You fill the bag with the chili and toppings and eat right out of the bag!

To hide the not-so-attractive crock pot, I wrapped it with burlap .  I served root beer from a large urn, which you could also fill with beer of course.

This chili bar was a huge hit with the family.  The husband loved it, the kids loved it, and it could even be used for a tween or teen birthday buffet .

Genius! So manly, yet so adorable! And wrapping the crock pot! Love the options to do it yourself! ♥

I’m so doing this on Sunday! So easy and you can feed even the pickiest eaters! Btw, another great chili topping is French fried onions, you know the kind you put on old fashioned green bean casserole. They definitely Iadd some extra flavor and texture!
