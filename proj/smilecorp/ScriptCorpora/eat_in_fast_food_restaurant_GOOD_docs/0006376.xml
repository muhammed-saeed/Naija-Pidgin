Mr. Meaty TV Show Facts
 Love 1 Hate 0 Courtesy of Nickelodeon 
What do you get when you let two underachieving teens loose in a Fast Food joint? Funny stuff apparently, especially when they&apos;re puppets . Kidzworld checks out Mr. Meaty.

Main Characters
 Josh Redgrove - 16 year-old Josh is into checking out girls , making movies , and indie-punk. His main objective in life is being cool. But it&apos;s hard to keep your cool when you work at Mr. Meaty. Working the front counter, he&apos; s the first line of defense against crazed holiday shoppers , health inspectors and tar monsters , all of which make it very difficult to carry on a good conversation with a cute girl. Josh has big dreams of being a filmmaker/ rockstar , and with Parker&apos;s help, he just might make it. Until then, he&apos;s goind his best just to keep his hipster haircut out of the grease. Parker Dinkleman - To 15 year-old Parker, girls are still aliens (except for video game elf babes) and action figures are still cool (in private, anyway). He&apos;s totally into horror movies and is determined to make the ultimate gore-fest with his old pal Josh, even though Josh spends was too much of his time flirting with girls . Parker&apos;s inability to bathe on a regular basis is the main reason he works in the kitchen and not out front with Josh. Not that this bothers him. At his ultra high-tech food station, he can fry up a chicken (or a pair of boots), run a gravy diagnostic , and open up a dimensional wormhole in the microwave all at the same time. 
Fun Facts
 Mr. Meaty started as a series of shorts during CBC&apos;s The Void . Each half hour features two 15 minute episodes. Show creator Jason Hopley never worked in a fast-food restaurant, but did work behin the counter at a movie theater . Mr. Meaty was the third Nickelodeon/CBC Television co-production, following Little Bear and Pelswick .
