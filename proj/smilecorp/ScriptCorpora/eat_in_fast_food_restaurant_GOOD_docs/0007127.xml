Pizza Hut Iftaar Deal
 By kar_umar October 6th, 2006 @ 2:55 PM Food and Drink 
There was a time when Pizza Hut was a preferred place for Iftaar but now it has become one of the worst. There is absolutely no quality control, be it salad or pizza, yet the place stays crowded as if they are giving away free pizzas. You have to be at the outlet over an hour before sunset in order to get a table. Otherwise you have to wait. They allowed smoking on the enitre floor (@ Bahadurabad Outlet) which made it worse than a saddar bus station. And I can go on and on about how bad the pizza tasted. That was probably the last time I went to Pizza Hut for Iftaar.

It has become evidently clear that the only intention of Pizza Hut management is to make easy money from this Iftaar deal. They don’t really care about the quality.

umar: perhaps a little off-topic but your smoking comment caught my attention. I went to Cafe Ciao on Zamzama last week and there too the entire place was occupied by smokers and i (a non-smoker who’s allergic to smoke) could not find a single place to sit in the entire cafe that was smoke-free. It was quite appalling that in a world where more and more countries are banning smoking in public places ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/4016447.stm ), Pakistani restaurants are going in the opposite direction by not even having a small no-smoking area!

Does anyone know the status on Pakistan’s smoking laws—can restaurants do this?

I agree 100%. Went to the one at Zamzama last week, half an hour before iftari. It was packed. They took our names down and then ushered us in, asking us to go to the 3rd floor, saying tables are available. There was nothing available. So we went to the 4th floor, asking for a table, and they sent us back down. We did this for the next 15 minutes, taking the stairs and checking on each floor. We became so tired and disgusted that we had to leave (maghrib had just happened and they didn’t have the courtesy to offer us a date). The girls at the door (yes, they have idiotic girls (mis)managing the whole affair) were clueless and did not even apologize.

Similar incident happened at Papa John’s earlier, even after they took a reservation on the phone. It’s quite ridiculous.

I have been observing quality deterioration in Pizza Huts services since quite a few months.

I happened to ask one of its employees for the reason when the play-area in one of the branches closed down. They told me that Pizza Hut has changed ownership and the management has been taken over by Habib Oils. The employee (who is a verteran) seemed quite demotivated at that time…he was like…“ab to yeh hona hee hai”.

God help those souls.

Pizza hut Pakistan has been sold to a new management, two years ago and i have witnessed a trend of quality detoriation since then.

The Pakistan franchise of Pizza hut is being held by a company called MCR which has been sold to the owners of Habib Oil Mills two years ago.

maybe this transaction hasnt worked well for the brand.

Pizza hut sucks now.
Get Pizza Next: ditto Pizza Hut. at first u might eve miss the differece. nice pizzas.
or go to nandos instead ;)

 Yahya ( unregistered ) on October 6th, 2006 @ 6:08 pm 
Hey, as long as you fools are going there in droves they don’t care.

 Anathema ( unregistered ) on October 6th, 2006 @ 8:36 pm 
i dont thinnk its pizza hut alone. i think its every place. and wherever you go youo have to be thehre an houor beforehand. the place is bound to be crowded. evevryone wants to enjoy themself. i had a similar experience at roasters, arizona and nandos last saturday. only it was too crowded to get a spot anywhere. landed at pie in the sky chatterbox.

i dont know how many of you have had friday lunches during office. and anyone who has been to these places during friday lunches and is fortunate to be served, knows ho iftari will be.

for the last two years, my practice is to enjoy a very very light iftari and an hour after namaz and iftari the lot heads ouot for a good casual dinner followed by coffee. its not crowded and we’re servevd and attended to well.

had too many experiences with iftaris. if its not service: the food is cold and that’s no fun.

besides on an empty stomach u cannot do justice to the menu. its cold. its limited menu. its not up the mark annywhere. arizona has far far better food when ordered. after trying iftaris, i will safly say id rather had water and juice for iftri. say namaz. and then after the world has driven the waiters crazy, we get our share of oven hot customised food wherever with no regrets and best yet: no rush and haste.

I was wondering why the ppl are so crazy for pizza hut’s pizza rather then eating the regular iftar items at home for breaking the fast, or do they have different food stuffs also other then pizza ??
Do they have arrangement for maghrib prayers there ?

 faisal ( unregistered ) on October 7th, 2006 @ 8:57 am 
@KhiTorPit

Please don’t mind my pointing out the following.
Where you used the word“then”, you should have used the word“than”.

 KhiTorPit ( unregistered ) on October 7th, 2006 @ 9:18 am 
@Faisal, Thanks for the correction.

 Kashif ( unregistered ) on October 7th, 2006 @ 9:27 am 
PizzaNext is better in service than PizzaHut.

 Haseeb A ( unregistered ) on October 7th, 2006 @ 9:40 am 
Thts cause people think they can Rip Off Pizza Hut by Eating all they can. What they don’t realize is that the poeple of there arent fools. They are making money andyou are making a fool out of yourself.
@KhiTorPit: Yes they had arrangements for maghrib last year. I didnt go this year

 mansoor ( unregistered ) on October 7th, 2006 @ 11:07 am 
i agree umar! pizza hut has sucked big time for the last couple of years.. its gotten so bad that you cant even‘taste’the pizzas anymore :S they’re like all the same

 Jamal Shamsi ( unregistered ) on October 7th, 2006 @ 12:48 pm 
Since Mr. Manzar adopted Costa Coffee after his venture completed with Pizza Hut,–

Pizza Hut food has gone down in terms of service, food quality and keeping at par the standards of Global PIZZA HUT.

I can safely say that Pizza Hut Asia Pacific representatives are not monitoring, audting neither checking on quality control of the Pizza Hut Pakistan.

Habib Oil Mills owns it for sake of prestige now, and PIZZA HUT is up avaialble in market again since Feb 2006, but no one is willing to pay what HOM is asking.

 Momo ( unregistered ) on October 8th, 2006 @ 8:14 am 
Jeez, I have been looking forward to going back to Karachi after 5 years, and trying Pizza Hut, DAMN we have to eat Vegetarian in the country I reside =/ cos of Halal issues.

So is their lack of quality control throughout the year? or is it just during the Ramadan cos they are trying to make the most out of it?

 WASIQ ( unregistered ) on October 9th, 2006 @ 3:31 am 
@khitorpit

do you know how many pizza huts are there in karachi…..twenty…thirty…
with a seating capacity of 100 at max per place..
i think only ppl with cute and smart kids go there or should i say that the smart kids take them.it is the cheapest outing for a small family…everybody gets happy….the rest of the karachi is(millions) still celebrating Ramadan kareem the old fashion way….dates,rooh afza,pakoras,fruit chat,and maghrib…..

GOD BLESS AMERICA.

 IllusionFS ( unregistered ) on October 9th, 2006 @ 10:23 am 
Kashif: Pizza Next is a Pizza Hut wanabee.

KhiTorPit: No just the pizzas with salad&amp;drink. Dont remember if they serve khujoor or not.

For 375+ tax, I believe its still one of the best iftaars around. Just stop hating it people. lol. I am sure most of you will still go there :P

 shlazz ( unregistered ) on October 10th, 2006 @ 12:59 pm 
Well…i guess i was the lucky one hten…well last saturday i went to Pizza Hut (Zamzaam)&amp;had a really good time…
I arrived with my 4 frends @ 5pm&amp;the rush was just mind blowing…the attitude of karachites(burgers included) was really bad…it was like either Pizza Hut is giving away free food or that the rozaydar are on verge of death by standing outside…anyay @ 5.30pm the doors opened&amp;a stampede ensured…good things v still hav manners&amp;let the ladies enter the hall first…after that it was eery group for himself…me n my frends got in @ around 5:50pm.. the khajoor’s were already there, so v filled up the salad bowl&amp;waited.
After the fast was broken, pizza’s were served afterer 10 mins…the very hot, fresh&amp;awesomely delicious.. yes thre were mistakes like too much tomatoes sauce on the pizza, extra cheese, awkward slicing of pizza, semi-cold drinks but all in all the atmosphere was good..i even enjoyed the cigaratte puff after the meal. All in all me&amp;the rest ofthe ppl on that day were the happiest customers. 4/5 stars

p.s. the biggest thing i hated was that ppl were wasting away pizza’s…i mean they were liteally just eating the filling&amp;leaving the bread alone. This type of behurmati of Anaaj i havent seen anywhere (except buffet dinner places)

Gives credibility to the claim that the masses burnt the Gulshan Pizza Hut down to protest against the pathetic level of service.

 Anathema ( unregistered ) on October 10th, 2006 @ 7:18 pm 
erm. half the world leaves the crust?

ull notie people who finish ten to twelve slices leave crust

those who eat eat crust hardly make it to their third slice.

 shlazz ( unregistered ) on October 11th, 2006 @ 9:32 am 
@ Anathema

i ate 9 slices all with the crust.. a family beside m ate 6 to 7 slices all with crust.. the technique is to eat pizza more&amp;drink coke less…but hte young guns&amp;burgers that show up there only o fool around are like addicted to fizzy drinks…even one of the waiters said to a bunch of teeens thta they should eat more&amp;drink less since they are paying Rs. 345 for the deal.

Muy point is thta whether u eat the crust or not the same amount of quantity will go into your stomach…eating 10 slices without crust is equal to 5 slices with crust…nope the pakistani ppl think that by wasting food&amp;eating like janglee’s they are creating huge losses to the restaurant, whereas its vice versa

 Jamal Shamsi ( unregistered ) on October 11th, 2006 @ 1:10 pm 
Be it Pizza Hut or any other place for Buffet / All You can eat for XX amount. People waste a lot of food. They always forget that one day they have to answer for that what is wasted by them.

Pizza Hut deals are very attractive but quiet unfortunately the quality&amp;standard of food is detriorating at a hyper speed.

 Abdul Sami ( unregistered ) on October 11th, 2006 @ 3:45 pm 
@SHLZZ

9 Pieces = 1.5 Regular Sized Pizza, you still paid more than what you ate. and if going in groups this gets even worse, not every one is capable of eating 9 pieces.

 NEVER EVER GO FOR BUFFET DEAL IN PIZZA HUT WHEN GOING IN GROUP 

 KhiTorPit ( unregistered ) on October 11th, 2006 @ 7:33 pm 
I was wondering that anybody have confirmed that the cheese in the Pizza Hut’s Pizza is Halal or not ? Because I am not sure if we make cheese in Pak or not.
As here we dont eat pizza with cheese in it (from non-muslim frenchise) as the ingredients of the cheese normally have pig’s fats in it.

 Abdul Rahim Ahmad ( unregistered ) on October 15th, 2006 @ 10:36 pm 
It is beyond doubt now that the quality at Pizza Hut has deteriorated since the new management took over. Just went to Clifton branch a few days back with my family and can easily term it as one of the worst experience at Iftar! They dont care about SERVICE QUALITY as long as they can get the maximum number of people inside. The waiters dont listen to u anymore and you have to run after them with your plates to have any chance of getting any pizza. They FORCE you to get irritated and leave in disgust. The restaurant is really getting a bad name to their repu and its high time someone took notice. Pizza Hut at Iftar is a BIG NO for me now. Highly Not Receommended!

 AshTray ( unregistered ) on October 18th, 2006 @ 12:44 am 
Actually guys I’ve noticed that when they do NOT let the people in coz of“housefull”status, people complain and yell! At the Boat Basin Branch, they even tried to break down the doors like animals!
Now when the management increases the seating capacity due to the PEOPLE’s demand, they diss the service and quality?!
Let’s just decide what we want???
If we want good quality and good service, then we shouldn’t yell if the restaurants are full and should go home for then…it is we who are responsible for the deteriorating quality; as for wanting to make money, doesn’t every smart entrepreneur do that…?

 Imam Deen ( unregistered ) on October 18th, 2006 @ 12:50 am 
YEs, i have voiced my concern at one of the Pizza Hut outlets and they showed me proof (certificates etc.) that the Cheese they use is Halal, it is made from cow fat and properly processed and monitored under Islamic laws.
Mostly they do have Namaz arrangements and I have always gotten Khajoor and drinks even while waiting in cue outside the doors!
I love pizza and have visited almost every outlet in Karachi, never have I witnessed the kind of picture some of us have painted here :)
Yes, at times the service and quality does get poor during Iftar and Midnight, but for that i would agree with AshTray above that we are responsible due to our illogical demands of being seated anywhere, anyhow; no matter they have seats available or not!
Give the pizza hut guys a break dude!

I live in states and visit karachi after every three to four months and this ramadhan my friends suggested to go to pizzahut for dinner and i was thinking what fun we can have in a fast food restaurant but when i reached the clifton branch i was astonished to see the ambeiance and the welcome i got from these people,I was very much impressed with it,but i was very upset when i saw some customers the way they were behaving as if they have bought the restaurant with there 500 Rs or so,I have never seen them fighting or shouting on waiters and asking what more they can get for free in any other local restaurants but since this pizza hut is an american franchise and the people working there are very humble and friendly pakistani customers take an undue advantage of them.Before pizzahut came to pakistan we never saw waiters talking to customers in english or asking evry now then to coustomers if they need anything neither were there any co-ordinators waiting at door to welcome customers,This concept was introduced by pizzahut in pakistan and they have maitained it.Uptill now i have seen all the new concept in restaurants is still introduced by pizzahut.

I have never seen them fighting or shouting on waiters and asking what more they can get for free That was funny indeed , I could imagine that scene and that brought a smile on my face. Most of the guys there are doing that just for the sake of fun. It’s guys joke by the way so do not take it seriously.
