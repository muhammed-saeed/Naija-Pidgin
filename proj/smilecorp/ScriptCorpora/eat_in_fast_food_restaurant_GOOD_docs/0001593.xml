MONTEREY PARK - The investigation continues into the fatal police shooting of a 22-year-old Chino Hills man who threatened an officer with a large pipe bender outside a fast-food restaurant.
Steve Rodriguez was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after he was shot by two officers about 9:30 a.m. Monday outside a Carl&apos;s Jr. restaurant along Avenida Cesar Chavez. The incident was captured on a cell phone camera by a witness who then posted the video online.
Though the video of the shooting has gone viral on the Internet, Monterey Park police and Los Angeles County Sheriff&apos;s officials continued to withhold the names of the involved officers Thursday. The two involved officers were described as 12-year and 3-year veterans of the Monterey Park Police Department.
&quot;We&apos;re not, at this point, releasing those names,&quot; Monterey Park Police Chief Jim Smith said.
Officials added that the names would likely be disclosed in the over the next few days.
The Sheriff&apos;s Homicide Bureau is spearheading the investigation into the shooting.
&quot;Everything right now is new,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It&apos;s under investigation by the sheriff&apos;s (department) and DA&apos;s office, which is the normal protocol with us. We&apos;ll continue to follow the investigation. And its a tough thing for the officers, for the family, for the witnesses... for everyone involved.&quot;
Also withheld by authorities Thursday was the coroner&apos;s report in the case.
An autopsy had been carried out on Rodriguez&apos;s body Thursday, Advertisement however sheriff&apos;s investigators had placed a security hold on the findings, barring coroner&apos;s officials from releasing information on the case, Los Angeles County Department of Coroner Assistant Chief of Operations Ed Winter said.
Because of the security hold, information such as how many times Rodriguez was shot or where the two electrified Taser probed ultimately landed were not available.
Chief Smith declined to comment on the shooting itself.
&quot;It would be inappropriate for me to comment on it at this time,&quot; he said. &quot;I need to let the investigators to do their job.&quot;
Family members of Rodriguez, as well as the sheriff&apos;s detective handling the case, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave and offered psychological counseling, as is the policy for any officer involved in a shooting, Monterey Park police Capt. Eugene Harris said. They remained on leave Thursday.
&quot;We expect them back to work if not next week, the following week,&quot; he added. The amount of time an officer takes for leave after being involved in a shooting varies on a case-by-case basis, but is generally at least three days.
While the digital age has changed law enforcement a great deal in recent years and decades, Harris said the fact that many citizens are now carrying with them cell phones capable of doubling as video cameras makes no difference.
In fact, Harris said, the Monterey Park Police Department has gone &quot;above and beyond&quot; when it comes to using technology to ensure transparency in police work.
Every patrol car is equipped with a video camera, and all officers carry audio recorders, he said.
&quot;Any citizen contact is recorded,&quot; Harris said.
The presence of a civilian camera does not alter police behavior, he added.
&quot;We teach people to perform as if you&apos;re always being watched, taped or video recorded,&quot; he said.
