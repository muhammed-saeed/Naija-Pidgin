Amaro is a lovely restaurant in the old part of Merida in the Yucatan in Mexico. You eat in the courtyard of an 18th century colonial style house; it is located just one block from the more expensive main plaza and just off of the lively Calle 60 (with lots of bars and live music at weekends). As well as a range of international dishes it also has a huge selection of local Yucatan dishes that you won&apos;t find elsewhere in Mexico or Central America. There is also a lot of vegetarian choice, which is great as I had eaten cheese quesadillas two days in a row. Ingredients include Chaya which is like spinach and unique to the region. Sadly that was off the menu on the night we dined there, and I never saw it on a menu again.
 
There were several other dishes that were not available on the menu, and whilst this is frustrating there are plenty of other options available. However, wherever restaurants have fresh ingredients you can run the risk of something not being available, particularly in this part of the world and I think I would rather have this than something ready prepared and just heated up. Amaro does claim to always use fresh ingredients.

They have a range of licouardos which are fruit drinks with milk or purified water. Often they are large and quite filling. They also offered Mexican wine, which I was keen to try but they did not have any chilled so we had to plump for the more expensive Chilean wines. Subsequently I tried the same Mexican wine as they offered and can confirm it is worth paying that bit extra for the Chilean varieties! The wine we had was delicious and probably cost the equivalent of 10 which is quite expensive compared to the food. The local wine was about 5-6 a bottle. They also offer a good range of cocktails and local and imported beers.

They did a large range of starters, which I did not have. Judging by the size of them they were almost meals in themselves but very reasonably priced at the equivalent of just a few British pounds and include nachos and salad.

Dishes to look out for include those that come with mole sauce. Fear not, veggies, this is not a sauce made of small, blind subterranean dwelling mammals but a spicy chocolate sauce made from Mexican chocolate. Regrettably I didn&apos;t try this and also never saw it on menus outside of Merida. Other specialties include Aubergine Meshe which is basically a stuffed aubergine with cheese and a local white sauce served with rice. Some of our party ordered this and found it delicious. They
