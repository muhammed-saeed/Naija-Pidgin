 Life 
 is more hectic than ever -- between school, sports, clubs and friends, 
 who has time to think about what to eat? Time for plan B: fast food. 

 &quot;Fast food 
 is easy,&quot;said Sarah Hudson, a 14-year-old from Portland, Maine, 
 enjoying a 
 snack at McDonald&apos;s.&quot;It&apos;s quick and it tastes good.&quot;She 
 figures she eats fast food about twice a week. 

 &quot;As long as 
 it tastes good and it fills you up then that&apos;s all I care about,&quot;said her friend Ryan Bell, 13.&quot;We buy it because it tastes good. 
 If they made healthy food I doubt we would buy it.&quot; 

 The average American 
 now consumes about three hamburgers and four orders of french fries 
 every week. That&apos;s 90 grams of fat and 2,520 calories. The average person 
 needs about 2,000 calories for a whole day. 

 Most Americans know 
 that fast food isn&apos;t exactly good for them, but can&apos;t quite seem to 
 break the habit. In fact, consumption of high-fat fast food is increasing, 
 in part because fast food restaurants are an inescapable part of American 
 life. 

 Fast 
 Food Nation 

 According to Fast 
 Food Nation , a new book by Eric Schlosser, 96 percent of American 
 schoolchildren can identify Ronald McDonald. The only fictional character 
 with a 
 higher degree of recognition is Santa Claus. 

 Schlosser says it&apos;s 
 nearly impossible to overstate the impact of the fast food industry 
 on the nation&apos;s culture, economy and diet.&quot;McDonald&apos;s Golden Arches,&quot;he writes,&quot;are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross.&quot; 

 The 
 Obesity Epidemic 

 Considering America&apos;s 
 love of the french fry, it&apos;s no surprise that kids are getting bigger. The percentage 
 of children and teenagers who are overweight has tripled in the past 
 30 years, according to the Center for Disease Control. One-third 
 of overweight students are so heavy they will probably have serious 
 health problems later in life. 

 Of course it&apos;s not 
 just young people who are getting heavier -- it&apos;s all Americans. U.S. 
 Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher is so concerned about childhood obesity 
 that he has declared it an&quot;epidemic.&quot; 

 &quot;We see a nation 
 of young people seriously at risk of starting out obese and dooming 
 themselves to the difficult task of overcoming a tough illness,&quot;he said. 

 He&apos;s not talking 
 about kids who are chubby or a little plump. These are kids who are 
 more than 20 percent above their ideal weight -- kids whose weight makes 
 it hard for them to move around, get up stairs and even breathe. 

 Doctors are finding 
 that more and more severely overweight children have medical problems 
 such as a fatty liver, a precursor to liver disease, high blood pressure, 
 and an increasing likelihood of Type 2 diabetes. In addition, obese 
 children are becoming prime candidates for heart attacks and strokes 
 even while in their teens. 

 Researchers say 
 it&apos;s important to realize that obesity is a health problem -- not a 
 judgment about how people&apos;s bodies should look. Everyone has their own 
 idea about how they like to look, but nobody wants to have a heart attack. 

 How can you tell 
 if you are overweight, obese, or just about right? Doctors usually calculate 
 your body mass index (BMI) a number based on height and weight. 

 Ideal weight is 
 usually given in a range of at least 15 pounds. If you have a small 
 frame, you should probably be toward the bottom of the range. And, logically, 
 the opposite for bigger people. 

 If you are more 
 than a few pounds above your ideal weight, you are overweight. But if 
 you are more than 20 percent above your ideal weight, you are obese. 
 That means your weight could start to endanger your health. 

 The 
 Corporate Effect 

 Weight is strongly 
 influenced by genes -- you are more likely to be heavy if your parents 
 are heavy. But, there is something you can do. Doctors say the most 
 important way for kids and adults to lose weight is to change their 
 eating habits. That means finding an alternative to all-night pizza 
 delivery, convenience stores, and fast food restaurants. 

 Sometimes it&apos;s even 
 hard to find nutritious food in school, where many cafeterias have been 
 replaced with mall-style food courts. Many schools across the country 
 have also signed contracts with soft drink companies like Coke and Pepsi. 
 The schools agree to install soda machines 
 and usually guarantee a set number of sales. 

 In return, the 
 soda companies give the schools some of the money that collects in the 
 machines. Schools often use the money from these contracts for teacher 
 salaries and special programs but such contracts often require schools 
 to sell as many as 50 sodas per student per school year. 

 Recent studies by 
 the U.S. Agriculture Department now link obesity to soft drink consumption 
 for the first time. The studies show that students drink soda instead 
 of eating healthy meals, and then eat more food later because they are 
 not filled up. So students are drinking more sugar and syrup and eating 
 more food than they would if they just ate a regular lunch. 

 The critics&apos; voices 
 have been heard. In the past few weeks Coca-Cola announced they will 
 add water and juice to their school soda machines and will discourage 
 exclusive contracts. Pepsi executives said they plan similar changes. 

 Senator Patrick 
 J. Leahy (D-Vt.) has introduced legislation that will allow the federal 
 government to more tightly restrict school soft drink sales.&quot;Taxpayers 
 are paying hundreds of millions of dollars for a federal school lunch 
 program, but many kids are filling up on empty calories,&quot;said 
 Senator Leahy.&quot;That&apos;s what has to change.&quot; 

 Physical 
 Education 

 And if that wasn&apos;t 
 enough, there&apos;s one more thing nudging kids toward the top of the scale: 
 the extinction of gym class. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
 (CDC) recently reported that from 1991-1997 daily participation in physical 
 education dropped from 42 percent to 29 percent, and that almost half 
 of all teens ages 12-21 get no vigorous exercise on a regular basis. 

 Schools across the 
 country are trying to make gym class more fun by adding activities like 
 rollerblading, rock climbing or treadmill running. Only Illinois requires 
 daily gym class for grades K-12 but many health groups are pushing for 
 more required P.E. 

 As doctors, teacher, 
 parents and kids try to work on developing healthy eating and exercise 
 habits, there&apos;s also the danger that some kids will go too far. Many 
 kids of normal weight seem to think they&apos;re fat -- and can develop eating 
 disorders that are just as dangerous to their health as diabetes and 
 stroke. 

 So 
 what can you do? Here are ten 
 tips for healthy living to help improve your body inside and out.
