 The Hardee’s Drive-Through Goat and Outback Fun–Not for the Faint of Heart 
 I took a goat to Hardee’s once. Hey, we were hungry and she was already in the back of the car. Once the order-taker in the window up front had gotten the word out to the guys in the back flipping burgers, there was a little commotion, to be sure. It’s not every day you see a goat in a vehicle at a fast food restaurant.   While I’ll admit it was a bit peculiar (to those outside my family–for those that know me, the bizarre and unusual are commonplace), it wasn’t too outlandish.   “Coffee”was standing up in the back of my Subaru Outback, which has a hatchback, when we came through, so it wasn’t as if she was casually sitting in the passenger seat…that time.    If that Outback could talk, the stories it would tell! It was made with the Australian Outback in mind, mind you. I’ve driven it all over the property, and have loaded all kinds of things in the back.   Some I’m not so proud of.   OK, there’s the standard stuff: hay bales, chicken scratch, large quantities of grain, groceries and children, of course.   It has carried dogs, cats and even mice–or a mouse. (The tale of the stow-away that nearly had me in a ditch is for another day.) This is one of those over-the-top blogs. I warn you now.   If you have a stomach that’s more suited to a ladies’tea room, what follows may upset your delicate sensibilities. You can stop reading now.   Here’s your chance!   Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you. I had two dead goats in the back of my car once.   Don’t panic.   They were frozen. (Oh, well, if they were frozen…) Here it is: two of our yearling goats had died suddenly without apparent cause.   Connor had hauled them to the back portion of our property for disposal. (That’s what you do in the country.   Rarely do people bury things out in the sticks.   They allow nature to take its course.   This gives new meaning to feeding the birds, right?) Only then did it occur to me to place a phone call to our vet in order to ascertain a cause of death.   He recommended an autopsy, naturally, which meant retrieving the dead bodies and hauling them into town. (Thank heavens it had been freezing that morning, but the sun was climbing and time was of the essence!)   Well Connor was none too pleased, considering the effort he had expended in getting them out there in the first place, attached to his go-cart. (I think they’d been on a sled, so it wasn’t as if their carcasses had been dragged, oh, wait a minute, he’s just corrected me…) I assured him we’d make it easier on him for this round by driving the Outback out to the back.   SO, you see, it was a judgment call. I wish I could tell you the story ends there. It doesn’t.   When our delightful vet had finished with an anatomy lesson for the kids, which included the inspection of a tiny little fetus (I’ll tell you what, my children get terrific science classes on the farm), he informed me that I was to dispose of the bodies.   Really?   He’d opened them up (and it wasn’t a pretty site), and then expected me to basically…pick up the pieces! He’d had them in a sink for goodness sake!   Well, I do have my limits, after all!   So I asked for a trash can. That’s where the Outback comes in again.   Connor had to sit in the back of it, holding the trash can outside with what was left of the animals we had loved (and was it heavy), and I had to drive as quickly (and carefully) as I could, because not only did I not want to tax Connor’s manly strength (he really is a trooper most of the time), but the sun was not our friend that day and it was growing warmer by the minute. And I had to keep reassuring my little girls that“Cupcake”and“Cocoa”were in a better place. If it hadn’t been so ludicrous, we might have cried.   I am making light of it now, but it was a disappointing situation. And I really wanted to strangle that vet! Fortunately, we were only a¼mile or so off the gravel road in the small town nearby, so it wasn’t a long ordeal.   I know my kids will always remember it.   However would they not? Yes, we did Lysol the back of the car. None of the children needed therapy. As it turned out, the cause of death was over-eating.   Yep. Goats can over-eat themselves to death. Who would have thought?   They eat constantly.  (We now vaccinate for &quot;Over-eaters.&quot;)  I know when I returned home, I was in no mood to eat. (Perhaps you are feeling that way now.) But I believe I did enjoy a lovely glass of red wine in a nice long bubble bath. And the next day, although it wasn’t another sunrise with Cocoa or Cupcake, it was another one with Coffee.

 The Train Whistle 
 The hour or so before the sun rises is special in the country, especially when the air is still; the silence itself seems to indicate a collective holding of breath in nature, as if in expectation of the glorious event that is on the way.   The sun arrives, never disappointing, though impediments may occasionally block its view, it never changes course. Eventually the birds and other talkative creatures arise from their slumber to greet its arrival, and here in country, the familiar sound of a train whistle adds to the symphony. 
 The bedroom window was open and the blinds were up as we slept last night.   My slumber was enhanced by the mild spring air, which brought a freshness and peace into the room. As I curled around a fluffy pillow I was quite thankful for, thinking of how wonderful my bed felt, (and how much moving my 7-year-old had done through the night–since Daddy was out of town, she had spent the night with me), I was further, and most pleasantly, awakened by the sound of two train whistles, just minutes apart from one another.   It was shortly after five in the morning, but my mind was already thinking about the trains–one moving south and the other north.   After all these years, the pronouncement of their arrival is still charming to me. The tracks are about a mile from us on the Missouri side of the state line.   They aren’t too close we take much notice, but aren’t too far away we can’t appreciate the quaintness and nostalgia they lend to the rural experience. If I listen closely, as I did in bed this morning, I can hear the clackety clack of the wheels as they traverse the tracks, along with the constant hum of the engine. 
 Of course there are trains in Southern California, but I never heard them.   I was never anywhere in the city of San Diego where I couldn’t hear at least the constant hum of traffic, but trains weren’t part of the landscape. It seems all freight trains in the world must pass through the Kansas City area at some point, so if you live in this area, you will probably hear the sound of a train. 
 It’s the little things in life we take for granted, but the sound of a far-off train whistle is not wasted on me. (Yeah, I know, it doesn’t take much to amuse me.)   Not everyone would share my joy in the sound of a train, including those who may live right next to a track, but there are plenty of mundane, little things that may make your day. It may be the few minutes of free time you manage to eke out of your day to collect your thoughts.   It may be that favorite song you play in the car each morning on your way to work.   It may be the blossoming tree that sits in your front yard or the way your dog wags his tail when you return home.   It may be, as it once was for me, the scent of the salt air moving in from the sea or the deep, heady fragrance of pine.   Whatever it is, we should all take notice of the simple things that call us to a heart of lightness and gratitude. For me and my girls, it&apos;s the train whistle. 
 &quot;In a way, the train whistle helps me sleep. It&apos;s like one of those sound devices that play noises to relax you, like the sound of the ocean or a heartbeat.&quot; Emily - 14 years. 
 &quot;The train makes me happy.&quot; Gracie - 7 years. 
 &quot;I usually don&apos;t fall asleep right away. The sound of the train whistle puts me in a drowsy slumber.&quot; Rachel - 10 years.

 The Goats, by Rachel - Spring 2007 - 6 years old 
 Rachel wrote this in response to the deaths of her baby goats, who were killed by a dog in the Spring of 2007: 

 &quot;A True Story: They licked my hand and when I was sad, the goats made me happy. They died on Tuesday morning. I was crying in the field. I miss Max, Genevieve, and Jake...&quot;  Posted by City Girls in the Country at 11:04 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook

 Sunrise with Coffee 
 It all began with Coffee.   Coffee the goat, that is.   Rachel named her Coffee because of her rich, brown color.   Coffee is the beverage of choice around here. There are days we have to brew two or three pots! Though it may be tough to stumble out of bed early each morning, once the coffee is brewing and the day is dawning, life looks pretty good.   There’s nothing like a sunrise on the farm with a hot cup of coffee nestled in your hands and a view of the rising sun seeping across the wide expanse of the prairie’s horizon. Each morning I’m up with coffee, and in the barn with“Coffee.”   Coffee in the pot is strong–my husband likes it that way.   Coffee the goat is stronger.   And I can’t stand it that way! But never has a goat been more loved by a little girl. Though technically she wasn’t our first goat, she was our first goat baby that lived. We had driven to a farm on the west side of town to pick her up for Rachel after we lost the only three babies that had been born on our farm that spring.   Rachel had been nearly inconsolable after we had arrived home to find our new goat babies had been killed by a dog because one of the kids had left the gate open.   We all cried, but Rachel took it the hardest, sitting outside, in what had been their field, for long periods of time on an overturned metal watering trough. She wrote compositions about her goats and drew and colored pictures of the little ones she had lost.   By summer time, we decided to buy her a new baby of her own. So Coffee came to live with us.   And Coffee came to torture me. There’s never, ever, been a more willful, obnoxious goat than Coffee.   Coffee has a mind of her own.   Perhaps that is because her previous owner had allowed her to roam inside and outside of the house, so she thinks“entitlement.”   Perhaps it is because Coffee had been bottle-fed, so she needs pampering.   Perhaps it’s because goats can suffer from mental illness too. She listens for Rachel, but for me she’s always wanted to go in the exact opposite of the way I wanted her to go. Rachel has even had her on a leash!   But last year when I tried to hold her by the collar, she slammed me against a metal pole in the barn and broke my little finger! There are a lot of Coffee jokes in this house.   Rachel’s siblings relish teasing her about Coffee.   We have all stated on more than one occasion, myself included in my more anxious moments, that we should have Coffee butchered for meat.   Emily has gleefully reminded Rachel that any day now we could have Coffee for dinner.   I’ve stated a bunch of times that I’ll have Coffee with cream for breakfast.   But for now, Coffee will still enjoy a few more sunrises, while I enjoy my sunrises with coffee. Living with goats is always an adventure and I need plenty of coffee to deal with Coffee! Posted by City Girls in the Country at 12:40 PM No comments: Email This BlogThis!

 Mud! 
 Ah spring…that one word effects comfort, with images of an English Garden, resplendent with brilliant flowers; a Renoir painting, infused with color that talks to the soul; the scent of lush, green grass that shimmers with long-lasting dew; and the sound of little winged creatures whistling enchanting melodies that seem to call forth a budding explosion of life. If you could describe spring in one word, it would be: green.   Everything seems verdant, fertile, peaceful…alive, in the springtime. Everything, that is but the Kansas countryside. In this part of the world, spring is the color brown. In the country, spring equals mud. Rain equals mud. Where you’re from April showers may bring May flowers, but here, April showers bring mud with powers! There’s no end to it…nearly. It’s what we wade through on the road on the way home. It’s what we stamp through in the yard.   It’s what we find on our backsides. While the rest of the tamed world ushers in spring with daffodils, tulips and blossoming bouquets, we here in the country wipe the mud off our shoes, off the sides of our vehicles (and consequently our jackets, pants and rears, as we can’t help but brush up against the wide swath of it painted across the side of our cars, trucks or vans), and even off our faces. (Yes, it’s projectile mud!) I have so much appreciation for our pioneer forefathers.   What they must have endured, traveling in those covered wagons!   How ever did they do it?   I remember reading that one of the things that made Harry S. Truman so popular in Kansas City in his days in the Senate, was his platform to rid Kansas City of mud! I get that!   In the country, plan on mud. It splashes, it covers, it moves, it lives. Our property had been farmed for generations before we built on it, but it was uncultivated.   Green grass? Ha!   The fields had undoubtedly known prairie grass at some point, say, when the buffalo roamed.   But green grass, as in the manicured lawn kind, had never grown here before.   We’re talking soybean and corn fields.   Now, if you take out the crops and put in a house, just what do you think the soil will be like?   What soil?   In the spring it was initially nothing but mud. When we first moved into our newly built house on property that had no idea how to behave, the mud was overwhelming.   Our oldest son called our property Saigon - a good description.   (He was, of course, referring to days gone by…though history had served him well, Driver’s Education had not.)   We hadn’t been here long when he drove the vehicle off the driveway and out into the middle of the yard.   The mud was so deep, that van sat in the yard for weeks.   Right, smack dab in the middle of the yard, as if to shout to all of our country neighbors,“We’re new here!   We didn’t know we couldn’t drive in this stuff!”   I told him that anyone driving by would think I had done it.   (“Look Mildred, that there city woman tried to drive today. Ha, Ha, Ha!”I wanted to put a large sign on the van that stated,“My dumb kid did this!)   I wish I could tell you that was the only time a vehicle on our property got stuck in the mud.   I even did it myself one time trying to drive to the barn when I was in a hurry.    That time the van sat for about a month before we could dig it out. (&quot;Look Fred, she&apos;s dang gone done it again!&quot;) I guess those covered wagons learned to stay put as well for a while. All this mud doesn’t mean that we don’t have our day of green.   It just takes longer. But patience pays off.   Soon we’ll have more green than we know what to do with. We just need to wait.   Isn’t that true of life too?   Sometimes you’ve got to wait through the mud, you’ve got to wipe it off your face, and your behind too, hold your head up, and patiently wait for it to become solid again.   If you do, it will eventually lead to green, grassy meadows and an explosion of prairie flowers.

 Real Women 
 Before I moved to the country, I thought I was a real woman. I had never been afraid of hard work, and I was a great multi-tasker (I could volunteer in my kids’classrooms AND fit in a manicure in between my split-shift at work.   I could teach aerobics after work a couple of days a week, AND get the meals on the table. I could read to my kids each night without fail, AND rise each morning at 4 am for my on-air shift.) Can somebody relate? I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was a Girl Scout troop leader, for crying out loud!   Then, I moved to the country and met some real women. I was immediately humbled in their presence and completely in awe.   (In fact, I was feeling pretty foolish.   You must remember, in San Diego, I had seen a lot of water, and, other than avocado trees and orange groves, very little farmland.   I wasn’t an idiot…well, maybe I was…but I did know how my food got to table. I just didn’t want to have anything to do with it.) My new rural friends were true country women, whose practical experience living off the land to provide for their families was downright inspiring.   Who in the heck did I think I was?   They were spending springs and summers on their knees weeding and hoeing their gardens so that their dinner plates boasted the best nature had to offer.   I was pushing my cart down an air-conditioned aisle, choosing produce someone else had worked hard to provide me.   They were caring for animals as if they were veterinarians, and then lovingly slaughtering them themselves to put meat on the table.   I put out food for the cat. (And, ewww, I preferred not to think of where my meat came from. I most assuredly wanted nothing to with killing anything that didn’t crawl.) They knitted, sewed and quilted items that looked ready for a magazine cover.   I could barely sew a button on–well, I could do that.   But not well. They ground their own grain and made their own bread.   I would have been the cat, or the dog, and no friend to“The Little Red Hen.”   Isn’t it simpler to just buy a loaf of bread off the shelf?   Wouldn’t it be cheaper, considering the“woman hours”involved, to purchase what I needed, rather than attempting to produce it myself? Why put myself through it? I think because there is value in producing food for yourself and in avoiding reliance on others.   I never realized how important this concept was until we planted our very first garden.   My darling, cherubic children, most of whom were in middle school about this time, were moaning and groaning when we set them out in the garden with hoes and told them to go to work.   You’d have thought they were part of a chain-gang sentenced to hard labor.   You’d also have thought by the pathetic, worn expressions, that they had suffered much hardship in their young, unfortunate lives. (This was about 7½minutes into planting…actually, it was about 2½minutes in, if you count the 5 minutes they had already utilized stopping for water breaks and sympathy gawks at one other.) It was about this time that one of my precious dears uttered forth the proclamation that would change my parenting and alter the rest of our country lives:“This is what we pay migrant workers to do.”   Really?   So that you, my pampered pets can get back inside to play your video games or straighten your hair? I knew I had to save them from themselves yet I was so furious I couldn’t respond adequately at first.   My husband and I did decide right then and there that we most certainly would have migrant workers on our property. If our children decided they were unwilling or unable to assist us in getting food into their mouths, they would migrate right into a long restriction. They gave it some serious thought, and the kept working, though it would take years before the attitudes improved. We all need to remember where our food comes from.
