SIDS and Infant Allergies: Has The Connection Been Found
This information is so new to the public itself it is going to stimulate controversy from all corners of the globe.

But that, I believe is good news. Controversy stimulates minds. It also stimulates the energy to get answers. And SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is just one of those, to date, unexplainable conditions which so easily devastates way too many lives. We need controversy on this particular subject.

So, a recent article in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition has detailed a new theory which may be one of the factors in so many infants&apos; deaths. Personally, from what I know about the subject, I like it. I also can see why and how this could be a possible link. But, remember, that is only my personal opinion.

But if you are a new mother, breastfeeding your child, how difficult would it be for you to make this one sacrifice for a few months to be able to have the chance of preventing your child&apos;s possible unexplained death?

It may sound like an inconvenience to many, but then again, are you willing to take that risk now when you may have heard of a possible solution? Check here for some more details. Then go have a talk, repeatedly if necessary, with your doctor.

Muscle Cramps and Diabetes
For some people, the phrase might as well be synonymous.

If you are a diabetic and you are plagued by muscle cramps in your legs, this is one of those old-wife&apos;s tales which many swear does work. So, if you&apos;re willing, give it a try. After all, if it works for you - all you&apos;ve got to lose is the pain. And boy, doesn&apos;t that sound good!

 Many people who are diabetics also are prone to muscle and leg cramps on a frequent basis. They are there, you don&apos;t know why and they just won&apos;t seem to let up.

So the next time you have this problem, go fill your bathtub with about 6-8 inches of comfortably hot water, add 8 ounces (1 cup) of apple cider vinegar and soak your legs in it for 15 minutes. 

For some other hints and tips which may help you obtain a better diabetic lifestyle, check at diabetes and apple cider vinegar .

Top Sources Of Salt In The American Diet
Many people believe they just do not use that much salt, thus they aren&apos;t getting very much into their diet. But what you don&apos;t know (because you don&apos;t read the food labels) can sometimes hurt you also.

See what I mean by checking this chart:

 Top 10 Sources Of Salt In The Daily Diet 
 bread and rolls cold cuts(deli meats)/cured meats pizza poultry (it&apos;s added during processing/packaging as a preservative and flavor enhancer) soup (canned, boxed, frozen and any pre-packaged varieties) sandwiches cheese pasta dishes meat dishes salty snack foods (think chips, pretzels, crackers, nutrition bars, breakfast bars etc)


So think about your daily diet. Do you ever eat any of these? Do you ever use more than one each day?

Reading that food label is so terribly important. All the information you need is right on there to tell you what you must know to reduce your intake of salt.

For some further help in ways to recognize where salt is or how to eliminate some from your diet check at:


 diabetes salt symptom and what it means to your future health

 salt substitutes and what you can use every day so you won&apos;t miss the salt

 foods high in salt and a list of low salt foods so you can learn where to easily find it and what you can use to avoid it.

Cream Of Tartar/Sulfites...Am I Safe?
Cream of tartar, a common ingredient in baking powder, is made from the residue of the grape fermentation process which ultimately means the possibility of some sulfites can be in the finished baking goods and the ingredients themselves. (Sulfites are a naturally-ocurring product in all grapes).

So, if you have a sulfite allergy/sensitivity , many people find they may have trouble eating baked goods which contain cream of tartar or baking powder.

Therefore choosing and finding safe alternatives can get very difficult.

As a safer alternative instead of using baking powder, use 2-3 teaspoons of baking soda and add one teaspoon of white distilled vinegar into the milk ingredient of your recipe. Return to &quot;Sulfite Free Foods&quot;.

Diabetes ... and the Family Dog (or Cat)
Do you have a pet who just loves the outdoors... on the end of a leash, that is?

It seems, it has been proven, the family pet is actually better for a diabetic than any help or support you receive from friends or family. How can this be?

Actually there is several pluses to owning a pet :


 the actual act of just walking your dog or cat on a leash gets you up and actually moving. Being a couch potato is probably the worst thing you can do to yourself as a diabetic (even poor eating habits can be neutralized to some degree just by getting a little exercise)

 high blood pressure signs and symptoms can actually be decreased just from the love and companionship of a trusted pet

 but most importantly now, it has been proven that the physical act of walking your pet vs. walking with another person uses more calories and builds more stamina.

How come, when all you are doing is walking?

The reason, many walkers are also talkers . The body has a tendency to slow down to a shorter, slower gait for ease in talking and hearing the other person. With your pet, you are never waiting or wondering what your pet says or answers so you maintain a more steady, rhythmic gait, thus cover more distance, thus you just got some better diabetic exercise .


So, see, here&apos;s just one more reason your pet should be deserving of the title &quot;man&apos;s best friend&quot; .

Diabetes...Heart Disease and Dental Health
Does all of this just sound like a laundry list of things to do to keep yourself from not being healthy? You, or a family member already have the diabetes, you sure don&apos;t want the heart disease and dental care... that dentist&apos;s office is just a pain!

But how are these all inter-related?

It is now a proven fact that people with poor oral hygiene boost their chances of having to be treated for diabetes and/or heart disease by up to 70%* by avoiding the basic details needed to maintain healthy teeth and gums .

So a daily plan of action to facilitate dental care in your mouth is not only a good idea but also one more step you can take to insure you may never have to get that final diagnosis from any doctor. Easy tips to use for a daily dental care routine can be the answer to just one more prayer.

Sun Exposure: It&apos;s Many Benefits
All over the news is the value of getting some daily sun exposure. All over that same news is slather on the sunscreen first though.

But other than the boatload of toxic chemicals which is in most of those varieties, the whole reason for getting in the sun anyway was too increase your skin&apos;s exposure to the sun so you can increase your levels of Vitamin D. So, what&apos;s the use of getting in the sun to raise your immune system&apos;s level of the important D vitamin if you are going to apply sunscreen which reflects all the sun&apos;s rays off?

Sound like one of those catch-22 situations, doesn&apos;t it?

The reality here, only approximately 15 minutes (for the light skinned person) to 30 minutes (for the dark skinned person) is needed to get a sufficient amount of sunlight to increase your D levels.

A few other ways to increase your body&apos;s availability of retaining those important rays is to add a sufficient mix of orange and yellow vegetables to your daily diet. Another good source is the addition of some Low Sodium V8 juice because of its high levels of lycopene.

Therefore with extended exposure to the sun, use the sunscreen if you want some additional protection if you feel you burn easy. But for shorter time periods, forget the sunscreen and go out and let mother nature give your immune system a daily dose of better health.

Fluid Retention: Eliminating The Bloat
Do you feel like the Good Year blimp on some days, you are so swollen and puffed up. The abdominal bloating, swollen fingers, legs and feet are all due to water retention in your system. The most common reasons for this:


 too much salt in your diet hormonal changes in the body underlying medical condition which is creating the problem


While you and your doctor must work on reason number 3 to find the cause and therapy, the first two signs can usually be curtailed right from your own efforts at home without the use of another medication. Give any of these a try and see what works best for your situation.


 eat a sensible healthy diet full of nutritious foods full of fresh vitamins and minerals

 limit your salt intake, whether that&apos;s from reducing the use of the salt shaker itself or read the labels and either eliminate or substitute low-salt versions of your favorite products

 get regular exercise - sweating some of the water away reduces fluid retention

 use one or more of the natural diuretics like black tea (two cups per day), corn-silk tea (two cups per day) or purchase freeze dried dandelion leaf capsules at your local health foods store and use a capsule twice daily. Check the boxes for any further directions or exact dosage requirements.


Maintaining a safe and consistent fluid retention level in your body also reduces your chances of needing to worry about finding some natural ways to reduce your blood pressure .

The Universal Favorite Snacktime Option
Popcorn is one of the most popular snack time options in all of the world and yet many diabetics feel they must avoid it - after all, it is corn which is high in carbohydrates. But popcorn itself usually isn&apos;t the big problem here. The problem is what you put on it as seasoning. Be smart, think positively and you can still enjoy popcorn - just not buckets of it and definitely not dripping with butter.

And now that you realize popcorn does not need to be completely off the menu, here is a super simple way to prepare it which is a whole lot cheaper and healthier than all those microwave popping bags (which are actually lined with chemicals which transfers to your food as it heats). So, if the stovetop method or the direct over an open fire is not an option in your household, utilize the microwave anyway the super cheap and simple way.


 Pour 1/4 cup popcorn kernels into a clean brown paper lunch bag and fold the top down twice and crease. Stand the bag in the center of the microwave.

 Microwave on high until the popping sounds slow down to about one pop every couple of seconds. Do not overcook - it burns easily. For most microwaves this takes about 5 minutes. (You will have to experiment since all machines are different)

 Open up your bag and enjoy as it or season to your tastes. For some simple recipes or suggestions what you can do with it, check these diabetic popcorn snacks for some other great ideas.

It&apos;s Easter Egg Dye Season Again
It is a time-honored ritual in many people&apos;s home - whether they are young or old. The act of dying easter eggs is equal to importance as that dozen of roses is for Valentine&apos;s Day.

But to the allergen community, many people are allergic to eggs or even sensitive to the store-bought food dyes. Does this automatically leave all of you out of the festivities ?

No way!

A really good tip I heard once in relationship to the egg allergen community I want to share here tonight. Obviously, if you are allergic to eggs, the fun of the festivities seems to pretty much be off-limits to you. But a great idea, and to allow you or the kid(s) to join in the fun also is to acquire yourself a heavy duty kitchen wire whisk with bendable tines. Make sure someone not sensitive to eggs loads the whisk (slide the tines apart and put the hard-boiled egg into the center). Carefully wash down the handle in case of cross contamination and then hand the whisk and the dye bath to the sensitive child or adult. A few &quot;dunking&quot; sessions, in different colors if you desire, and this now time-honored tradition can also be practical for the egg allergic also.

For the first time, this individual actually can join in the festivities and dye their own egg. For some safe and all-natural food dyes straight from your own kitchen (forget those chemical dye baths they sell in the store), check here and make your own natural food coloring .

So You Think A Chocolate Allergy May Be The Problem
So here you think your problem might just be a chocolate allergy, since every time you eat some your stomach or bowels are churning, you itch or swell a little, you run for the bathroom, or a host of any other small minor symptoms.

But guess what? You know sometimes a few of those closely guarded secrets can get out in any corporation and then the whole world all of a sudden becomes repulsed? The chocolate industry itself has just been exposed!

Further research has been showing many people might not actually have a chocolate allergy . They might be sensitive to the cockroach.

The what? A cockroach!

Yes, it seems the cockroach also enjoys the attributes of the cocoa bean. Being a fresh product direct from nature, of course there is going to be some bug parts included in the harvesting operation. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is well aware of this situation and actually has pre-set levels of contaminants allowed in the finished goods.

But for some people, what&apos;s your new opinion of the chocolate bar?

Just remember though, giving up chocolate is really not a rational solution. What about the slice of bread, the dish of pasta, the bowl of popcorn, the fruit and vege smoothie, the glass of milk or ice cream cone... and on and on.

Think about it. Any product which derives an ingredient from nature is going to run the risk of a few extraneous ingredients which we don&apos;t really consider part of our normal diet. So giving up chocolate is no solution. You are pretty much going to have to give up everything!

And although pesticides and herbicides to kill off all the bugs might seem to be a viable option, pesticide problems in the human body creates a wider curtain of detrimental health effects than just enjoying a few little bites of cockroach.

Low Fat Lifestyles Are Killing Our Society
A 25 year veteran of the surgical operating room has finally been brave enough to come forward and admit this crazy notion that people need to live a low fat diet to maintain healthy cholesterol levels is totally and vastly wrong. Deteriorating health over the last few decades has been the final result.

The problem here is not eliminating fats. It is eliminating trans fats (saturated fats) and hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats from your diet. All of these are a man-made process by the food industry itself. All of these ultimately are a one-way ticket to future higher medical expenses.

But good quality fats high in omega 3&apos;s (extra virgin olive oils, avocado oil and virgin coconut oils) and a smaller portion of fats from omega 6&apos;s (the corn oil, sunflower and soybean oil) all lead to a strengthening of your digestive system.

Dr. Lundell firmly believes, from everyday experience, that getting back to the foods of our ancestors is the way back to a better controlled health.

What Is Junk Food?
Your grandparents and great-grandparents would wonder just exactly what are you talking about if you asked them this when they were growing up. After all, all food was food. It was used as the fuel source to keep you alive. Most foods in those days all had several things in common. Put simply, their motto was “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”

Nowadays, the food processing industry has changed all of this around. Canned foods, boxed foods, fast-foods, frozen dinners, meal-in-a-minute selections... this list can go on endlessly. But none of them are real food. Some have a little real food in them mixed up with all the chemicals, preservatives and additives, coloring agents, artificial (factory-born) flavors. Then there is other selections which are just plain 100% fake but made to taste, smell or sound like something your grandparent might recognize.

Now, with all of that said, is it any wonder that food allergies and sensitivities are at an all-time high? Diabetes, cancers and heart disease is the nemesis of many. Obesity is now the accepted norm. Many people realize they are 50 to 100 lbs heavier than they used to be. But the excuse I have heard, before they were underweight. Now they&apos;ve filled out nicely.

No, &quot;filling out nicely&quot; is not normal. It is the gradual acceptance of the abnormal because you have repeatedly failed to get back to normal.

Now, understand, I am not blaming this on the individual either. The food industry also knows, all those chemicals and additives do several things also. They make us want to eat, and eat and eat. They also pack on the lbs. and make changes to the body&apos;s metabolic processes so even when trying to lose, the body itself no longer recognizes this attempt. Therefore the lbs. pack on and they are resistant at falling off.

Is there a solution? Yes, it is here already within our grasp. It is known as the whole foods diet .

Now, that isn&apos;t some crazy diet plan. It is the way your grandparents and great-grandparents ate every day of their life.

Are You A Neat Freak?
If you are prone to allergies, many people assume being a neat freak has to be one of the better solutions to help control your allergies. Therefore, maintaining a good clean household, washed cabinets and doors, sterilized countertops and cutting boards should all help to control your allergen(s).

But the reality is, sterilizing a cutting board will not control anything actually. Plain old soap and water is actually a better course of action.

Why?

Because the process of sterilization is used to kill off bacteria on surrounding areas. But an allergen is a protein, therefore immune to the sanitizers which are available all over the market. Plain old soap and water being used consistently, and as necessary, showed a marked improvement after testing over the effects of using any type of sterilizer agent.

Save your money - buy a bar of soap!

Raw Milk vs. Pasteurized Milk
In this country, the United States, the Food and Drug Administration(FDA), the Center for Disease Control(CDC), all federal, state and most local governments all seem to sing the same song - &quot;All hail to pasteurized milk and condemn the raw milk industry&quot;.

Why is this when mankind has been drinking raw milk directly off the farm (straight out of the barn) for centuries and centuries? How do you think our grandparents, great-grandparents and on and on got their milk? Are cows today supposed to be different somehow from prior centuries?

The answer, protection for Big Agri-Business in this country comes at all costs to the small farmer trying to make a living with his small scale home-business and operation. And those cows, for shame for them assuming they could actually in this day and age pretend to make a safe and edible food product which is still safe for the average individual.

It&apos;s big news in every source of media when it exists there may be a possibility that raw milk has led to a large (or small) scale outbreak of food poisoning. Day one, even before testing to confirm the source has been the raw milk product, it is plastered over every radio, TV and newsprint to warn all of us unsuspecting consumers of the dangers lurking from those fresh raw (milk) cows.

Now obviously, sure cleanliness and safety protocols MUST be followed to confirm a safe and healthy product is to be received, even from the small scale operation. When safety protocols are not followed, sure the risk and possibility is there raw milk can become dangerous to man&apos;s health.

But many times, after testing, do you ever hear the outcome of the final test results? Sure, you do. Every single time the tests confirm the bacterial count was so high that the source of the raw milk was the source of the food poisoning.

But when was the last time you heard any media source take days and days, article after article to explain to us consumers that the problem was not the fresh raw milk products, it was something else. Have you ever heard? I sure haven&apos;t.

And yet, if you follow the full story, many times the dairy products themselves had nothing to do with the outbreak itself. Often times, it has been confirmed a fruit or vegetable, direct from seed from big business, was the offending culprit. But that&apos;s not news the &quot;powers to be&quot; in this country wants you to know. The media blitz against raw milk products is the information they want at the forefront of your mind.

Now obviously, just from my remarks here, it is obvious I am biased towards raw milk. But then I am against GMO&apos;s, pesticides and herbicides,food additives, food dyes, and artificial sweeteners and a whole host of other things they put in my foods.All of these chemical cocktails they insist in placing in our foods is the cause of many of our health problems in this day and age. Get back to the basics and it is amazing how many medical conditions start to clear up and no longer become a deciding factor in your daily health.

I have included a link here where a conscientious source, the Health Ranger releases raw milk infographic comparing fresh raw dairy to pasteurized homogenized dead milk . I wish everyone to take the time to check it, even if you aren&apos;t a milk enthusiast. Remember, just because you don&apos;t drink milk does not mean this is not being done to your cheese, yogurt, baked goods, casseroles and any other item you eat daily which includes milk. In it, it explains the main differences between raw milk and pasteurized milk. Take a look at this information yourself and use your own common sense (and judgement) which one do you think is actually better for your long-term health.

Statin Drugs: Do They Help or Hinder
Controversy has swirled around the use of statin drugs in the market for years. Way too many in the field of medicine believe their use is so over-rated when compared to the benefits these supposedly offer a patient. And yet, statins are one of the most widely prescribed drugs in many countries/nations.

As a treatment plan for high cholesterol, its common adverse reactions include increased chances of muscle failure, liver failure and kidney failure. But now the FDA has issued a release on their website stating stains are also proven to generate memory loss, high blood sugar levels in diabetics and also may lead to the actual diagnosis in a non-diabetic with the start of use. Therefore before statin use, control of your blood sugars could be normal. After starting statins, expect increased blood sugars, thus eventually a diabetic diagnosis.

If you are already on statins or your doctor has suggested them, it is time for a serious conversation with your doctor whether the use of a statin is actually a necessary plan of attack for your better health.

When&apos;s The Last Time You Had A Medication Consultation?
Sounds funny, huh? Believe me though, it&apos;s not.

Actually making an appointment with the doctor, or maybe two appointments consecutively so you have enough time, could save your health, reduce unpleasant symptoms you are currently experiencing or maybe even save your life.

Why? Multiple doctors all dispensing prescriptions often do not take the necessary precautions to confirm every medication you use is compatible with every other drug you are using also.

Now I am not saying they are intentionally trying to cause you harm. But the reality, no one person can ever know every contraindication on every medication. There is just too many of them.

Then people have a habit of forgetting to tell the doctor about some. Or people fail to mention the cough syrup they are using, the tylenol, advil or aspirin etc. they are taking. Even supplemental herbs and essential oils can lead to trouble when mixed with other medications if care is not taken to prevent adverse reactions between two substances.

Many people assume over-the-counter drugs and plants don&apos;t matter. But they do. Often, they can cause great harm or danger to a patient too, especially when the patient exceeds the dosage on the label.

Or almost every cough syrup has acetaminophen in it. What&apos;s that - a form of aspirin. So if you take aspirin per the bottles directions and then take cough syrup, you have just doubled your dosage on aspirin. If the doctor happens to give you something which also contains aspirin in any of its forms - you have now taken a triple dose.

See how this adds up. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ve all heard the easiest way to kill yourself is to swallow the pills in an aspirin bottle and then just fall asleep. Well, your well on your way there and you haven&apos;t even been trying.

Drug overdoses and drug adverse reactions do not only happen to the addict, like a heroin or cocaine addict. It can so easily happen to the normal individual also.

Make that appointment with your doctor soon, especially if you happen to be on a longer list of all different types of medications from a string of different doctors.

New Ingredient? - Arsenic In Baby Formula
On-going research on levels of arsenic in many food sources has revealed startling results on the toxicity of many major brands of baby formulas.

Read the label and if brown rice syrup, often considered a better source of natural sugars, is found on the label within the top five ingredients, put it back on the shelf.

It has turned out that prior to 2009 when the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) decided to ban the use of several toxic chemicals being used consistently in farming, the use of these chemicals was phased out but the toxicity levels are still in the soil itself. Anywhere this form of sugar is being grown (even in some farms which have since went organic), the toxins themselves have survived and are being passed onto the new crops which are grown in these fields in successive years.

Brown rice products seem to have the highest concentrations over any other form of rice because the hull itself is left intact before processing.(With white rice, the hull and germ layer are both stripped and discarded before use).

Increased incidences of infant allergies and sensitivities to heavy metals and toxins are therefore expected to be seen more and more at many physicians offices in the upcoming years.

Can&apos;t Blame The Fast Food Neighbors
Living near one or an assortment of fast food chains has been determined not to be a factor in the rise in diabetes.

A 30-year study has followed inhabitants all over the world where they have lived within a block of a fast food chain during those years. The final results: having a fast food chain nearby is not a detrimental factor for weight gain.

Actually, by experience, I have been in the food industry for the last 48 years of my life and I can say with certainty, the majority of us employees and management, we all reach this saturation point of the smell, taste and proximity and you no longer want it. You have to work with it, but that doesn&apos;t mean we have to eat it.

Fast Food Restaurant Changes Can Affect People With Allergies
Recently the franchise Burger King and Wendy&apos;s has made what may seem like minor changes to their menus, but if you have an allergy, both of these places may have become an issue for many people with a food allergy.

Wendy&apos;s has added a new burger. The bun itself is now buttered and then toasted. Anyone with a dairy allergy can not eat this. But the difficulty though arises because of cross-contamination, even if you do order a former &quot;safe food&quot;, your food could now be cooked on the same equipment which toasted that buttered bun.

Ask questions before ordering.

Burger King has now changed their french fries. All of the top eight major allergens (dairy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish and shellfish) are still missing but there has been an ingredient change for some lesser known allergens. If you have food sensitivities, ask questions before ordering.

Blood Donation
Do you have an upcoming surgery coming up?

How about a family member needing blood and you happen to be the same blood type as them?

Many diabetics believe, because of their condition, they are not capable of donating blood for a worthwhile cause. This though is just so far from the truth in many cases.

Initially, yes a few tests will be run to verify your safety if you do decide to go ahead with the donation. All of your safety checks are very easy though. Blood pressure, temperature, an iron count check etc.. Each of the steps to guarantee your safety can usually be completed in less than 5 minutes total. Do not worry either if you are on blood pressure pills, insulin injections or pills etc.. None of these are a contraindication preventing your donation.

For more information, please see the article Blood Donation - Can I Donate Blood Safely?

Oatmeal As Medicine
Many people have a problem with thinking and believing the concept &quot;Let thy food be thy medicine&quot; . And yet, oatmeal is one food which has such an excellent list of credentials going for it, it actually can help you retain better health.

Remember though, those over-processed boxes in round cylinders (these have a tendency to raise your blood sugars higher and are not considered gluten free) is not true oatmeal. Pick up some true steel cut oats or Irish oatmeal for the best health advantages. And yes, it takes longer to prepare real oatmeal, but just cook (or bake) a large pan once a week and you have a delicious and nutritious treat for the entire week. Add some fresh fruit, chopped nuts, diced dried fruits or some nut milk, hemp milk or soy milk each day to add extra nutrition and keep your bowl of cereal moist and delicious.

High in fiber (to stabilize blood sugars), it reduces cholesterol levels naturally and a great source of B vitamins which gives your body increased energy.

So now that you know why you should be eating it, let&apos;s figure out what you should be cooking with it. For some easy selections, also good for your diabetic or just healthy diet, check at diabetic oatmeal cookies or hot oatmeal cereal for some excellent suggestions how to prepare some good tasting oatmeal selections.

Having A Serving Of Bugs For Dinner Tonight
Is anything from the processed foods industry on your dinner plate tonight?

If it happens to be red in color, chances are very great it is from a crushed up beetle whose shell is, guess what, red when it is all ground up. Many people are allergic to these food products because of the addition of the red coloring. It ultimately always ends up in the food processing industry just for use as a coloring in many of our food products we eat on a daily basis.

Check your ingredients list and if the word carmine is there, I hope you enjoyed your ground up bugs!

For a safer and still easier way to retain the color without the visual reflection in your mind during dinner, preparing dinner yourself from scratch and using some all natural food coloring is the easiest way to enjoy your meal without the extra protein from a few ground up bugs thrown in.

Aluminum Toxicity and Infant Allergies: Where Do The Two Coincide?
Aluminum compounds are a standard component of almost every vaccine commonly given to our children. The reasons are plenty but the most important, according to the vaccine industry, is its capability of enhancing the total effects of the vaccine itself for a greater return of benefits.

But just stop to think, especially if you have a newborn or a young child, just how many of these vaccines are they continuously giving your child on a rotating basis? Current science, research, and practicing physicians themselves are so divided on the issue of vaccinations, it is really up to each individual parent to decide if you really believe it wise to allow your pediatrician to give just the normal round of vaccinations which are thought to be effective.

Vaccinations have been showing increases in metal toxicity, ADHD, Autism, Infant Allergies , aluminum allergies and a whole host of other difficulties, many of which have been linked back to the vaccine itself.

For starters, as a new or repeat parent, arm yourself with information first and then talk with your pediatrician. An excellent example of some of the eye opening difficulties a vaccine regimen can initiate is shown in this accumulation of studies shown here . This type of information, although common knowledge, is one set of circumstances the pharmaceutical industry itself will never be standing in line to warn you about.

Taking The Bite Out Of &quot;Old Man Winter&quot;
Diabetic exercise is not a seasonal philosophy. Just because it turns a little - or a lot, cold outside, is no reason to give up on mother nature occasionally. It just means a few extra precautions should be taken that are not so important during the warm weather months.
