Tips for starting a restaurant

The first step for starting a restaurant is to decide on the type and quality of food you will serve. Do you want to open an upscale restaurant that serves prime rib and seafood at a greater cost, or a mid scale restaurant where part of the appeal is more for your customer&apos;s money. There is also the option of opening a fast food restaurant where the emphasis is placed on speedy service and low prices.

After you have made a decision regarding the scale of your restaurant, the next step is to focus on food options and the type of restaurant decor that will reflect your restaurant&apos;s taste. What&quot;feeling&quot;will you present to your customers as they walk through your doors - romance, fun, private, ethnic? Restaurant competition can be fierce, so it is important that your restaurant decor causes your restaurant to stand out from the crowd.

Next, you will want to brainstorm a name for your restaurant. The name should not only reflect your restaurants ambience, but also be easy for people to remember. You will need to remember to check for name trademark availability [ http://tess2.uspto.gov ] and also register the name with the state in which your business will be located.

Selecting a location for your restaurant requires time and research. When selecting a geographical area, you should take into account external factors that will effect your business, such as: traffic flow, visibility, parking, handicap accessibility, lot size, crime rate, road condition and future construction plans.

Value and long-term quality should be the driving force behind your purchase of restaurant equipment. When it comes to credit card processing equipment and software, your purchase should include equipment that is secure enough to protect your business and your customers from identity theft. At Money Tree Merchant Services we can help you get started. We offer a free wireless credit card machine - the popular Nurit 8000 - to our new retail customers .
