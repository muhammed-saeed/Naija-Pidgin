 Every Job I’ve Ever Had

It’s Labor Day in the United States, the holiday that traditionally marks the end of summer and the beginning of the new school year. Officially, it’s intended as“a day off for the working citizens”.

 Because it’s Labor Day, I’ve spent much of the morning recalling all of the jobs I’ve had in my life. When I was young, I wanted to be a business executive or an astronaut or a writer. I’ve actually managed to become the latter, but it hasn’t been a very direct path.

My first paid work came in junior high. During the summer, my friends and I would pick beans and cucumbers and strawberries at nearby farms. This was piece work, though, and I didn’t make a lot of money. I spent most of it at the video arcade. My first job where I drew a paycheck was planting cauliflower.

 High school 
During the summer of 1984 (between my freshman and sophomore year of high school), my friend Torey and I worked for a local farmer. We earned $3.35/hour (minimum wage!) walking behind a big tractor, planting cauliflower. The work was hard, but it was fun. I spent the money on clothes and cassette tapes. (I remember buying Tears for Fears and U2 .) My father encouraged me to save, but I didn’t listen.

Also during high school, I worked other typical teenage jobs:

 I flipped hamburgers at Burger King (tedious) I sheared Christmas trees (hard work, but paid well) I flipped hamburgers at McDonald’s (loved it because my managers and co-workers were smart, industrious, and funny as hell) I spent a summer as a camp counselor 

Most notably, however, I worked in the family box factory. On 31 July 1985, his fortieth birthday, my father quit his job to start his own business. In a dilapidated old building on our property, he built his own machinery and the family began producing custom boxes . I hated it. I wanted to be out with my friends, but dad insisted I spend my evenings making boxes. To show my disdain, I would play angst-ridden teenage music ( The Cure , New Order , etc.) at full volume and sulk while I worked. I swore that after high school, I would never work for dad again.

 College 
During college, I held a variety of work-study jobs:

 Creating posters to hang around campus. Hanging posters around campus. Delivering A/V equipment. Answering telephones. Working at the information desk. Editing the literary magazine. 

These didn’t pay well, though. For real money, I had to find work off campus.

For a couple of years, I worked a hotel 45 minutes away. I’d drive up on Saturdays and Sundays to bus tables (and, later, to wait tables) in the coffee shop. I kept this same job for a couple summers. It was my first introduction to the Real World, really. Before, I’d been working with other kids my own age. At the Holiday Inn, I was working with 50-year-old waitresses and grumpy cooks who couldn’t find work anywhere else. Still, I had a lot of fun and earned a lot of money. (Which I promptly spent on computers and those new-fangled compact discs.)

During my junior and senior years of college, I took a job as a resident assistant to pay for room and board.

 Post-collegiate 
During the summer after college, I was aimless. I found work at a Japanese school managing the audio-visual equipment. I was paid in room and board.

For spending money, I waited tables at the new Red Robin in town. The interview for that job was memorable. The manager told me,“Remember: the best way to increase your tips is to sell more food. Ask your customers if they would like a drink from the bar. Encourage them to order appetizers or side orders. Offer them dessert.”This had never occurred to me before.

Soon after this, I took a job selling insurance door-to-door around rural Oregon. This was truly the worst job I ever had . I hated it. People would invite me into their homes, and we would have a pleasant chat, but I could not get anyone to buy anything. I maybe sold ten policies in ten weeks. At $40 a policy, I was going broke quickly!

I quit the job with no prospect of another. I had several thousand dollars in credit card debt, I owed on a new Geo Storm , and I was paying rent on two apartments. It was a nightmare. I took temporary work to staunch the bleeding, but ultimately I did something I’d sworn never to do: I returned to work for my father.

 The box factory 
In January 1992, dad hired me to be his box salesman. This was better than selling insurance, but I still didn’t like it. I stayed at it though, because he was paying me the amazing sum of $20,000 a year. With that money, I could pay off my debt in no time! Only I didn’t pay off my debt. I bought comic books. I bought a new computer. Kris and I bought a house. I got hooked on the income and allowed myself to succumb to lifestyle inflation . When I got a raise, I spent it.

During my 16 years selling boxes, I did a variety of things on the side:

 I spent a year as a part-time computer programmer (I always thought I’d love this, but I hated it) I started my own computer consulting firm I began blogging 

That last item is most important, of course. Eventually, my web sites were generating enough revenue that I could quit my day job to write full time, something I’d always dreamed of doing. I always imagined I’d write science fiction novels, not articles about personal finance, but it turns out I simply love to write. I’m fortunate to be doing something I love.

That’s enough reminiscing for one day. How about you? How many jobs have you worked in your life? Which was your favorite and why? What do you hope to be doing ten years from now?

Oh boy! I’ve had so many jobs it’s ridiculous. In brief, since I was 12 I’ve babysat, worked at the local library as a page (re-shelving books as they came in) for $4.00/hour (minimum wage), worked lots of retail, worked at a daycare, worked at a Pizza Hut as a cook (we affectionately called it Pizza Rut), have done direct care for both mentally and physically handicapped adult males and on a Geriatric Psych floor in a hospital (both of which were stressful and depressing), cashiering at a health food store, secretarial work and am now back in retail selling over-priced textbooks to under-funded students. Honestly? Of all of those, cashiering in the health food store was my favorite. It was in Austin, TX, I worked with a lot of hippies, so was able to enjoy that aspect of my own personality, dyed my hair hot pink, learned a lot about self-care and good food and even got to meet and get the autograph of singer/songwriter Sara Hickman! She was buying diapers and other stuff and just was very nice and fun. I think that may have been the job where I was most able to be at ease and work with a very interesting variety of people. I, too, would like to write for a living. I’m searching for the spine to do so.

Your blog is inspiring at every turn–I started reading it for the financial insight as I started getting my finances on track and also enjoy all of the other insights you share. I giggled to myself the other day because I, someone who fearfully avoided financial matters, looks forward to the daily email I get from you. Thanks and keep it up!

I worked as a vet asst,waited tables (great money), bartended (better money), was an 800 operator (Grrr),cleaned toliets (YUK), and now work in the automotive industry. The latest has paid the most, been the hottest, coldest, dirtiest, and by far the best. Really the biggest downer is that I will lose it in a year or two from now. It is also an industry that has taught me the most and allowed me to further my education to a BS. Thanks for sharing!

Good stuff. Reminded me of some of my classics too. In particular, I detassled corn for two weeks. Wasn’t exactly for me. Riding the bus (unpaid) for nearly 3.5 hours a day to get back and forth for dirt wages wasn’t much motivation.

Right after high school I spent another two week stint working for the state. Another minimum wage job that culminated at a hot summer day scrapping dear guts from the road. Yummy.

Since you mentioned, do you plan to write a book in the near future? Would it be a personal finance or a sci-fi? It would be interesting to see you write a sci-fi.
Cheers,

The best job of all time wasn’t a job so much as it was a part of my job. During high school I worked at the local Home Depot in the out door section where they sell mulch and trees. It was fun to get some fresh air, drive a fork lift, and pall around with the rest of my friends. But then one day it came.

Demolition day. As I’m sure everyone has been in a home improvement store at one point it time, you know of the miniature kitchen and bath setups in the store. These are actually owned not by the store them selves but the actual manufacturer. Once a reset is done you contact the manufacturer to pick them up. They never do. So we can’t sell them and the manufacturer doesn’t want them what do you do? Throw them away. Problem is that they are attached to a wall and don’t fit in the dumpster, that’s where I came in. I was handed a sledge hammer, a circular saw, and a crow bar. It was very fulfilling to destroy something, made you not care you were sweating profusely for maybe 8 bucks an hour.

The sad part was that I destroyed close to 100,000 dollars worth of merchandise, but I wasn’t as frugal as I am now.

De-tassled corn? Oh my word. That must have been awful. Farm work is like no other. Whenever I think of the jobs we used to do (and I didn’t list all the one-off things like hauling hay or cleaning out barns or planting seedlings in the greenhouse), I’m reminded of my favorite scene from Napoleon Dynamite .

My best job was picking wild mushrooms, called Chanterelles, and selling them to fine dining restaurants. They only grow in a hot and humid climate, so climbing the hills and carrying a heavy bucket wasn’t easy, but decisions were all up to me. It’s why I created my blog, to help launch my own business. I’m still a few years away, but I’m never giving up. It’s all about working happy.

Babysitting ($1 an hour, $0.75 if it was just one kid), delivering the afternoon paper, punching cards, proctoring exams, filing, being a teaching assistant, teaching, reading reports and doing miscellaneous paperwork for a grant program, web development, translation, teaching German. The translating and teaching have been the most interesting work, and the second boss I had at the grant program is the best boss I’ve ever had and that job wasn’t too bad. On the whole, though, I would say that the most rewarding experiences in my life have never involved getting paid.

In ten years I would like to be a sailing instructor and writer, so I’m still going to need a day job.

Babysitting, prep cook and weekend breakfast and lunch cook at the FBI Academy (yes, I can crack two eggs at a time, one in each hand, to fill a huge wheeled pot–it held dozens of eggs…one day a wheel got caught going into the walk-in and I came very close to losing all of my hard work), front desk clerk, waitress, retail sales person (lasted two weeks), receptionist and tour guide for a model home (I could quote all the specs easily), elementary school teacher (I still miss the kids, but not anything else), technical writer/editor, and quality assurance specialist. I enjoy the QA role because I am anal (LOL). I’ve been doing this type of work for many years on various projects. I am very good at it, but I am ready for something else. I lead a celiac/gluten intolerance support group. I love helping others become gluten free and healthy. So I am starting a blog on the side to teach people how to eat gluten free easily and inexpensively.

Maybe this is looking back with false memories, but I never considered New Order to be all that angst-ridden.

That being said, the unintentional comedy of John Barnes rapping on“ World In Motion ”probably never made it Stateside. 

The people with the worst job at school were those who manned fresh fish counters in supermarkets. I’ll never forget them complaining about the smell lingering on them all week, then just about leaving them before they went back to the counter the next weekend.

Eesh, memories!

I was allowed to start babysitting when I was 12. I think I charged $3/hr and $1 extra per kid. Something crazy. My mom gets more than $10 when she babysits. Quite a bit more, I’m sure, as a lot of parents just toss cash at her gratefully after a good night out.

When I was 14, I was a receptionist at a hair salon. Learned some useful tips about hairstyles (I always try to bring in a picture and talk to the stylist about my particulars—curl, thickness, face shape—to help figure out how they’ll work the style to suit me.)

At 15, I started writing monthly columns for the Anchorage Daily News—I entered a contest and was chosen as one of 4; they asked me to stay on after the 6 months were up. I kept writing for around another year.

When I was 16, I started working a movie theater, which may be one of those places where humanity is at its absolute worst. I worked full-time in the summer and, in the school year, one day a week plus weekends.

When I was 17, I did some temp work in addition (I thought I was rich, making $10 an hour) for two months. That summer, I worked both the movie theater and Red Robin (as an expediter, checking the orders/getting condiments/running the food to tables) full time.

The summer after my freshman year, I worked full-time at the movie theater and part-time at Red Robin again.

Then I got sick at 19. The next year, I started working at the school paper. In the next two years I did reporting, movie reviews, various editing positions. All while working against an increasingly-obvious energy limitation from the illness. (Score one for denial.)

When I was done with school, I had $32,000 in the bank thanks to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend and saving all my babysitting/holiday/job money. I was supposed to pay off my student loans but instead used it as a downpayment on a house. Ran a rooming house for three years, while also doing random part-time jobs to make ends meet. I worked part-time for a small paper; I delivered the UW Daily paper in the mornings (on the days I wasn’t too exhausted to get out of bed); I worked part-time for UW in an administrative position. I fought off the now-really-obvious fact that I couldn’t keep up any kind of work long-term.

Then I crashed severely, slept almost constantly for a month (I was awake maybe 9 hours a day), then money problems meant I got back out and got a resident manager job.

After I still couldn’t make ends meet renting out my house, getting free rent as as a resident manager and temping one to two days a week, I moved to a bigger apartment complex. Where I crashed and burned again.

My mom moved to the state and I moved in with her, and sold my house because I couldn’t make my student loan payments. The profits paid the loans plus about $20,000. I paid off my mom a ton of money she had loaned me—around $13,000 total. Then lived on the rest for a few months, trying to figure out what to do. It became apparent that I wasn’t even able to leave the house regularly, let alone work regularly. So I swallowed my pride and applied for disability and spent the time (18 months) building up my health again.

For about a year, I worked a few hours a week from home for a start-up corporation, cataloging business world relationships (which taught me a lot about the corporate world). Then the boss increasingly demanded I work from their office, which made my health start spiraling. Then a reorganization of the company meant I was no longer needed—unless I wanted to enroll in computer programming classes (on my own dime).

Two years since, I’m finally really healthy and being mindful of my limits. And really looking forward to figuring out some form of gainful employment. I have some very-PT work from MSN on a short-term project. Meanwhile, I am signing up with the Dept of Vocational Rehabilitation. That will help me figure out what I can do reliably and over the long-term, and hopefully will find me something with insurance so I can get off Medicare.

Did I mention I just turned 30?

In 10 years, I would love to have found a job working from home (maybe I’ll become one of the few bloggers to make this vaguely profitable but I’m not holding my breath). As long as there’s insurance and okay money, I will be happy as a clam!

My best job so far was launching missile targets as a contractor for the Navy. I got to play with JATO bottles, Military flares, and the world’s biggest, most expensive model airplanes! Downside-very stressful. One small mistake could literally cost someone their life. Worst job- Janitor in a company that made sliding truck windows and greenhouse windows. Cleaning up broken glass for 6 hours a day.

High School:

1. Occasionally babysat neighbor’s kid
2. Brief stint tutoring shorthand

College:

1. Clerk/cashier at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory
2. Occasionally babysat neighborhood kids
3. Light housecleaning and cooking in exchange for room and board
4. Brief stint driving a little girl to her appointments

Law School:

No jobs besides helping family and family business affairs

After Law School:

1. Many different firms over 10 years
2. My own image consulting business
3. My own law school coaching business
4. Now my own blogging business : )

Throughout college I worked as a waitress. I learned an incredible amount about people at this job, and it also helped me learn how to manage a crowd.

Now I teach a few classes. Another teacher once observed that I seem to know how to handle a class effectively. Upon reflection, I realized it was a skill I picked up in my waitressing days!

And thanks for sharing with us about Max the“Meatball”cat. Cats are wonderful creatures when we get to know them.

I’ve had fewer jobs than many, and way fewer McJobs–I guess I’ve been lucky. In high school, I had a brief job as a dishwasher in a coffee house, which was boring, and had the usual share of babysitting and lawn-mowing jobs. I also worked cutting and de-pitting apricots for drying for $0.25/tray one summer. (The trays were big: you had to cut about 100 cots to fill one.)

My most useful job in terms of life experience was a summer job loading and unloading my uncle’s truck as we went cross-country; I got to see warehouses and the inside of little ol’ladies’houses from Seattle to Orlando, FL. And I had a close shave after nearly dropping a 300 pound dresser with a marble top off the truck on top of me in a place called Stuttgart, AR. (A bit of fancy footwork saved both me and the dresser…)

That job convinced me I’d better go to college–after having a very indifferent high school career. I aced the first couple of years in junior college, took a FORTRAN class (it was 1980), got a summer job as a programmer at National Semiconductor, and made enough money that summer to pay for room&amp;board. I ended up at UC Berkeley as a JC transfer, majored in math and CS, and got summer jobs at Lockheed, where I wrote a piece of software that they still use (and ask me about from time to time).

After graduating, I worked at Lockheed again for a couple of years, before going back to UC Berkeley as a staffer on a research project. The project went well, and launched me in my career specialty: database engines and internals, where I spent the next 20 years, mostly in startups or consulting.

Good topic and post, JD! It’s labour day in Canada too. My favourite job was bartending, which I did at nights&amp;weekends from the age of about 16 through 24. I still dream about having my own pub, to the point that I’ve scouted locations and prepared a decent business plan. I’ve also waited tables, worked in a tennis pro-shop in connecticut, and worked for architects and contractors and construction consultants, as well as picked up some side money making signs, of all things. Ten years from now? God, who knows, but I hope I’m working less hours than I currently do.

This is going to take some thinking on my part…however I remember my first job…I was 15 and I was a kitchen aide and receptionist for the convent that was next to my high school. Elderly nuns lived there and I helped serve their meals, wash dishes, and answer phones…I remember that my shifts were usually about 4 hours long, and no matter what we always got to sit down and eat the meal and were not required to clock out for this break…lol! I think that was probably the cushiest job I ever had…After that I decided that I wanted to work with boys because I want to an all girls high school and worked at a convent, so I realized that I really had NO way of meeting guys to potentially date…So I got a job as prep person at Friendly’s Restaurant…I made desserts. Every once in awhile I was allowed to make a grilled cheese, drop a basket of fries, DECORATE an ice cream cake (haha!) or wait tables…I thought these little breaks in the monotony of making ice cream sundaes was AWESOME! I also took great pride in making my ice cream sundaes look like artwork…to this day I say there is an art to the scoop. =0)

Anyways, after about two years of working at Friendly’s I got bored and frustrated with working there because my boss was prone to MAJOR temper tantrums, and his two sons spent a lot of time in the dishwashing room blairing David Bowie and smoking pot…I realized I got sick of the toxic environment and moved on up the ladder of food service jobs to being a server at Steak‘n’Shake…Steak‘n’Shake was a fairly new restaurant to the area I lived in, so it was kind of trendy…and I got to be a server…which meant for the first time I got tips…there is nothing like being 18 years old and counting your tips after a long day and realizing that you made 60 bucks in a 6 hour shift…NICE! That was more than I could have ever dreamed of at the convent…I actually loved working at Steak‘n’Shake…I had regular customers, there were boy co-workers to flirt with, and I made friends with the other servers on staff…some of whom went to my school. I worked there on and off until I was about 20 years old…during this time however I also went away to school…about three hours from my hometown…and I worked all the while I was there too…My first semester I got a job at a place called the Galley because this guy I had met online (who was going to be a sophomore at my University…woohoo) told me I should work there…What he failed to tell me was that the Galley was this greasy little snack bar in the basement of my residence hall that fried EVERYTHING and that I would basically be relegated to running the dishwasher in the backroom for the first year because I was a freshman…One day I got up and didn’t feel like going…so I didn’t go…and yeah, I can say now that this is the wrong thing to do…you should never no-call no-show…believe me, that’s about the least professional and least respectable thing you could do. Don’t let people get that idea of you. So I went for a few fancy free weeks of unemployment while going to school until I realized that I had no money to spend and that nice credit card that i had been signed up for wanted me to pay‘em…yeah…my first credit card…so now I was 19 and I had credit card debt, in school, spending like a wild woman with the nice windfall I got from my student loan refund check (my reasoning was the interest was low and it would be easy to pay back later…hahaha!) and I needed a job. Guess what was right across the street from my residence hall??? That’s right…McDonald’s…I got a job working at McDonald’s…this was an interesting experience…I got to see the powdered onions that they use for like EVERYTHING…and I got to make McFlurries…the highlight of my employment there…I also loved the culking gun looking things they used for the Big Mac sauce and mayonnaise…that was the best part of dressing sandwiches…It may have come to your attention by now that one of the things that excites me the most is how things are laid out visually…putting something together with a lot of detail…some employers have appreciated that about my work…others have said that I work too slowly…I think that some of my work environments have not been suited to the individual attention and attention to detail that I like to give things…so it is no wonder some of them have gotten frustrated with me for taking too long on projects. I only worked for McDonald’s for one semester, because I did not enjoy smelling like french fries all the time, wearing a ball cap, and working with Phil who liked to tell me“Yuk! Yuk! If you got time to lean you got time to clean.”Thanks for the sentiment Phil…did I ever tell you that you sort of remind me of Goofy from Mickey Mouse and friends??

That summer was an interesting one…I started out deciding with my friends that we wanted to work at Kings Island amusement park because we heard they paid really good and you got a free pass if you worked there…so we signed up…those lucky dogs got jobs in games…I ended up in *drumroll please* food service…Lovely old food service…I wound up being a cashier at a place called the Stunt Crew Grill in the Paramount Action Zone part of the park…My stunt was standing for 9 hours a day selling overpriced hotdogs, hamburgers, nachos, desserts, drinks, and beer to tourists…tourists who often got angry at me for asking to see their ID (we had to ask everyone) or that the teeny weeny beer they were buying cost $5.25…do you really need a beer that bad people? They got mad if I didn’t give them their change fast enough…they got mad a lot…We also listened to a KISS FM radio station where I got to here the NSYNC song“It’s gonna be me”like a million times…I also developed a crush on my supervisor…he was a little older and went to Ohio State…dreamy…I worked there for about a month when my friends decided to quit, and suddenly I realized that I was driving about an hour and half round trip every day to get there, and it just wasn’t possible to keep doing that in my broken down little beater 1985 Toyota Tercel…the whole car shook if I ever went faster than 60 mph…So then I got my next job that I stayed at for quite awhile…I was a server at Tumbleweed…Tumbleweed was a big step up for me I felt at the time…I was going to be a waitress in a nice casual dining restaurant, serving appetizers, steaks, alcoholic beverages and the like to people…the prices were higher…and the tips were better sometimes. I liked working there and I had a reputation for being a good worker there…so I kind of felt like a valued employee and that made me want to stay there…I actually had a really hard time quitting when the time came to move on. When I went back to school that semester I got a job working for Instructional Media Services on campus…I was so afraid they’d find out about my no call no show at the Galley that I told them about it in my interview and my boss said“everybody makes mistakes, so don’t worry about it.”I set up computers, video projectors, and other A/V equipment in the main lecture hall on campus…I worked there all year and loved it…that was a really easy job and I felt like I was finally away from food service…then I went home for the summer and worked at Tumbleweed again…This time I worked days and nights…I was working hard so that I could pay my cell phone bill and my credit card bill, and so I could go out with friends…I didn’t grasp the concept of saving back then…I had a boyfriend by this time, and all I could think of was how much I missed him…lol…oh how young and funny I was back then…I remember very clearly that fall of my junior year in college…my best friend and I moved into an apartment off campus…I felt so ADULT like! I had to pay for rent and utilties…we would grocery shop, clip coupons, clean the house, and it felt like we were playing house…lol…our boyfriends were even roommates, so we would double date with them…that September she and I both got jobs working at Dining Services on campus…she got a job at Founders food court…and I got job as a server at the Silver River Cafe…I felt pretty big time there because I’d been a waitress at Tumbleweed…haha! Well pretty soon my efforts were noticed and I got promoted to Student Supervisor…and then the university opened the new Student Union and I signed on as a transfer employee to the new union…I was going to work in the office as a Student Personnel Coordinator…however, I think I was too outgoing for that position because I never quite got the hang of working with the spreadsheets and databases…and they suggested that I could be an office assistant if I wanted too…and I said“Well I was going to be a student supervisor”at my old job and they said“Do you want to do that here?”And I said“Heck yes!”So I got to be a student supervisor…I spent the summer on campus that year, and went out pretty much every night…and spent all of my money…I had broken up with my boyfriend and was mending my broken heart by going out every night and partying…well it didn’t really work…but it was fun anyways…I worked really hard at my job and at school that summer and I was asked to go into a training program to be a student manager. I was thrilled! That had to mean I was doing well…During that time I got to work at university concessions, at the on campus pub, the on campus pizza parlor, all the food court areas, and a campus cafe…I really felt like I knew my stuff and I took pride in doing a good job as a supervisor. This is so cute to me now…I worked there for about 4 years combined…I took my skills from there and my final summer in college I worked as a day care worker and as a bartender at a golf course. I liked the bartender job better…you know why? I got to serve something, interact with customers, and I got to do something in the“entertainmentish”area…I got to work some wedding receptions and I loved doing that.

My degree was in Child and Family Community Services/Human Development and Family Studies…I had the noble idea that I wanted to“help”people although I think in doing that that I neglected my natural skill for customer service, selling a product, and attention to detail.

After college I have had far fewer jobs…and stuck with them longer…it’s been about 3 years since graduation…and in that time I had a short stint at a mental healthy agency as a housing case manager…this was not a good job for me…I couldn’t really help the people because most of them had much bigger underlying issues than homelessness…most of them were chronically mentally ill, had substance abuse problems, criminal records, and little or no education or work history…I was much too green and naive for such a field…although I didn’t think so at the time. I was depressed because my strong work ethic and idea of solving everyone’s problems just was not working out…people really do have to help themselves first folks…no good can be done by those of us who want to help until a person has made the commitment to change.
My next job was short term to help me find a job after I quit at the mental health agency…I was a store clerk at Cincinnati Natural Foods…again I had the opportunity to interact with customers and help them select products, sell them a product, and I was actually helping people…even if it was on a short term basis…plus I was interested in natural foods and healthy living. If the pay was better I would have thought about sticking around for a longer time…but I still wanted to pursue something in my field…and that is when I got a job at a MR/DD services organization…I worked in transition services for youth and adults with physical and developmental disabilities. I loved this job for awhile…I worked for a non-profit and it was very laid back…so laid back in fact that I really was not given any training…and that was difficult…I had to orient myself to how to spend my days, what would be a productive use of my time, and to how to teach classes within the first month of employment. I learned however that I LOVE to teach…I absolutely love to teach people new concepts…specifically about things like personal finance, careers, job searches, etc…I could see lightbulb moments in my students lives and it was just so wonderful. However, I never got the adequate training and support that I needed, and the organization that I worked for had such a high level of turnover that I had several different supervisors in the two years that I worked there…that got to be very hard to deal with because I had all the responsibilities in the department when there was no department head, but not authority over the department at all…I interviewed for the department head position and was turned down because an individual with a masters degree (who incidentally quit at exactly the same time I did) was offered the position. I left that organization for the opportunity to work with a nationwide non-profit…a scouting organization just last May…I am happy in the job, but at 27 I still feel like I am trying to find my niche in careers…I don’t quite think I’ve found it…but writing this blog here today has helped me to notice some patterns from the past. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to write about this.

I really love getrichslowly.org btw!

My favorite is my current work as a financial planner. I don’t sell products or manage accounts. I work directly for clients and get paid only for my time to deliver advice. I’m self employed and love my work. I would like to write more and get paid for it.

I hope that in ten years, 1/3 of my working time is spent advising clients about financial planning, 1/3 writing about financial planning, and 1/3 lecturing about financial planning to individuals and other financial planners.

Thanks for sharing a bit of your life with us!

I’ve had a few jobs:

High school–piano teacher, cashier at a craft store

College–cafeteria worker, resident adviser, serving wench at the Utah Shakespearean Festival, waitress

Post college–cashier at farm store, Classified ad salesperson and office manager for local newspaper, freelance writer

My favorite job is the one I have now—freelance writer. I realized in high school, when I was a piano teacher working for myself, that I wanted a job that I could do from home and set my own hours.

In 10 years, I hope to have written a book. And had it published and doing well

I saved most of my money from the jobs I had in high school and college, but looking back, I kind of wish I had just spent it. While it seemed like a lot of money at the time, I make more in a week at my current job than I made in 5 years of delivering newspapers.

Then again, I guess it’s good that I got into the habit of saving from an early age. I worry about my younger sister, because she seems to think that she is required to spend money as soon as she gets it. I hope she grows out of it when she has to support herself (she’s in college now and my parents pay for everything).

I have (chronologically from sophomore in high school) pumped gas (back when they used to do this), dug graves, worked as a laborer on a petroleum pipeline construction crew, roughnecked on several different oil rigs in Oklahoma and Texas during the late 1970 early 1980 oil boom, became a journeyman lineman for 15 years and now work as a system operator in an electrical transmission control room. Every one of these jobs has helped make me what I am, and I don’t regret a minute of them.

During my lifetime I have been a writer, stockbroker, photographer, librarian, banker, mom, counselor, poet, third-shift postal worker, painter, academic psychologist, sister, English teacher, and firefighter.

Not always at the same time. Not necessarily in that order.

Which did I like best? Probably the two that are a combination of several: creator (writing, poetry, photography, art), and teacher.

Why? One allows me to share what I already know. The other allows me to share what I do not yet know myself.

What do I hope to be doing? In good health, creating and teaching!

Started at 16 at the local record store, great perks, cheap Beatles albums! Moved into making pizzas, managing pizza parlors, flipping burgers, to bartending.

Then when I quit drinking and I moved into more retail, now in jewelry. Tried my hand at making jewelry, having my own gallery and when that didn’t really pay much I’m now back at retail in a new venue for me that I like.

Where am I going with this? Don’t know but I have had a great life and have met lots of interesting people. I wouldn’t change a thing.

I think I’m on the younger end of the average reader spectrum here. I started in high school with a job at a small video business run out of a guy’s home. I transferred people’s old home films to DVD (felt slightly voyeuristic at times) and occasionally manned a camera at events he filmed. After high school I got a full-time internship with a small business in another city doing graphics, web, and print media design and web application development. After a few months there I was asked to stay on with the company after my internship ended, which I did. This was my first introduction to living on my own and managing my budget and finances.

After a year with that company, and looking for a change, I decided to go to college. While at school I got a job with the publications department doing graphics/print design and some web programming. Because of my growing passion for photography, I also started working as one of the school photographers and a free-lance photographer for the school newspaper and yearbook. I also donated my graphic design and photography skills to campus clubs and organizations in order to gain more experience.

After my freshman year the company I previously worked for asked me to come back for the summer, which I did. I headed back to college in the fall, then took this past spring semester off to travel. My travels helped me build my photography portfolio, from which I have licensed a few images. This summer I found a job close to home (my parent’s home, that is) yet again doing graphics and print design for a printing company that was seeking to offer better print marketing solutions. I gained valuable experience as the small graphics department manager. I also learned a lot about printing and why printers commonly get peeved at graphic designers. While there the owner launched another company geared towards web marketing solutions. I was able to receive four days of invaluable training and become certified to offer the search engine optimization and other web marketing packages through our partner company.

Now that I’m currently back at college I’m still doing lots of photography, working remotely for the printing and web marketing companies back at home, and putting in a few hours on a project for the college publications department. Needless to say, I’m a busy guy, but I still take time to read this excellent blog. Thanks J.D.!

I’m a young reader too–I’m 18 and just about to start college. In middle school I took video production classes and got offered the opportunity to work with one of my teachers to film birthdays and weddings. That paid very well, and I loved it. But it wasn’t reliable–just a few jobs here and there. I tried doing it by myself recently, but it’s harder without multiple workers who will edit/film something you missed/lend you their fancy equipment.

In high school, I figured if i wanted a job, it should be something I like. I started pet-sitting for the neighbors, and I’m still doing it. I’ve built up a network and done big jobs, like four months with a house and a cat while the owners were in Singapore. Since pet sitting mostly booms when people are on vacation, I do babysitting the rest of the year. Now that school is starting, I have one job lined up to be regular two days of the week, leaving time for my classes, homework, and leisure. And if I have extra time or need more cash, I can take jobs here and there from other clients. A great thing about babysitting is making myself available to the customers that I really like and being able to turn down the ones that don’t go so well.

I wanted to get a job at a bookstore, but it would be less lucrative and more time consuming than the jobs I have now, and the experience would probably be equal in value.

I’ve always thought about doing something with art but for now, this really works for me. I’m going to study art and figure out if it works as a financial support for me. I don’t want to make things I don’t like just so they sell, like at an ad agency or something. But at the same time, the fun jobs tend to pay less or be harder to get. So I figure for now, I’ll stay with the pet/baby/house-sitting. And I’m constantly saving so that I’ll be able to afford the most important things to me: education. traveling, and going out with my boyfriend. My job isn’t the ultimate dream yet, but the work I do now pays for the experiences (like going to art galleries or shows in LA on the weekends and networking with other local artists) that will get me where I want to be later. Oh, and it doesn’t hurt that one of my clients whom I babysit for is a professor at a design college and works in the field!

My stepfather was a general housing contractor, so I started working for him at $1 / hour when I was 8-9. As I got older, the work got both harder and more interesting, hours got longer, pay got better. By junior high I was making more than minimum wage, and getting about 40 hours a month during the school year. When I was 15 I went to work for his framing contractor as well, and kept doing that off and on except for a semester during undergrad when I tried delivering office supplies for $5.5/hour (a pay cut from, I think, $8/hour framing new homes but I thought I could make the schedule work better with my classes)–turns out I hated the delivery job and went back to framing for a couple of years.

The final two years I spent in undergrad (aerospace engineering) I worked as CAD draftsman for an engineering firm.

Went to grad school and started teaching undergrad courses–Engineering Mechanics and programming classes for engineers. Got my Master’s in aerospace and went for a PhD out of state, which meant that I finally quit working for my stepdad’s business–I had at least two jobs from the time I was 15 until I turned 25. I had taken the slow method through a state college and graduated with no debt and a nice chunk of money in the bank.

At the out-of-state college I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant–I managed to get into a top research institution with a research assistantship and a relatively nice stipend. I also managed to save money during this time as well, but I didn’t get the PhD. Eventually I burned out and took a year off, living on my savings–I don’t regret that I took the time off, but I wish that I had made my‘vacation’about four months or so instead of a year.

After that, I moved into a nice position at an aerospace consulting firm, mostly doing work for NASA’s Constellation program, though we have customers other than NASA.

Since‘building space ships’is what I’ve wanted to do since I was about 12 years old, I feel pretty lucky to have ended up right where I was aiming to be.

Overall, I’ve been relatively happy at every job I’ve had except the office supply delivery job. Even the graduate research position was a nice job working with and for great folks–it was the academic jump from a Master’s at a relatively laid-back school to the PhD program at an elite school that I couldn’t handle.

I’ve given some consideration to turning one of my hobbies into an income-earner for variety, but to be honest, my job is flexible enough that I can work extra hours and get paid extra. That might not appeal to folks who don’t like their jobs, but it suits me just fine. I went in today (yes, on Labor Day) for 5 hours because I’ve been working on an interesting problem and I was itching to get back to it after spending Sat and Sun thinking about it…

i had a couple formal jobs in high school, between 1 and 4 jobs at any given time in college, and now i’m contractually obligated to spend all my time on my education. that’s ok, i do that at more than full time.

my favorite was retail management- it taught me that i needed to stay the hell away from retail but managing people is something i can do. i had a blast with my employees. my second favorite is the work i do for my education currently. it gives me the skill set i need to have to get into my future. and it’s just cool.

I don’t think I’ve had as many jobs as most people around here–part of me thinks that’s just an attitude I was brought up with. I was always taught to stick it out, and never quit. Which isn’t the advice most young people get nowadays–it’s all‘follow your dreams, don’t settled for second best!’. Most of my younger friends have gone through way more jobs than I have purely because of that…

Anyway, my first job was doing the mail in an accounting office at 15. Which was fine, pay seemed amazing at the time (of course now I know it was below minimum wage!) and I liked the people. But it was temporary, and I had to leave after a few months. My next job was in my local convenience store, working for my older brother who was a supervisor there. Hated it. After I was robbed at knifepoint for the second time(!) I quit, and my brother followed shortly after. Then, aged 18, I got a part-time job in a baker between classes at University. I *loved* this job, and still miss it today. The early mornings were tough, but the work was rewarding and I could really feel like I was learning a useful skill. Baking bread is an art, and I was being paid to practice it! Plus it’s the only job I know of where you smell better at the end of your shift than at the start Sadly I made a mistake and left this job when I was offered a role tutoring struggling students at the University. It paid twice as much and I felt it would be more useful on my resume. I liked it just fine, and it was very easy to not have to leave campus to do a shift. But I missed the bakery, and sometimes I still do.

Aged 21 I joined the navy. By accident. That’s another story though!

Aged 22 I did a few internships at law firms and was offered a graduate job for later down the line. I was also given a grant to finish law school, so I didn’t have to work until graduating at 23. I’m nearly 25 now and work in a large international law firm. Honestly, I don’t much care for it. In terms of‘worst-to-best’jobs, it sits somewhere in the middle–and I can’t help but think that the job I’ll be doing for the rest of my life ought to be right at the top of that list.

Let’s see…:

Paper route when I was 12 (lasted about a year, I decided I liked sleeping)

Various work around house paid by Dad (he paid me the then exhorbitant rate of $5.00 an hour, I was the envy of all my friends)

Stock room boy at Nordstrom during my junior year in high school (for less than the $5.00 an hour my dad would pay me for odd jobs). I did meet a girl that worked there that worked for a modeling agency, which led to…:

Being a small-time fashion model who did some small amount of work (it did pay, but most of the money I made never recouped the money I spent on pictures and promotion).

Ran a grill at a combination restaurant and ice cream parlor while I should have been focusing on school.

Started driving and delivering pizza’s when I was 18 for Dominos. This was the job that helped me start funding my“music career”, i.e .as a singer in various rock bands over a ten year period.

After two years of delivering pizza’s and running two cars into the ground, I cleaned houses for a few years along qwith being a musician.

Decided that perhaps a temp agency might be able to help me get better work, so I went with one that sent me to a small networking company in 1991. Decided any company that hired long haired freaks like me by the dozens had to be a place I’d love to work, so I did all in my power to tget hired on full time. I worked in the manufacturing groups, and ultimately got hired on as a lab admin/cable monkey.

Worked my way up from cable monkey to tester to quality assurance engineer over a ten year period. Left that company at the beginning of 2001.

Took a chance and a big pay raise by moving to a smaller company in 2001. Worked there for a year until I expereinced my first ever layoff.

Landed another job a few months later that also lasted about a year. However, both my manager and I determined that what they wanted to have me do and what I could actually deliver on didn’t quite match.

Took that opportunity to go back to college, and while I was a full time student with a wife and three kids, took a job as a video game tester. Fun job, lousy pay, but the pay was helping to slow down the burn rate on my savings, as that was the intention for while I was in school.

Finished school and went to work for my current company, first as a technical support specialist and then back into QA again.

So that accounts for my work life between age 12 and age 40

My list is way shorter than most.

1) lifeguard during summers in college
2) 1st job out of college. Been there 5 years. Plan to be there till I retire. Maybe in 10 years?

I disagree with the idea that kids need to work in HS and during college to learn responsibility. I think it’s much better to focus on your studies, assuming that you have other ways of paying for school.

When I was 15 i got an‘under the table’job at a hall serving dinner at weddings and bachlor parties. I hated this job as the men would lear at you and I usually spilt somehtign hot on myself (coffee, lasagna)

My next job was with Swiss Chalet at 16 as a hostess. I was good at this job and i enjoyed it but i butt heads with one server and when she got promoted i got fired.

the summer after that i worked at a local burger joint for about a month got paid terribly and left to enjoy the rest of my summer.

I then began working at a grocery store. I worked there for a year from the are of 17 until nearly 19. I began working for my mom in the summer when i was 16 two days a week to cover for the receptionist who had a three day work week. I continued to work there each summer and in the summer i turned 18 i was working at the grocery store, the airport with my mom and a golf course working 7 days a week often 14-16 hour days.

When I left the grocery store i kind of scrambled for a good job to do while attending university. I put in my resume everywhere and the first to respond was Harvey’s so i worked there for about a month when i got a call from Shoppers Drug Mart offering me a cashier position there.

So i did that for about a month and then got fired. I had left University for college and my mother offered me a full time position with her company and the airport so I did that for 6 months, at that point my mother left that company and I stayed on there for another month before joining her at a different company at the airport, this is where i am now.

So at 20, and in 5 years, I have had 9 different jobs.

And i am only now beginning to save money.

Worst job experiences:
Getting fired from the ice cream shop–my first non-babysitting job–for giving too much ice cream per scoop and mouthing off to the manager when he asked to me to weigh the scoop before putting it on the cone.

Worse/Funniest:
Answering the phone for a personal ad service. I learned a lot about the depths of human depravity which was miserable at the time, but makes for some hilarious stories now.

Best job:
My current situation as a librarian at a university.

My favorite job was the least paying–I drove a tractor around a golf course’s driving range collecting golf balls. It was fun work because I was outside, I could listen to a Walkman (remember those?), and I got to play golf for free. Being a target for people practicing their drives was an added bit of fun!

I can’t pin-point a job and say it was best or worst. There is good and bad in everything but I guess there are a few things that stand out.

I was a photographer at JC Penneys for about a half a year. It was fine until Christmas came and half the staff quit. We were so busy and most of the customers were just terrible no matter how hard we tried. I’m also not a big kid person and thought I would have problems dealing with them. I was suprised to find that the kids were the easier and the parents were the worst. On the flipside, I got very familiar with child development and found it fascinating how a week ot two could make a difference in how well a baby could sit up, smile and react to different things.

I spent a summer after college working for an aviation insurance company. They had just centralized their operations, switched to a new database AND raised their premiums across the board. Most of the customers were disgruntled because on top of paying more money, they lost the agent they had been working with, they didn’t have a local office and no one really knew what the hell they were doing. On the other hand I got to do some really cool things–I got a ride in a B-17 and an old Ford Tri-Motor, met a few aviation type celebs like Chuck Yeager and Paul Tibbets (pilot of the Enola Gay). I also got a ride with Gene Soucy in his open-cockpit bi-plane (basically a souped up Ag-Cat). Ride included a few barrel rolls which is way way cooler than any roller coaster I ever rode.

I worked as a revenue management analyst at a now defunct airline. Pay wasn’t very good, and the whole job was a HUGE bore but I could hop on a flight like I was hailing a cab. I flew me and my Mum first class out to San Francisico for my cousin’s wedding. I flew to Michigan to make a New Year’s Eve party some of my friends were throwing. I went to San Diego and Martha’s Vineyard for the heck of it. I saw a lot of America that year.

The job I now hold is the longest full-time job I’ve ever held–5 years. I’m a trade show manager. The job is stressful, but can be energizing too. I work with some great people and again I get to travel a lot which allows me to rack up a lot of miles for free travel.

Always restless, I’m thinking about going back to school at the ripe old age of 42. I’m leaning towards something in law.

My first jobs (grade school through high school) were a mish-mash of babysitting (hated it!), petsitting/housesitting (loved it!), and a series of summer jobs at the county fairgrounds–watering the new landscaping and doing the cashier/ticket taker job at the main gate during the fair. I also had a job cleaning up every other Sunday morning after the“Swinging Singles”Saturday night dance in the main hall at the fairgrounds. It paid well, but it was enough to steer me away from janitorial jobs for ever after.

After high school, I moved right in to an office assistant job with an HVAC company that the owners ran out of their basement. Boring job, but my real regret is not walking out the day the boss decided to give me a really nasty tongue-lashing over the way I answered the phone. (Which was the way his wife had told me to answer it!) After that, I had a series of temp jobs–receptionist, stock clerk, etc.–until I started at the local community college, going after my AA degree and an ATA in Horticulture. During that time, I spent two years in retail, pulling down $5.85 an hour and hating every minute of it. But, it paid for school.

Then I transferred out of state to complete my 1st B.A. (and paid a year of out-of-state tuition…BIG mistake!) THE PLAN was to move back home afterwards and complete my 2nd B.A.…but half-way through my last semester, I met my husband. Bye-bye plan! My last few jobs–phone survey taker (worst job ever!!!), collection agency clerk, receptionist, marketing assistant, and investment coordinator–have all been taken with an eye toward getting my husband through school and then paying off some of the debts we acquired for ourselves during those lean student years.

BUT…I finally start back to school tomorrow. Night classes, since I’m still holding down the investment job from 8 to 5. I’m getting back into Horticulture (since my previous classes are all 15 years out of date), and hopefully by the spring hiring season, my current classes and my older classes will be enough for me to get my foot in the door at one of the local greenhouses or garden centers.

I’m sure the people here at the financial planning firm I work for will all think I’ve lost my mind…leaving their elite company for a lowly blue-collar job. But I know that working with plants will make me a lot happier than what I do now.

Most of my jobs have been unmemorable, but one stands out as the best and most fulfilling business project I ever had. I scavenged and bought, then repaired, restored, and resold, vintage arcade video games. There was nothing quite like buying a gutted out Galaga, Tron, or Street Fighter 2 for$50-$100 and making it look and work like new again, then selling it to a doctor or lawyer for his rumpus room for $3k.

Most of my jobs have revolved around education, from teaching high school girls how to spin flags to tutoring ESL students to my current teaching life. I’ve daydreamed about a million and one jobs, but always seem to be stuck in school!

My first job was when I was 14. I was a camp aid for a month. I got to shovel horse crap and wash infirmary laundry covered in vomit, while living in a tent and using an outhouse, for the grand total of $320 before taxes.

Hmm…Reading for the blind, secretary, receptionist, graduate teaching assistant, newsletter editor, freelance writer, magazine editor (x 2), mother, wife&amp;society matron, university lecturer, senior editor. Not many: only 11.

The jobs that were hands-down the most fun were the two magazine editorial positions. Journalists drink a lot, laugh a lot, and party a lot. The best of them all is my current job, in which I earn a living wage for a fraction of the amount of work I did in any of the earlier incarnations.

Worst job was working as a secretary for a demented market research guy. What a creep! The final straw was an insulting note he left on my typewriter, which I found the following morning when I arrived (as usual) before he did. I dropped the keys in the middle of the floor, pulled the door shut behind me, and never looked back. Except for the complaint I filed with the labor department to get the pay the SOB owed me.

In ten years? Hope to be retired. And still living.

a book editor (great!)
