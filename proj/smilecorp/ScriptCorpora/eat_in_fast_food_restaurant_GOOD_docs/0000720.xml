How do i get a mazda rx7?
 i am 16 and am looking for a good car, yes im talking about sports cars. I know it sounds rediculous because im so young. Except i work at a fast food restaurant making roughly $700 a month, no bills at all. I have saved up $2,000 dollars, never expected to have so much lol. Also parrents have given me the luxery of providing $5,000 dollars for my expence. (not 100% sure but i need to get to work somehow) Since i was realy young i wanted a rx7, i dont know how much to pay? if i end up getting one what should i do to it, i hear about soo many recalls and problems? or should i pick a different sports car?

 Do your home work. Read the guide on buying an RX7 at the RX7 club. Take your time on buying one.
A few words of caution:
Most of the problems with the RX7 can be traced back to one of two areas:
1. Improper operation. You have to make sure that the operating instructions are followed, especially engine start up and shut down. This car is not one for driving to and from school in. Once it is started up it needs to be run for at least 20 minutes before it should be shut down.
2. Maintenance. There is a tendency on these cars (Miata&apos;s have the same problem) is for the owner to be the mechanic. While most drivers could do a lot more of the repairs, there are some areas that these home schooled mechanics just do not pay enough attention too.
3. Get one ticket, or have one wreck and it will take more the 700 dollars a month for insurance.
I might suggest that you find a beater (something cheap) and if you have room for a place to work on it the RX7. Keep the RX7 as a car to be used on special occasions and the el-cheapo for daily runs.

 Yeah seven grand wont get you a good rx7 and the rx7 itd pay for would prob be unreliable. Rotary engines suck in alota categories.. haha. There alot of other cool import cars out there though you could find. From eclipse to tiburon to civic si to celica gt.

 First of all the insurance will be expensice. Second rotary burns a lot of gas. Get a simplier car as a first car. BTW a good rx-7 fd would cost about 10k $ . Try mr-2 or something like 240sx.

 For your budget, you definitely need to look at the Gen1 RX-7, not the gen 3.
FB (81-85) or SA(79-80) models in decent shape are well within your price range, and are very simple to fix. Terrific cars. You should be able to find a decent running one between $1500 and $5000 depending on things like body and interior condition.
They come up for sale regularly on kijiji and in the classfied section of the rx7club website linked below.

One thing is if you live in a cold climate - most of this body style have carburetors and do not start easily in the cold without the block heater plugged in. Also, it&apos;s a light vehicle that is rear wheel drive, if you get any snow or ice in your area, spend th e money on good winter tires, preferably studded.
