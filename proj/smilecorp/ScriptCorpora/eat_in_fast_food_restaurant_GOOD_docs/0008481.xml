I have loved this place eve since I was a kid.  Where else do you get to eat, drink and watch knights joist?  They really try to cater to the whole experience.  First you can easily get discount tickets online so do a quick Google search before you buy.  Second get the group photo with costumes despite the cost.  Also plan on coming early so you can tour the grounds and see all the really cool stuff (like the dungeon of terror).

The food is actually good and there is enough to get the job done if you eat everything (or steal off your lady&apos;s plate hehe).  The show is top notch.  A quick warning it can be scary for a young child.  If you have an event and tell them about it early they will read it off as an announcement.

I would definitely go back anytime.

I guess you can say after becoming obsessed with Game of Thrones, I had to make sure I live it as if I were a real Lady -- having dinner served to me by wenches, being called &quot;my Lady,&quot; and greeted by bows from knights and squires.

I remember attending the dinner and tournament as a young lady, but did not have much recollection of it... I just remember watching knights on their horses, riding back and forth.  Now that I am much older, I can fully appreciate the beauty of winning a game of jousting to honor their respective land.

The food was definitely more delicious than what I remembered... I read somewhere on Yelp that they changed the menu and made it better.

The wench brought out some Dragon soup (aka tomato soup), which was warm, but not too hot that would burn your mouth... after all, you have to eat all these without utensils, including the soup!  It was a bit bland and not dense enough for me.  It was like drinking tomato soup.  The garlic bread, however, was very warm and tasted like it just came out from a baker&apos;s iron stove.  Next came the baby dragons, which tasted just like chicken.  They were very moist, and the skin had great seasoning (wished I brought my own condiments to make it better though).  The dragon ribs were my favorite, although I should warn you to not expect much... After all, you are paying more for the show, not the meal.

The show was alright.  The only thing I did not like was that it had no interesting plot, but I loved the performances that the knights and their squires delivered.  Most of the jousting and battling looked very real.  Weapons were clashed against each other, sparks were made, and some even broke.

There were some boring scenes, such as parts where horses just walked around the stage as if they were doing something clever.  The &quot;English&quot; accents from the Lord and the King was horrible.  I could not understand half of the things they were saying.  Luckily for them, the knights made up for their lack of duty.

Overall I would give this a 3.5.  I also got the tickets when they were on sale for about 45% off, while they were promoting their new show.  I would definitely not pay the full admission price for this though... It&apos;s fun, but I am pretty sure I can do more with $50 (per person!) than watch a bunch of men dressed as knights and wave their sticks around.  For $30, it is a steal! Feasting like kings in a crowded city in front of a king and the princess, while watching knights and their squires battle to the death.

The knights were very handsome and the atmosphere is fun!

The food was not the greatest.  The tomato stew was a drop of tomato sauce with hot water.  The chicken was dry and rib a little salty.  The bread was good, but the apple dessert was the best thing I ate the whole evening.  It was moist, warm, and YUMMY!

So, you&apos;re not going for the food, but rather the entertainment.  Definitely check online for deals and discounts before purchasing tickets.  I got mine for 15% off, $44 a ticket.  A couple days later, they sent me an email for $35.00 for each adult ticket.  I was like what-the- I could have saved myself $18!

One thing I did not like was that the outer room smelled like horse poo.  I was nervous that the arena would smell like that and was thankful that it did not!  I

I went there once ten years ago and have to say that the show is definitely better than I remembered. The knights and horses are so talented!  Definitely a place to take the kids.

Family fun but our knight always dies. &quot;Our knight sucks!&quot; I shout in dismay as I rip off my paper crown.  Of course I was joking, but it caught my daughter&apos;s funny bone.  We still laugh about it.  She also caught a carnation tossed by the red and yellow knight.  Observing your own girl-child swoon is strange.

Ok, this place is silly and fun.  Everything is fake, so expect it.  It&apos;s fun if you can play make believe.  If you have younger ones along for the evening, it becomes that much more fun.

You don&apos;t really get to choose your dinner.  No, the king has chosen.  Bill of fare, tomato bisque, half roasted chicken, spare rib, herb potato wedges, apple pastry, Pepsi.  Yes, the king has chosen.  It&apos;s descent and messy.  Enjoy!

PSA:  Whatever you do...don&apos;t leave trying to talk all medieval n stuff.  It&apos;s weird right after you leave the parking lot.

Maybe if you&apos;re under the age of 12, Medieval Times may be enjoyable.  The bf and I were bored out of our minds.  The storyline was hard to understand and the show was way too long.  Our knight didn&apos;t make it to the end so whatever little interest I had left dwindled when he got eliminated.

Let&apos;s not forget that the food sucked as did our server.  The tomato soup, garlic bread and chicken were average and the ribs and potatoes were terrible.  The apple turnover was the most decent thing on the whole menu.

The only positive thing I can say about the experience is that it only cost us $38pp with our Travelzoo vouchers.

I was all excited about eating chicken legs with my bare hands while watching pretend knights pretend joust.

But then I got there and my excitement turned to sadness (17 dollars for a soda?), disgust (the spout of our tomato soup jug had hair and dust on it), and nausea (my cup and plate were speckled with dried bits of old food).

Boo.

Well, in response to my complaints about customer service, I received a message from the owner that they would like to correct that issue.  I was asked to contact them for FREE PASSES.  I thought long and hard about this.  The prospect of dealing with them again made my skin crawl, but I was impressed that I got such a quick response, and they wanted to do better.

I contacted the manager as directed by the owner, twice even.  It&apos;s been over 2 weeks and nothing.  I even responded to the owner and advised her of the lack of communication from the manager here.  Tommorow, it will be a week, and nothing.

Thanks for confirming once and for all that your company is not worth my time or effort.  Not even worth recommending to anyone.

I think 2 chances to correct customer service issues is fair, and well.  FAIL, FAIL, FAIL!!!

Went here for my Birthday with my bf and another couple. We had the time of our lives!!! I used to come here a lot when I was little. So I knew we all had to come when I found out that all 3 of them have never been! So happy we went.

My bestie bought me the Royal Birthday package. I was drunk so it was a lot of fun. I find that I had way more fun being over 21 than when I was younger. They knighted me during their cocktail hour. Simple, short,&amp;sweet,&amp;received a cute Birthday Queen crown and a shout out during the competition.

The food is always fun. No utensils. Just use of your hands. Definitely gets you in the &quot;Medieval Times&quot; vibe. Food is huge portions! It&apos;s basically an entire chicken on your plate and the apple turnovers are amazing!!

Always a great show, and luckily we had a great crowd. So we got a bit rowdy. ;)

Everyone was very friendly. If you go expect for a lot of BIG drinks&amp;fun. (Boyfriends had over 120 oz of beer each and us girls had about 6 vodka tonics each) We loved it so much we are planning on going again this Dec! =) This is definitely a night to write in the books.

Lol, i havent been here for over 10 years, and well had a coupon so decided to go~

it was entertaining... the host was funny and the show was pretty good too, but you gotta not expect like a broadway show or anything, because it isnt, but if you dont mind dishing out the funds and just have a good time, then its a blast.

before the show you can go see old torture devices which is $2.person, but i think it was worth it.
There&apos;s some pretty messed up things in there, including a chastity belt, which is wayyyyy more messed up than what i saw in a movie... it might have been the highlight of the day...

The food was ok.  The chicken and rib was pretty greasy and the bread and soup was... good enough...  and the soda just sits in pitchers before the show so it was really flat.

Overall it was a good time.  I probably wouldnt go back for a long while though... even with my half off coupon, it still ran about $70 not including alcohol which was another $25 for 2 drinks.

so if youre ballin&apos; and wanna do something different, then Medieval Times Rocks!!!

I was on the fence between a 3 star and 4 star review here but I ultimately had so much fun, I couldn&apos;t go with anything less than 4. I will be blunt though...Medieval Times is nachos with extra cheese. From the paper crowns you wear to the fake jousting where the actors throw themselves off the horses about 5 minutes after they actually get hit, but it&apos;s all so entertaining you can&apos;t help but cheer along. My friend and I even gave our knight a fake name just so we could yell for him when it was his turn (he came in second by the way. A silver medal if I&apos;ve ever seen one). The guy that was the host was incredibly entertaining too.

I&apos;d always heard the food was mediocre but other than the soup (which was pretty bland), it was actually quite good and you get A LOT of it. Think Medieval Claim Jumper.
We went to an earlier show too so parking was plentiful but it looks like if you went to a later show on a weekend, it wouldn&apos;t be quite as easy. We got there pretty early too but there&apos;s a full bar and nice courtyard area to sit in while you wait.

I think this is something everyone should go to at least once in their lives. I was lucky enough to have free tickets. I&apos;m not sure if my review would be the same if I&apos;d shelled out the $50 - $60 for the whole thing. But definitely a fun and different excursion for a weekend with a meal that might actually leave you with leftovers. Oh and you might have to pay $10 for a margarita but they are yummy and you get to keep the glass (as long as you aren&apos;t absentminded like me and forget it there).

Are you ready to get Medieval?

After all the years of living close to this place, I finally got to go inside. Like other reviewers mentioned, you probably only have to experience this once. I still go to school full-time so we were able to take advantage of their Spring Break deal and that&apos;s $20 off regular admission. And that&apos;s probably one of the reasons we went because we really weren&apos;t willing to pay full price for this. I&apos;m sure glad we didn&apos;t. It&apos;s good but not $50 good.

Compared to their neighbor, Pirate&apos;s Adventure, the drinks are cheaper here. Not necessarily stiffer though. The food was good. I liked everything they serve or maybe I was just really hungry. Either way, I left pretty full and satisfied.

Go with a big crowd of friends that love to get loud and stupid and you will have a blast! Go cheer/heckle the knights,wenches, squires, princess catalina and take cheesy ironic pictures and you will have some great memories! Go grab a frosty brew and duel your friends in the lobby with light-up fake plastic swords!

Just don&apos;t go to the show to take it or yourself seriously for the duration of the night. The show and the atmosphere they provide gives you the opportunity to let loose so just take it!
There were some groups that literally sat quietly through the whole evening looking totally dull and proper- why would you come to Medieval Times and do that?

I like that even though this place has been around for so long that it still offers something for everyone. Last night, it was almost all sold out!  I saw families with little kids loving the whole medieval fantasy part of the show, teens on dates or graduation parties, young adults pounding shots at the bar, and also seniors strolling around nursing a beer. All having a good time.

I will say that some of the negative comments do connect though. Yes, the food is not 5 star dining and there are no vegetables  (but on the other hand, you are expected to eat with your hands and it is a TON of food). Also, the &apos;horse master&apos; portion  where you watch the guy prance around on a horse for 10 minutes sucks the life out of the whole stadium. But I don&apos;t think that  it detracts that much from the whole experience.

Bottom line: This is something you have to try atleast once with your friends- especially your obnoxiously loud friends. Get a deal and make it even more worth it.

Free entry for Moms on Mother&apos;s day weekend!

---

Hubby has always wanted to see this and after a recent visit to Pirate&apos;s Adventure, we decided to try Medieval Times too. It helped that they were doing a Spring Break promo during March and April and it was only $30 for &quot;students&quot;. You need a student ID to qualify per their website but they didn&apos;t really check.

Eh. It&apos;s me not you, Medieval Times.
I don&apos;t like going to the zoo, aquariums, or anywhere where animals are not in their natural habitats. I also don&apos;t like PETA but I digress. I should have known that I would not enjoy being here because of the horses. I wish they didn&apos;t show them off in those glass cases. It looked really uncomfortable and took away from my enjoyment of the show.

The food was surprisingly okay -- if you don&apos;t come with high expectations. After reading all the Yelp reviews, I came in not expecting much from their food. I decided to get the vegetarian option. Who said you can&apos;t eat with utensils here? The veggie option comes with a plastic knife and fork LOL!

Tomato bisque soup -- either I was just hungry or it was really good. I liked it and I don&apos;t usually like tomato.

Focaccia bread -- too soft, not sure if that was a good or bad thing. It was just okay.

Hummus and pita -- good, pretty standard

Skewer of veggies -- I liked it

Stuffed pepper -- definitely the highlight of my meal. I wasn&apos;t sure how to go about eating it. Thankfully, I had a fork! I was just gonna pick it up but it was going to be too messy with the rice. It was a flavorful combination!

Herb-basted potato - pretty average

Pro-tip: If you&apos;re dining with a non-vegetarian, the server will offer them an extra rib.

Hubby really liked it so he&apos;ll be writing his 4-star review.

You used to get a frosty brew with the price for a ticket..not anymore.  Booo.

The show was still fun and the food is pretty good. As my daughter put it, &quot;I&apos;m glad we got the hot knight.&quot; He even threw her a carnation that she caught.  We had to wait in a mob of teenage girls to snap a picture with him after the joust, but he was patient and friendly.

It&apos;s a fun night.

Be prepared to lose your voice in screaming for your knight!

Well, that depends if you really get into it or not. Haha usually, everyone is screaming on the top of their lungs hoping that their knight would win.

Before the show, you can chill and walk around the place. Stuff to buy, drinks to drink (theres a bar)...some people paid for their celebrants name to be announced during the show, or to be knighted in one of the gathering rooms...honestly, its nothing..you pay money for them to say your name (and they even had trouble saying some of the names...) Or for the knighting one, you pay money for the king to knight you for probably just a good minute or 2. Unless its your kid&apos;s birthday, you really dont need any of that stuff.

I would say paying for the show is a little pricey, but hey, our economy is pretty bad right now. I LOVED the show and so did my mom! We went on mother&apos;s day weekend since moms were free with a purchase of 1 adult admission! (YAY FOR FREE STUFF! or if you think about it another way, YAY FOR HALF OFF TICKETS!)

Minus one star for the &quot;just ok&quot; food...nothing to be so crazy about. The ribs were the only part I liked since the chicken was dry. You only get 1 rib...and its small.

FYI tip/gratuity is NOT included, so they expect you to tip your waitress/waiter at the end of the show. With the expensive price, you would think it would be included already.

My silly girl-friends took me here for my birthday this year and we had a blast!!!  We know it&apos;s for little kids, but if you just let go of all your reservations and go with the flow, you&apos;ll have a lot of fun!  We were team yellow/red-striped and our knight was the BEST... he was so into it and always looked at us whenever he was up for a fight.  Some of the other knights didn&apos;t seem as &quot;committed&quot; to their role as our knight!  Our little squire was pretty darn cute too.

The fight scenes are exciting and intense even though they&apos;re so obviously fake and rehearsed.  We screamed at the top of our lungs and took a gazillion pictures.  The food wasn&apos;t bad either!!  Much better than I expected, and they give you tons of food.  We started off with focaccia bread.  Then came the tomato bisque (it was watery and not creamy like a true tomato bisque should be).  The entree is where it&apos;s at though... they gave us huge pieces of (surprisingly) tender rotisserie chicken (which they called a dragon leg), and some BBQed ribs.  YUM!!  You finish off with an apple pie that&apos;s similar to the McDonald&apos;s apple pie pockets.

All in all a great experience... my friends were so creative to take me here, and they knew I&apos;m just silly enough to love it!

My dad took me to the Medieval Times in Dallas back when I was 9 or 10 and I remember LOVING it. So, at 24, I decided to give it another go. I truly wish I hadn&apos;t.

PROS (what few there were)
-Museum of torture was interesting (albeit horrifying)
-Some of the cheesy acting was so terrible that it was actually amusing
-Apple pie pastry was decent

CONS
-Yucky meal
-Overpriced drinks ($15 for a slushie?)
-Truly upsetting animal cruelty exhibited. They allow you to look into the horse stalls (where the horses LIVE) while you are waiting for the show to begin, and I noticed immediately that the horses were tied to the walls in their stall with a 10 inch tether; that didn&apos;t even give them enough room to turn around or walk two steps! Horses looked beaten down and terribly sad. I&apos;ve been around animals much of my life and I have never seen animals looking this beaten up. Many had wounds and looked ill. Once the show started it got far worse. They were forced to do unnatural tricks and were moved along with shark spurs and whips. One horse&apos;s tongue was completely hanging out of his mouth the whole show...another kept running the wrong way and the rider got violent with him. I was so upset I was almost in tears the whole show.

Bottom line ---- kids seem to enjoy this show, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend ever bringing anyone (even your kid) unless they get their act together.

Bow your head, kiss my hand ... and only refer to me as &quot;My-Lady&quot;.
(well, that&apos;s what happened to me ... and I loved it)

Medieval Times Dinner&amp;Tournament was a great.

We arrived an hour early, as the seating is general admission and assigned on a first come first served basis. Seating assignments in hand, we perused the area designated to &quot;hang&quot; where we shopped, took pictures and grabbed drinks from the full bar.

The food? Good. Tomato soup, warm pita style bread, a pork rib, half of a roasted chicken, potato skins and a warm flaky crusted apple dessert. Soda, Iced tea and coffee to wet your whistle. Yes, the food is served without utensils in metal ol&apos; skooled tableware - ya know - just like at your house (wink).

There didn&apos;t appear to be a bad seat in the house. Arriving 20-30 minutes prior to the performance start time, would be sufficient. As opposed to their suggested 1 full hour, advanced arrival.

The performance was intriguing, the camaraderie was refreshing, the horse showmanship was captivating.

A lot of fun place to go and enjoy a dinner and a show.  I have been going for several years and it is a blast each and every time.

Our server this last time was absolutely hilarious.  He really got involved with our group so much that when he joined part of the processional for the show, we thought it was appropriate to cheer and chant his name over that of our knight.

Came here with a group of mid to late twenties professionals. We had a blast!

Plenty of free parking. Get there early if you have a big crowd. We spent quite a lot on all the fixin&apos;s (pictures, banner, sword, icees)

We drank a lot. I felt bad for the families with young children because we were pretty obnoxious.

The food was okay, not great but not bad. I guess what you expect. The entertainment was not that great, but the fighting was really really impressive. the &quot;show&quot; didn&apos;t really start till desert when the knights started fighting. I think I like the vegas show at excalibur better because it has a better plot and cooler fx. the food there is better too. the show was about 1.5 hours.

We had the hottest server ever. 10/10. cute, slim, glasses, total librarian looking chick. she was really nice and smiled whenever she did something.

i felt really bad for one of the horses. they made a white horse do these stupid tricks, and it looked like the horse was retarded or dying. I hope they get rid of this part because it&apos;s hella boring. they need human acrobats or something.

icees were too sweet so we threw them away. we drank afterwards too. The horses in the stables got really excited when they saw us, so be prepared to see some huge horse units. Our girls were giggling the whole time and taking pictures.

Never again! I grew up in Buena Park and I never had the chance to come here. I finally went here when I got older and was so excited. My brother paid and I felt sorry for him since entry alone was expensive. The drinks were SUPER EXPENSIVE and weak. The food was horrible and they didn&apos;t have any utensils. The show was pretty unentertaining, but I could see how it would have been fun if the drinks were strong enough to get you tipsy and you sat front row. The smell of the place is gross and the staff seemed miserable. Not sure how this stays open so many years given that it was barely half full when we went.

Took my wife and mom here for mother&apos;s day along with my dad and kids.  I LOVE medieval times.  I go once a year, AT LEAST!

However, the 1pm show was a let down.  The new show was good but if you remember back about 10 years ago, the show was highly similar.  It seems they took the &quot;old show&quot; (ten years ago) and the &quot;new show&quot; (the one for the last 3 years or so) and made a NEWER show with a few changes.  No lie, I do miss the wizard.

Sadly, I said RIGHT when the show started, &quot;Our knight is first dead, (Black and white) and the Green knight is the winner.&quot;  How did I know this?????  5 of the 6 knights were young.  I am talking late teens early twenties young.  The green knight was older.  He was obviously the most senior knight for the night.

The show just continued to show that it was an &quot;experience show&quot;.  Being in entertainment industry myself, this is the show that new crew members and new cast members use to get experience.  They have to have their first show sometime, better to have a half empty arena then a full one right?  There were a few times that their rookie strips showed.  That is my purpose for the missing star.  I was a little upset that mother&apos;s day was used as a training day (and if it wasn&apos;t, I need to remove another star!) also, we were ushered into the green screen room when we first got there and asked for our photo ticket.  Photo ticket?????  We did not have one and then was ushered out into the courtyard.  We then see everyone else getting their tradition picture.  I guess we didn&apos;t want to remember mother&apos;s day with a picture. :(

Great show and animals are not abused.  The horses are the life line for medieval times, they are treated better than the guests!

PS, the new menu had its hits and misses.  New bread is good, potatoes are neutral compared to past.  I prefer the old ribs.  I am not a beef rib type guy, I like the older, more tender ribs.  Chicken a little dry but it happens.  Thank god there is no more free beer!  I hate drunks!

PS #2:  For the crew, there is always at least one or two, usually more, lights not functioning properly.  I understand with a rig of over 100 lights, it can be hard to catch but there are a few times somewhere should be lit but isn&apos;t due to automates not functioning.  Furthest north electric, CSL moving head did not function.  There were a few others but that one was most noticeable!

Go Yellow! Haha. I was extremely satisfied with the entertainment here! Make sure for one you get here ahead of time to avoid waiting too long in line and buy your tickets online instead of buying at the door.

Here&apos;s how it all went down...

We drove about 40 miles to this place because of the great deal we got off the website. Arrived about an hour and a half prior, got our crowns and sat in the bar area until it started. The alcohol costs varied depending on which sized cup you wanted. Don&apos;t forget that your meal comes with two regular beverages. Our cup/alcoholic drink was $16.00 and while in the show as long as you have your yellow paper bracelet you are good to go. The show was great with everyone cheering and the actor knights did a great job. The meal was pretty good. You get half a chicken, a rib and some potato wedges, tomato bisque soup and an apple breaded pastry for desert.

If I could I would give it 5+ stars lol! Lots of fun for big groups and couples.

What better way to celebrate thirty one glorious years on earth than a throwback Middle Ages competition and dinner fare? AWESOOOOME!

OC Restaurant Week&apos;s promotion extended through my birthday, so I decided to invite a grip of my closest companions to come relive 25 years ago (which was the last time I&apos;d been to MT). Except this time there was much, MUCH more alcohol involved. Wow! Drinks were decently priced but the hard stuff was pretty strong!

Red knight = not only hot, but also knighted me at the end (which meant way more to me than having the king do it, lol). Get your mind outta the gutter, Yelpers. My drunken stupor prevented me from taking part in this ceremony beforehand, so the MT staff kindly ran around afterward to help me take care of it. SUPERB service!!!

The food actually isn&apos;t bad. Don&apos;t leave the chicken breast for last, just sayin&apos;. The rib is DELICIOUSLY PREPARED. Be forewarned: you will be full!

-1 star because, frankly, there is so much unintelligible talking going on (but then again, you ARE eating at this time, so it makes sense) that it borders on boring. But once the competition gets going! Yeahhhhh Red! (He lost, but he made it far so it&apos;s okay. AND HE KNIGHTED ME!!!)

I wouldn&apos;t pay full price for this business. But I would come back again on a discounted price. Happy birthday to meeee!

Thank you thank you THANK YOU Alex P., the Bestie, Natalie M., my bro, Donny, Missy, Gale, Sasha, Proverbial Boy, my favorite Joe and Mrs. MFJ Haylee for making the trek out! An extra special thank you to Chewy and Erica for REALLY making the trek out! I love you all so much.

What&apos;s not to like about dining with the aroma of horse and stable around you?

More for the ambiance and experience, my kids LOVE to come here.  they enjoy eating with their hands and being transported back to the gallant knight days.  A bit pricey, but sometimes they have deals.  We always come out having a great time and the food isn&apos;t that bad.  Half a roasted chicken, tomato soup, potato wedge, garlic focaccia, bbq rib, and a apple pastry for dessert.

Have a couple of cocktails to set you in the mood and you&apos;ll be fine. LOL.

Definitely worth all the hype. It&apos;s where an adult can feel like a kid again. Scored some tickets from the military base so the package we got was pretty good for the price we paid for. Got 2nd row seating so the view was great. Me and my party had a lot of fun considering we all lost our voices from cheering at our knight.

The Show:
At first I thought he would lose the tourney as he was the smallest of the knights, boy I was wrong. Little knight won the whole tourney and defeated the enemy faction. The winner of the tournament is based on the most supportive crowd for the knight. At times I wanted to run to the bathroom , but everything was so action packed you had to stay and watch. When not fighting, the dialogue and the show the horses put on is fantastic. Make sure you use the bathroom before the show because you don&apos;t want to miss a thing!

The Food:
Eating w/out silverware? AWESOME! The food was great and plentiful. I wish I hadn&apos;t eaten before hand. My only grudge is that you have to use your bill of sale as a napkin and that&apos;s all you get. They do however, give you some wet naps after dinner.

Shops:

There&apos;s a bunch of awesome things to get but a bit pricey. A lot of things add up depending on what package you get. Photos, alcohol and memorabilia adds up like whoa!

Overall I would go again and take my friends who haven&apos;t gone. It&apos;s one of those places where you always wanted to go until now. So definitely check it out now!

Spectacular time again, the act is different from when I was a kid but still fun. DUDE, the sword fighting is so hardcore....they really hit hard! Thats some really good choreography! This is a cheap dinner and show!

So here&apos;s the 411:
Most worth coming time is VDAY! Why? Because you get two free glasses, champagne, dessert and all this stuff you&apos;d usually have to pay upgrade for or can&apos;t even get.

Upgrade to Royalty for guarantee 1st or 2nd row seating, can&apos;t substitute any items.
- CD it comes with on your table is interesting.
- Get 2nd row (never 1st row)
- And get the yellow/red or white/black team....basically middle of arena!
- Come 90minutes ahead of time, YES!!! DO it, so you can get better seating!!

Food:
Actually pretty delish! LOTS TOO! And you can take it to-go!
Tomato soup comes out, then bread to dip it
Half Chicken is soft
A piece of ribs and two potato wedges
Apple Turnover (if you got the vday package or upgraded to celebration upgrade, but dessert isn&apos;t worth it)

So the package also includes torture museum which would cost $2 per person. Its really pretty creepy and not big, so probably not a romantic tour in this room. But if you have kids, I&apos;m not even sure if you want them to imagine after learning about these torture items :/ So skip the museum and save the $2, if you had to pay for it.

Whats worth it????
The $23 Margarita Goblet!!! Its a hugeeeeeeeeee margarita cup you get to keep! Sooooooo worth it!!!!

What do you do there????
Become a drunk wench and knight, and shout as loud as you can for your knight to win! The show is pretty good actually, at least the action is very impressive. Really good choreography.

Coming for bday?
If you buy a ticket full price, your bday person gets in free. Should you get the knighting for $25? Don&apos;t bother, its not worth it. I thought they knight you in front of everyone but they don&apos;t.

What to wear? Attire?
Ummm yeah depends how messy you or your neighbors are. I would recommend no whites.

Parking: Free. If you get first showing you wont&apos; have a problem with it. If you get 2nd showing, then yes you will have problems. Come early!

Price?
You can always go to goldstar or online sites for deals! Lots of deals out there, only thing is you can&apos;t use other promotions with it sometimes but its worth asking. For a huge meal you&apos;ll probably have enough leftovers to pack home, champagne, 2 free glasses, flags and such..... totally worth it! DINNER AND A SHOW!!!

Codes I was given via my ticket and hat:
105CROWN ($10 Off Adult Admission, $5 off Child Admission)
FREETKT (Free Royalty Upgrade)
And more codes: http://dealspl.us/coupon… 

P.S. We got lucky, not sitting by any kidsssss!!! whoo-hoo!!!

Quoting my friend Steve:

&quot;Weddings, baseball games,&amp;Medieval Times are only good with alot of alcohol.&quot;

Don&apos;t get me wrong!  The last time I went was wildly entertaining.  Wildly entertaining cause the inebriated actions of my friends!  But, the food was &quot;eh!&quot;  The show was good.  The service was good.  But, the cost is definitely not worth it in my book.

You know one thing in common with weddings, baseball games,&amp;Medieval Times... they all cost alot of money!  But, give me a baseball game any day!  I&apos;d rather play ball than sword fight (please don&apos;t Freud that last comment).

You really cant ask for more with the price you pay. Even if you get no discount and still pay full price, your getting a worthy experience.

Only reason I&apos;m giving them 4 and not 5 stars is because my favorite part of the mean was the tasty garlic bread they use to have. Now they serve some pita style bread...kinda blend and not tasty at all! They need to go back to the old garlic bread!

Show up early to get parking in the back, and not accross the street. It also gets your better seats, but there really isnt any bad seats in the arena.

Lastly, be sure to bring cash to tip your wench!

I beseech thee: Dost get plastered like an olde king of yore.

Party with the other Rennie&apos;s and bring the debauchery to the kings table! There&apos;s something about coming together (having drunk copious amounts of alcohol), eating with your hands and cheering-sometimes for no apparent reason, only because it&apos;s kinda normal to do that kind of thing-for your respective knight.

The atmosphere makes for a good time so bring a large group and get all Renaissance-fanatic on everyone.

Note: Some of the drinks coming with a commemorative glass that you can take home. Try to avoid them unless you like leaving with an 8 piece set for your home.

Horses running in circles kicking up their own manure mixes with low lighting and my dinner of thin tomato basil gruel, bland flat bread (now thats funny), moist but bland roast chicken, a single bony rib, over-salted cold potato wedges, tepid ice tea and a scalding apple pastry (I bet the McDonald&apos;s down the street is outta apple pies)...anyhooooo...it&apos;s not about the food, it&apos;s the delight in my child&apos;s eyes

Thank goodness this overpriced horse litter box is 1000&apos;s of miles from home

I know the show revamped and has more action.

There were parts of the show where the horses looked really sad, their saliva was dripping from their mouths and did not look healthy.  They looked tired and over worked

It made me just want to leave the show.

The food was decent.

Service was great.

The chicken was dry.

Ribs was okay.

The bread was good.

The soup was good.

The dessert was like the apple pie from McD&apos;s.

Overall, it was a good show.  I don&apos;t think I would ever go back tho

Just had a truly fantastic experience here! Things have only gotten better since the last time I was here (seven years ago). The show seems to have a more developed plot, better fight choreography and a more elaborate show all together.

Two outstanding employees: Genevive, our wench who we tipped nicely since she did an incredible job. She was attentive to everyone in my party and did her job with a smile! And Grace who was working one of the gift shop booths. She made small talk with us while we decided what to buy (ended up not getting anything), and again, was generous with her smile. People truly underestimate how much one&apos;s attitude relates to good service. Both of these women were great at making sure we had an awesome experience.

Details:
-We sat in the yellow section and with the Royalty Package upgrade (additional $10 per person) ended up at Table 2, which is the front!
-I checked http://retailmenot.com to see if there were any discounts available and there were!
-Ask where the bathrooms are ahead of time so that you don&apos;t have to miss much of the show if you have to go.

It&apos;s been about 20 years since I&apos;ve been here to the Medieval Times Dinner&amp;Tournament show.  There is still the same excitement and energy that makes for a very fun evening!   $50 an adult - totally worth the price!

The night started off with doing a first check in at the front, where they take your name and tickets.  The service people tell you to take your place in line at ANOTHER check in area (why twice?) where they give you color tickets of where you should sit.  (NOTE:  Go early so you can reserve seats towards the front of the action!).   You walk past the second check in and they give you matching crowns (one of six colors) and have you take photos with the Medieval characters (each color section had their own character, so they knew where to find you later to sell you photos - $20 for the first photo, $10 for the second).

The dinner show is about 2 hours long and it is filled packed with entertainment and a great time!  The three main actors (Lord Knight, King, and Princess) play a cheesy role, which totally entertains the crowds!   My favorite was the Lord Knight, because he totally knew how to engage the audience and make everyone laugh spontaneously.  We were seated in the Red Knight section and he came in 2nd place in the battle of the knights!  Super exciting.

Dinner consisted of a tomato bisque soup, fresh flat bread, a 1/2 roasted chicken, 2 wedges of potato fries, one beef rib, two cups of your beverage choice, and a sweet dessert at the end.   The food was good picnic food, and the fun thing is that you get to eat with your hands.  REMEMBER TO BRING SANITIZER as they don&apos;t provide it for you.  Our waitress was very very hard working and patient with all the requests that the guests made of her!  (Sorry, I don&apos;t remember your name, 2/12/12 Red Section Row 5).

Throughout the entire 2 hour experience, you are provided with action packed entertainment.  There are 8 knights and each of them has their cheering section of the auditorium.  Each of the knights totally work hard at providing real-life (well, almost) action fighting with 5+ different types of weapons.  These guys not only ride horses very well, but they also do full swings on their opponents while fighting.  Yes, the fighting is very rehearsed, but the blows that they serve each other are at full force and the sparks from the metal swords / sheilds / chains fly everywhere.  These guys work hard for their money, so I hope they are paid well to do what they do!  Exciting!  What a great time!

Don&apos;t forget to visit the huge gift shop before or after the show.  Buying a 1&apos; flag to cheer your knight on (color coordinated, of course) is a MUST at $5 each!  You can also get knight costumes, princess gears, mugs, pewter figurines, and even real life metal sword$).  Fun to shop here!

My only negative about this experience was the parking.  The afternoon show is at 3:00 and ends after 5:00.  This means that if you get there ahead of time to get a good seat, there is NO parking in the lot.  Once the show gets out, there is a RUSH to get out of the lot and the next shift of cars rush in to get a parking stall.  Dangerous for kids and older people - so be careful!

Food Grade:  B.
Entertainment Grade:  A-.
Service Grade:  A-
Parking situation Grade:  C
Overall impression Grade:  B+

I have only been to Medieval times twice in my life.  Once in 1999, and once in 2012.  Nothing has really changed between my experience in 1999 and 2012. :/  Except maybe the actors and the horses.

I was able to purchase discounted tickets to Medieval Times and came here with a group of five other friends.  We arrived an hour early and after getting our table assignments we hung out around the shopping area until they were ready to seat us.  The only benefit of this is that you supposedly get better seats, and you get to hang out and drink.

I bought a strawberry slushy alcoholic drink from the bar.  Alas, it was mostly slush, with one shot of vodka.

After being seated, we were served the usual: Half a chicken, one rib, tomato soup, garlic bread, two potato wedges, apple pie, coffee, and another liquid (soda, iced tea, or water).

The food here was actually pretty good considering they were making it in large quantities.  Imagine how many chickens have to die each night for Medieval Times! LOL.

The rotisserie chicken was moist and well marinated.  Their ribs were decent, soft, and not overly sauced.  Their potato wedges were dry like rocks. I did not eat those, but instead handed it over to Mark K.

The apple pie they gave us after our meal was yummy! IT kind of reminded me of the apple pies you buy from McDonalds but not as much apple in it.

The show was alright, and our knight won!  The only thing I didn&apos;t like about the show were the animals. Somehow I felt sorry for the horses. . . but they probably take very good care of the animals here.  The horses were clean, fat, with nice silky hair. :D

I&apos;d come back here, but maybe in another ten years.

Let&apos;s just say, it&apos;s probably much better if you&apos;re a kid. I&apos;m 52 and I took my son for his 19th birthday. The food was actually okay. Came here on a Thursday night and it was filled. I&apos;m sure this had a lot to do with my experience.

You are starving by the time they&apos;re ready to serve you! The soup was very salty. The garlic flat bread was warm, toasty and delicious!! Roasted half chicken was very moist. The spare rib was so tender it fell off the bone. The potatoes were a nit dry. The dessert was fair. The flaky dough was much much better than the filling. The filling was over spiced, a bit too sweet and didn&apos;t have enough apple chunks.

I felt bad for the horses the whole time; almost to the point of abuse. Wonder if anyone else has complained?

Dear Jennifer Briggs,

Thank you so much for inviting George and I back to Medieval Times for your VIP event!   I was very happy to receive your invite on Yelp!  We had so much fun with all the great complimentary  appetizers and drinks served before the show that I had to box up the actual dinner portion and bring it back home!

This was one fabulous event that will last a  lifetime especially with the free photo keepsake album that was given to us!  We both looked very happy taking a picture with the King!    Also, thank you for those lovely tote bags.  I&apos;m a huge collector of tote bags and being a teacher it comes in very handy!   The calendar, pen and bottle opener key chains were such a cute idea to include in the tote bags!  Those were awesome!

We were pleasantly surprised at how much food was being served constantly for a whole hour inside the VIP event area.  Our favorite was the bacon wrapped scallops, mini quiche and the cajun garlic shrimps.   They were so additive and good that we just couldn&apos;t stop asking for more!    George really enjoyed the Mango slush and I wanted to go back for seconds on the Pina Colada.  However, I really wanted to stay sober and enjoy the show and dinner=)    We weren&apos;t expecting the drinks to be free!

George bought a dragon figurine because according to the Chinese calendar, he&apos;s the year of the Dragon!   Thanks to those complimentary two extra tickets, we&apos;ll be coming back again this year to buy a Horse figurine (I&apos;m the year of the Horse) and to enjoy another great dinner and show!    Everything at the gift shop was very affordable and we were happy to pay under $20 for our little souvenir!   Some of the hair accessories make great gifts and are very decently priced!

Forgot our servers name but we sat at Table 6 (Red) and she was absolutely wonderful!  Then again, all your staff was friendly and made our visit very enjoyable.   We loved our seats and the view was perfect for taking pictures and video of the show.   My favorite was the tomato soup and the roasted chicken this time.  George had no complaints about the food and was able to finish everything.  He especially enjoyed the chicken as well!   My garlic bread, bbq ribs and potato wedges and  the apple turnover were brought back home.  My mom sampled every thing and she gives it two thumbs up!   She really enjoyed our last visit to Medieval times and wants to go back again this year!

Our red knight was awesome and so were all those lovely horses!   This time around, we noticed that the bad guy wasn&apos;t fighting the knights.  Instead, the knights were battling each other.  Despite our knight not winning the tournament, we still had lots of fun cheering him on!   Go Red team!!!!

Great event turn out and we can&apos;t wait to go back again this year!
