Michelle Obama Touts Healthier Chain-Restaurant Menus
   Email 36 Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print 
First lady Michelle Obama today praised a move by Darden Restaurants, the operator of Red Lobster, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Bahama Breeze to cut calories and sodium in its meals and offer healthier options for children, calling it a“breakthrough moment”for the restaurant industry.

“Darden is doing what no restaurant company has done before,”Obama said at an event at a Maryland Olive Garden.“They’re not just making their kids’menus healthier so that parents have more choices and more control; they’re making changes across their full menu at every single one of their restaurants throughout the country. They’re looking at all the food they serve, and they’re asking themselves one simple question: How can we improve the health of American families?”

Working with the Partnership for a Healthier America, the nonprofit that oversees the first lady’s“Let’s Move!”initiative, Darden has committed to reducing calories and sodium in its meals by 10 percent in the next five years and by 20 percent in the next 10.

In addition, fruits and vegetables will become the default side option on kids’menus, replacing the ever-present French fries. Sugary sodas will also be absent from the menus going forward. Instead, 1 percent milk will be the default beverage, with free refills, of course. Menus will also be revamped to promote the healthier choices.

Noting that Americans spend half of their food dollars at sit-down or fast-food restaurants, Obama said she can sympathize with busy families who want to eat right but just don’t have the time.

“I know the feeling because I’ve been there,”she said. ”I mean, it wasn’t that long ago that we lived in a regular house. We didn’t always live in the White House. And it wasn’t that long ago that Barack and I were struggling just like most families to try to keep it all together. Our girls always had busy schedules, like many of you. They did then; they do now. And there were plenty of times that things like cleaning and grocery shopping and cooking fell by the wayside.”

But too often, she said, kids’meals in particular are loaded with far too many calories.“Instead of targeting the most healthy food to our kids, we’re targeting the least healthy food to our kids. And parents need to feel confident that enjoying a meal at a restaurant doesn’t mean sacrificing their children’s health,”the first lady said. 

“So the bottom line is that Darden is making the healthy choice the easy choice. And they’re making it the delicious and fun choice, too,”she said.

Orlando-based Darden is the world’s largest full-service restaurant company and owns and operates more than 1,900 restaurants that generate more than $7.5 billion in annual sales.

The first lady also had some lunch at the Olive Garden today, sampling the apricot chicken and asparagus, which she said was“awesome,”but also“healthy.”

This is a great idea. With so many eating out frequently, restaurants improving their menus will affect many Americans’health positively. Losing the soda for milk is a winning idea for children.
I am glad that Mrs. Obama has championed healthier eating, I know it has made me more aware of what I buy in the grocery store for my family.

French fries are fine–now and then–especially if you’re lucky enough to find a place that makes them out of fresh potatoes. The problem arises when they’re the default side order on every plate of food served to kids, or adults.

thoughtfully yours,

Dear Lydia, While I’m pleased that Mrs. Obama managed to make you aware of the importance of healthy eating, you have to realize that the fact that you were ignorant doesn’t mean that everybody else is, nor do they necessarily appreciate the First Lady’s hectoring of them or private businesses.

Her own husband, poor fellow, seems obsessed with chowin’down on a burger with all the fixins’and knocking back a brewski every chance he gets. It’s easy to see why.

Never was Shaw’s aphorism more appropriate:“”Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their TASTES may be different”

Bon Appétit!

Through billions of dollars of research, I think businesses know their customers wants and needs better them Ms Obama. Having the government now stepping in and deciding on what privately owned food establishments must serve their customers is nothing less then communism. This is just a tip of the iceberg on why this economy is doing so badly.

And I would say just because you are ignorant of the very positive benefits of the First Lady’s campaign bringing major food chains on side to reduce calories and sodium in their servings across the nation, doesn’t mean eveybody else is. As you demonstrate, ignorance is special. :)

“Deciding on what establishments must serve their customers”? What? Did you even read the article. Give it a try, you might learn something. No wonder the right wing is so daft, they can’t even read.

I want to personally thank Mrs. Obama for saving me and my family from ourselves.

Healthy kids and adults mean nothing, if our whole way of life is destroyed, and that’s what’s really happening in America. This feel good BS means nothing when 50% of the people work to support the other 50%.

Are Big Macs Healthy? What about ice cream? Or Candy bars? Remember; The road to Hell is often paved with good intentions. Sorry, but going down the road where the government starts dictating what you can and can’t eat is dangerous.

I seldom eat a meal without a large side of fries. It is my choice and I really don’t appreciate having someone lean out the drive-thru window and forbid me from ordering them! I just wish the government would stay out of my business! I don’t smoke , I don’t drink, don’t do drugs, and don’t drive fast cars! I would like to keep my french fries without having to argue with somebody from Washington every time I go to eat!

John, I think that ship has sailed. The government tells you how you can and cannot reprimand your child; that you must wear a seatbelt when you drive a car; you must wear a helmet when you ride a motorcycle. The government is the mommy and daddy of all us everyday nobodies who don’t know our place in their world.

Huuummmmmm . . . . .
Perhaps the word“Health”shouldn’t be used in the same sentence as“Chain-Restaurant”.

Geez people lighten up. I mean really, I am no fan of Michelle Obama but what is she possibly doing wrong here? And what is wrong with healthier eating options. The government is not making you eat anything you don’t want to. Some of you did not even read the article before you start complaining about government intervening.
If you want to eat Big Mac’s everyday go ahead, it’s your body.

OMG (6:53 PM); Maybe it’s because people already know she loves her fries. It’s all about the First Lady championing some cause anyway. Some plant flowers, some oppose drugs. She’s into healthy eating (if you buy into it).
 
Posted by: newcountryman | September 15, 2011, 7:10 pm 7:10 pm
 
OMG, I think it’s just the audacity of the government sticking its nose into EVERYTHING. Personally, I wish their were healthier meal options at restaurants, smaller portions with a smaller price, etc. BUT, what a restaurant offers on its menu should not be coming down from the white house or your congressman. Next they’ll be telling the networks what they should and should not air at certain times. The government takes everything and turns it into politics. It likes to guide the societal norm and make all the worker bees conform. Some of us don’t want to conform, don’t want to given choices from a government. Damn! I already have a mommy and a daddy! I don’t need another one.

It isn’t.

This was a classic communications undertaking. The First Lady works with restaurateurs to see if there is a way to reduce calories and sodium in the food they serve. The restaurateurs felt there was an advantage to doing this and decided to make changes. No laws enforcing anything.

At the same time this is taking place, public awareness of healthy eating is improved as people see the change taking place.

Anybody got a cigarette? All this typing is tiring.

These restaurants made their own decisions, nobody forced them to do anything. They believe it’s to their advantage to offer healthier, lower calorie, lower sodium meals.

Those of you pretending otherwise are a joke.

I eat out too often but watch what I eat and it seems to me that most restaurants have been giving healthier options for several yars now. I don’t see what th fuss is one way or the other. I think the biggest problem is that we all sit on our rears too much and buy too much boxed foods at the grocery stores.

You all realize that Darden made the choice, yeah? There was no gov’t mandate. Michelle Obama is simply praising the choice and bringing awareness.

Oh, I see Tanya made that point. I agree Tanya!

First ladies aren’t allowed to comment? Or what?

Chuck, ask me what? I don’t understand why you’d reference me in your post @ 8:42 pm. You realize you’re claiming that restaurants making their own menu choices is fascism, yeah? While I do think corporations are capable of tyranny, and the founding fathers were leery of multinational corporations and monopolies, I don’t see any dictatorial control or monopolies here.

The LA Times noted,“While we applaud Darden’s decision to feature food lower in calories and sodium, we have to wonder why it’s going to take so long. Yes, corporations often make changes at a snail’s pace, but a five-year plan to reduce sodium and calories by 10% and a 10-year plan to take it down 20% seems like an inordinate amount of time. We recently worked with Los Angeles chefs to see if they could reduce the calories, fat and sodium in some of their dishes, and the task was accomplished in a matter of hours.”

Oh nooooooes! How fascist.

Cute how when he gets caught in yet another lie, he retreats to personal nonsense. Shows a certain weakness of character methinks. More troll than authentic.

By the way Kimberly i like the way you spin circles around Chuck and do it with such class and politeness. You always use facts and logic–props to you.

Kimberly makes perfect sense to me. Her words speak for themselves. And she always speaks with a lot of class and politeness, something sadly missing from many of the right wing juveniles.

I do (did) eat at the Red Lobster, Olive Garden, and the LongHorn Steakhouse. No more! If they are willing to cut the quantity/quality but stay the regular price just to please Michelle, these businesses can kiss my a$$.

Hey I have no problem with the First Lady commenting or pushing some agenda.
It doesn’t matter what she says, we just need to be vigilant so that the federal government doesn’t get involved.

Star and Darla, thanks!

Noz, For many Americans, being vigilant about government overstep and America’s ideals while supporting the continued prosperity of America doesn’t necessitate distorting the truth as it stands.

The truth as it stands is that a restaurant made a choice to serve healthier options and the First Lady praised that choice. That isn’t fascism. Nothing sinister occurred. I think Darden made a good choice, too.

“President Obama said he believes his chances of being reelected in 2012 are “much higher” than they were in 2008.”

Wow Kimberly, project much? I don’t see Noz suggesting anything sinister going on either.

I don’t have a problem with what Darden has done either and I don’t have a problem with Michele (the not too proud of her country) Obama congratulating them.

As long as the government isn’t requiring such things from private enterprises I could care less what the Obamas have to say. However, I will remain vigilant (as will Noz I assume) of those in power like the Obamas, because they are all to eager to set forth regulations in response to their“crisis of the moment”that usurp the freedoms of everyday Americans.

Reducing fat and calories is nice, but not a serious effort in healthy living. 1% milk? Yuk, not to mention it will still be conventional milk with rbGH and antibiotics, from cows fed on GMO corn and soy. Plus, there will likely still be tons of high fructose corn syrup…or fake sweeteners which are remarkably unhealthy….with many goods still loaded with preservatives, food dyes, msg and GMO ingredients. There is a lot more to simple eating than what is apparent to the eye…or taste buds. Do your research on where your food comes from…what does your food eat? What about large agribusiness growing practices? Our fresh produce today is less nutritious than it was a few decades ago…not to mention laden with herbicides and pesticides. Start demanding“real”food!

Kim–do you really have a problem with the seat belt laws?! It’s too bad that govt had to step in because some parents are worthless and REFUSE to be good parents. It is a sad day when people use their freedom as an excuse to be stupid and lazy and outright abusive to their own offspring. I mean, the audacity for the govt to step in and ensure kids are taken care of by their parents, right?!

Wow, this almost changes my life. I almost never eat out anyway, especially during this depression Obama’s created. I can’t afford to do it. I have been able to make a little money on the side or trade for BBQ. Sometimes it’s just someone bring two things to smoke and gives one to me, if I’ll BBQ them.
