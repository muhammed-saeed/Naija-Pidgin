What does the term&quot;going Dutch&quot;mean, when going out to eat?
 I have a small party to orchestrate to take out to dinner,&amp;I was told by the hostess that everyone is to&quot;pay for themselves, we&apos;ll go Dutch&quot;. So I need to know what I&apos;m working with. It&apos;s about 10 people.

Additional Details
 PS-You&apos;ve all answered my question-so I thank you all. To&quot;sherrysfu&quot;-I wouldn&apos;t dream of burdening the waiter/waitress with 10 seperate tabs, it&apos;s obnoxious. Even if we all pay for our own meals, or each other, or whatever, the monies get pooled. They won&apos;t be divided for the poor server. But I thank you for your concern on their behalf :-)

 Going dutch is a phrase where you pay for your own food and drinks

.Going Dutch is a slang term that means that each person eating at a restaurant or paying admission for entertainment pays for himself or herself, rather than one person paying for everyone. It is also called Dutch date or Dutch treat.

Etiquette

There is a delicate etiquette surrounding going Dutch. It may be accepted in some situations, such as between non-intimate friends or less affluent people, but considered stingy in other circumstances, such as on a romantic date or at a business lunch.

The traditional way to handle a bill on a romantic date in the West has been that the one who invited the other (traditionally, nearly always the man) takes the bill and the invitee may not even know the actual price of the meal. Some restaurants keep ladies&apos;menus without prices.

Etymology

The phrase&quot;going Dutch&quot;probably originates from Dutch etiquette. In the Netherlands, it is not unusual to pay separately when dating. The Dutch were already internationally known as scrooges, and English rivalry with The Netherlands especially during the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars gave rise to several phrases including Dutch that promote certain negative stereotypes. Examples include Dutch courage, Dutch uncle and Dutch wife. The particular stereotype associated with this usage is the idea of Dutch people as ungregarious and selfish.

In Spain,&quot;going Dutch&quot;is attributed to Catalans, due to a stereotype that they are greedy. A stereotypical non-Catalan Spaniard would compete to invite the group.

In Italy, the expression pagare alla romana can be translated as:&quot;To pay like people of Rome&quot;or&quot;to pay like they do in Rome&quot;. It has the same meaning as&quot;going Dutch&quot;.

Curiously, in South American countries exist the Spanish phrase pagar a la americana (literally&quot;To pay American style&quot;) which refers to a trait attributed to people from the U.S.A. or Canada.

The gambling term dutching may follow this same route as it describes a system that shares stakes across a number of bets. It is commonly believed, however, that the Dutch reference here was in fact derived from a gangster (Dutch Schultz) who used this strategy to profit from racing.

[edit] Feminist support for Dutch date practice

During the advent of second wave feminism, the late 1960s and 1970s, the women&apos;s movement encouraged women to understand aspects of their own personal lives as deeply politicized. Many feminists investigated the framework and assumptions of traditional courtship roles. They subscribed to the idea that there should be equality of the sexes, not just legally, but socially and sexually.

They thought that it was mature, empowering and self-respecting for women to pay their own way in romantic dates. They were rejecting traditional gender role assumptions that men should make more money and should pay for affections through dinners and the rest of costs of dates. In this way, women were making an equal investment in the cost of courtship.

It became more common for women to pay their own way, or to pay for men&apos;s meals. Some women were offended if their male dining partner&quot;grabbed the check.&quot;

Ironically the majority of women still see the value of this&apos;tradition&apos;for the man to pay for meals in relationships.

[edit] Effective end of Dutch practice

Since the 1990s, mores, particularly in the US, have reverted to past customs.

More women have abandoned 1970s feminism&apos;s ideals for equality of gender roles and relationships. More women have reverted to adopting traditional, that is, unequal views of the courting relationship, and assumptions about men&apos;s responsibility to spend money to express affection.

Thus, a gesture has arisen to test a man&apos;s adherence to the return to traditional courtship roles: In the last 10 years in the US, a further twist to the woman&apos;s offering to pay their own way has occurred. These women will generally offer to pay their part of the meal, but if the man agrees, the woman will assume that he is not interested in her and she will then decline to meet him again.

 first of that&apos;s a slanderous term, just so you know, and your friend is suggesting that you have everyone pay for themselves. So find how much everyonecan spend and go from there.

 means everybody pays for themselves

it however can mean you pay for your specific meal/drinks etc
or
you take the total bill and divide it by the number of people there (in this case 10)

the first option is a little more exact since the person that just had a salad should not have to pay for the person that had a big steak, however in my experience the bill seems to be short this way
the second option dividing the total bill normally works pretty well, except for the hurt feelings of the salad eater.

 of course this has been answered adequetly i just wanted to say that the hostess stuck you with a crappy job!! you&apos;ll have to be sure the server knows right from the beginning that all bills are seperate and that after everyone has been seated they stay in the seats they started in or the poor server wont be able to keep track.......cant stress that enough!!! servers use seat numbers to punch n the bill and if people move around how is she/he supposed to remember who is who........boy am i glad i didnt get an invite to your soiree! lol
