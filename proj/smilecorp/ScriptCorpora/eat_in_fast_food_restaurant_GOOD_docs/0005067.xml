 If I want to buy an existing fast food restaurant (pizza place) where do I start? 

 I have managed a pizza restaurant for 20 years and I would like to invest in my own place, where and how do I start?

 Right now is the perfect time to buy a small to midsize business. This economy has left a whole lot of businesses out there selling for less than their worth. Now is the time for people who want the most out of life to grasp on and take the plunge.
I think a key idea to remember when buying a business is to try and buy a winner. I know its tempting to buy a loser business and turn it around, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the financially sound way to operate. Purchase a mature profitable small business and you&apos;ll have cash flow right from day one.
I&apos;d also recommend not straying out of your field of expertise. A person that has been an executive of a produce company for 15 years has no business buying a water park. Stick to what you know. I think you&apos;ve got this down for sure. You have the experience doing this for 20 years, during that time you have certainly learned what it takes. Its only natural to take the next step forward and own your own business..
I think that anyone that is specifically interested in either buying or selling a business has to check out www.businessbuyeradvocate.com , it&apos;s full of must have information for anyone even thinking about taking the plunge.
What I like best about it is that there seem to be a whole lot of experts that read it and are available to answer any questions you or I might have. The comments section of the posts is extremely insightful.
Here&apos;s their tagline from the about section, I think it sums it up pretty well..&quot;The purpose of our blog - The Business Buyer Advocate®- is to further our understanding of issues affecting the buying and selling of privately held small and midsize businesses. We invite war stories, expert advice and marketplace intelligence from buyers, advisors, business brokers and dealmakers.&quot;
Buying a business very well could be the most important decision you ever make in your life. You have to make sure you buy the right business the right way.

 BizBuySell has a great &apos;buyer guidelines&apos; which is a good place to start. It&apos;s a nice outline of how someone would go about buying a business. Once you have an area you like, a business plan and your financials in order, I would suggest calling a restaurant/business broker to help you get started finding the right site/pizza business for you.

 Start by assembling your acquisition team. You will need to hire an attorney and an accountant to help you through the acquisition process.

 First thing most people would like to know is where? Do you have a preference for where this business would be? Would recommend that you be careful of buying, some have a poor rep that will be hard to live down. Ask many people in town if they know of it and if there are any problems. Then just start asking as you drive down the street. You get the best answers from those who are or have been there and done that. Good luck, Jon at Edgemaster Mobile sharpening
