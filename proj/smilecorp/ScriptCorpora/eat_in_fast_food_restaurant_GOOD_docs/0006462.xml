 &quot;Quote of the Month&quot; 

   

 &quot;They can play
middle-of-the-road and pop and call it country all they want to, but I don&apos;t
think they&apos;ll ever take the real thing out of people&apos;s hearts. Nowadays it&apos;s
strictly all fame and fortune and glory. In the old days we did it because we
loved to do it. It was a wonderful feeling of course, knowing that you could
make a living that way, doing something you loved to do, but it was never
really about money. I think to be successful and stay successful a long period
of time you&apos;ve got to love what you&apos;re doing.&quot; --George Jones in The Country Reader 25 Years of the Journal of Country
Music 

 Note: George Jones is such
a legend, the Find-A-Grave website
has already posted his Bio, and place of burial. Check it out at: http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=7225751 

 Note #2: I happen to know
that our hero is a friend of Jesus, and will spend eternity with his Creator.
Therefore, in my mind George Jones will never die, because eternity with Jesus
trumps death. Gob Bless George Jones!

 November Highlights 

   

 11-1-1947 Eddy Arnold&apos;s recording &quot;I&apos;ll Hold You In My Heart (Till I Can Hold You In My
Arms)&quot; was
Billboard magazine&apos;s #1 record. This song also won Billboard&apos;s Top Hit of the
Year Award. Eddy recorded this song at a session in Chicago, on May 18, 1947.
Steve Sholes produced the session, and the session players included: Eddy
Arnold - vocals&amp;guitar; Roy Wiggins - steel guitar; Owen Bradley - piano;

 11-2-2007
 Porter Wagoner&apos;s funeral
service was held this morning at 11:00 a.m. at The Grand Ole Opry House. Porter
celebrated his 50 th anniversary as a member of The Grand Ole Opry on
Febuary 21, 2007. Porter was scheduled to turn on the Nation&apos;s Christmas tree
lights in December. A short time prior to his death he told Marty Stuart,&quot;You&apos;re gonna have to call the president and tell him I won&apos;t be able to
sing him any Christmas songs this year. Maybe next year.&quot;Porter Wagoner
was laid to rest in Woodlawn Memorial Park, in Nashville. 

   

 11-3-1956 Nashville&apos;s
Tulane Hotel was
demolished beginning today. The Hotel was once the home of the Castle Recording
Studio, which was founded by some very talented WSM employees (during their off
duty hours). Aaron Shelton, George Reynolds, and Carl Jenkins were all radio engineers,
and used their skills to build their own studio, with a unique sound. Between
1946~1956 their studio recorded some of the best country music available at the
time. The three WSM employees, who were eventually forced to close the studio,
or lose their jobs at WSM made a huge contribution to Nashville becoming the
country music recording capitol of the world. 

   

 11-4-1975 Audrey Williams
1923~1975, age 52,
died unexpectedly in her sleep, at home in Nashville, Tennessee. Her death
occurred the night before the IRS was to seize her home for non-payment of
taxes. What a coincidence…or was it? 

   

 11-5-1985 C.W. McCall was elected in a landslide vote
today, when he won the job of mayor of Ouray, Colorado. The MGM and Polydor
recording artist received more than a 3 to 1 margin of votes. Ouray, Colorado
has a population of 813, and is the country seat of Ouray County. The vote
count from today&apos;s election was 259--80. Way to go C.W. 

   

 11-6-1998 Wynonna filed for divorce from her
husband of two years Arch Kelley III, in Franklin, Tennessee. 

   

 11-7-1914“Archie”James Campbell 1914~1987, Grand Ole Opry member and Hee Haw cast member, was
born in Bulls Gap, Tennessee. He studied Art at Mars Hill College in North
Carolina, and then went to work at radio station WNOX, in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Archie and Roy Acuff appeared on “The Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round” for one year, and Campbell
relocated to WDOD in Chattanooga. In 1941 Archie joined the Navy, where he
remained until the end of World War II. Between 1952~1958 Archie appeared on
WROL-TV’s “Country Playhouse,” Knoxville’s first country
music TV show. Archie moved to Nashville in 1958 and replaced Rod Brasfield on
the Prince Albert portion of the Grand Ole Opry. The following year he signed a
recording contract with RCA. In 1969 Archie was signed as a writer, and
entertainer for Hee Haw. That same year he was named the CMA Comedian of the
Year. Archie Campbell died as the result of a heart attack on August 29, 1987,
at the age of 72. Archie was laid to rest at Glenwood Cemetery in Powell,
Tennessee. 

   

 11-8-1973 Kris
Kristofferson&apos;s self-penned Monument single &quot;Why Me,&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA.
This was Kris&apos; first # 1 record. Larry Gatlin and Rita Coolidge provided
background vocals.

 

 11-9-2001 The Nashville Songwriters Hall
of Fame inducted: Johnny Russell,
Dennis Linde, and Don, and Phil Everly. 

   

 11-10-1945 Donna Fargo singer, songwriter was born Yvonne
Vaughn in Mount
Airy, North Carolina. One or more Music City publicists played games with
Donna&apos;s year of birth. It has been reported as November 10, 1940, 45, and 49.
The majority conclude the 1945 date to be correct. Just as a 2007 sidebar...age
is such an issue in Nashville these days that the Grand Ole Opry Souviner book
has stopped printing the year of their member&apos;s birth, just the month and day.
I think that is so sad, almost as sad as the music the Grand Ole Opry now
refers to as Country. There was a time in Cashville, when the elders of country
music were respected, and revered. 

   

 11-11-1974 Johnny and June Carter Cash attended the Watergate trial in
Washington D.C., at the invitation of Federal prosecutor James Neal. 

   

 11-12-1957 Johnny Cash recorded “Big
River,” &amp; “Ballad Of A Teenage Queen” at Sun Studio in Memphis,
Tennessee. The session was produced by Jack Clement. Big River was written by Cash, and the
session players included: Johnny Cash - vocals&amp;guitar; Luther Perkins -
lead guitar; Marshall Grant - bass; and Jack Clement - guitar. Ballad Of A
Teenage Queen was
written by Jack Clement. The session players on this recording included: Johnny
Cash - vocals&amp;guitar; Marshall Grant - bass; Jack Clement - guitar; Cyd
Mosteller, Asa Wilkerson, Bill Abbott, Don Carter, Lee Holt, and Nita Smith -
backing vocals. Big River topped out at #4 on Billboard, and Ballad Of A Teenage
Queen became
John&apos;s 3 rd #1 country single. 

   

 11-13-1983 Alvin“Junior”Samples 1926~1983, age 57, cast member of Hee Haw died from a heart attack.
Samples was laid to rest in Swanee View Gardens, in Cumming, Georgia. 

   

 11-14-1951 Ernest Tubb recorded “I’m In
Love With Molly” and &quot;Too Old To Cut The Mustard&quot; for Decca Records, at
Nashville&apos;s Castle Studios. Paul Cohen produced the session, the session
personnel included: Ernest Tubb-vocals; Red Foley-vocals; Billy Byrd and Grady
Martin-lead guitar; Tommy Jackson-Fiddle; Billy Robinson- steel guitar; Ernie
Newton-bass; Owen Bradley-piano; Farris Coursey-drums. &quot;Too Old To Cut
The Mustard&quot; with
E.T. and Red Foley hit the Billboard chart in February 1952, and topped out at
#5. The song was written by future Hall of Fame member Bill Carlisle. 

   

 11-15-2005 The CMA Awards
Show was broadcast
from New York City, the country music capital of America. Woops, I forgot, New
York City doesn&apos;t have a full time country radio station, so perhaps the new country
music capital is in New Orleans. The&quot;Musician of the Year was Jerry
Douglas.&quot;Lee Ann Womack won three trophies, and&quot;Whiskey
Lullaby&quot;written by Bill Anderson and Jon Randall was&quot;Song of the
Year.&quot;Glen Campbell, Alabama, and DeFord Bailey a harmonica player who
was fired from the Grand Ole Opry because he wouldn&apos;t learn any new material,
were inducted into the CMHF. Dolly Parton and Elton John sang John Lennon&apos;s &quot;Imagine.&quot; At the
conclusion of the show I was imagining what Roy Acuff was thinking as he looked
down from Hillbilly Heaven, and got a glimpse of today&apos;s country music.
Actually, I didn&apos;t imagine what he would say...I already knew exactly what he
would say, but I can&apos;t include the quote in this article. But Roy ole friend,
you are absolutely right! 

   

 11-16-1934 Felton Jarvis
1934~1981, record
producer, was born Charles Felton Jarvis in Atlanta, Georgia. Jarvis produced Elvis
Presley’s sessions from 1966~1977. Felton and Mary Lynch, Chet Atkins secretary were married in July 1969. 

   

 11-17-1951 Eva Overstake
1918~1951, age 33,
a.k.a. Mrs. Red Foley, took her own life in Nashville, after learning her
husband was having an affair with Sally
Sweet . At the time,
Red was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Red Foley married Sally Sweet, a short
time later. Eva Overstake was a cast member of the WLS Barn Dance when she met
Red. 

   

 11-18-1969 Conway Twitty recorded his #1 hit “Hello
Darlin’,” at Bradley&apos;s Barn. Decca released the song the following year, and it
charted on April 25, 1970. The single remained on the charts for 20 weeks, and
has been named a Grammy Hall of Fame recording. During his lifetime Conway
charted 98 country singles on Billboards Country charts. Forty of those singles
went to #1, and 70 of the singles were top 5 records. In addition, Conway
charted 67 country albums. The Country Music Association awarded Conway Twitty
a total of 4 awards during his lifetime. All 4 awards were for duets that he
recorded with Loretta Lynn. Why? Conway had no interest in, and refused to get
involved with the politics of Music Row. Welcome to Music City...what&apos;s your
dream? 

   

 11-19-1974 Tom T.
Hall’s self-penned Mercury single “Country Is” topped the charts. This was The
Storyteller&apos;s 24 th chart hit, and his 4 th #1 single. Tom
T. quit the Grand Ole Opry earlier this year, when they moved from the Ryman
Auditorium, to the new Grand Ole Opry House at Opry Land. He knew a lot of his
friends on lower Broadway in Nashville, would be financially ruined by the
move. He rejoined the Opry in 1980, after Ernest
Tubb told him in
the parking lot behind TNN that it was time that he came back where he
belonged. When E.T. talked, everyone listened. He was one of the most popular
artists to ever grace the stage of a country music show. It was Ernest Tubb who
talked Roy Acuff into coming back to the Grand
Ole Opry a few decades earlier. Roy had quit because of the ridiculously low
salary paid to the Opry stars by WSM. Ernst told Roy the Opry needed him back,
and Roy rejoined the following week. I haven&apos;t stood on stage next to Ernest
Tubb in front of a WSM microphone for almost forty years. But there isn&apos;t one
day I don&apos;t think about him, and all the people he helped during his career. No
one artist in Nashville did more to further the career of others that Ernest
Tubb. 

   

 11-20-1897 Eck Robertson
1887~1975, champion
fiddler, and pioneering recording artist, was born in Madison County, Arkansas,
and raised in Hamlin, Texas. Eck began his recording career in 1922 with &quot;Sallie
Gooden&quot;and&quot;Arkansas Traveler.&quot; 

   

 11-21-2001 Welcome to the new“Music City USA.”One month after the attacks of 9-11, Country
Music Television presented their“Country Freedom Concert.” Charlie Daniels was booked on the show, and was going to perform
his popular“This Ain’t No Rag, It’s A Flag.”The
politically correct executives at CMT (which was owned by VH-1) told
Charlie that he could not sing that song on the show, because it might offend
the Muslim community. Charlie Daniels, an American Patriot, cancelled his
appearance on the show. Well done, Charlie Daniels. I have nothing to say about
Country Music Television…except this, they should change their name to
RPST (Rock Pop Sexy Television). 

   

 11-22-1986 Lorrie Morgan and Keith Whitley were married in Nashville, and spent their honeymoon in
Florida. Their son, Jesse Keith Whitley was born June 15, 1987. The marriage

 Did You Know? 

   

 Marty Robbins began recording at the Bradley
Film and Recording Studios in Nashville in 1955. The new facility was owned by
Owen and Harold Bradley. 

   

 Olivia Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer
in 1992. 

   

 When Eddy Arnold first came to the Grand Ole Opry, he was the vocalist for
Pee Wee King&apos;s Golden West Cowboys (1940-1943). 

   

 Chet Atkins charted 32 of his albums between
1964-1996. 

   

 The Union Gospel Tabernacle was built in downtown Nashville
in 1892. It would later be renamed the Ryman
Auditorium , The Grand Ole Opry
House, and
once again the Ryman
Auditorium. 

   

 George Strait has a degree in agriculture from

 When George Jones was in the U.S. Marines, he performed as &quot;Little

 Kitty Wells&apos; 1952 #1 Decca single &quot;It Wasn&apos;t God Who Made Honky Tonk
Angels&quot; was
banned on the NBC radio network, and the Grand Ole Opry, as being too
suggestive. The ban lasted for years. This sounds absolutely foolish to the
young people of today, but don&apos;t judge them too harshly. Most of them are not
familiar with morality. This is the generation that will never see a social
security check, because they murdered the next generation of Americans in their
mothers womb. 

   

 Deana Carter and husband Chris DeCroce were divorced in 2001, after five years of marriage.

Kelley, Wynonna’s ex-husband was sentenced to fifty days in jail, on December
14, 1999, for violating the terms of their divorce agreement. (He discussed the
details of the settlement with the press.) Arch posted a $50,000 bond, and was
released pending an appeal. 

   

 Willie Nelson&apos;s movie &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; premiered at Mann&apos;s Chinese
Theatre, in Los Angeles, in July 1980. 

   

 Gov. Jimmie Davis of Louisiana gave the honorary
title of &apos;Colonel&apos; to his longtime friend Tom Parker in 1948. I have a few titles for
Parker myself, but I&apos;ll keep them to myself. 

   

 When Jimmy C. Newman recorded his first record in 1946, he sang the
words in French. 

   

 WSM began paying their Grand Ole
Opry stars, and sidemen, in 1928. Everyone was paid the same…$5.00 a
week. That wasn&apos;t very much. Whatever they get today…that&apos;s way too much! 

   

 Thought For Today 

   

 What a friend I have in
Jesus! By the way…He&apos;ll be your friend too…if you&apos;re interested. 

   

 Be
anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with
thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God,
which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through
Christ Jesus. 

 Philippians 4:6,7
NKJV 

   

 Good
Lord willing, I&apos;ll see you next month.

Trace sustained a few other injuries prior to joining the Grand Ole Opry in
2003: His nose was severed in a traffic accident; left finger cut off in the

 10-9-1937 The Belmont Brothers
duet made their debut appearance on the Grand Ole Opry. The brothers lived in
Nashville, and this would be their only Opry appearance. A young man by the
name of Roy Acuff, and his band The Crazy Tennesseans auditioned on this evenings Opry
show for George D. Hay. The Judge was not impressed, and
sent them back to Knoxville. Roy later admitted that he didn&apos;t do a very good
job that night. In February the following year, Roy and the band would get
another opportunity. Hay was on medical leave from WSM, and Harry Stone, the
president of WSM, and manager of the Opry during Hay&apos;s absence was impressed
with Acuff. Stone hired Roy as a member of the cast, and suggested he change
the name of his band. They came up with The
Smokey Mountain Boys. The rest is history.

founded in 1942. The formal partnership agreement was
between Fred Rose, and Roy Acuff’s wife Mildred. Mildred handled all of Roy&apos;s
business matters. Mr. Roy said many times that Mildred did a lot more for him,
than he ever did for her. 

   

 10-14-1946 Grandpa Jones and Ramona Riggins were married. 

   

 10-15-1952 Hank Williams, and former girl friend Bobbie

House, and died in Reston, Virginia. Inducted into the CMHF in 1990. Ernie Ford
was laid to rest in Alta Mesa Memorial Park, Palo Alto, California. 

   

 10-18-1952
 Hank Williams married Billie Jean Jones Eshliman, in Minden, Louisiana. The following day they
repeated the wedding ceremony in two separate public appearances. Some folks
say the last two ceremonies were Hank’s attempt to spite Audrey. After
his death, a judge ruled the wedding was not legal due to the fact that Billie
Jean’s divorce did not become final until eleven days after she married
Hank. A Federal Judge would overrule this decision in 1975. 

   

 10-19-1991 Grant Turner 1912-1991, age 79, a favorite
son of the state of Texas, and The Dean of WSM Announcers died in Nashville. Grant was
loved by everyone who ever met him. His career at WSM began on D Day, June 6,
1944. Inducted into the CMDJHF in 1975., and the CMHF in 1981. Grant was laid
to rest in Williamson Memorial Gardens in Nashville.

 

 10-20-1949 Vernon,
Gladys, and Elvis Presley moved to a federally funded housing project in
Memphis, after Vernon was caught hauling illegal whiskey for a bootlegger in
Tupelo. 

   

 10-21-1933 Mel Street

birthday at his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Later that same day his 19th
chart record hit the Billboard Country chart. Mel was laid to rest in Woodlawn
Memorial Park, in Nashville. 

   

 10-22-1975 A Federal Judge ruled in
Atlanta, that Billie Jean’s marriage to Hank Williams was valid, and 50% of Hank’s future royalties
belonged to her. A few days after the judge’s decision Audrey Williams died in her sleep, one day before the IRS was
scheduled to seize her home. I have not read the death certificate, but
I’m pretty sure in Nashville it would read“death by natural
causes.” 

   

 10-23-1992 Roy Acuff the King of Country Music, made
his final appearance on his beloved Grand Ole Opry. One month later Mr. Roy
passed away. 

   

 10-24-2003 Rosey Nix Carter Adams 1958-2003, age 45, daughter of June Carter Cash and Edwin“Rip”Nix, was found dead, along with bluegrass musician Jimmy
Campbell, in a converted School Bus. Cause of death was carbon monoxide
poisoning. Rosey was Johnny Cash’s step-daughter; Mother Maybelle’s
granddaughter; John Carter Cash and Carlene Carter’s half-sister; and
step-sister of Rosanne, Cindy, Tara and Kathy Cash. Rosey was laid to rest in

June Carter Cash.

inducted into the NSHF in 1973 and won a Tony Award in 1985 for the music he
wrote for the Broadway production of&quot;Big River.&quot;Induction into the
CMHF came posthumously in 1995. Roger Miller was cremated in California. Shortly before his death, Roger told a visitor in his hospital room;“You
know that’s just my luck. I finally reach a point in my life when I could
use some spare parts, and California passes a helmet law.” Roger Miller was a genius, and
is missed by everyone who knew him. 

   

 10-26-1969 Waylon
Jennings and Jessi Colter were married. 

10-27-1934 The Grand Ole Opry moved from WSM’s Studio C, to Nashville’s
Hillsboro Theatre. The Hillsboro seated 2,400 people, and for the first time the stars would have
dressing rooms. At this time the artists were instructed to wear costumes on
the show. The opening night at the Hillsboro Theatre was Vito Pellettiere’s
debut as the Opry’s first stage manager. Mr. Pellettiere’s contribution to the
success of the Opry over the next forty years (1934~1974) cannot be overstated. 

   

 10-28-1936 Charlie
Daniels American
patriot, singer, songwriter, guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and banjo player was
born in Wilmington, North Carolina. Charlie was the CMA Musician of the Year in
1979. He charted thirty-four country singles on Billboard’s country
charts between 1973~2003, and fourteen albums, including the #1 Epic Album“Million
Mile Reflections.”Charlie Daniels loves his country, and the brave men
and women who protect it. After Stonewall Jackson filed a lawsuit against the
Grand Ole Opry charging them with age discrimination, the Opry invited Charlie
to become a member. Could it be possible that this very talented artist was
invited to join the Opry at the suggestion of one of the Opry&apos;s lawyers?
Charlie Daniels should have been an Opry member years ago, but the timing of
this invitation smells to high heaven…almost as bad as the music now
being played on it&apos;s stage. 

 
 10-29-1931 Gene Autry recorded “That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine.&quot; 

   

 10-30-1941 Ernest Tubb ,
age 27, recorded six songs today at Biggs Studio in Dallas, Texas.“Walking The Floor Over You”was the first song recorded, and
became The Texas Troubadour’s first big hit. Dave Kapp produced the session, which included
Ernest Tubb on Vocals,&amp;Rhythm guitar; Fay Smith on Steel&amp;Lead
guitar. The names of any other session players have been lost to the ages.
Twenty-four years and eleven months later, Decca Records honored E.T. at a
party in New York City. The occasion celebrated Ernest’s twenty-fifth
anniversary as a Decca recording artist, and finally, E.T. was presented a gold
record for“Walking The Floor Over You.” 

   

 10-31-1990 Carl Belew 1931~1990, age 59, died from cancer in Salina, Oklahoma. Cast member
of the “Louisiana Hayride” and inducted into the NSHF in 1976. Carl wrote, or
co-wrote the following songs. Am I That Easy to Forget; What&apos;s He Doing in
My World; Stop the World and Let Me Off; Help Stamp Out Loneliness; Lonely

time. NOTE: Bob Luman was my friend, and I

Opry. I was always polite to Mr. Acuff, because I had a great deal of respect
for him. And…his son Roy Jr. and I were touring together. But I know I
was correct in stating that Bob made a huge contribution to the Opry. He filled
a lot of seats that would otherwise have been empty. Bob&apos;s daughter Melissa and
her husband were invited to the induction ceremony, and made the trip to
Carthage, Texas, from their home in Hendersonville. Bob Luman was something

 The Grand Ole Opry celebrated Roy Acuff’s 50th anniversary as a cast 

 on February 20, 1988. Porter Wagoner hosted two segments that evening, 

 and Dolly was his guest on both shows. This was the first time they had 

 performed together on stage since the 1974 breakup of their show. 

 
 Something
To Think About 

   

 The
United States of America… 

   

 By law
condones the murder of unborn children. In the past, the safest place in the
world for a child to be, was in an American mothers womb. American&apos;s have now
made it the most dangerous place for a child to be. 

 

 Some
states support the homosexual lifestyle, and same sex marriage. 

   

 The
communist founded, God hating ACLU, in cooperation with the many Federal U.S.
Judges who legislate from the bench, are succeeding in taking God, and the Holy
Scriptures out of the public domain. Isn&apos;t it interesting…their only
religious target is the Christian Bible, and the God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob? But then, what reason could they possibly have for attacking any other
God? 

   

 There
was a time when chewing gum, or talking in class could get an American student
in a lot of trouble. Now, it&apos;s a good day at the local school when not one
child is murdered, raped, robbed, or died from a drug overdose. Not to mention,
being sexually seduced by one of their teachers. 

   

 America&apos;s
colleges and universities hire professors who are so far to the left, they
border on being mentally challenged. They identify the students in their
classes who are Christians, and Republicans, and reveal the names to the rest
of the class. These students are regularly criticized by the professor. 

   

   

 Our
elected officials don&apos;t even pretend to represent the American people anymore.
Our government is all about the leaders, and their re-election. The people in
this nation no longer have a voice. It&apos;s all about politics. There are no poor
politicians in Washington D.C. It is not possible for an honest man, or woman,
to raise millions of dollars for their political races, and not sell their soul
to the source of all the money. 

   

 America
has not won a war since 1945. Half of America would not support a war for any
reason. America has few friends around the world. The parts of America not
covered by flood waters, have recently experienced fires that can&apos;t be put out
for months, or suffered from severe storms of one kind or another. The fact of
the matter is, we haven&apos;t seen anything yet. God destroys nations, and cities,
that turn their back on Him. If you think He isn&apos;t really angry with this
nation, take a look at the jewels who have been nominated by the two political
parties to be our president in the last two decades. 

   

 The
saddest part of all this gloom, and doom, is that it&apos;s too late to do anything
about it. The American people have made their choices, and the results have
been all around us for years. Satan and his favorite tool &quot;Political
Correctness,&quot; win. This once great nation will soon be history. That makes me sad for
you, unless Jesus is your best friend. Only the people who know Jesus Christ
will survive this mess. To those who have turned your back on your Creator, I
tell you in all honesty…eternity is a long, long time. 

   

 See ya&apos;
next month…maybe.

 &quot;Quote of the Month&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m so proud to
be here to induct one of my dear, dear friends, Mel Tillis . Fifty-one years ago,
when I was 10, I did my first country tour, with Mel, Faron Young, George Jones
and Patsy Cline. If you didn&apos;t think that was an education, you&apos;ve got another
think coming. But that&apos;s how far Mel and I go back, and 10 years ago, when
[then CMA Executive Director] Ed Benson called me in Branson, Mo., and said
that I was being inducted into the Hall of Fame, Mel was one of the first
people I told. He was as happy for me that day as I am this day to be a part of
his induction.&quot; 
—Brenda Lee inducting Mel Tillis into the Country
Music Hall of Fame

 September Highlights 

   

 9-1-1976 - Delia“Mom”Upchurch 1891~1976 , age 85, Den
Mother of the stars, died in Nashville. After the end of World War II, Mom ran
a rooming house for down and out musicians for many years. No one paid more
than ten dollars a week, and only musicians and songwriters were welcome. Mom
Upchurch and Tootsie Bess of Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge, sustained hundreds
of young, talented people until they found their spot in Music Row’s
Merry-go-round. 

   

 9-2-1972 - ­ Bob Luman&apos;s Epic label single “Lonely
Women Make Good Lovers” was released in 1972. The song charted in September, and
topped out at #4, remaining on the chart for 19 weeks. Spooner Oldham and
Freddy Weller wrote the song. This was the Louisiana Hayride and Grand Ole Opry
star’s 23 rd chart single. Bob Luman was a dynamic entertainer,
and helped fill many seats at the Grand Ole Opry during a period of time when
Rock and Roll was causing many country artists lots of problems. The last time
I spoke to Bob, he was getting back on his bus in a nightclub parking lot near
Thomasboro, Illinois. The cover charge that night (May 2, 1971) for the Opry
star’s road show, which included 3 artists and 2 bands…$2.00 each.
I had opened for Bob earlier that evening, and I asked him where he would be
the following night. He replied“Bill, I’m going back to
Nashville…I’ve got to find a hit song…I’ll see ya down
the road.”Bob Luman died on December 27, 1978, at the age of 41. I look
forward to seeing Bob again…up the road. 

   

 9-3-1949 - Ernest Tubb&apos;s Decca single &quot;My Filipino Rose&quot; charted today in Billboard
magazine. The song was written by Ernest&apos;s friend Hank Snow, and was recorded
at Castle Studios in Nashville three months earlier. Session personnel on this
recording included: Ernest Tubb-vocals; Hal Smith-fiddle; Tommy Paige-lead
guitar; Bill Drake-rhythm guitar; Dickie Harris-steel guitar; Mac
McGarr-mandolin; Zeke Turner-electric rhythm guitar. This was E.T.&apos;s 26 th chart single, and it topped out at #6. The flip side of this record also charted
today. The Cindy Walker penned &quot;Warm Red Wine&quot; climbed the chart to #8. 

   

 9-4-1991 - Dottie West
1932~1991 , age 58,
singer, songwriter, guitarist and actor, died in a Nashville hospital. Dottie
died as a result of injuries received in a car wreck on August 30 th near the Grand Ole Opry House, where she was scheduled to perform. Dottie was
the first female Country Artist to win a Grammy. She won for “Here Comes My
Baby.” She won the CMA’s Vocal Duo of the Year award with Kenny Rogers in 1978&amp;1979. Between 1963~1985 Dottie charted 63 country single hits on the
Billboard charts, and 23 of her albums charted. Don’t look for Dottie
West in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Dottie wasn’t the political type.
She was only a top notch female singer, songwriter, and entertainer. And if you
think that will get you in the Hall of Fame, you need to read the list of
inductees. Going back to the 1920’s (Jimmie Rodgers, the first inductee,
was working in that decade) there have only been seven (7) female solo artists
chosen for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Patsy Cline (1973)
~Kitty Wells ~ (1976) Patsy Montana (1996) ~Brenda Lee (1997) ~Tammy Wynette
(1998) ~and Dolly Parton (1999). There is twice that number of CMA, and Music
industry executives in the Hall of Fame as there are female solo vocalists. But
then we must remember the Country Music Association was not formed to serve the
fans of country music. And obviously their illegitimate child “The
Country Music Hall of Fame” falls into the same category. Everything in Music City in
the 21 st Century is about $$$. Did you know there was a time when
fans were admitted to the Grand Ole Opry for free? And during all of those
years, the entertainers were not paid. It use to be all about the music. Now
it’s all about the $$$. And today’s country music radio, and
television reflects the results. Dottie West was laid to rest in Mountain View
Cemetery, in McMinnville, Tennessee. She will never be forgotten by those who
were fortunate enough to know her, or watch her perform. 

   

 9-5-1967 - Dolly Parton debuted as a cast member on the
Porter Wagoner Show. 

   

 9-6-1984 - Ernest Tubb
1914-1984 , age 70,

Ole Opry for forty-one years. He was inducted into the CMHF in 1965 , NSHF in 1970 , and the Texas CMHF in 1999. No

their careers than this Texas gentleman.

Ann Womack, Alan Jackson and Jim Lauderdale from the stage of the Grand Ole

lasted six months as a cast member of the Opry. A very independent artist with
strong opinions about feminist rights, and a desire to wear costumes that bared
her midriff. Rose was fired in March 1957. Opry management shouldered the
blame, but it was Mr. Acuff who insisted that this feisty female be terminated.

 9-30-1958 - Marty Stuart , country music legend, and

to country music, and it&apos;s history is immeasurable.

 From The Wisdom Desk 

   

 If you
reject truth, all that&apos;s left is lies. If someone tells you there is more than
one way to get to heaven, that person is a liar. Jesus Christ is the door to
heaven, and heaven only has one door. It&apos;s heaven, or hell and you get to
choose. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. 

   

 See you
back here next month, Good Lord willin&apos; and the creek don&apos;t rise. Shalom…Pray
for the peace of Jerusalem.

appearance on the Friday night Opry. Randy has appeared on the Opry over 200
times, but always as a sideman. (Tom T. Hall, Dolly Parton, and many others).
Tonight, Randy was the headliner, and stood in the circle at center stage, and
opened his portion of the show with a song that my daughter Susan, and Randy
co-wrote. When Randy completed his portion of the show the audience gave him
the loudest applause I heard all evening. I couldn&apos;t be present at the Opry
House for this special event, but I listened to the show on WSM. It was
something very special for me, and I will never forget hearing that song, being
beamed out over the airwaves of 650 WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. Yes, I cried
while listening, but old men do that from time to time. Especially when they
have children who love their God, and their country, and put those feelings
above their personal achievements. Please forgive this old man for sharing his
thoughts about this very special night. You know how much I love Classic
Country and Bluegrass musicbut I love my children moremuch more. My son Tom is
a law enforcement officer, and one of the best. He searches out the bad guys,
(and gals) with due diligence, and puts them where they belong. I like that a
lot. Yes, I am very proud of my children, and I thank the God of Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob for sharing them with me.

matter where you gothere you are.&quot; In spiritual terms this clich becomes the most
important aspect of every human life. Compared with eternity, the time we spend
on earth is less that a heartbeat. So, when you die where will you go? I&apos;m
going to heaven, and that&apos;s where I will spend eternity. I know that because
Jesus Christ paid my sin debt, and his sacrifice at Calvary is the only
acceptable payment for anyone&apos;s sin debt. When you go, where will you spend
eternity? You really should think about it, eternity is a long, long time. 

   

 9 if you
confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has
raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart
one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation. Romans 10:9,10 NKJV 

   

 God said it. I believe it.
And that&apos;s it. 

   

 Please
pray for our troops and their familiesbecause they deserve our thanks and
prayers. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and our nations leaders because God
said we should. Pray for America&apos;s law enforcement officers, firemen and those
who protect us from the evil that threatens us in every city, and neighborhood
in this nation, that was founded by God fearing Christians. 

   

 If you
know a federal judge, tell him/her that the original Constitution has worked
just fine since it&apos;s inception. It is not a living thing that can be changed by
someone who has not been elected by the citizens of this nation. If they don&apos;t
honor the oath they took, they will pay a price. If you know a member of the ACLU, tell them they will stand before God someday, and be judged
for what they have done to this Christian nation. They won&apos;t believe you, and
they won&apos;t change their God hating ways, but at least they won&apos;t be able to say
they received no warning of their impending eternal sentence.

Well, thanks for dropping by RCNV, it&apos;s always good to cyber-see you. Good Lord
willing I&apos;ll see you here next month. If not ... it&apos;s to a much better place I
go. I pray that I&apos;ll see you there to ... ShalomPray for the peace of
Jerusalem.

 &quot;Quote of the Month&quot; 

 
&quot;Don&apos;t worry about me hoss, when it&apos;s my time to go, it&apos;s my time!&quot;
 --Patsy Cline 1963 



 Recording Session of the Month 

 
 Buck Owens recorded &quot;You Ain&apos;t Gonna Have Ol&apos; Buck To Kick Around No More,&quot; June 20, 1972, at Buck Owens Studio&apos;s in
Bakersfield, California. Buck Owens wrote the song after he heard Richard Nixon
tell reporters after he lost the California governor&apos;s election in 1962,&quot;You won&apos;t have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.&quot;Session Personnel
included: Buck Owens--vocals; Don Rich--lead guitar; Buddy Alan-rhythm guitar;
Jerry Brightman--steel guitar; Jim Shaw--piano; Doyle Curtsinger--bass; Jerry
Wiggins--drums. The Capitol single was released August 28, 1972, and topped out
on the charts at #13. This song was also released on Buck&apos;s 1973 album &quot;In
The Palm Of Your Hand.&quot; 

   

 Ten Questions 

 

         1.
 Don Gibson wrote &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; in 1956. Who recorded this country
music standard?
2. Buffalo, New York&apos;s favorite married couple had a huge hit in
1970, with a
#1 song named &quot;Tennessee Bird Walk.&quot; The couple have been inducted
into the New York Music Hall of Fame. Who are they? 

         3.
 Clint Black hit the country music charts for the first time in 1989. Clint 

 released his first RCA duet in 1991. Who was Clint&apos;s duet partner on
this 

 record? 

 4. Who was the first performer to sing on stage at
the new Opryland, Grand
Ole Opry House in 1974? 

         5.
 What was the name of Jim Reeves&apos; Band? 

 6. Who played the first live music on WSM 650 AM in
Nashville. Hint: It 

 wasn&apos;t Uncle Jimmy Thompson, who first played on WSM
on November 28,
        1925. 

 7. What was the name of Gene Watson&apos;s first #1 hit record,
and how many 

         #1 records did Gene chart in his career? 

         8.
 When Roy Clark was co-hosting the filming of HEE HAW, (1969-1992) 
        only one time did he find
a seat in the studio, where the artist could see 

 that Roy was watching their performance. This occurred on
February 16, 1991. Who was the artist that Roy wanted to watch for the first
time? 

         9.
 Twelve years after Jimmie Rodgers was inducted as the first member of
the Country Music Hall of Fame, the first female solo artist was
inducted. 

         What was her name? I&apos;ll give you a hint: She had to die a tragic death, in
 order to receive enough votes from the Good Ole Boy&apos;s
Club in order
to
        be inducted. 

 10. Name the female solo artists (not comedians, or member of a duet, or
       group) who have been inducted
into the Country Music Hall of Fame since
1961.

 6-22-1969 - Merle Haggard was the featured guest on &quot;Hee

 6-23-1929 - June Carter
Cash 1929-2003 , was
born Valerie June Carter, to Ezra and Maybelle Carter in Maces Springs, Virginia.
June was a member of the &quot;Carter Sisters;&quot; Helen, on accordion, Anita on
bass, Mother Maybelle, on guitar, and June on autoharp and comedy. This group
was formed in 1943 after Sara Carter left the Carter Family and went back to
California. During the time they spent as members of the Grand Ole Opry, Chet

as regular cast members, and toured with John for several years. 

   

 6-24-2002 - Dixie Chick
Natalie Maines ,
married actor Adrian Pasdar, in Las Vegas. The ACLU member now lives in
Hollyweird. Natalie at one time was the lead singer for an all girl band out of
Texas. Don&apos;t hear much about them anymore. I guess you could say, the Chick
in the middle committed &quot;musical suicide.&quot; Rumor had it, that the girls were now playing rock
and roll. I know that couldn&apos;t be true, because they haven&apos;t appeared on
Country Music Television, or the Grand Ole Opry. 

 
 6-25-1986 - Jenifer Strait , age 13, daughter of George and
Norma Strait, died in a car wreck near her father&apos;s ranch in Texas. Riding in a
car with friends, Jenifer was thrown out of the car, through an open window. 

 
6-26-1909 - Colonel Tom Parker 1909-1997 , Elvis Presley&apos;s 50% manager, was born Andreas Cornelis
van Kuijk, in
Breda, Netherlands. If you&apos;ve ever wondered why Elvis never toured outside the
U.S., it was because Parker, the former carnival hustler, was an illegal alien.
He couldn&apos;t get a passport, so he kept his property where he could see him. When
Elvis died, Parker attended the funeral at Graceland, wearing a short sleeve
flowered shirt, and never once approached the casket to look at Elvis. When
Parker was Eddy Arnold&apos;s manager, he told the Grand Ole Opry manager that he
wanted a percentage of the Opry ticket sales. He said Eddy was going to start
his own radio show on another station, during the same time-slot if the Opry
refused his demand. WSM said&quot;NO!!!&quot;and Parker instructed Eddy that
he had to quit the Opry. Eddy said goodbye to the Opry audience a short time
later, and left the stage in tears. Parker also managed Hank Snow, and cheated
him out of a promised share of money from the signing of Elivis, and Hank
disliked Parker with a passion(it was really more than disliked, but I hate to
use the word hate). It was Hank&apos;s son, Jimmy Snow, who went to Shreveport to
watch Elvis perform on the Louisiana Hayride, at the request of Col. Parker.
Jimmy returned to Nashville with a very positive report about Elvis&apos;
performance, and the crowd reaction. Parker soon signed Elvis to a management
contract, which Vernon, and Gladys Presley were required to sign, due to Elvis&apos;
age. 

   

 6-27-1990 - Betty Foley
1933-1990 , daughter
of Red Foley died at the age of 57. She recorded three singles, one each in
1954, 1955, and 1959. All three were Top Ten singles. 

 
6-28-1974 - Roy Acuff introduced Paul McCartney to the audience at the Friday
Night Opry. The former Beatle and his family had been in Nashville for several
days, recording with his new band Wings . The Opry members enjoyed their
backstage visit with Mr.&amp;Mrs. McCartney and their children.

 6-29-1969 - Tammy Wynette , George Jones , and Faron Young were the featured guests on &quot;Hee Haw.&quot; Tammy met her last husband George Richey when she
taped this show. 

   

 6-30-2001 - Chester Burton
&quot;Chet&quot; Atkins 1924-2001 , age 77, died in Nashville. In 1973, Chet Atkins, age 49, was the
youngest person ever inducted into the Country Music Hall Of Fame. A partial
list of Chet&apos;s awards include: The Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at their
33 rd Annual Awards show in 1993; inducted into the Georgia Music
Hall of Fame 1995; the Billboard Century Award in 1997, won the CMA Musician
of the Year Award 9
times; inducted into the Rock&amp;Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, as a sideman. 
This Music Row giant was laid to rest in Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens,
Nashville, Tennessee.

 RCNV Songwriter&apos;s Spotlight 

 
 Don Gibson 1928-2003 
 
 Born Donald
Eugene Gibson April
3, 1928, in Shelby, North Carolina.
Died in Nashville, November 17, 2003. Laid to rest in Sunset, Cemetery, in
Shelby, North Carolina. 

   

 The
last time I saw Don Gibson was backstage at a concert in Rockford, Illinois. I
opened the show, and my band backed Don on his portion of the show. Don didn&apos;t
have his own band. He was traveling alone, with his guitar, one suitcase, and
some items of clothing on hangers in the back seat of his car. After the show
he asked where I was headed next. I told him I was headed to northern Saskatchewan,
in Canada, for three weeks of shows, including one show at a Federal prison. I
said where are you headed? He replied I don&apos;t remember, but I&apos;ve got it written
down at the motel. That was Don Gibson. A musical genius, with a suitcase full
of demons. Sadly, a pretty typical Music City story. The more talent a person
has, it seemed like the more difficult it was for them to just get through the
day sometimes, and no one understands. I wish I would have told Don, that I had
been a fan of his for years, and it was an honor to talk to him, to work with
him - but I thought I would wait until I had more time - my wife and two angels
(one a six year old buddy of mine named Tom, and the other a real beauty named
Susie, who was born 12 weeks earlier at Baptist Hospital in Nashville), were
waiting for me to join them, and the band, so we could begin the next leg of a
very long tour. I just shook hands with Don Gibson, and told him to drive
careful, and be safe - I never saw him again. But as long as there is one real
country music radio station in America, Don Gibson will be with us. He left a
body of work, that no D.J. who loves real country music could ever ignore. But
I sure am sorry I didn&apos;t tell him how I felt about him, and his music. 

   

 Don
began his career in the Shelby, Tennessee, area in 1948 and he and his band the&quot;Sons Of The Soil&quot;were hired by WOHS in Shelby. Knoxville,
Tennessee, was his next stop when he joined the cast of the WNOX Barn Dance in
1951, and later worked the&quot;Midday Merry-Go-Round. It was Wesley Rose who
discovered Don&apos;s talent, when he heard him sing Sweet Dreams in a nightclub in Knoxville.
Rose immediately signed him as a writer for Acuff-Rose Publishing, and was
responsible for getting Don&apos;s recording contract at RCA. 
 
 Don wrote, and
recorded Sweet Dreams in 1956, and his first RCA release Oh Lonesome Me, took Don to the Grand Ole Opry
in 1958. He remained with RCA until late in 1969. Don did his best to kill Chet
Atkins during an evening session at RCA, after a problem arose in the studio. He
didn&apos;t do a whole lot of damage to his producer, but he was soon recording for
Hickory records. Don charted over eighty country singles during his career, and
almost twenty albums. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of
Fame in 1973, and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Don left the Opry in
1964, but was reinstated in 1975. Drugs were a huge problem in Nashville during
this period. Many careers were ruined, but Don Gibson hung in there. 

   

 The
following songs represent a few examples of Don Gibson&apos;s songwriting ability:
 Sweet Dreams; Oh Lonesome Me; I Can&apos;t Stop Loving You; Blue, Blue Day; I&apos;d
Be A Legend In My Time; Country Green; Sea Of Heartbreak; One Day At A Time;
Lonesome Number One; and hundreds of others. You can visit Don Gibson&apos;s NSHF website at: http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/

 * All fame is written in ice, and eventually the sun
comes out.* 

 From The Wisdom Desk 

 
Note to the God hating ACLU: 

   

 &quot;It
cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was
founded, not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the
gospel of Jesus Christ. For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been
afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here.&quot; 

 Patrick Henry 

   

 God&apos;s
love can be matched by only one thing - His wrath. The ACLU and their supporters
will someday stand before the judgment seat of Christ. I look forward with
great anticipation to that day. Their sentence will be severe, and it will last
for all eternity. And friends - that is a long, long time. 

   

 For
the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness. Romans 1:18 

   

 But
in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring
up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
judgment of God, who will render to each one according to his deeds. Romans
2:5,6 

   

 God said it. I believe it.
And that&apos;s it. 

   

 Please pray for our troops
and their families - because they deserve our thanks and prayers. Pray for the
peace of Jerusalem, and our nations leaders because God said we should.
