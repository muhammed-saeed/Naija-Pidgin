Portion Distortion: Serving Sizes Are Growing

 Portions
 today are far bigger than in the past, which often means we&apos;re taking in far
 more calories than we realize

Larger plates, cup holders, muffin tins and pizza pans are
 becoming the norm. Fast food restaurants feature super sized meals for just
 a few cents more. Portion sizes of virtually all foods and beverages have increased
 and now appear typical.

A single meal may contain a day&apos;s worth of calories

Several studies published in 2003 document increases in
 portion sizes for many popular foods. This amounts to an additional 50-150 calories
 per meal.

So what&apos;s the big deal, you might ask. What&apos;s the harm of
 eating a few extra calories here and there? The answer is simple: An extra 10
 calories per day could add up to a pound of weight gain per year.

So, if you&apos;re consuming an extra 100 calories from soft
 drinks and snacks every day, you could pack on an extra 10 pounds of weight
 in a year.

Consider this

A small, two and a half ounce serving of french fries has
 210 calories, compared to a whopping 610 calories in the seven-ounce size. While
 a 12-ounce fountain soft drink contributes a relatively modest 150 calories
 to a meal, a mega size 42-ounce cup contributes 410 calories.

If you drink that huge soft drink and eat a giant hamburger
 with an extra large fries that contains as many as 1,000 calories - that would
 total about 2,000 calories in one sitting - more than many people need to eat
 in a single day!

Most marketplace portions are at least two times, and sometimes
 as much as eight times, greater than standard recommended serving sizes based
 on the USDA Food Guide Pyramid or on food label standards established by the
 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
 showed that when people buy large size bags of just about anything, they tend
 to eat more at one sitting, which can increase what they eat by up to 43 percent.

The following table shows just how much more people consume
 in a serving today compared to people in the 50s:

Serving Sizes Then and Now


 Food or beverage 1950s Expanded 2003 portion French fries   2.4 ounces   up to 7.1 ounces Fountain soda   7.0 ounces   12 to 64 ounces Hamburger patty   1.6 ounces   up to 8.0 ounces Hamburger sandwich   3.9 ounces   4.4 to 12.6 ounces Muffin   3.0 ounces   6.5 ounces Pasta serving   1.5 cups   3.0 cups Chocolate bar   1 ounce   2.6 to 8 ounces 



Researchers have found that people tend to eat most or all
 of what they are served, rather than taking leftovers home in a doggie bag.

Even at home, where we have control over how much we put
 on our plate, we are eating larger portions. Perhaps because we&apos;ve grown accustomed
 to the large portions served in restaurants and our perception of a serving
 size has changed.

A serious national health problem

More than 120 million Americans are either overweight or
 obese. The additional pounds Americans are piling on have had a devastating
 impact on our national health. Expanding portion sizes could contribute to this
 problem. So, cutting back on portion sizes in restaurants and at home is one
 way to lose weight or help prevent weight gain.

What you can do to manage your plate!

 Not sure what a portion size should be? Make sense
 of portion sizes by relating
 portions to common household objects .

 Learn to read food labels. Pay attention
 to the number of servings contained in the package, then note the
 calorie and fat content per serving. If the label on a large muffin,
 for example, says two servings: 250 calories and 10 grams of fat per
 serving, you will have consumed 500 calories and 20 grams of fat if
 you eat the entire muffin!

 Compare marketplace portions to recommended
 serving sizes. If you eat a marketplace portion of something -
 say a big bagel, compare its size to what&apos;s recommended on the food
 pyramid. A standard bagel is two ounces, and counts as two servings
 from the bread/cereal/grain food group. A marketplace bagel weighs
 nearly six ounces and counts as six servings of grain. A pasta dinner
 from your favorite restaurant might add up to six or more servings
 of grains as well. If you eat a 12-ounce piece of meat, you&apos;re consuming
 three ounces more than the recommended daily serving.

 Repackage supersize bags. Supersize bags
 may be more economical, but they can also encourage you to overeat.
 If you buy huge bags of chips or pretzels, for example, repackage
 the contents into smaller containers.

 Share a meal. Order a couple of appetizers
 and split one main course with another person when you go out for
 a meal. Split an order of fries. Order one dessert and some extra
 forks. Four people can enjoy a taste or two of a decadent dessert,
 without feeling guilty.

 Eat half or less. If you&apos;re not sharing
 a meal, eat half of what you&apos;re served and take the rest home to enjoy
 as another meal.

 Use a smaller plate. At home, serve your
 meals on smaller plates. Your plate will look full, but you&apos;ll be
 eating less.

 Skip second helpings. Eat one reasonable
 helping and don&apos;t go back for seconds. Don&apos;t put a big platter of
 food on the table. You&apos;re more likely to nibble and eat more than
 you realize.

 Slow down! Eat slowly, to allow yourself
 time to feel full so you won&apos;t be as tempted to heap on a second helping. 

If you have a hard time leaving food on your plate - remember
 that there are two ways to waste food: You can throw it out or carry it around
 as fat cells.

The first mistake was being served too much food. Don&apos;t
 compound that mistake by eating more than you need.
