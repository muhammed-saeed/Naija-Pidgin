WELCOME TO DOLLYWOOD; PARTON&apos;S AMUSEMENT PARK SINGS PRAISES OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS : ON LOCATION.

Byline: Robert Cross Chicago Tribune Chicago Tribune 

Daily newspaper published in Chicago. The Tribune is one of the leading U.S. newspapers and long has been the dominant voice of the Midwest. Founded in 1847, it was bought in 1855 by six partners, including Joseph Medill (1823–99), who made the paper

Unfortunately, some outsiders find it hard to feel at home down here. Pigeon Forge, as viewed from teeming teem 1

 2.  U.S. Highway 441, is a seemingly endless string of factory outlets, franchise restaurants, gift shops, Army surplus purveyors, chain motels and country-western music theaters.

Those commercial ventures probably mean well, but a certain category of traveler takes vacations to escape such places, preferring, say, a quiet lake to a Charlie Cheapo&apos;s discount store.

Still, that hickory-smoked Dolly Parton voice holds a certain allure. One almost can see the wink and the crooked finger that the voice implies: My Tennessee mountain home is just up the road. C&apos;mon by.

And soon enough, at traffic light No. 8, there it is: a big Dollywood billboard marking Dollywood Lane.

She grew up in these parts during the 1950s, and now she owns this place, so welcome to Dolly&apos;s nostalgia. For example, at the Sweet Dreams Candy Co. a sign provides an inkling as to where all this is going: ``Dolly loves candy, and she used to beg her sister Willadeene to make homemade candy every day. Dolly was so persistent that her sister used to say, `You&apos;ll just have to have sweet dreams, &apos;cause I&apos;m not making you any candy today.&apos;&apos;&apos;

The park used to be Silver Dollar City before Dolly put her name on it. The Silver Dollar&apos;s mountaineer motif remains. So you find long-rifles at the shooting range, a flume ride called Smoky Mountain Rampage and a wood-burning train that circles the park spreading secondhand smoke sec·ond·hand smoke

Fans march right past WDLY WDLY Widely  Radio Square, Aunt Granny&apos;s Dixie Fixins, Lid&apos;l Dolly Dresses and the Lucky 7 Mine to scrutinize the exhibits in Dolly&apos;s Museum.

But even in the museum, Dolly Parton&apos;s transition from poor little girl to big rich star is difficult to grasp.

Not far from there, just across the Dollywood Express tracks, visitors come upon the Tennessee Mountain Home, a replica of the two-room cabin where Dolly spent part of her childhood. The sign there says, ``These mountains and my childhood home have a special place in my heart. They inspire my music and my life. I hope being here does the same for you.&apos;&apos;

The message is clear: Go with the syrupy, sentimental flow. Picture a country girl with dreams and aspirations in a family poor as church mice - but, mind you, loving, God-fearing, proud and fiercely loyal.

Isn&apos;t this town called Dollywood the sort of place where you would want her to grow up? Isn&apos;t the W in Dollywood always represented by a butterfly because Dolly realized as a child that Monarch butterflies had a kind of magic dust on their wings and couldn&apos;t fly without it?

Over in Daydream Ridge, the little kids mess around in the Critter Creek Playground. Up in Craftsmen&apos;s Valley, people are making all sorts of things and selling them too: rustic furniture, wrought iron wrought iron:  see iron. wrought iron

The Village and the Country Fair are right next to each other. It&apos;s an easy walk from the Magic Shop and Mountain Laurel Mercantile in the Village to the Country Cookout Pavilion and the battling dodge-em cars of Dolly&apos;s Demolition Derby.

Adults have not been neglected. They line up at a ticket counter in Pigeon Forge and reserve seats for all the musical extravaganzas Dollywood schedules. The big names of country and western perform at the Celebrity Theatre. Other acts turn up at Back Porch Theatre, Valley Theatre, Wings of America Theatre and the Pines Theatre.

According to the Dollywood guidebook, those who turn up at the Heartsong Theatre (next door to the Whistlestop Grill) get nothing less than ``a unique multi-sensory musical/film experience&apos;&apos; where Dolly Parton&apos;s music and the magic of ``Naturound&apos;&apos; put them into a Smoky Mountain cove. There they hear, in narration and song, ``a powerful story about her deep feelings for family, friends, faith and values.&apos;&apos;

Dolly&apos;s theme park isn&apos;t entirely about uplift, of course. A new section combines the subtly decadent Dollywood Boulevard and its Silver Screen Cafe with the Pines Theatre (a rock &apos;n&apos; roll rock &apos;n&apos; roll:  see rock music.  venue), the 5&amp;Dime and several other shops evoking the &apos;50s - the store facades that might have been around during Dolly&apos;s teens.

There visitors can examine a collection of restored cars, including a Rolls-Royce on Dollywood Boulevard and the Fords and Chevys scattered around Red&apos;s Diner, Lee&apos;s Auto Parts (classic-car souvenirs), Cas Walker&apos;s (Coca-Cola memorabilia) and the &apos;50s-era automobile dealership that leads to the Rockin&apos; Roadway car track.

Dollywood provides just about any version of the old days that anyone might care to sample. We all know that Dolly has her naughty side, but her amusement park traces Wholesome Living all through the American centuries and it comes out as the other side as clean and pure and delicate as a butterfly&apos;s wings.

Dollywood is open on most days from early April through Dec. 31, but the schedule varies. It&apos;s best to write ahead (1020 Dollywood Lane, Pigeon Forge, Tenn. 37863-4101) or call (423) 428-9488.

The one-day daily admission includes everything except food, carnival games and celebrity concerts. Cost: 12 and over, $26.99; ages 4-11, $18.99; seniors 60 and up, $22.99. Parking is $4.
