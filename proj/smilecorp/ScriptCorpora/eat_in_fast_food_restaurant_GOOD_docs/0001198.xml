A West Roxbury teen allegedly attempted to rob a neighborhood McDonalds at gunpoint while his order for hash browns was being processed Saturday morning, police said.

Robert H. Bunszell was arrested after city officers said they followed snow shoeprints through woods behind the fast food restaurant on VFW Parkway to a back staircase of the 19-year-olds home, around 500 feet from the reported crime scene.

Police said they responded to the McDonalds around 7 a.m. Saturday and were told by witnesses a white male wearing jeans and a gray hooded sweatshirt ordered hash browns before pulling a handgun from his waistband while the order was being processed.

The suspect pointed a gun at the cashier and exclaimed Give me the money! according to police. As witnesses scrambled to call police, the man then threw the cash register to the ground before running empty-handed through woods behind the restaurant, officials said.

Witness reports, review of surveillance video, and shoe tracks left in the snow led police to a New Haven Street home where the homeowner, Bunszells mother, allowed officers to search, according to police.

There, police said they found Bunszell in his bedroom along with a pair of Nikes sneakers matching the prints and a gray hooded sweatshirt that matched witness reports and video of the suspect fleeing.

The teen was identified by a witness and then arrested for the attempted breakfast-time heist.

Officials said they later recovered a blue latex glove at the home. The glove matched another with clear plastic tape stuck to it that had been found earlier along the snow-print path. Both gloves were similar to ones worn by the suspect in surveillance video and witness reports, police said.

Police also reported finding a gun with clear plastic tape on the handle, a pair of jeans, and a roll of plastic tape during a subsequent, warranted search of the home.

Bunszell was charged with attempted armed robbery, malicious property destruction and unlawful firearm possession, police said.

A plea of not guilty was automatically entered. Assistant District Attorney Lindsey Weinstein recommended that he be held on $10,000 cash bail and have his open bail on an unrelated Dedham case revoked.

Judge Patricia Bernstein set bail at $5,000 and revoked the Dedham bail. Bunszell is due in court March 28.
