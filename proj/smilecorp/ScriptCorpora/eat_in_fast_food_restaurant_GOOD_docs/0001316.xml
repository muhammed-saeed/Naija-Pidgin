 LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Posted: Mar. 25, 2010 | 6:49 a.m.

A 23-year-old woman was shot and killed Thursday in the parking lot of the fast-food restaurant where she worked, a Las Vegas police spokesman said.

The slaying took place in the parking lot of a Jack in the Box restaurant at 7510 W. Lake Mead Blvd., near Buffalo Drive, about 6 a.m., officer Marcus Martin said.

He said witnesses reported the woman was arguing with an unknown man in the parking lot when he shot her in the head. The suspect is still at large.

Homicide Lt. Lew Roberts said that the slaying was believed to have been a domestic dispute.

&quot;According to co-workers, she had some relationship problems,&quot; Roberts said.

Roberts said the woman&apos;s ex-boyfriend is &quot;definitely a person of interest&quot; in the case.

The woman, who was not identified, was transported to University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he said.

LVRJ doesn&apos;t do it&apos;s homework. The news stories are incredibly weak with information. This same story was on LV Now Channel 8 KLAS news site with much more information. http://www.lasvegasnow.com/global/story.asp?s=12202132
Nevadas only newspaper, whose reporters get their facts from wire feeds.

Not a bad area, but apparently a bad relationship.

In ANY city in America, if you are on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Blvd, Lane, Road, etc... you are in a bad neighborhood.

You can make book on that.
