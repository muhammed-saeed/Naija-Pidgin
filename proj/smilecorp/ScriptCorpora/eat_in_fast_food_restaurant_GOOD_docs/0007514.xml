It appears that RFID technology is now a firm player in border control. The Monitor reports that Brownsville, Texas, is the latest of several border cities to open a Ready Lane for those passing through.”Travelers with RFID-enabled travel documents, such as a passport card, passport, permanent resident ID or a SENTRI card, can hold up their cards to a sensor, which will send the information to primary inspection.”Furthermore, the RFID signal from any additional passngers in the vehicle will be picked up as well.  With the Gateway International Bridge boasting some 2.5 million passengers each year, this new ease of passsage should certainly come as good news. However, there are security queries around the concern for speed. Whatever the case, Brownsville is actually the 12th port of entry to introduce the Ready Lane, and it appears that no security concerns have arisen so far from the other border bridges.

 ATM’s move into biometrics and contactless technology. 

At VM World 2011 last week in Las Vegas, Diebold demonstrated a prototype ATM with NFC and biometric security . The ATM’s will feature thumbprint biometric authentification as well as NFC based mobile banking support.  Since ATM’s are hit so regularly by credit and banking card skimming, this will come as good news for the general public. As well this, Diebold have a“virtualized ATM”ready to launch in partnersip with VMWare, which“…takes ATM management software out of the end unit and puts it in a server responsible for multiple units.”All of this means two things for clients, greater convenience, and greater security.

 Buddy Fraud 

 Thirdfactor reports that payroll suffers up to a 5% loss from“buddy punching”:…”the act of hourly employees punching someone in or out when they are not at work.”With the cost of biometric systems falling, the arguments for moving payroll operations to such systems are strong. In fact, these systems have already been implemented in the fast food restaurant arena by Popeye’s Chicken and Biscuits . Using Digital Persona, employees now have to clock in and out using fingerprint readers. With the restaurant chain already enjoying increased sales and improved accountability, biometrics in payroll certainly looks like a winner.

 Credit Card Skimming Becomes an Epidemic 

We first started to see mention of pay-at-the-pump credit card skimming a year or so ago. Just recently, a spate of debit and credit card number theft has spanned the distance from Florida to Texas. A piece by Gov Info Security reports that pump skimming is becoming more sophisticated, and is an ever growing threat. The National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), says that the skimming trends have become nearly epidemic. The skimming devices are installed“inside the terminal enclosures”, making them virtually undetectable. Hot spot and tourist destinations in Florida became such a concern that state police urged consumer to forego paying at the pump altogether, and pay inside with cash instead. This is a huge step back for the U.S. gas pump method, and strongly suggests that something is required to redesign the pay-at-the-pump method altogether.

 The Future of Mobile 

The world is getting used to being amazed by new technologies appearing and unfolding in our lives. So what can we expect next? It appears that the next big push will be concentrated around the mobile phone. Nokia Conversations blogs that augmented reality, contactless payments, and voice biometrics are to top the table. With our phones now as (if not more so) inseparable and imperative to us as our watches, it’s easy to see how delivery of the things we want and need is now occurring.  Convenience, security, and instant gratification are the necessary ingredients to our embracing of future tech.

 Ear Biometrics 

We already know that biometrics takes new strides almost every day. We can be identified by our fingerprints, our faces, our irises, even our gait. Now, in a recent article in Gizmodo, it’s claimed that we can also be identified by our ears. Did you hear that? Yes, it’s possible that the next time your ears are burning, someone really is talking about you, as well as which the contours of your ear are being assessed by a”new shape-finding algorithm called“image ray transform,”which boasts 99.6 percent accuracy, according to a study presented at the IEEE Fourth International Conference on Biometrics Sept. 29.”

It is urged to consider this new technology as a supplement to those biometrics already in place, especially since certain factors make the method difficult, like hair covering the ear. Personally, I would have thought that anyone concerned about being recognised by their ears should simply listen to their mother, and wear a nice wooly hat to keep their head warm.
