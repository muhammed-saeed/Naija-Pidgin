 5 stars...and I am not even Vegan!. Okay, my girlfriend is but this place is amazing! I defy you to find a healthier, better tasting meal for the prices there, seriously.

 Chicken what? Chicken who?. Chickens needn&apos;t run for cover in the vicinity of Native Foods, a quick-service vegan restaurant that can turn even a carnivore&apos;s head. While the Westwood eatery is famous among UCLA students for its sweet potato fries, the Ensalada Azteca with fresh avocado, cucumber and jicama salsa, quinoa, romaine, currants, toasted pumpkin seeds, cilantro, and mango lime vinaigrette ($9.95), is what keeps me coming back. With the addition of blackened tempeh, this hearty salad could easily go head to head with a medium rare rib-eye. Or, at the very least, convince a meat-lovin&apos; gal to give her steak knife a break. …

 REVIEW FROM CITYSEARCH&apos;s 3BUCKBITES DICTATOR. Being vegan doesn&apos;t always mean tofu and celery sticks - at least not with Native Foods&apos;sweet potato fries. This vegan-food-only restaurant is bound to cheer you up whether you&apos;re a plant eater or not, with pictures of friendly animals on the napkin dispensers and signs asking you to kindly leave your milk products at home. The sweet potato fries are a new creation and not yet on the menu, and while less sweet than others I&apos;ve had, they are made from fresh sweet potatoes and are crispy and delicious: the perfect snack to make you feel better about the world. …

 flavorful vegan. along w/ RAW and RFD, this place is definitely up there in terms of serving up the most tasty&apos;vegan&apos;organic healthy cuisine. it&apos;s fairly small and the decor is nothing to talk about&amp;there&apos;s no parking (as it IS in westwood)&amp;they don&apos;t deliver, but for me to put up w/ all the above suggests that the food might be the only thing that actually makes up for all that it lacks, and it does. even my friends who don&apos;t like &apos;vegan&apos; or healthy food have all raved about this place, so that says a lot. …

 LOVE this place.. Being a vegetarian, I am always on the lookout for good places to eat, and this one is definitely my top so far. I have never had a bad meal here...and for the carnivores, the fake chicken actually tastes like chicken (no joke), maybe even better. I love their bowls. The service is great, the people are so friendly, and the atmosphere is very fun. If you haven&apos;t tried Native Foods yet, go! …
