 Is there a difference between an idiot and a genius? 

12/21/2011 Michaele Duke
 
A wise old, er, middle-aged sage (Beth Jonte) recently said there is a fine line between an idiot and a genius. Her submission was in response to my claim to observations that have lead me to question whether or not we are all a bunch of idiots.
As I told her, I’ve been watching, with great interest mind you, the subtle goings on around our county and this country. And I am not thrilled with what I have witnessed thus far.
I’m not talking about counting back change (that is near the bottom of my list of simple things somewhat intelligent people can’t do), I’m talking about glaringly obvious things–like how to stand in line….
Did you know at one time a local fast-food restaurant had sets of‘foot prints’on the floor leading to each cash register? I suspect the purpose of this strategy was to show customers where to stand in line. Are you kidding me? Am I so dumb that I must follow an illustration directing me to stand‘behind the person in front of me’in order to order?
Lets be frank. Some people simply prefer to break in line and footprints aren’t going stop that. Maybe a good kick in the pants, or better, a lesson in manners would make a bigger difference than clown shoes dancin’down the isle.
Idiocy can occur on a much more subtle level. Take for instance the confusion brought about by my propensity for preferring my personal coffee cup to its Styrofoam counterpart. The reason I choose to tote my own cup into a restaurant is simple - I layer the bottom with“enhancements”such as chocolate syrup (or whatever comes close, as long as its chocolate) and whipped topping. I fill the cup with the restaurant’s brew and place it on the counter, change in hand.“Sixty five cents,”the nice lady says and sets a Styrofoam cup beside my foam filled, piping hot Marine Corps emblazoned mug. Need I say more? Ok, ok…she was doing her job…
True idiocy, however, makes headlines at the corporate level everyday. For istance, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg seems to think we don’t have an illegal alien problem, saying almost nobody is coming across the Mexican border. Huh? When was the last time he checked out the underfunded efforts of DEA agents on our borders? I wonder f he has ever watched the show titled“Cops and Coyotes”that airs on the I.D. channel? If he has, does he consider the program make believe?
Bloomberg wants to reward illegal aliens (some who are part of the worst of the worst–the drug cartels) by giving them a free education so they can become entrepreneurs - who will hire Americans. It doesn’t matter that the unemployment rate in this country is at 9 percent and a lot of‘legal’entrepreneurs are out of jobs.
I find it equally hard to grasp how Jon Corzine, former CEO of Goldman Sachs and more recently CEO of M.F. Global, for the life of him, cannot figure out how 1.2 billion (yes, billion) of investors’money just up and disappeared. You’d think this man, who also was a U.S. senator and New Jersey governor, is supposed to know what he is doing. Mr. Corzine is currently stumbling his way through a congressional hearing. Like Beth said, there is a fine line between an idiot and a genius. However, that line is becoming thinner and thinner with each passing day.
