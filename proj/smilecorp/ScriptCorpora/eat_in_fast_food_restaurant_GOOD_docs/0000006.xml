 Blue plate special is or was the special of the day, actually the cheapest meal of the day served in restaurants. Don&apos;t really think they use the term any more.
Began around the 1920&apos;s, it would usually be put on a different color plate, not always blue, at least by the 50&apos;s, but maybe it was blue back in the 20&apos;s, quite a bit before my time, so can&apos;t know exactly about that.
Tray service is where you take a tray and go to an area like a cafeteria and you pick up your own food, like in schools, and sit down and eat. You don&apos;t have any waitress service.

 OK,&quot;Lochmessy&quot;is wayyyyy off!!!

What she thinks is tray service is actually self-service or buffet service. And her blue plate&quot;special&quot;is correct but not the information you need (I&apos;m sure.)

Tray service is when practically EVERYTHING (but your food) you want is brought to you on a tray. Your drink, an extra plate, ketchup, a salt shaker, ANYTHING, is brought to you on a tray. This is also known as french service.

Blue plate service is casual dining service. Where proper serving techniques are not enforced, your plates are yelled out and when you hear yours, you raise your hand to your server to let them know it&apos;s yours.
