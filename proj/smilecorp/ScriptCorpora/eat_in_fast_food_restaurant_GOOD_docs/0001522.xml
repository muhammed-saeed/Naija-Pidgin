 Most places like that will do a drug test. Oh by the way,the Urinalysis is a thing of the past. Most companies will have you go to a clinic where your hair will be plucked out with the root attached(they get to do it).
This way they can tell what drugs you&apos;ve been using for the last ten years.

 Just hide in a toilet and collect samples.

 Don&apos;t do drugs and you won&apos;t have to worry.

 I think they drug test to make sure you are hi. That is a job requirement- you must be hi to work there.
