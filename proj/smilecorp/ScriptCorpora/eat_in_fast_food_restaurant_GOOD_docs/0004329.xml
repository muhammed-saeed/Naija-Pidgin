Amazon.com, a review of the A to Z guarantee program and how consumers are fraudulantly getting free items!

 This is my complaint and why I won’t sell anything on there ever again! 
 




By now pretty much everyone and anyone has heard of Amazon.com.  Basically it’s the new eBay.  You can buy just about anything you want from books to college books and textbooks to clothes, CDs, DVDs and more.  It is very consumer friendly, easy to use and more reliable than eBay.  So what’s the problem and why is this a complaint?

Well I used to be a seller of items on both eBay and Amazon.com.  I was only a small seller on these sites and was primarily an Internet and brick-and-mortar retailer.  From time to time I used eBay to test products on and see what was popular or hot and what was not. Just by perusing either eBay or Amazon.com in just a few minutes you can ascertain as to what products have a whole lot of people wanting them or desiring and purchasing them.

A lot of nowhere, Amazon.com came out of this aid is he guaranteed program that hundred percent favors the consumer.  Then eBay decided to follow this because Amazon is taking too much of their business and repeat the same guarantee just under a different name.  The problem with the guarantee and what Amazon.com is not telling you is that there is a 20% fraud rate across the board.  What this means is that consumers, a lot of them learning this from forums and other people, have figured out how to abuse these guarantee programs like the A-Z guarantee program from Amazon.





What happens in these cases of abuse is that these consumers are shipped the item that they ordered and it comes in the condition it was reported to be in (99% of sellers on Amazon.com are honest, straightforward and reliable sellers), the problem is upon receipt of the item the consumer automatically files and A-Z guarantee claim stating that the item arrived broken, not working, faked, etc…It doesn’t matter what the seller states in their response or what shipping and tracking confirmatons they can prove.   100% uptime Amazon.com finds for the consumer.

What that means for the seller is you’re basically screwed.  Sometimes Amazon.com makes them return the item to the seller, but in 99% of these cases they return an empty box or a worthless  item that they were never shipped in the first place.  For instance, I shipped a brand-new DVD box of the complete next generation Star Trek series.  When it left the shipping point it was brand-new and never opened and sealed.  The customer stated in their A-Z claim that I shipped to them a beat up Bible.

 Been taken advantage of? Want to get even? Leave your own complaints and reviews here on ReportYourComplaint.com and help others avoid businesses and companies with which you’ve had terrible experiences! 

That was a complete lie and fabrication.  Guess what?  Amazon.Com had them send me back a beat up Bible that they must’ve gotten from Goodwill or some other place probably for free or 50 cents.   There was nothing I could do about it.  What ended up here is the customer got a free $100 DVD box set and I was out everything on that transaction.  Now you can say,“okay maybe this is just one instance and it’s not happening very often.”Quite the contrary, it’s running at about 20% and growing.   Just ask any significant seller on Amazon.com and they will tell you the truth is it runs about a 20% fraud rate.
 
Consumer fraud rates hit upwards of 20% or more on Amazon.com as consumers are learning to abuse the A to Z guarantee program in droves!
 
Now for bigger sellers that sell millions of items and make millions of dollars in profits it’s just like click fraud in Internet advertising you just have to take that into account and it’s a part of doing business with Amazon.  The problem is if your small seller and the only sell a few items or a couple hundred items even you could really get hurt by this.  Now according to Amazon a person can only file five of these A-Z claims per account.  So once someone files five claims they’re done, right?  Wrong!  All they do is open up another and another and another account n Amazon.com.

Some people are getting thousands of dollars worth of free items just by doing this.  They have multiple accounts and they’re using left and right to file fraudulent A-Z guarantee claims to get free items.  What Amazon.com is done is created a legion of freeloaders and this will come back to bite them in the end as with all businesses they just don’t realize it yet.  I stopped selling on Amazon.com and close my selling account once I realized the multiple account fraudulent claim filings.  It was easy to spot because you would have 10 orders in one day for the same item from 10 different account names and have the exact same word for word response for each and every A-Z guarantee claim which each of those 10 orders would file.  And on top of that they were all filed one right after the other.  Now you tell me is that fraudulent activity?




 Your Ad Here 


If you ask Amazon they say they have the lowest rates of incidence of fraud of any company out there.  It’s just like eBay when they were bigger than Amazon.  If you inquired with eBay asked him how much fraud activity occured on their website they would tell it was a very small amount less than 1%. Now the funny thing here is, if you go to the FBI website and research a little bit you will find out that according to the FBI 50% of the items sold on eBay have some kind of fraud attached to them from their being stolen, to being purchased with stolen credit cards, etc.

So my complaint, as a previous seller on Amazon.com, is that the A-Z guarantee program is full of fraudulent activity mostly on behalf of the consumer and it is creating a large group of people that know exactly how to get free items and take advantage of companies.  So if you’re looking to sell stuff I would highly advise you do it somewhere other than Amazon.com because you will get ripped off by fraudulent buyers possibly enough of them to make it so you are actually losing money right off the bat.  The above mentioned items are not meant to show people how to get free items on Amazon.com, is instead meant to highlight and bring to attention the fraud that’s proliferating and growing on on Amazon.com.

Wow this is a great resource.. I’m enjoying it.. good article on how to get free stuff from Amazon.com! I had heard a little about this here and there, but this put it all together. I am now going to put this to use and get some free stuff–maybe I can resell it on Ebay and make a living at it? What do you think?

I don’t see what scams you guys are talking about. I have bought numerous items through Amazon.com and never had a problem. I just bought my Spanish textbook at a great deal ($40 delivered) and it came within 8 days as described. I buy all my college textbooks through Amazon and save huge–I usually save around $300 per semester on books! So, no, I don’t see the fraud you are talking about. Also, how do you get items for free through Amazon.com? I would like to know.

I think Amazon.com is great. I buy my textbooks from there every semester for my classes in college and I and the saving usually between 50 and 75% off the campus bookstore prices. I probably save some words around $500-$600 per semester on textbooks. Plus I also bought my North face backpack on there for about half off.

I have known about this for quite some time and have used this along with my 13 accounts to get lots of free stuff through Amazon. I tend to target pricier stuff ($100 to $200) or so range. My favorite thing to do is file a A to Z claim and report that I received something other than what was ordered.

I can pick any trash item I want like a matchbox car or something and Amazon will require that I return the item to the seller. Once the seller has received the item and Amazon confirms the tracking and delivery information I am immediately refunded. I only pay for shipping which is a few bucks and the seller is out their item and there ain’t anything they can do about it.

I have used this method to get a free laptop, desktop computer, server, tons of software, DVD box sets, collectibles and more. Once one account has used up its 5 A to Z claims I just go and open another. It is so easy to do and its basically free stuff! I love Amazon and I love the fact that I haven’t had to pay for 1 item yet.

Didn’t you know that Amazon.com is the new evil? They are trying to become like Google and get their hands in everything. From cloud computing to handheld readers like the Amazon Kindle to who knows what. I think there will be some antitrust legislation in the near future for Amazon. As these companies, when they get too big like Amazon.com is now, stifle competition and cause increased prices and lowering of quality of both products and services to consumers. Does anyone know if the FTC or Atty. Gen.’s office has started to act on or take action on Amazon.com for these or similar problems or violations?

The A-Z guarantee on Amazon.com favors buyers not sellers. This is the way it’s been since it started. It’s sellers don’t like that they need to go elsewhere like eBay. Or they can sell in the local craigslist or at local flea markets. I like Amazon.com because I can get the things that I want at the prices that I want and reliably and quickly. I have used Amazon.com for years and never had a problem.
