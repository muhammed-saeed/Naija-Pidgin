 Dear Dave, 
 Dave,
       I received my order yesterday. Those Ham Hocks are
       just like The Rogers Company use to make. The only
       hocks we can get around here are Hormel brand, and
        I wouldn&apos;t feed them to a dog. You should contact the
       grocery chain Market Basket in New England. They
      sell the Hormel Brand now, but used to sell the Roger
       brand. I&apos;m sure they would carry your product. Next
      order I&apos;m going to try the Tavern Style.
       EXCELLENT PRODUCT

Thanks,
Chuck D.
 


Gentlemen: I have ordered from you previosly and just great things happen at your place. Delicious.
Norman G., Putnam CT
 

 Thanks for the replacement pickled sausages; my family, friends and I are enjoying them very much. I ordered the HOT Horseradish for a co-worker and she likes it very much too. 

 You probably hear stories like this pretty often but the pickled sausages taste and smell just like the ones I got in the 1950&apos;s and 60&apos;s when my dad took us kids along to the Deli. We also used to get pickled eggs and another type of pickled sausage that looked like maybe your pickled kielbasa. I think I will order the pickled eggs, kielbasa and some mustard next. 

 Thanks again for the great products and excellent customer service. 

 Don Hobbs


 Great pickled eggs and great service! Always a dependable seller! Thank you!!! Marty Bowman, MT

Fast Shipping and a great product. Long Lake Lakeside Foods never ceases to satisfy! It is amazing how fast you ship your products. Pete, Fairfax, VA

 Hi Dave, Just wanted you to know your shipment arrived, and I tried one of your Premium Pork Hocks. I enjoyed it very much. I am from Illinois and we can&apos;t find pork hocks out here in the west, so I will be re-ordering again when I begin to run out. All the best out your way. Mike M. - Boise, Idaho -

Hello Long Lake Foods,
I got my package today in good conditon and very timely. I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed the Long Lake Spicy Pickled Sausages! I used to buy Rogers products but they went out of business so I am glad I found you on the internet. I also tried your Long Lake pickled pork hocks and they were really good too! Thanks for the great service and delicious pickled foods.
Kent P. Sturbridge, MA

With no &apos;funny&apos; ingredients! These are WAY better than the pickled sausages I got at the corner grocery when I was a kid. I like the hot ones even better.  R. Arant Jr. Seattle, WA 

Hello!
I ordered the 8 oz jars of your Lakeside Red Hot Pickled Sausage&amp;Bayview Mild Pickled Sausage&amp;they were EXCELENT!!
So this time I&apos;m trying the Porkie Pickled Kielbasa Sausage. 
The Lakeside Red Hots were good, but they were just alittle TOO hot for me. I wished you had the 8 oz jar of Lakeside Mild available. Anyway, I hope the Porkie Mild are just as good if not better than the other sausages I&apos;ve tried. I&apos;d order the Porkie Red Hot, but they too might be alittle too hot; if you sold them in an 8 oz jar, I&apos;d love to buy it, just to try them out.
Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
Terry Wilcox


Fantastic pickled eggs, the best I have ever had! Great job shipping those glass jars all the way to CA. Fred Loral

I have succeeded in getting my father to switch from junk food to Pickled Herring for his night time snack  ! 
Thank you for having such a seriously high quality Herring that it reminds him of his youth in the Northern Michigan and doing so at a price that lets me feed his Pickled Herring addiction. Eric G.


Great pickled eggs, the red hots were to hot for my taste but my husband loved them. The regular eggs are a piece of heaven. Thanks for getting them to us so quickly. Have a great week.
Rhonda Howser

Fast shipping and great pickled turkey gizzards. I took Dave&apos;s advice and gave them a try. I was looking for the Rogers Company Pickled Lambs Tongue and gave you people a call. Dave explained that pickled lambs tongue was not available anymore and suggested I give the pickled turkey gizzards a try. I also ordered the Lakeside Premium Pork Hocks and wow, what a treat. Thanks for the quick&amp;friendly service.
Justin l. Boston, MA

Fast and accurate. Best horseradish and mustard you can buy. Gary D. Fredericksburg, VA

Red Hot Pickled Eggs that are hard to find in my area. Quik ship&amp;reasonable price. Thanks!  Mary R. Dunkirk, NY

Excellent Seller! Quite the tasty Bayview Pickled Turkey Gizzards! We&apos;re loving them! Thank you!!!!  Rich W., Harrisburg, PA

Do you make pickled lambs tonques? I used to buy them under the Rogers Band name.  Evelyn A.
Answer: The Rogers Co. was the last to make pickled lambs tongue. We have been unable to find anyone tha currently makes pickled lambs tongue commercially.

Just wanted to let you know we really enjoyed the spicy pickled pork rinds, I have not seen these in years.
Frederick A. - Arizona 
 Add me to your e-mail list if you ever offer free shipping or discount product sales. I&apos;ve ordered your products several times through Amazon (both Bayview and Lakeside), in retail outlets up north when traveling on vacation, and also on E-bay.  In Florida, I do not think that people are even familiar with picked pork products except for pigs feet that are perceived as gross by most.   When I lived in MN years ago, the only pickled products that were available on a retail basis were peer and then later posh until I believe they went belly up. When I compare the quality of your products to those that I use to purchase through these companies, I would say that it is like comparing the dollar menu at a fast food restaurant compared to items available at places known for fine dining. I am sharing your pickled pork hocks with newbies from Florida and much to my surprise, my friends seem to really enjoy your product.  If you package pickled pork hocks as fresh and something new gourmet item, I believe that you will find a new base of consumers and I will be one happy consumer knowing that can find this product on the shelf in FL instead of having to order online and pay for shipping.    
Happy Holidays! Marie 
 Lightning-fast shipment. Thank you! Nicole F. COLUMBUS, IN 

Perfect Transaction As Always !!!! Ultimate Packaging == Very Nice Dave !!!! Wallace G.

Super fast shipping and Awesome packaging...Super Seller!!!!!!! Terra L.

Dave, The box got here intact and very little seepage, a little damp on one jar of eggs. Had to try the mustard right away and it is really good with the pickeled egg. And just the right degree of&quot;hot&quot;. They will be good in various salads with a touch of homemade icicle pickels to sweeten it up and honey mustard to spice it up - smart salesman! Hope your lake is full (but not TOO full) and clear. Have a beautiful summer, Lou Ella

Thanks for the fast s/h. Ate a jar of the hot pickled eggs with a couple beers as soon as they arrived. EXCELLENT! Looking forward to trying some of your other products in the coming months.Thanks again,Mike D. 


 I just opened the well packaged container.
They are SOOOOO good.
I am impressed the way the turkey flavor is maintained in the centers. The&quot;no need for refrigeration&quot;is another plus (although i will refrigerate them).
A search for&quot;pickled turkey gizzards&quot;reveals so many&quot;yuks&quot;from thems(those) that (whom) has(have) never tasted.
I expected much less and would have been satisfied or even pleased with such.
Well balanced vinegar, salt content IMHO.
&apos;Gizzards of Ozz&apos; is a description well deserved.
Thanks Dave.
Mike T.

Dave, just wanted to let you know that I received my order today and yes
indeed the pickled eggs are wonderful!
Thanks,

I ordered the Polish Sausage for my husband who is Polish. He loves them as it was something he used to eat when he was a kid. I couldn&apos;t find them locally so I went on line to order. He loves them and it brought back many memories for him. In fact, I reordered another jar. Lillian, Danvers, MA

 Pickled Meats and Eggs

 Pork Feet: We use only long-cut pigs feet, which means
each foot is meatier and contains a portion of the hock.

 Pork Hocks: Our full pork hocks are special ordered. We
sort and select only those hocks which meet our high standards, are hand trimmed, final inspected, and packed.

 Polish Sausage: Our pickled polish sausage are made with the finest cuts of beef and pork for a perfect blend of flavor with a deep smoked coloring. Our blends of spices and brine enhance the flavor- not too hot, not too mild!

 Turkey Gizzards: This oriental delicacy is made with natural Grade A gizzards, pickled in a special brine sauce which enhances the flavor of this meaty product for your dining pleasure.

 Pickled Eggs: We use only fresh Grade A Large eggs, hard boiled, peeled, after highly controlled cooking, and processed with our pickling brine. This assures quality for your enjoyment.

 Pickled Herring: Long LakeFoods Herring is the finest imported herring in the world. They are harvested from the cold, clear waters of the Atlantic, which produces a firm but delicate filet.

 Wine Sauce Herring: This herring is prepared with wine sauce, fresh cut onions, and a blend of spices, making it a popular seller all year-round.

 Sour Cream Herring: Our sour cream herring is a hand-packed tasty treat, made only with pure Wisconsin dairy sour cream, fresh cut onions, and seasonings.
