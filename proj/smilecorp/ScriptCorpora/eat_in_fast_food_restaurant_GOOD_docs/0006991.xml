 I work part time as a cashier at this fast food restaurant. By rude customers I mean people who have no real reason to complain, but are shouting/lecturing at me because they had a bad day and want to put all that anger on someone. Seriously, I don&apos;t deserve to be embarassed for a stupid thing just because you had a bad day. Learn to respect others and have good manners in public.  

For customers/those who haven&apos;t worked in customer service, I want to let you all know that employees greatly appreciate it when you say things like &quot;have a nice day&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot; because you don&apos;t know how many nitpicking, overly selective and verbally abusive people we have to face everyday.  

Today I had the worst customer ever. First he and his friend complained because the &quot;service was slow&quot;. Yes there was a long line up, but like I said I&apos;m the ONLY person in front. All my co-workers are doing drive thru. So I think you would be more compassionate noticing how I&apos;m struggling to make food/drink orders by MYSELF to a long lineup.

He then complains because I didn&apos;t cash the order before I went to make his drink. WHY is that an issue? Seriously? UGH..And he was lecturing at me in front of a long line of people about being bad server because I left the front to make his drink??

Seriously, why was this person who looked like he was in his 20s dressed up as a gangster (probably never graduated high school) lecturing/humiliating me in front of a dozen people waiting, about how to do my job properly?? Seriously?? I&apos;m a University student just doing my job so I can support my education/living. I don&apos;t deserve to be lectured with insults for ONE TINY THING that isn&apos;t even a big deal. WHATEVER.

 The rude doesn&apos;t even get to me as much anymore as the downright ignorant. Had a man come in the other day and tell my co-worker he can&apos;t talk to her because she&apos;s a woman. He said it out loud. Like that&apos;s an acceptable thing to say. Then on his way out, he said &quot;thanks for your help, you just didn&apos;t want to get involved in that!&quot;

Um. Kill yourself.

 I had one asshole during my 9 month run because my boss would NOT tolerate that kind of thing. People can be ridiculous .

 I feel like this deserves a bump because I&apos;ve experienced some extremely rude customers today. It&apos;s so embarassing and disgusting to see adult people act with absolutely zero class and manners in public.

 I hate when people are rude to service people as well. I&apos;ve encountered more rude service people than customers (I&apos;ve worked in retail and didn&apos;t really have that many rude people) but one unnecessarily rude person can ruin your day.

Even if you get bad service, tell a manager. Eventually you have to grow up and stop the name calling and voice raising. There are proper channel&apos;s to handle this stuff.

 I&apos;ve never worked as a cashier myself, but I always try to make sure I - as a customer - say &quot;Thank you&quot; to a cashier (whether it&apos;s at the grocery store, a fast food joint, the movie theater, the waiter/waitress at a restaurant, wherever), and if they say to me something like &quot;Have a nice day,&quot; I&apos;m also sure to make sure I say &quot;You too,&quot; and give them a smile.

I&apos;ve found that sometimes, just that little gesture can mean a lot to some people

 I&apos;ve never worked in retail or food service but I know all about rude people. I&apos;ve worked in fundraising/customer support my entire job career. I&apos;ve worked customer service for AT&amp;T;and for Linden Lab, which I currently do. Have you guys ever heard of Second Life?

 They are pretty bad, but I also find them hilarious... the more pissed off they are the funnier I find it. That being said if they had an actual reason to be pissed i&apos;d be more sympathetic but when it&apos;s over something they are clearly in the wrong it&apos;s so ridiculous.

 The more demanding and rude someone is, the less likely I am to help. I make it literally impossible for them to get what they want. But if someone is nice and very understanding and they&apos;re asking for a favor or make an exception, I am more than happy.

 Oh and also, you should&apos;ve gone with &quot;I&apos;m sorry you feel that way, sir, but you are more than welcome to apply for an open position and show me how I should do it.&quot;

That&apos;s exactly how I am. I wish more people realized that that&apos;s how it works.

 I work in my family&apos;s feed store/gas station/green house/everythingyoucouldthinkof and today I had a customer yell at me because there&apos;s tax on bird feed, like it&apos;s my fault and mine alone that NYS charges tax on bird feed. I mean really. For the most part I keep my cool and kill them with kindness but there&apos;s some days that it&apos;s so hard. Today was one of those days.



And I&apos;d like to add to whoever said we appreciate a have a nice day or a please/thank you--- it really means more than you know. I think it is the rudest thing when customers bark orders at you like you&apos;re a dog... &quot;Gimme so and so&quot; without a please following. Also, when someone says &quot;have a nice day&quot; the proper response is not &quot;yep&quot;.

Yeah! They can yell and scream all they want. Call corporate if you really want to. I&apos;m not going to be belittled at a flippin&apos; retail job so I can get through college.  
 I always think about it this way... what if I was THEIR 22 year old child working behind that counter? Do you want them to be spoken to that way by complete strangers?

EXACTLY. I chose a career where I would not have to deal with customers or people for that matter because the 6 years that I had to scarred me for life.

 My favorite thing to do is volunteer to get the manager before they even ask. Like 90% of the time people make the connection that if I&apos;m offering to get the manager myself, they&apos;re obviously not going to win.
