 July 2012 $42 Very typical KOA with all expected amenities. Glad to have solid 50 amp service when temps are over 100F. Has good shade and very pet friendly. New management since our last visit. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2012 $46 Our GPS led us through the Badlands State Park. At first we were remiss that we had to pay the 15.00 dollars to get to the campground, but it was well worth it. The scenery just outside the campground is breathtaking. The sites were large and the trees ( the only trees within 50 miles) made the campground that much more comfortable. The staff was very nice. We would camp here again if we were in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2012 $42 This is our first KOA. We were extremely pleased with the friendly staff and managers. We had site 2 which was an adequate pull through for 35&apos; travel trailer and pickup. Plenty of shade. This a very family friendly park with lots for the kids to do. We didn&apos;t use the cable TV or Wi-Fi all that much as we spent the time touring the Badlands and Wall Drug. The location is a little off the beaten path, we drove through the Badlands to finally arrive at the CG, but once we were there we decided to stay an extra 2 nights. It would have been very peaceful except for a thunderstorm with hail and high winds (no fault of the CG). We would stay here again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2012 $40 Great area in the badlands. Close to park and badlands but nestled in an quiet pretty setting. Friendly helpful hosts with adequate grocery and gift store. Skip the breakfast. Not very good and cold coffee! But otherwise great stay and would stay here again. Cell phones do not work in campground, but can get reception if you hike up to road. Also Internet reception intermittent. Nice pool, laundry, playground, and pet areas. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2012 $45 This park was OK; not great, not horrible. The cable was our biggest disappointment. There were only 12 channels, and I think we paid extra for it (but I could be wrong). The Wi-Fi was rather weak at our site. The pool was full of cottonwood seeds, but our grandson enjoyed it anyway. The park is further back than we anticipated, but no problem. We enjoyed the area very much. We thought this park was way overpriced for what we got. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2011 $46 This was a great campground. The folks were nice and escorted us to our site. It also had a dog run as well as nice facilities. It had many trees which made for a pretty campground and lots of shade. It was a good campground for visiting the Badlands which is about 5 miles down the road. We would use this campsite again! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2011 $42 Very nice KOA facility. All was fine until I noticed unauthorized charges appearing on my credit card. The lady in charge was very mean and nasty when I requested that the erroneous charges be removed. The charges were removed, but I was asked to leave the park in a very mean and rude fashion. I must caution all to watch for unauthorized charges on the credit card given this facility. When questioned as to the basis for asking me to leave, I was told they could ask me to leave for no reason or if they just didn&apos;t like me. The management at this park is in severe need of customer service training. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2011 $45 This was our second stay here in a year. This is a very well maintained campground with lots of much appreciated shade trees. The kids enjoyed the pool, bike rentals and the play ground. The Indian tacos for dinner were a hit again this time. We would definitely stay here again when travelling through the area. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2011 $44 Rate reflects 50 amp site and tax. This is a nice campground, for sure, but KOA&apos;s are always more expensive than most. The Wi-Fi was generally good, but bogged down in the evening. There were about 13 cable channels provided with our site (#76) and we had shade which was nice. Our kids are grown, but this would be a great place to bring kids with so many activities in the park. I asked a guy about the laundry room and he said it was fine, but really hot in there, so I decided not to do laundry. Also, there are MAJOR mosquitoes here due to the proximity to the river, I assume. It was very quiet and all of the big cottonwood trees provide a lot of shade. The 50 amp sites are along the back of the park and close to the dog run and laundry. Our ATT phones did not really work and our Verizon MiFi didn&apos;t either. However, once you get near Rapid City, they both worked very well. Probably the nicest and most quiet park in the area with shade. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2011 $46 We stayed just one night, but enjoyed it. Nicely kept place, lots of shade. Nice folks with an inexpensive pancake breakfast deal in the AM. Good idea, cause it&apos;s a long way to restaurants/stores. 1st week in June it was still chilly at night and no bug problems. We would definitely stop again. Badlands NP is cool. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2011 $45 From the beautiful landscaping and greeting by our hosts we were pleased with out choice, nice that they lead you to your site. Quiet area, sites are decent size but bring plenty of bug spray. I assumed we would be on the river, however we had a berm between us so that was disappointing. Great place to stay when you want to tour the Bad Lands. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2011 $40 People are very friendly and guide you to your site. Sites are level and we had a nice pull through. The pancake breakfast and Indian taco suppers are excellent. Nice and quiet. Well maintained. Good walking. The only negative is that the roads are not paved. This is on the outskirts of the Badlands so you won&apos;t find restaurants close by. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2011 $35 We&apos;re not big KOA fans generally, but this is a really fine campground. Huge sites, two nice bath/shower facilities, large campground with lots of room, breakfast and dinner specials, mini golf, and just a little way to the beautiful Badlands NP. Also very friendly folks. We&apos;d definitely return here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2010 $44 This is an older KOA which has won a lot of awards and has newer infrastructure (power pedestals, sewer connections, water lines) but appears a bit outdated in terms of layout. Interior roads and sites are all gravel and fairly narrow, with close spacing and lots of tree branches that could use trimming. There are very few spots that are satellite-friendly. It&apos;s popular with vacationers touring the nearby Badlands National Park, and there were relatively few perma-rigs present. The pool is large and popular. Given the hot weather, we did have some issues with power voltage drops; we were not able to run all of our A/C units at the same time on 50A power. Park Wi-Fi was reasonably stable although not particularly speedy. Verizon service was non-existent in the Park (staff warned us about this at check-in) but OK about 1/2 mile away. The rate noted reflects the 10% &quot;KOA Kard&quot; discount. This was a reasonable place to stay for visiting the Badlands, and KOAs are a known quantity so it was a good choice for a first visit to the area, but not the best value. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2010 $50 This is a very nice park. It has everything you could want with the exception water front sites. The power, water, Wi-Fi, etc all work well. There is lots of shade and the staff is friendly. The only things that keeps this park from being a 10 to me are paved pads and screening between sites. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2010 $39 This is a very nice campground: what you would expect from a well run KOA. Great Wi-Fi and limited cable TV. It was really hot here and we had to be careful while the A/C was running as the voltage (30 amp) was close to the red line. The park is not far from the Badlands park but be sure that you have all the groceries/supplies that you might need as there isn&apos;t much around here. Diesel was very high when compared to other areas off of I-90. 2 days in 100 degree heat here was enough. I think that a previous low review wasn&apos;t for this park as the owner has been here for over 7 years and he seems to be a very nice person and everyone who works here, lives on-site. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2010 $29 Stayed just one night as an overnight stop. Friendly staff. Nice level site with shade trees. They offer an Indian taco dinner for $6.25, which is a nice idea but the wait time was quite long considering everyone pre-orders. Also, they are very skimpy on the meat, you couldn&apos;t even taste it. We camped here in a Truck Camper.

 July 2010 $35 Nice KOA with the standard features. Everything was clean. We had a pull through site with plenty of room. Good shade and helpful people working there. Be sure to check out the bridge over the White River since there are hundreds of swallow nests under the bridge. Oh, lots of mosquitoes so be prepared. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2010 $50 We stayed here one night on our way to the Black Hills. It&apos;s a very nice oasis in the middle of the Badlands. It was 100 degrees the day we pulled and our site was completely shaded. Park is in great shape and the bathrooms/showers were clean and modern. Sites are a little tight but not nearly as tight as some we&apos;ve encountered. We had the Indian Tacos for dinner and everyone enjoyed them. We would definitely stay here again.

 July 2010 $40 Very good for families with children (pools, playground, bikes, mini-golf), All gravel roads and sites. Great pancake breakfast and Indian Taco suppers offered daily at a modest cost. Our rig is a 40 ft fifth wheel and they provided a good site with no problems getting in and out. Unfortunately there are no good restaurants within 20 - 30 miles. Only issue we had was that we arrived early and the office staff wasn&apos;t all that accommodating in knowing where we could park until our site was ready. We would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2010 $50 We stayed here with two grand children so the price was higher. All of the hookups were very good. The staff was very helpful. The &quot;all you can eat&quot; pancake breakfast was super for $4. The park is close enough to the Badlands National Park to make travel through it easy. There is no cell phone service here but the WiFi service in the park kept us in communication with family members. We would stay here again except we thought the cost was pretty high, so we might stay in the National Park campground instead. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2010 $43 This is a comfortable, clean, and friendly park very convenient to the Badlands road. We were all alone in the early AM on our drive out, it was very nice. We were parked on the end, and facing opposite all the other trailers on the row. The 30A plug was being used by our neighbor and the owners lent us a 50/30 adaptor without hesitation. Pool was nice and clean, staff was very friendly. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2009 $43 Very friendly and helpful staff. Moved us to a more open site which had more room. Good location for the Badlands Park but some of the sites are quite close together and we had a neighbor running a generator for a few hours one evening which was very noisy. Overall the site was well maintained and good with every service provided, including pancake breakfast and cooked suppers, which we didn&apos;t have. As with most KOA Campgrounds this is expensive. Wi-Fi ok but a bit slow when campground is busy. Showers and Restrooms clean but could do with updating. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2009 $39 We stayed here for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. We had a nice, shady pull-through site with plenty of room on both sides so as not to feel cramped. A golf cart escort to the site was nice. Be aware that this campground requires you to drive part way through the Badlands National Park if you are coming via I-90. There are well located services including wi-fi at the office. It is a very pleasant campground. All sites were level and well-graveled. Be sure to visit the Wall Drugstore as part of your experience here. I would not hesitate to stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2009 $35 This is our favorite KOA. We love the badlands, but what makes this campground unique is the grove of trees it has to offer. Having shade in the badlands is a luxury, and this campground has it. Wonderful, large shady sites, clean pool, friendly staff, clean bathhouses. We even saw some very nice facilities for tent campers. Why stay in the National Park with no shade and exposed to the winds when you have a place like this? WOW! Love it, this was a second stay and we&apos;ll be back. We camped here in a Tent Trailer.

 July 2009 $45 The campground was clean, big, a nice place for evening walks. There are friendly people, and a nice swimming pool. They let our grandson ride an ATV very slowly around the park and he loved that. The area has nothing in it but the Badlands National Park, but that is what we came to do and see, so from this site we did the park twice and we did venture to Wall and the famous drugstore there. We stayed 2 nights, there wasn&apos;t enough in the area to keep us there any longer than that. The population of Interior SD is 67! It is tiny. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2009 $35 This is a nice shady campground with reasonably sized pull through sites. The Badlands is a wonderful place to visit for a day or two. It can get HOT and the shade is nice. We would stay here again if we revisit the Badlands. There are two ways to get to Interior from I90. I suggest that the Eastern most route is easier with only one big hill.

 June 2009 $30 Overall the KOA was OK. Only issue for me was the bathroom/showers. Grab bars don&apos;t make wheelchair accessible. Although, the door to the bathroom was wide enough, neither the toilet stall or the shower stall was. The sinks were built over cabinets, so no leg room. We camped here in a Tent Trailer.

 May 2009 $41 This KOA has won numerous President&apos;s Awards for good reason. It is a well managed park with outstanding amenities. The shaded sites are well laid out with plenty of room between them. The current managers are former owners of the CG and have the pride of ownership in how they maintain the park and treat their customers. In the hot summer months you will appreciate the shade - something other area CGs don&apos;t have. If you are planning your stay June - September book well in advance. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2008 $33 A very well maintained park, and Joe, the owner does a great job of customer service. We used the park to explore the Badlands. The only drawback during this visit was the White River, which runs right next to the park had water in it. That provided a bumper crop of mosquitos. So much in fact that we left earlier than planned. I would stay here again at a different time of year. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2008 $30 This was a clean and well kept campground in the middle of no where, but close to the Badlands with plenty of shade trees. We reserved a pull through site so that we would not have to disconnect our car as we were only staying one night. However, the sewer connection was so far away from the water and electric connection that we had to disconnect our car in order to accommodate all hookups, that was the only negative. They served a Native Taco for dinner that was not only delicious, but huge. We would stay here again, even with the funny hookup situation. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2007 $35 Very nice; quiet this time of year. Friendly and well kept. Two small negatives: because of the fire rings and ample supply of wood, nearly every night there was wood smoke from someone&apos;s campfire. If you&apos;re allergic or simply don&apos;t like strong smoke smell, this could be a problem. Second, the laundry facilities are limited, although clean. Very family friendly, with lots of children -- an advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether you travel with children. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2007 $43 Nice campground, helpful owner and staff. Exactly what we expected. The views of the badlands were limited, but not really expected. Nice layout of campground, many trees in a desert like area. Good shade and spacious sites. We didn&apos;t try the food they make, only because we didn&apos;t get a chance, was nice they provide something in such a desolate region. We had originally made a reservation for 5 days, but had seen and done everything within 3 days, and they graciously refunded us for our early departure. Badland are very unique and the campground suited the area well. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2007 $35 I have been here several times in the past and spent a weekend here in mid-July. As expected the park was full both nights, but had an enjoyable stay in spite of the crowd - probably 400 customers in the park. Good facilities - full hook-ups, pool, cable a bit limited, and WIFI. Best park to use as a base for the Badlands if you are going to spend a couple days exploring the park. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2007 $37 Wonderful campground. Very clean with a great pool. Large sites with trees. Very friendly staff. My daughter was having trouble with her braces and they got right online to try and find a local orthodontist. We did not use the showers or laundry. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2007 $38 One of the nicest campgrounds we&apos;ve been to. Quite a surprise to find such a shady spot in the Badlands. In a grove of mature cottonwoods, so every site has lots of shade. This is very welcomed in the summer. Very spacious park and even the non-premium sites had plenty of room. Huge fenced in pet area is great. There is a knowledgable and friendly staff and the location is just a few miles outside the national park gate. The town of Interior has a population of 67 and not much in the way of groceries, so stock up before you arrive. Our only real negative was that it was a bit pricey, but we don&apos;t mind that so much when we get a nice place. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2007 $26 Nice park. In a valley out of the wind. Nestled in the trees. The pride of the hosts shows. Everything is neat and clean. The WiFi is quite good. The only thing we could not do is use our cell phones. The camp has received the KOA President&apos;s award for four years. Definitely not the usual crowded KOA. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2007 $43 Tight (even for KOA&apos;s) and remote-- but shady. As usual at KOA sewer is extra, TV is extra, WIFI (when available extra)etc; I thought our rate was a bit pricy even for KOA though, without sewer or TV. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2007 $35 This was our first big stop after 4 days on the road. It was great! We needed to have a place to relax and shake the road dust off and this was the place to do it. We used the pool, showers and the laundry, all were in very good shape and clean. The staff is very nice and were very visible and hard working. Our site was a double, which gave us plenty of elbow room. Great quiet location 5 miles from the Badlands National Park. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2007 $26 WONDERFUL!!Check-in a breeze and received a beautiful pull-through site with shade. Only different thing was sewer on 1 side&amp;rest of hookups on other but it worked. WiFi superb. They have dinner and breakfast and we had the dinner (Native American tacos) with dessert for $18 and it was delicious. I would suggest this KOA to anyone who wants to tour the Badlands for several days. Only drawback is it is not near shopping to restock on food. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2007 $33 This KOA proved to be better than expected given it&apos;s in the rather remote heart of the Badlands. Gravel access roads and sites. In the KOA tradition, the sites are narrower than I would like. Our pull-through site was only about 45&apos; feet long and I had to park our towed vehicle in an adjacent site. This would not have been an option in high season. People were nice and cable TV was included free as I am a KOA Club Member. 50 AMP power was welcome and rock solid. We stayed one night. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2006 $23 This is by far the best campground in the area. Large campground with good variety of sites, from tent sites with no utilities to full hookups, plus quite a few cabins. Nice shade from cottonwoods&amp;other medium-sized trees, and sites are reasonably wide for a private campground of this type. Bathrooms very clean, laundry also (and not terribly expensive). Owners live on site and are friendly and helpful. Playground equipment old but kept up, and during the season some limited food service available. The only drawback is the long distance to other services (true of everything in/near the Badlands, however). We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2006 $27 Excellent campground and very nice operators. This is absolutely the best campground in the Badlands area. Facilities are top notch. Only one TV station can be received at present (PBS), but the coaxial cable is already in place for cable channels. This campground is secluded, so don&apos;t expect a fast-food restaurant just around the corner. That may be its greatest asset. We will definitely stay here again.

 July 2005 $29 This is a great campground. It&apos;s 15 miles off I90, but worth the drive. To get to the campground you pass through the Badlands National Park. The scenery is beautiful. The campground is well shaded and very quiet. When we were there the White River was up due to rain, and it is white. This campground has new owners as of two years ago. All of the facilities seemed in good condition. We don&apos;t have pets but I noticed a huge dogwalk that was fenced in. The only sites that are right on the river are tent sites and a few cabins. They sell a pancake breakfast each morning, it was cheaper than a restaurant but a bit more than I expected to pay for a campground breakfast, but it was still good. This is an ideal spot to decompress if you are returning from the tourist trap that is the Black Hills, but it&apos;s also a worthy destination in it&apos;s own right. I have to commend the owners on helping me when I had a blowout on the camper - I called them from the interstate and they looked up a wrecker service for me, very nice. We camped here in a Tent Trailer.

 September 2004 $25 This is by far the nicest campground near the Badlands. The park was very clean and well maintained. It is few miles off I-90 but to us that was a plus. The park was very quite and the staff was very friendly. The park only has 30 amp. service but we were only there three days and it was not real hot. The only draw back to this park would be grocery shopping. It is not near any cities. Our recommendation is to definitely stay here, but shop before you arrive. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 2003 $21 I stayed here for the annual Sturgis rally and I really enjoyed it. It was a little out of the way, but we made reservations a month before hand, so I did not mind. If ever there was a peaceful, relaxed, quiet, out-of-the-way campground, this is it. The white river was little more than a mud-hole, so that was a little deceptive (but not at the fault of the campground). Other than that, the area was beautiful. The showers and bathrooms were very clean. Our cabin looked brand-new. The general store was more than adequate. The pancake breakfast was great. The staff/owners were very very friendly. I would and will stay here again. We camped here in a Campground Cabins. Review Rating

 June 2012 $23 This is a campground near the Badlands. This is the desert. The campground fit right in. It was easy in and out, with good hookups. Wi-Fi at our site was excellent. The owner and office workers were friendly and helpful. There is a small cafe attached to the office which appeared very popular for their all-you-can eat pancake breakfast for $6. The campground is tent friendly and also has a small motel which was almost filled each night. As we lost a tire on our fifth wheel, we were here for five nights awaiting repairs. The location for the National Park is excellent. The views all around are majestic. I would stay here again when in the area. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2011 $22 The location and rate were the biggest benefit of this park. It is very convenient to the Badlands. The showers and restrooms weren&apos;t fancy but they were clean, and worked. Wi-Fi was a hotspot near office only. Restaurant attached with all you can eat pancake breakfast for $6. They charged extra for sewer hookup, so we went with water and electric only. Here only 2 days. They have a dump station. We would stay here again for its convenience. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2011 $25 Beautiful setting close to the entrance to badlands park. You can see the rock formations from the campground. But the Wi-Fi didn&apos;t work and the showers were dirty. We did note a cleaning person entering the shower area as we were leaving so maybe it depends on timing. Showers were small and basic. I&apos;d stay here again just for location.

 July 2010 $22 Kind of a tired, sketchy campground, but owners are friendly and accommodating for the most part. Previous review about dogs is accurate. Kind of annoying when the CG owners dog is running all over and leaving little presents outside your door, in addition to annoying other dog owners whose pets are tied up. Pretty wild &quot;temporary&quot; sewer hookups above ground (no plumbing code in SD, I guess...), but we chose no sewer and used a dump station instead. Base charge for campsite then electric&amp;sewer are extra. Very convenient to Badlands NP. Small town is walking distance with general store and gas station. Tired bathrooms, but reasonably clean. Would stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2010 $27 We stayed here two nights. It is in the middle of the Badlands and about a mile from one of the park entrances. The pool was small but clean. My daughter enjoyed swimming in it. Interior is a little village with a few businesses but no real grocery or gas station. The bathrooms were a clean but not exceptional. We would stay here again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2009 $22 Stray dogs were roaming the park along with the owners&apos; dogs running free. These dogs are intimidating. We couldn&apos;t walk our dogs without both of us being on watch for dogs with their hackles up running up to ours. Also, the fire pit next to our site was full of trash. There is no sewer connection for the 50 amp sites. We would definitely not return to this campground. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2009 $22 Most aspects of this park have been covered. The staff is friendly and the little convenience store has some essentials for purchase. The only negative about this park is that the Wi-Fi is set up to block the sending of emails through Microsoft Outlook, and would not allow me to upload photographs to Face book. This seems to be an unnecessary restriction and should be removed. It&apos;s probably not a problem for someone staying overnight, but we were there for a week. Close access to the Park and views of the Badlands are nice. We&apos;d stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2009 $22 I thought this was a great little campground for the price...has the basics, a nice view, quiet,&amp;close to the Badlands. One of the things I really liked about it was that I didn&apos;t have to look at the motel-it&apos;s behind the campground. Sites are level, trees are a nice size. Office staff was nice&amp;accommodating. The most disappointing thing was that there was no 50 amp service for big rigs&amp;the day we arrived it was hot&amp;took forever for the RV to cool down. Also the picnic tables need to be replaced, but not a big issue as we hardly ever use them. Wi-Fi worked fine at our site-the one nearest the office, but they said it probably wouldn&apos;t work at others further away. Campground had some older playground equipment for kids&amp;an above-ground pool. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2009 $24 Easy access from Highway 377. Gravel interior roads and site with some grass between sites. There are some small trees by many of the sites. Satellite RV and Verizon phone and air card worked although Verizon was slow. Wi-Fi is offered, but signal is very weak from sites. Signal next to the office is fine. The park was a little run down and tired, but worth overnight or two visit. Park is very close to Badlands Cedar Visitor Center and loop road. Great view of the Badlands from all sites. The office staff was very friends. Park was approximately 30% full when we visited. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2009 $25 A nice place to stay while visiting the Badlands. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The campground is clean and neat. It sits just outside the National Park. Remembering where you are, you can&apos;t ask for much more from a campground. They don&apos;t call this area the Badlands for nothing. If you are expecting a 4 star resort, don&apos;t bother staying here. If you want a good, basic, well kept place to stay, this place is for you. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2008 $25 This park is an older park and is showing its age, for example the tables are old and have been painted several times, some are in bad repair, grass is mostly weeds, etc. 30A was highest offered electric in spite of claims of 50A which was promised when our reservation was taken. Some pull-thru sites had standing water and were blocked from use. Worst problem was mosquitos!! The perimeter of the campground has standing water almost everywhere and is ideal breeding for these insects and they are voracious and numerous 24 hours a day. The local radio stations also warn of West Nile Virus being present in the mosquito population of the Badlands. The &quot;petting zoo&quot; consisted of a bison/buffalo, horse and steer behind a poorly maintained wire fence. Our reservation was not honored as when taken, the sites are marginal, the environment is hostile and we would not stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2008 $20 The staff was pleasant. We chose not to use the showers after using the restrooms. We just didn&apos;t want to face it and chose to use the RV shower instead. It would have been doable with shower shoes. The pool was small, but nice and warm. It was a welcome site in the middle of the very dry Badlands. Trees have been planted at most sites but simply struggle to grow in this environment. It was 100 degrees on this day and we were told it was mild weather because it is usually 110 to 115 this time of year. Campgroud is very close to Badlands National Park. A motel is next to the campground and the office serves meals in a small diner. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2006 $17 We like to support family businesses and this family may be terrific but their campground was fairly nasty when we were there, perhaps because it was nearing the end of their season. What we assume was the restaurant at the back of the office was closed and filled with junk. The store was fairly empty and dirty. The sites are mostly dirt and small but level with the occasional small tree (no shade though), we had enough room for our 30 ft class A. Many of the picnic tables were so warped and broken down as to be useless and the playground equipment looked quite derelict. The firepit near our site was filled with smelly, disgusting garbage and there were many piles of dog poop in the weedy areas between sites. The laundry was reasonably clean (just one pile of junk spilling out from the arcade area) but if you wanted hot water you couldn&apos;t fill more than one washer at a time. The bathrooms/showers looked freshly painted and were clean but the showers didn&apos;t give you anyplace to keep your stuff dry and tended to turn cold periodically. The woman who manned the office was friendly but I wouldn&apos;t stay there again, I&apos;d pay a little more and drive a few more miles to stay at the KOA down the road. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2006 $15 This campground fit our needs very well in a place as isolated and hot as the Badlands. It is family-run and all of them are extremely congenial and helpful. The pool was great in the hot weather of July. The small restaurant with the &quot;all you can eat&quot; cowboy stew for supper or pancakes for breakfast (plus burgers) is very handy to have around because this is such an isolated place. The on-site small store also supplied basic needs. The campground is far from fancy, but if you want a place that provides reliable electric power for your air conditioners, good water, and good western hospitality this place should suit you fine. (One word of caution: 50-amp sites didn&apos;t have full hookups; full hookups are 30-amp. The owner let us park in a 50-amp site and extend our sewer hose over to the adjacent 30-amp site, so we had the best of both worlds). The $15 rate includes taxes and reflects the weekly/Good Sam discount. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2005 $16 Modest campground and motel with superior hosts. Really nice folks (long time residents). Catch the Cowboy stew for dinner(5.95) or sourdough pancakes for breakfast (3.95), all you can eat. Delicious and the company is wonderful, feels like grandma&apos;s place. Campground is clean with gravel pull thru sites. Utilities worked good. First motel&amp;campground you come too when leaving the park property. We were looking for another one and got them mixed up. Names are too similar but we didn&apos;t make a mistake. Trees are short and full making some turns difficult without scrapeing the sides. We did all right with a 35&apos;. Very quiet and peaceful.

 June 2012 $15 Don&apos;t know where to begin. This campground was in the Passport America book and we had tried all day to call ahead for a reservation. Only received recorded message of &quot;out of the office for a bit&quot;. We went anyway and found the office locked and no other customers. Since it had been a long driving day, we decided to set up and wait for the office to open or someone to return to collect money. The showers were demolished and appeared to be permanently non-functioning. No one ever arrived, neither owner nor other guests. In the morning we left our payment (at P.A. rate) taped onto the locked office door. Stay away from this one. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 August 2011 $13 We have stayed here a few times because we like the &quot;off the beaten path&quot; effect we have here. Things have really gone down hill though. The women&apos;s bathroom is completely shut down. The men bathroom is pretty bad also with bugs and cleanliness issues. One of the two men toilets still has an &quot;out of order&quot; sign on it, which was there last year also! The office seems very seldom to have anyone in it. Our electric was OK and we have been places where the 30 amp would not run our air and microwave at the same time but here it seems to work OK. Some of the picnic tables are in very bad shape. We like hiking in the Badlands, but if you are looking for that &quot;Resort&quot; that is advertised for this location, well it is not really here! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2010 $14 We tried to stay here and have the following comments, all of which boil down to: avoid this place if you can. 1. Do NOT attempt this campground if your RV is more than 34 ft long or 11 fit high at highest point (and do not forget your air conditioner)! Unless they have trimmed trees, you run risks. 2. They only have (maybe) 30 amp electricity. On Sept 9th, many of the sites had electrical boxes taped closed. Also, water was leaking from the valves of the spigots. 3. It is possible that no one will be here to direct you, even if it is before 5 pm when the office &quot;officially&quot; closes. The person who answered our phone call earlier in the day, was no where around, even though she&apos;d said there would be someone in the office. Just after we pulled in from the extremely dusty, washboardy Craven Road, several more RVs pulled in behind us. It was a grab-bag as to where people went. The only place that would possibly have taken our Itasca Ellipse 40 had it&apos;s electricity taped closed. And the tree branches in several other spots would have damaged the Coach. One of the people who was here before us, reported that there had been a sign on the door saying &quot;back in 15&quot; when they arrived, so they chose a spot. Going back to the office 40 minutes later the sign had been removed but no person was in the office. We selected this campground because of the &quot;promised&quot; boating on the lake. Didn&apos;t see a lake. We regret having to give a bad report as we try to support small businesses. Upshot of problems: Left this campground and went up the road to the KOA. (Yes, we paid 2.5 times this rate, but got 50 amp, water, sewer, electricity, nice people in the office and a guide to our site). We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2010 $14 As described by other reviewers, this campground is in poor repair. Ground is covered with &quot;stickers&quot; and is full of weeds of various heights. It does not look to have been mowed for a very long time. The office staff is supposed to be in from 9AM to 5 PM. They are very seldom there and it is difficult to even pay your bill if you are going out to see the sights. It is very quiet and out of the way. We cooked inside to avoid the weeds and stickers. Would probably not stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2010 $14 The park is located a mile down an extremely dusty dirt road so if you RV is clean, it won&apos;t be for long. The 30 amp service was so bad that we had problems just running one AC with everything else shut off. Had to start the generator to get the coach cool down. There is an above the ground pool but it was not maintained. The trees were scrubby and needed trimming. I would not stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $15 We picked this spot so that we could be out of the way, save some money, and enjoy some quiet while visiting the Badlands. We were able to accomplish all three. We ended up staying four nights, and happened to be there during a heat wave of 105 degrees! Thank heavens the A/C and electricity were fine for us, we had none of the problems other campers reported. We arrived late and enjoyed picking our own spot. We selected one nearest the road so that we could enjoy the view and minimize pesky neighbors. We didn&apos;t take into account the dust from the road, which when the locals drove by (very fast) billowed over the trailer. Since we had the A/C going full tilt, it wasn&apos;t too much of an issue, but I can imagine it being problematic when the windows were open. Our two girls didn&apos;t care about the dated facilities (which is putting things nicely): they played at the playground and went in the pool, which wasn&apos;t green during our stay, but was extremely cold, so they didn&apos;t stay in for long. It was good for cooling off on hot days. Mid-week the place was fairly empty, with a few sets of families coming in on the weekend. Driving by the other campgrounds, I was very happy with our choice: the other campgrounds are right next to the main road of the park. We prefer not to hear traffic all night, not be packed in so tightly with other trailers, and to save money where we can. If you want peace, quiet, and the opportunity to feel as though you are really in the Badlands, and not some manufactured oasis, this park would be a good choice for you. Happy travels! We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2010 $24 We started our visit to the Bad Lands and per their website it looked great. When we arrived I paid for a week, but After 1 day we decided to leave and find a real campground. It is under new management, and it just went down the tubes. We asked about and setup a trail ride, and I was told they are only doing it in the evening which was fine. We ended up waiting for over 2 hours and the person never showed up. The manager said that she would come and get us when he arrived, and soon after she left very fast without even telling us that the person was not going to come. The pool was green, and there is no stocked fishing ponds as advertised. If you like snakes in your camp and nothing else then this is the camp for you, but if you want a nice location, pay the extra money and go to a nice place We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $15 This would be a great park instead of just a low end park if the owners (on Indian reservation land) would just put some effort into maintaining this park. 1. the grass needed to be cut and the weeds pulled. Several pullthrough sites had weeds so tall I would be worried about a fire started by a truck parked on top of them. 2. Tree branches needed to be cut back instead of having an expensive RV drag them out of the way. 3. Rake and redo the pads with new gravel. Level pads? You&apos;re kidding, right!!!!!!!!!! 4. It&apos;s listed as having wi-fi but it&apos;s only in the cabins so that part is misleading. The good thing about this park is the quietness and the lack of traffic since it&apos;s so far off of the beaten path. I would stay here again as a very last resort. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2010 $22 The facility is under new management. We arrived late in the day so we registered and did not really look around to much since we had to get the RV all setup. The next day we looked around and we found out that the Pool was Green, the fishing ponds are really not very nice. We setup for a trail ride and the ranger never showed up. The manager said that she would come and get us when he arrived and the next thing I knew was she just left very fast without telling us anything. I would recommend that if you want to camp, you should stay somewhere else. You will be much happier. If you want a site with a place to park your RV and without anything else this one is for you. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2010 $15 Great park for the money. The resort part is the lodge and very nice cabins they have,but the RV part is full hookups and a little close together but clean and neat. Roads and pads are gravel but level and hookups are close and convenient. Shade is good and views are great. Have a very good string of horses for guided trail ride and the wranglers match folks very well by experience, even if none! Road is much better but the map on this site is wrong as of this date. The management are trying to get it corrected. The park is located south on SD 44 of Interior. Staff is great. We look forward to returning. Price reflects Passport America. Note from Admin: Map pin is now set in the correct place. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 May 2010 $10 This is a nice park with friendly managers. There is horseback riding at the camp and it is close to the Badlands. It is a no frills camp, but had full hook ups and was quiet. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2009 $14 This is a low-budget campground. Yes, the road is washboard right now, but we drove at 10-15 mph for the mile length with no problems. The sites are very close together (many are &quot;back to back&quot; with each rig facing the opposite direction) but if the park is not full, it&apos;s a nice layout. We were allowed to pick our own site, as were all other campers. We requested three nights at the Passport America rate and it was granted. The owners/managers were very friendly and accommodating. We asked for permission to wash the RV and it was granted immediately. The site is about 5 miles beyond Interior, SD. This entire part of the state is very remote and lightly populated. This is a good site for visiting Badlands National Park and the Minuteman Silo National Historic Site. We&apos;d stay here again, for sure, especially because of the half price. There is no park Wi-Fi, but our Verizon air card worked great. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2009 $14 THE GOOD - The staff was very friendly and happy to accept our CampClub USA discount for a week. We picked our own pull-through site with full hook-ups. The campground is very quiet and the view of the prairie and Badlands makes for a very peaceful setting. Horseback riding and lake fishing available at the campground. THE BAD - Access require travel down 1.2 mile dirt road with some wash-boarding that really affects a big rig like ours (41 ft). Internal roads are gravel but well compacted and some larger interior trees can be challenging to negotiate. Some sites are also too close together, affecting the turn radius. The closest convenience store is in &quot;downtown&quot; Interior (pop. 67), about 5 miles away. THE SUMMARY - We stayed here for a week and would definitely stay here again. The friendly staff and peaceful setting is well-worth any short-comings the campground may have. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2009 $28 Advertisements say the park was 1 mile out of Interior, SD and it was 4.5 miles. The access road was also a 1.5 mile dirt road. The lanes were very narrow and hard to enter into the sites. Had to unhook my toad to make the turn into the site given me. They said they did not have 50 amp but said it would not be needed. In our rig its hard to run some things at the same time with 30 amp. Also he complained because I used my USA Camp Club card. Lots of trees which also caused problems. I knocked my phone antenna off the rig trying to turn the corners and could not get any TV or Internet due to the tree coverage. I would not use this location again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2009 $15 This place is unique. I worried about my decision after reading the other reviews so I&apos;ll address what were my concerns. Road in is not bad at all. We were allowed to pick our own spot and parked facing our traveling companions. We asked if we could trim branches that were in the way and were given permission. We were given permission to wash our vehicles. Laundry is a flat fee of $4.50 for as many loads as you have. Horses are not a problem and are enjoyable. View of the Badlands is spectacular. Showers are small and only have curtain but there are full hook ups so it is easy to use your own facilities if that bothers you. Is it a resort? Not by a long shot but I&apos;d stay again in a minute. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2009 $26 1st site hookups were not working. Sites were not mowed, grass was up to bench on table that needed a lot of TLC. Shade?????? Old abandoned trailers and motorhomes with high grass was in last rows. Older couple trying, but can&apos;t keep up the park by self. Son suppose to take over. Would not stay again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2009 $14 The road in is dirt/gravel and a little rough for a mile. The rate is for Passport America. We stayed a second day for free with a horse back trail ride. The trail ride was super. The sites are close. The trees need trimming. There were only 3 other campers there so no problems. If full it could be a problem. The place has been sold according to the owner. He said the new owners have plans to upgrade. We are rating the park as it is now. It&apos;s about 7 miles outside the National Park. We would only stay here again if we were doing the trail ride. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2008 $28 It was actually quite quaint with all the horses around....but the road leading into the campground was very rough and washboard like. The showers were small and only had curtains across the shower itself, no privacy otherwise which I thought very awkward. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2008 $15 If you have a snake phobia, don&apos;t open the &quot;free cookies&quot; canister in the office. Manager appears spaced out, unhelpful, and cranky. Side by side sites; trees need serious trimming. Campground has horses, and features trail rides. Although there appears to be plenty of other space available, there is a horse corral 20 feet from the campground with associated odors, bugs, and biting flies. Full hookups are 1/2 price for Escapees and Passport America. We wouldn&apos;t stay here again at full price; might stay again at 1/2 price. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2007 $14 I would rate this campground higher except for the washboard road you have to drive on for a mile to get there. Campground is in an out of the way area. Drive to Badlands isn&apos;t far but there isn&apos;t much else around there. Once in the campground it is nice. Mostly centered around providing trail rides on their horses. It is quiet and peaceful. Nothing much to obscure the stars. Power did go out during rain storm but came on quickly. Only has 30 amp service. Prices for laundry, phone, modem are higher than average. Guy in office is a little strange. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2007 $22 Nice, rustic campground on a working ranch. A couple of miles off the beaten track, so it was very peaceful. Side by side hookups, so when full it might be close. Choose your big rig site carefully, it may be difficult pulling out if it&apos;s crowded. The trail ride was wonderful, making it all worthwhile. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2007 $13 This is a Passport America CG so regular rate is $25/night (you can get one night free with a trail ride when paying reg rate). The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. The location and trail rides are simply outstanding but drive slowly on the gravel road to the park (typical washboard surface found on such roads). This was our 3rd trip to the ranch (two visits in 2006). We will go back. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2006 $17 Not a good campground for dogs. They were very welcome - but there were grass spurs on the ground. Our dog couldn&apos;t walk two feet without getting these in his paws. Full hookups, shade. Older campground, clean but needed some paint in areas. Owners were very friendly. We didn&apos;t do the trail ride, but other campers said it was great. There was one big fire pit, no individal campfires near your rigs. It was actually fun to sit around the fire and meet the other campers and here their stories. Don&apos;t plan on fishing, when we were there the pond was a swampy mess, and the grass wasn&apos;t mowed around it - so no way to get to the pond. There was a nice laundry facility, clean and newer, efficient machines. Lots of areas to hike, great views, beautiful country. Campground was off the beaten path - but worth it. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 2003 $12 If you like camping &quot;way out in nowhere &quot; this is the ideal spot for you. Take Hwy. 44 from Interior, SD, pass the KOA, and within a mile or two, turn left onto a dirt road and go for about a mile to the park. Many sites offer impressive views of the Badlands and the grassy praries. The location is a storm-watchers heaven, as you can see them approaching from many miles away. The park is about a half hour drive to the Interior entrance of Badlands National Park. As can happen in very rural areas, electricity went out for several hours, but park staff had the utility company come and fix the problem as quickly as possible. Staff was easy-going and friendly. Picnic tables are located on grass between sites. Great place for fishing, horseriding, talking walks, and taking photographs. We camped here in a Motorhome.
