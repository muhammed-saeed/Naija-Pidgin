 Powerful stove for an unbeatable price! 
I was in the market for new equipment for boundary waters canoe area trips and this stove caught my eye. This thing is about the size of a flip cell phone and weighs about the same too inside of it&apos;s carry case!I hooked it up at home the first day I recieved it and was wondering if the arms could hold anything up... I took a pan and of course it stood there just fine, then I took a GIANT pot of chili as a joke and tried to stand it on there.. Lets just say about a gallon of chili in a large pot will boil in about a minute and 30 seconds with this stove if you want it to..The flame can be varied from a small flame you might need to make sunny side up eggs perfectly, to a blazing inferno that can probably power a hot air balloon (or boil water in the morning asap (about a minute or less at sea level)). This is for people who need coffee before their tempers catch up to them in the morning for sure.Auto ignition on this thing works perfectly but of...

 Its A great stove! 
The arms swing out for supporting a pot or pan, problem is one arm gets stuck and you need to loosen the burner head to swing it into position. The unit is very compact and has a hot flame. For the price it is OK.Just used this on a recent camping trip, worth the money if you are looking for a very compact hiking stove. Boils water in about a minute at sea level.(EDIT).....I wanted to update this review to reflect how I feel about this stove now. Initially I wasnt pleased with how the unit functioned but since I have purchased this unit I have fallen in love with it. It isnt very often when you buy a cheaper product that you really find quality this high. It is very small, light and powerful. By far the most important piece of hiking equipment I own.I want to thank the vendor also for the attention to those minor issues I had before, but like I said I have grown to love this stove!

Product Description

Ultralight backpacking camp stove, weighs only 3.9oz packed in the case!

This is a great stove. You get a ultralight canister stove, WITH PIEZO IGNITION, that folds into its protective case, and weighs only 3.9oz. This stove is built very well! Quality construction and materials are at work in this stove. I guarantee you will be happy! These stoves wok with any screw top butane / propane canisters, available just about anywhere, MSR, coleman, camping gaz, etc.

This stove will also simmer. It has a fully adjustable flame! This really is an impressive stove. When I got these in I was expecting something much cheaper, I am totally impressed with this little guy.

These would make great primary stoves, back up stoves, emergency, spares, Boy Scout troops etc etc endless possibilities! Top to learn more 

 

 Low Cost and Powerfull 
The stove comes not exactly as pictured. The handle has a smaller spiral wrap as opposed to the larger triangular bend as shown. It is light weight and appears to be made of stainless steel, aluminum, and minimal amounts of brass. I tested it against my Snow Peak GigaPower Stove and it boils the same amount of water in the same type of pot at the same temperature slightly faster. That puts the heat output around 10,000+ btu/hr. The flame is not very even over the bottom of the pot. It does not heat the canister up as much as the GigaPower stove does, this surprised me. I ordered five and the plastic boxes were split at the corner on all but one of them.It works a little better with Optimus 75/25 mix fuel over the Coleman 70/30 mix fuel. I could not find a &quot;made in...&quot; mark so I am guessing it is from China based on similar stoves I&apos;ve seen for sale elsewhere.I expect the first thing to break will be the piezoelectric igniter.

 A lightweight, compact, powerful, excellent value stove (and more useful than a jetboil!) 
I&apos;m a gear freak. I own 3 Whisperlites (2 I got cheap), a Jetboil (gift) and a Pocket Rocket (from REI around 2005 I think). I have several other odd stoves too. While they all had their place their niche use has been squeezed out by the excellent Pocket Rocket.I&apos;ve always been a fan of MSR Whisperlite stoves and have used them for 20 years. About 5 years ago I considered a canister type stove as white gas stoves have the downside of the fuel smell and the extra time to pump and warm/prime the stove. I wanted a more convenient lightweight stove I could use on day hikes, fishing/hunting trips and to make a quick cuppa on chilly rock climbing days. After some research, I found the MSR Pocket Rocket was the lightest and most powerful stove of it&apos;s type. It was also less than $35 so cheaper than it&apos;s competition. It was easily the best at that time, and might still be.I have used mine almost every weekend for years, in every season, on day trips and on several...

 Solid Gold 
This is a great bit of kit, I have used it for the last 3 years and it just keeps on going. One word sums it up, simplicity. It has very few moving parts which means not much can go wrong. I have drowned this stove in near freezing water and had a hot brew on before my fingers were dry.I advise people to think long and hard about the electric start models, just something else to go wrong when it&apos;s -4 and raining...The compactness comes at a cost, as was mentioned by one of the other reviewers, the three supports can make it a bit difficult to balance stuff on but a small price for the benefit of its size.As a side note, I&apos;ve found that the MSR brand cylinders tend to last lightly longer than other brands.

Product Description

When it comes to canister-mounted stoves, MSR proves less is more. The PocketRocket is a favorite of BACKPACKER Magazine Tester Andy Dappen, who said, &quot;This midget flamethrower is one of the lightest backpacking stoves available, and the best cartridge stove I&apos;ve used.&quot; Top to learn more 

 
Pack light, but carry a powerful stove with the palm-sized MSR 11792 Pocket Rocket, which weighs just 3 ounces and measures 4 by 4 by 2 inches. It offers fast and simple lighting, with no need for priming, pressurizing or maintenance, and it will boil a liter of water in under 3.5 minutes. The glove-friendly controls allow precise flame adjustment and stability, while the micro-burner, tri-sectional Windclip Windshield clip protects flame in light wind gusts. It uses clean burning MSR IsoPro premium fuel.
 Stove Tips: 
 MSR recommends 4 oz. (114ml) of liquid fuel per person per day for cooking or 8 oz. (237ml) of liquid fuel per person per day for melting snow and cooking. At high altitude, MSR stoves may burn &quot;rich,&quot; which hinders vaporization. Reducing fuel bottle pressure and opening up the windscreen can offset this. MSR&apos;s stoves burn best when the fuel bottle is pressurized to 15-25 psi (1034-1724 mb). That&apos;s equivalent to about 20 pump strokes for a full 22-ounce MSR fuel bottle. As the fuel burns, the air space in bottle grows larger, and pressure decreases. You&apos;ll have to pump more to maintain the same pressure.

 Light, tiny, efficient, and HOT! 
MSR&apos;s Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker. Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable.If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread. Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking.

 Not perfect but not bad 
I am a stove collector as well as a car camper. I have many stoves and use them all on occasion. I almost always bring the 533 along because it just works well. It burns hot with Coleman fuel but I usually don&apos;t actually cook on it, I boil water on it. The simmer function is marginal until it heats up and can sustain low fuel flow and vaporize it effectively. As for those of you who chose to use unleaded fuel and clogged your generator tubes, please send them to me, I will pay the postage. As soon as I take them apart, soak them in carburator cleaner and flush them clean, I will sell them back to you. :-) For those of you who want to backpack, this stove is probably a bit heavy. Check out an MSR or an antique Svea 123 but be ready for sticker shock.

 Engrossing... I couldn&apos;t put it down 
As a frequent visitor to the USA I have for a long time had an interest in the Appalacian Trail and perhaps hiking it end-to-end (or&quot;through hiking&quot;as it is called) one day. Once I saw the cover&quot;blurb&quot;for Roland&apos;s book I just had to purchase it.You realise upon opening this book for the first time that Roland has a very insightful and engaging writing style. This is a book that you can open up at any section and commence reading without feeling disconnected. If you want a book that follows a through hiker&apos;s day-to-day experiences when walking the trail or one that details historic, geographic or topographic information discovered along Appalacian trail, then this is NOT the book for you.However, if you want a book that thoughtfully covers all of the things one would want to know about when preparing for through hike of the Appalacian Trail or any other very long distance hike then this could be just what you are after.The book is based...

 A must read for those interested in the appalacian trail. 
Roland Muesser takes us along on a trip that quantifies aspects of the trail important to trail hikers and interesting to those who are new to the sport of hiking. Indeed, this book may be of even greater value to the novice hiker than the seasoned trailblazer in that it addresses critical issues for hikers such as gear and trail etiquette questions. Roland Muesser shows his respect for the trail and hiking in general and writes an inciteful and real account of what to expect and what the trail hiker comes to expect from day to day life with nothing but what you carry on your back. From mosquito protection to an amusing deerfly experiment to more serious matters of equipment and safety this book is a great one and should not be overlooked.

 Excellent and perfect for emergency use 
This stove works very well, with good wind protection. Most importantly, if you live in any area where a natural disaster could occur, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, this stove can really be a lifesaver! My sister used one after Hurricane Andrew and we have ours primarily because it is a valuable addition to our earthquake survival kit. The liquid fuel stores easily for years in a contained area, and it is very easy to use and control.

 The best stove for car camping bar none 
I have two of these stoves (one is over 20 years old and one is the model covered in this review and it&apos;s about 4 years old); they have seen a lot of use. Very easy to use and rugged, I take both of them along when car camping because my family loves to camp and this allows the ultimate in outdoor cooking flexibility for use with our drip coffee maker and griddle.

 Called Powerhouse for a Reason 
This stove is big, but well worth our money. It accommodates two full sized skillets at once. It boils water in a jiffy, lights easily and burns clean. We cooked under a canopy with ample overhead ventilation with no problems. No odor or discoloring our pans. I loved that the stove&apos;s bottom didn&apos;t get more than warm when cooking. We used it with a plastic table cover under it with no problem. It stayed lit in very windy conditions. As advertised, the auxiliary burner is less powerful than the main, but was still plenty hot enough to cook on its own. Downsides? Size if you&apos;re not car camping. It&apos;s the size and weight of a large briefcase, and even larger when in the box. Another issue: in broad daylight, it was difficult to tell if the burner was still lit -- quickly passing a hand over the burner was sufficient to answer that question. To light the auxiliary burner you must briefly turn the main burner up to medium or higher -- tricky if you&apos;re already cooking something on...

 Great for eating on the go. 
I want o start by saying the image shown doesn&apos;t really look like the Roadpro I got, the one pictured looks cheaply made and flimsy. The one I got looks much better built. Also there are no tins, not a big deal as I had some already (and I recommend getting some they will be handy)That said this thing is awesome! I pre-made a few breakfast burritos to heat up while we were out in the Mts on a day trip. I got out my little stove to give it a try, grabbed my burrito out of the ice chest and about 10mins later had a hot meal and I do mean hot! This thing definitely lives up to the 300 degrees.Two things to note:1. The bottom of the stove gets fairly warm. I only had it on for 15-20mins at a time so I can&apos;t say how hot it would get but it was hot enough I took notice.2. I felt the need to flip my burritos as it heated more on the bottom than the top. Stacking two to three didn&apos;t work well either. There was plenty of room but the ones on top didn&apos;t get...

Trust me that now in this difficult times 911 is very busy and sometimes we dont even make it to a fast food restaurant.

Hiking Stoves

 
no make any difference asics alton shoes what shoe or boot you dress in the 1st should be a sock that will wick. about your footwear if you happen to be hiking in hill region or . mountainous place you will want a boot with rather stiff sole to give. ankle assist might be needed for all day hiking.

Pros are very safe as no spillage, ultra reliable, can predict how many fuel blocks needed, quiet, no smoke, works in any weather, unused bits of fuel can be blown out and used later, stoves are very light – I have one that weighs 13g. The backpacking community has developed many light meths stoves including the Caldera Cone and the “Soda can” stove. Pressurised stoves Primus made the first pressurised stove and are still brand leaders. Cons are fuel is relatively expensive, blackens pots (but easy to clean off with a used tea bag or wet grass) , some people don’t like the smell although it doesn’t bother me, not all hexamine is the same in terms of heat output, slow as low heat... Pros are very reliable, noiseless, smokeless, fuel is easy to find, usage can be predicted so excess fuel needn’t be carried. Cons are  all meths stoves cook slowly, the flame is either full on or not burning (although Trangias have a simmer ring), flame is hard to see in daylight. Liquid fuel is pressurised by using an integral hand pump and, after pre-heating, the fuel ignites. Alcohol Gel stoves A multitude of fuels like Greenheat or Sterno which are all solid ethanol. For longer trips I often use a meths stove, like the Caldera Cone, as the weight of the hexi blocks comes into play. Wood stoves These burn twigs and small bits of wood, some reheat the hot gases to give a very hot, albeit uncontrollable flame. For backpacking trips of a couple of days, I use hexamine or a Swiss Army Gel Stove which is essentially a tin can with a pot stand.

The kind of cooking stoves I am used to for camping are a butane canister stove, and a pumped stove using Coleman fuel (white gasoline), as shown in the photo below. I found that over 50% of those who through-hike the 2200-mile (3500 km) Appalachian Trail use simple stoves that burn alcohol (methanol or ethanol). These stoves typically weigh less than 3 oz. (90 g), have no moving parts, and can be made at home or bought for less than $40. These stoves work fine, but their weight is nontrivial, and some have a lot of moving parts that can malfunction. With aging and a knee issue, I cannot carry as heavy a load as I used  to, so I have looked into lighter hiking gear.

White Gas Stoves These camping stoves utilize white gas, which can be stored in refillable fuel bottles when hiking. Multi-Fuel Stoves Multi-fuel stoves have an advantage in that they can burn different kinds of fuel. These fuels do not burn as clean as white gas, and the stove will require cleaning more often to prevent buildup. Stoves that burn white gas are often used on extended backpacking trips, and there are no empty fuel canisters to carry out of the backcountry. The disadvantage of isobutene stoves is that one must carry replacement canisters for longer trips, and pack out the empty ones, which can be a lot of extra weight. Optimus Nova Multi-Fuel Stove: has a compact design.
