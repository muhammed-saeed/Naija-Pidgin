I have given this place 3 tries...

Giant burgers? Really, giant? No they are regular size (I&apos;m a 125lb woman with a healthy size appetite), they are pretty good except they always come well done and they are crazy expensive for what you get (because its not much).  The service is awful.  Most of the seats are torn and the place is always dirty.  I normally go when its not that busy, maybe one other table, yet all the tables are dirty/not busted and there is garbage on the floor.  There always seems to be enough staff, but they are hanging out and feeding their friends/family and not doing any work.  Seriously like a total of 6 people working, one at the counter being RUDE when you try to place an order and one taking FOREVER to make your order and then 4 standing around.  I feel bad for whoever is shelling out the money for these people to stand around.

Overall the food is fine, if you have a coupon and want a dirty McDonalds atmosphere with bad customer service.

Menu is a good selection on meat options and a vegitarian.
Potatoes come in both standard french and curly spicy fries, plus a couple of my friends swear by sweet potatoe variety.
There is a condiment bar that I use to drop a load of jalapeños on my buffalo burger.
Neither fast nor slow on the service, soda fountain is standard coke products.
Good casual environment conducive to conversations.

This place needs a more active manager or something...  The food is good, what you&apos;d expect.  BUT, there are a few &quot;issues&quot; with the restaurant.  Today for example the only non-sugared beverage, iced tea, was out.  The little iced tea machine only had sweetened green tea and sweetened black tea with raspberry...  GROSS!  I can&apos;t imagine what kind of artificial crap is in that tea.  Really, soda, sweet tea, or nothing were my choices for beverages (or beer/wine, but it was lunch with my daughter and I was working after, so no alcohol for me at the time.)  Sugar, sugar, sugar...   Also, a few seats have rips in them which is kind of trashy and the staff doesn&apos;t seem real familiar with the menu.  The last two times I&apos;ve been there I&apos;ve had to point to what I wanted and they say &quot;Oh, I never saw that&quot; or something.

Anyhow, I&apos;ll re-review with more stars if I see an improvement.

I ordered two burgers, fries, onion rings and a milkshake for take out. While waiting for my food, I saw another customer picking up her called in order leave with her bag of food and come back not a minute later asking for the rest of her order - another burger and fries, neither of which had been made.

I thought to myself that they couldn&apos;t possibly do that twice in a row. I was wrong.

I checked my order before leaving (thankfully) and noticed I was also missing one burger and the one order of fries. I brought this to their attention and they made the extra burger (and I thought!) fries and I went on my way without checking the bag. My fault, yes, but COME ON.  When I got home with one (now!) cold burger, one warm burger, cold onion rings and a melting shake, I noticed the fries were still missing. Instead of going back to get them I decided I&apos;d just not go back there again.

The burgers were a disaster - half cooked, sloppy and oily (how they managed to get burgers oily is beyond me) - and the onion rings weren&apos;t much better. They were also sopping in oil. The only decent but not great thing was the shake.

I won&apos;t be going back.

Very good but just not up to par with the original San Rafael location. This Phyllis is a large restaurant- you can sit down, have a beer or glass of wine, watch TV, and its very clean. The San Rafael location is almost exclusively for take out, is tiny in comparison, looks somewhat dirty to be honest, but the burgers are the tastiest you&apos;ll have in Marin! Not bad if you&apos;re in Novato, but don&apos;t go too far out of your way to come here.

Sadly, this place has gone WAY downhill in the last few months.  The burgers are either under or over cooked every time and the flavor of the meat is atrocious.  It&apos;s as if they have gone to the worst possible ground meat to save on money.

One consistency - the staff is still terrible at service or at getting order done correctly.  There will be no going back here.

As the name says, Phyllis&apos;s is a great place to stop for a huge burger.  The portions are large, and that&apos;s a good thing because the burgers are delicious!

All sandwiches can be substituted for a piece of grilled chicken or a vegan burger.  They&apos;ve got a bunch of different things you can add to spruce up your burger like avocado, sauteed mushrooms or onions, chili or even pesto.

I opted for the pepper-jack 1/2lb burger which comes with pepper-jack cheese, avocado, sprouts, a chipotle sauce and served on a ciabatta bun.  At first I was skeptical if ordering &quot;just the burger&quot; would be enough to eat for lunch.  But moments after eating the burger I would be thrown in one of the heaviest food comas I have ever been in.  It was so intense I was left speechless except to mutter &quot;I&apos;m ruined!&quot; over and over.

In the midst of this debilitating yet somewhat happy food coma, I noticed Phyllis&apos; has an outdoor patio area and a bar towards the back that probably serves beer.

Great lunch spot, pretty reasonable prices for great burgers.

I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE

I used to go to the Phyllis&apos; Giant Burger in Davis way back when, and always thought they made the best burger ever.  When this branch opened up in Novato, I thought, &quot;Oh boy, memory lane, here I come!&quot;

Was I less of a foodie back then?  Did I enhance the burger from my memory? Don&apos;t know, but the burgers here just way too greasy and the meat on the grisly side.  Been here at least 3 times, and each time, I go away feeling a bit queasy and regretful.

For me, Giant Burger = Giant Mistake.

The place is very clean and the staff are very friendly, but the food just isn&apos;t great. Every time you order they&apos;ll ask how you want your burger done, and every time it&apos;ll come out well done and dry no matter what you say.

Their burgers are gigantic! Wide selection of burgers, salads, fries, and drinks/shakes. Great kids menu/portions too.

All their burgers come on big ciabatta buns, my favorite kind of bread. I had the terimushroom chicken burger and it was delicious! I couldn&apos;t even finish the burger because it was so huge. The curly fries were good - kind of reminds me of jack in the box ones. I got a taste of the philly cheesesteak burger too and it wasn&apos;t bad either.

Great place to grab a burger&amp;fries if you&apos;re in the area with lots of seating. It&apos;s in the shopping complex so plenty of parking unless you go on a busy weekend day.

This place is some sort of weird hybrid between a sit  down restaurant and a fast food joint.

We ordered our burgers and various side dishes and I ordered a pint of IPA too. After a minute or so, back up to the counter area to pick up my pint (which came in a pint glass).

After a while our number is called and we go back up to the counter to grab our trays. After some confusion as to which burger was which, we started to eat.

I had the Teriyaki burger and onion rings - the burger was pretty decent, and typically messy for that kind of burger - and the onion rings were OK (nothing special).

The IPA was a Lagunitas on tap - always good!

The weird part of this hybrid fast food/sit down style is folks were busing their own tables, and the normal fast food trash cans are by the doors, but in your typical fast food joint, everything but the tray goes in the trash.

Here, you have the tray, baskets, bowls and the afore mentioned pint glass that don&apos;t need to go into the trash, and then there&apos;s various basket liners etc. that do - it&apos;s all rather complicated and messy.

We didn&apos;t quite get it right in that a chili bowl accidentaly ended up in the trash.

If this place could figure out the level of service (and maybe move it up a notch), it could easily become a four star place, but with its current split personality, it gets a three.

Mmmm, I love me a good burger and when I&apos;m craving one while in these parts, this is where you&apos;ll find me. It&apos;s all around a good real old fashioned burger. They have big ass onion rings and fries and great shakes. It&apos;s a little pricey, but finding a good old fashioned diner style meal is hard, so it&apos;s worth it.

The restaurant itself is pretty stylin&apos; too. I was a little bummed out when Taxi&apos;s went out of business and was replaced, but after giving it a try, I wasn&apos;t disappointed for long.

Call me old fashioned, but I love old fashioned.

I love taxi&apos;s! I mean Phyllis&apos; Giant burger! Anyways, greasy juicy burgers. What can go wrong! I love this place because of the options. I mean they have like three bun selections! and avocados and sprouts and multiple cheeses and teriyaki sauce! The best part of this place is the fact it has one of the THE BEST patios in town. I usually get a turkey burger with avocado and yaki sauce. They have great curly fries and shakes. They have vegan burgers and also great salads.

If you like sports they have like 5 big screens on multiple channels too.

I came for the burger but stayed for the patio! They also have a small bar area with lots of beers on tap if you want to get the boys together and watch a game!

Very good burger place. The portions are generous, some different options, and all seem very fresh. [bonus option: you can have your kid watch a cartoon and not act up while you eat. read bottom of the review]

Variety: you can get some non-traditional burgers and toppings here too.

* Buffalo
* Turkey
* Veggie (I know. Don&apos;t ask me why one would bother. But, to each their own.)

* Variety of real cheeses like cheddar, pepper jack, jack, blue, and more (not just cheese whiz, or velveeta)
* mushrooms, bacon, avocado, and all the similar &quot;fancy&quot; variations

Fries are pretty good.

Salad was OK, according to those who ate a salad at a burger house.

A few beers on tap.

They have different big screen TVs. You can adjust your volume at your booth if you want to watch sports. There is always one channel adjusted to some kid&apos;s cartoon. (In case you want your rowdy kid to sit down, eat, and give you a minute&apos;s peace.)

I&apos;d have to say this is about as good as it gets for a burger. Definitely the best burgers in Novato.

I love that they use organic, local beef, no-antibiotics or hormones and fresh.

The burgers are awesome with great sauce.

They also make really good fries.

I am a huge hamburger lover.  Hamburgers are my go-to comfort food.  What I love about Phyllis&apos; is that their meat isn&apos;t too thick on the Jr. hamburgers.  Ask for pickles- they are like the Klausen pickles, all cut up on your burger.  Also, I&apos;m a huge curly fry person, and they have delicious ones at Phyllis&apos;.

I&apos;ve yet to have a bad burger or anything else from Phyllis&apos;
My only complaint is when making phone orders I have to repeat myself and spell the words out for the non-English speaking employee who answers the phone.  That&apos;s the ONLY reason I didn&apos;t give Phyllis&apos; five stars.

I understand California has a mulit-cultured population, I just wish people answering the phones were required to understand English as they do their native language whatever it may be.

Now, I&apos;m off to dinner!  :-)

A friend of mine had been coming here for a while and always talked about their sandwiches and burgers so I decided to try them too....

THEY ARE REALLY GOOD!!!

First of all, service was impeccable for a chain-style burger joint. Both the lady at the register and the one assisting the tables were real sweethearts and seemed to enjoy working there. The place was really clean and well-organized. I appreciated the LCD TVs on the wall, with speakers and adjustable volume at each table.. thats kinda nice :)

There are many choices on the menu and the prices aren&apos;t bad.. more expensive than fast food burgers, I suppose they are deli prices, so around 4.95-6.99 per burger. The upside is that the portions are generous, the food is delicious, and it&apos;s a nice atmosphere. Definitely will be coming again.... soon!!

Bored service.  No mayo on my chicken sandwich, nor was any offered or available from the condiment area.  Burgers are good, not stunningly amazing and not really worth the hefty prices.

Good fries.  I love a thick steak fry, so bonus marks for that.

Ambiance is certainly more spacious and colorful than the quirky, cramped, stuffy greaser &apos;original&apos; location on 4th Street / Miracle Mile in San Rafael.  The leftover decor from the Baja Fresh chain that formerly occupied this space is pleasant and lots of TV&apos;s distract you from the noise your heart valves are making as they slam shut... One by one.  Ignorance is bliss.

Good fatty fare but not the Best Burger in Marin.  A little expensive and blase employees.  Beats the Jack in the Box across the parking lot.

This is the best place I&apos;ve found for burgers in Novato.  I&apos;ve been there a few times and I am never disappointed.  They have a good menu with many different types of burgers as well a variety of fries.  The burgers are always delicious and the fries are very tasty as well.

I appreciate the big screen TVs and the A-1 steak sauce that comes with the standard ketchup/mustard condiment pack.  They have a nice patio area outside if you want some fresh air.  They also have a bar to sit at with an OK selection of beers.

ehhh....  Didn&apos;t think the burgers were too special.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, the burgers were fresh, big, and juicy, but it lacked a lot of flavor.  For the price, I didn&apos;t think it was really worth it.  Rather go to &quot;IN N OUT&quot;.

Where to start.....

Let me first note that this is my very first post on Yelp and I felt compelled to do so because this place was such a horrible experience.  Do not let this place fool you by its cosmetics with flat screen tv&apos;s inside.  This location has been plagued with sub-par chains.  I thought this place was finally the savior for this location......BUT I was wrong.

Their food I have to admit is at best decent.  The cashiers ask you how you want your burger, and well it doesn&apos;t matter if you ask for it rare, medium, or well.  THEY ALL COME OUT WELL.  I have been here a couple times and have always ordered the Western on a french roll.  The french roll is definitely the way to go if you decide to take your chances and eat at this place.

Now you might wonder why I would give this place a one star review if the food is at least decent.  Well.....their customer service is nothing short of awful.  I&apos;ve been here three times and had my order messed up all three times.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt this team.  Could they really mess up my order for a 3rd time!?  I drive all the way home, sit down on my nice comfy couch and check my order (my fault).  What were the chances of them messing up my order once again?  F@#$ me!!  Again!!!??  I call the dumb broken english cashier who took my order and complained that they had once again messed up my order.  I ordered curly fries NOT french fries. The lady told me to come back with the french fries so she could switch them out for the curly fries.  First of all, they can&apos;t even give me these french fries out of courtesy for jacking up my order!? What is she going to give them to another customer? Munch on them behind counter? I finally drive back to the restaurant and the lady is giving me attitude.  I ask for the manager and the idiot doesn&apos;t even know who or where her manager is.

Ironically while I&apos;m going back and forth with this numb nuts, the other cashier screws up another lady&apos;s ice cream order!  You would think you were at a fast food restaurant.

I pitifully drove back home and ate my cold, fat coagulated burger with hot curly fries.....

Sorry Yelpers for the long review, I couldn&apos;t resist. And if the owners are reading, they need to know how terrible their customer service is and maybe think twice about hiring incompetent people at minimum wage. I am not the first on here to complain about their atrocious service paired with sub-par food.

I&apos;m bumping up their rating to 5 stars! They now serve high quality Niman Ranch meats (didn&apos;t notice this if they did before), and everything here is consistently good. I&apos;ll also give a shout out to the kids&apos; menu, which is better than the one for adults in that it includes a free soft-serve ice cream cone. How great is that?

If I could give zero or a negative number I would. I&apos;ve been there about 6 times not because I like the place but because I believe every place deserves a few chances cause there are off days.  However every time I&apos;ve been either my order was wrong they left something out or both.  I&apos;m my opinion a huge waste of time and money.  The only good thing I can say about the place is they have TV so you can keep your kids entertained while you wait an eternity for your wrong order.

I visited for the first time with my 4 kids.  Ordered 3 kids meals, a regular-sized burger (1/2 pound!)for my teenager, and a junior size (1/4 pound) for me, with a regular sized fries.  We were all stuffed and had 1/3 the regular-sized burger&amp;almost the entire basket of fries left over!  LOTS of food - and everyone was happy.  The kids meal comes with a coupon for a free soft-served ice cream.  We only ordered 2 out of 3 because we were so stuffed...we&apos;re saving the other coupon for the next time we visit.

The place is also conveniently located by Rite Aide&amp;Safeway - so we were able to run a few errands without having to fire up the car again.

They have SWEET POTATO FRIES which is the ONLY reason I go here.
The burgers are not that good. Edible but I don&apos;t look forward to them (the burgers at the san rafael location are better---could it be the fact that I have gone to that place forever and suffer from some odd nostalgia)
A much better burger place is Barney&apos;s in San Rafael
But again--I appreciate this place as the only location in Novato to serve sweet potato fries which are worth their weight in gold.

We love their food. Their shakes rock too and are also &quot;GIANT&quot;. I usually order a &quot;kid&apos;s size&quot; and it&apos;s plenty.

NOTE TO PARENTS: This place has 3 or 4 wide screen tv&apos;s on all the time. If you monitor what your young children are exposed to, it is difficult to censor here. TV&apos;s show network programing and commercials and the kids just zone out and suck it in.
Other than this, the place is great for families.

Best burger in MARIN! I&apos;ve been to them all, and if you want your american burger filled with juicy beef and grease... then this is it.

The Novato joint is better than the one in San Rafael and Santa Rosa... and the shakes are great.

And a huge plus that they have beer and wine.

We&apos;ve been here many times, but the last 3 times, the food has been bad, the restaurant dirty and gross.

First time, the mustard and ketchup bottles were brown with dirt around the rim. Second time, the dressings in the salad bar were separated, when I told them, they stirred it, smelled it and told me it was fine. The last (AND FINAL) time we were there, plastic came out of the ice machine when my son was getting his drink! Again, I told them and they said, &quot;it&apos;s just a little plastic, it happens.&quot; Three strikes and you&apos;re out!

I know there&apos;s not really anywhere else in Novato to get a quick burger, but my advice, don&apos;t go here!

I just recently tried the Novato Phyllis&apos; and I have to say the burgers, fries and shakes are excellent. I do not recommend the onion rings though. They have some weird spice in the batter that&apos;s actually kind of gross. I also noticed that this location has soft serve ice cream cones (mmmm...), which I never noticed at the other locations. However, when they say &quot;Giant Burgers&quot; they aren&apos;t kidding. Since I ended up getting two full meals out of my burger, fries and shake, I will have to go back another time to try the ice cream cones.

A great burger.  This place is more comfortable than the San Rafael location; but it certainly gives up some of that greasy spoon feeling.  Still, the burger is good, and they&apos;ll serve it up pretty rare if you like (and I do)!
