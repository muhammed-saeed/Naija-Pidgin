 Question 
I am considering developing a five unit building suited for fast food establishments. I am concerned about the success of such a development project. What issues might I run up against when trying to have five fast food restaurants in one location? What type of traffic counts should I be looking for? The location is located 3/10ths of a mile from a corner with 19,000 cars/day count. Demographics within 5 miles...28,500 homes, average houshold income $35,000-$75,000. Young families make up the majority of the demo.

Also, what percentage of revenue is attributed to rent? For a store doing $350k anually, is $36K in rent to high?

Thanks for the advice!!

 Answer 
Dear Kyle,

In response to your questions, first of all, from the description you gave, you have a great location.

My advise is to stick with the big players, No &quot;mom and Pop&quot;
places....way too risky!

Typicaly rent is in the 10% range. However, the big guys like an Applebees or Fridays, can do 1.5 to 2.5 million in sales per year!


When you start dealing with these guys, it is best to get a broker on your side, as it can get quite involved.

Hope this helps you a little,

Best of luck on your development
